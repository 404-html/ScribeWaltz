00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.533
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the dressing room at the Palace </v>

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Theater in Louisville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky on June 14th,</v>

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.603
<v Speaker 1>2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought I'd read you an excerpt </v>

4
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>from maps of meaning the architecture of</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>

5
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:16.824
<v Speaker 1>which is a book I published in </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Ninety nine with routledge </v>

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.863
<v Speaker 1>and it's been the basis of my youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures and I would say also 12 rules </v>

7
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.023
<v Speaker 1>for life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the ideas and 12 rules for </v>

8
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:29.814
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her first worked out with maps of </v>

9
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:31.514
<v Speaker 1>meaning by just recorded an audio </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of the book was released two </v>

10
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>June twelfth,</v>

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.140
<v Speaker 1>2018 and it's available from penguin </v>
<v Speaker 1>books on audible.</v>

12
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>I'll put the links in the description of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video.</v>

13
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that the audio version with </v>
<v Speaker 1>its careful intonation will be easier to</v>

14
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:53.604
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maps of meaning is a rather difficult </v>

15
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read you an excerpt from it</v>

17
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>today and that'll serve as a bit of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction to the book.</v>

18
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll make some more excerpts over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next coming weeks I think as well,</v>

19
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>but we'll start with this one.</v>

20
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.793
<v Speaker 1>I was reading Jeffrey Burton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell's Mephistopheles the devil in </v>

21
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:16.224
<v Speaker 1>the modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I came across his discussion of </v>

22
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:24.051
<v Speaker 1>dusty huskies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brothers Karamazov Russell Discusses</v>

23
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:25.524
<v Speaker 1>Ivan's argument for Atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the most powerful ever </v>

24
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:29.634
<v Speaker 1>mounted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivan is one of the brothers and the </v>

25
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:36.681
<v Speaker 1>brothers Karamazov Ivan's examples of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil all taken from the daily newspapers</v>

26
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>of 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>76 are unforgettable.</v>

27
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.263
<v Speaker 1>The nobleman who orders is hounds to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tear the peasant boy to pieces in front </v>

28
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:46.254
<v Speaker 1>of his mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man who whips his struggling horse </v>

29
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>on its gentle eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parents who lock their tiny daughter</v>

30
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>all night in the freezing privy while </v>
<v Speaker 1>she knocks on the walls,</v>

31
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.143
<v Speaker 1>pleading for mercy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Turk who entertains a baby with a </v>

32
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>shiny pistol before blowing his brains </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

33
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Ivan knows that such horrors occur daily</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can be multiplied without end.</v>

34
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I took the case of children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivan explains to make my case clearer of</v>

35
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 1>the other tiers with which the earth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>soaked.</v>

36
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.283
<v Speaker 1>I will say nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burton Russell's states the relation of </v>

37
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:25.014
<v Speaker 1>evil to God has in the century of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz and Hiroshima once again </v>

38
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>become center of Philosophical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>theological discussion.</v>

39
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>The problem of evil can be stated </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply,</v>

40
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>God is omnipotent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is perfectly good.</v>

41
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Such a God would not permit evil to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>

42
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.290
<v Speaker 1>but we observed that evil exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore God does not exist.</v>

43
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Variations on this theme are nearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite.</v>

44
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.710
<v Speaker 1>The problem is not only abstract and </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical.</v>

45
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is also personal and immediate.</v>

46
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Believers tend to forget that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>god takes away everything that one cares</v>

47
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>about possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comforts,</v>

48
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional craft knowledge,</v>

49
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and life.</v>

50
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.633
<v Speaker 1>What kind of God is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any decent religion must face this </v>

51
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:17.254
<v Speaker 1>question squarely and no answer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>credible that cannot be given in the </v>

52
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:21.574
<v Speaker 1>face of dying children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that we use the horrors </v>

53
00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:31.040
<v Speaker 1>of the world to justify our own </v>
<v Speaker 1>inadequacies.</v>

54
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.473
<v Speaker 1>We make the presumption that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability is a sufficient cause of </v>

55
00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:36.614
<v Speaker 1>human cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We blame God and God's creation for </v>

56
00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:40.874
<v Speaker 1>twisting and perverting our souls and </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim all the time to be innocent </v>

57
00:03:44.151 --> 00:03:49.151
<v Speaker 1>victims of circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you say to a dying child?</v>

58
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.740
<v Speaker 1>You say you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is something in you that is strong</v>

59
00:03:56.111 --> 00:04:01.111
<v Speaker 1>enough to do it and you don't use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible vulnerability of children as an</v>

60
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:06.751
<v Speaker 1>excuse for the rejection of existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the perpetration of conscious evil.</v>

61
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.793
<v Speaker 1>When I wrote maps of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not have much experience as a </v>

62
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:16.890
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologist to have my </v>
<v Speaker 1>patients,</v>

63
00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:17.724
<v Speaker 1>however stayed in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first was a woman about 35 years </v>

64
00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.760
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She looked 50.</v>

65
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.920
<v Speaker 1>She reminded me of a medieval peasant of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my conception of a medieval peasant.</v>

66
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.620
<v Speaker 1>She was dirty clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair,</v>

67
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.543
<v Speaker 1>teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty with the kind of fill that takes </v>

68
00:04:34.831 --> 00:04:38.430
<v Speaker 1>months to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was unbearably shy.</v>

69
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.380
<v Speaker 1>She approached anyone who she thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>was superior in status to her,</v>

70
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.550
<v Speaker 1>which was virtually everyone hunched </v>
<v Speaker 1>over with her eyes,</v>

71
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:48.384
<v Speaker 1>shaded by her hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both hands as if she could not tolerate </v>

72
00:04:51.721 --> 00:04:52.554
<v Speaker 1>the light emanating from her target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had been in behavioral treatment in </v>

73
00:04:57.781 --> 00:04:58.614
<v Speaker 1>a Montreal hospital before as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>outpatient and was in fact a site known </v>

74
00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:04.044
<v Speaker 1>to the permanent staff at the clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others had tried to help her overcome </v>

75
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.590
<v Speaker 1>her unfortunate manner of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>presentation,</v>

76
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.530
<v Speaker 1>which made people on the streets shy </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from her,</v>

77
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.920
<v Speaker 1>made them regard her as crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable.</v>

78
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.960
<v Speaker 1>She could learn to stand or sit up </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporarily with eyes unguarded,</v>

79
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.500
<v Speaker 1>but she reverted to her old habits as </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as she left the clinic,</v>

80
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.743
<v Speaker 1>she may have been intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 1>impaired and consequences of some </v>

81
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:31.224
<v Speaker 1>biological fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was difficult to tell because her </v>

82
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:37.410
<v Speaker 1>environment was so appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may have caused her ignorance.</v>

83
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.693
<v Speaker 1>She was illiterate as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She lived with her mother whose </v>

84
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.660
<v Speaker 1>character I knew nothing about and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>an elderly desperately ill bedridden,</v>

85
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.170
<v Speaker 1>and her boyfriend was a violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic.</v>

86
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Schizophrenia who mistreated her </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically and physically,</v>

87
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.903
<v Speaker 1>who was always muddling simple mind with</v>
<v Speaker 1>tirades about the devil and the worship </v>

88
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>of Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had nothing going for her.</v>

89
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 1>No beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no intelligence,</v>

90
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 1>no loving family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no skills,</v>

91
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>no employment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

92
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>She didn't come to therapy to resolve </v>
<v Speaker 1>her problems.</v>

93
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor to unburden her soul,</v>

94
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>nor to describe her mistreatment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>victimization at the hands of others.</v>

95
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.663
<v Speaker 1>She came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She came because she wanted to do </v>

96
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 1>something for someone who is worse off </v>
<v Speaker 1>than her.</v>

97
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.563
<v Speaker 1>The clinic where I was interning was </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with a large psychiatric </v>

98
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:36.794
<v Speaker 1>hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the patients that still remained </v>

99
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:39.734
<v Speaker 1>after the shift to community care in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aftermath of the sixties were so </v>

100
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 1>incapacitated that they could not </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive on the streets.</v>

101
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.613
<v Speaker 1>She had done some volunteer work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some limited type in that hospital </v>

102
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 1>and decided that she could maybe be </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

103
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>a patient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take him or her outside for a walk.</v>

104
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.443
<v Speaker 1>I think she got this idea because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a dog when she walked regularly and </v>

105
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:04.694
<v Speaker 1>when she liked to take care of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All she wanted from me was help </v>

106
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:09.044
<v Speaker 1>arranging this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help finding someone who she could take </v>

107
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:12.374
<v Speaker 1>outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help finding someone in the hospital </v>

108
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy who would allow this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

109
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I was not very successful in aiding her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she didn't seem to hold that against</v>

110
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:23.954
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

111
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.423
<v Speaker 1>It is said that one piece of evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that runs contrary to a theory is </v>

112
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 1>sufficient to disprove that theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

113
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.410
<v Speaker 1>people do not think this way and perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>should not,</v>

114
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.813
<v Speaker 1>in general theory is to useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give up easily to difficult to </v>

115
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:42.944
<v Speaker 1>regenerate and the evidence against </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be consistent and believable </v>

116
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.683
<v Speaker 1>before it is accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the existence of this woman made me </v>

117
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:52.244
<v Speaker 1>think she was destined for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathological end from the </v>

118
00:07:56.931 --> 00:07:57.764
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint of biological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental determinism faded as </v>

119
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:06.791
<v Speaker 1>surely as anyone I had ever met and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe she beat her dog sometimes and was</v>

120
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:08.144
<v Speaker 1>rude to her sick and maybe I never saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>her vindictive or unpleasant even when </v>

121
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:17.870
<v Speaker 1>her simple wishes were thornton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say that she was a saint</v>

122
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.390
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't know her well enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

123
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.270
<v Speaker 1>but the fact was that in her misery and </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplicity,</v>

124
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>she remained without self pity and able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see outside of herself.</v>

125
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Why wasn't she a criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruel,</v>

126
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.080
<v Speaker 1>unbalanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and miserable.</v>

127
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.740
<v Speaker 1>She had every reason to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet she wasn't in her simple way.</v>

128
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.420
<v Speaker 1>She had made the proper choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She remained bloody but unbowed,</v>

129
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.373
<v Speaker 1>and she seemed to me rightly or wrongly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a symbol of suffering humanity </v>

130
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.570
<v Speaker 1>solely afflicted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet capable of courage and love.</v>

131
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.120
<v Speaker 1>God</v>

132
00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.110
<v Speaker 1>justifies his creation in Milton's </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise lost</v>

133
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.630
<v Speaker 1>such I created all the theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powers and spirits,</v>

134
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.250
<v Speaker 1>both them who stood and them who failed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not free.</v>

135
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.760
<v Speaker 1>What proof could they have given sincere</v>
<v Speaker 1>of true allegiance,</v>

136
00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:17.660
<v Speaker 1>constant faith or love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're only what they needs must do,</v>

137
00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:19.580
<v Speaker 1>appeared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what they would.</v>

138
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:25.190
<v Speaker 1>What praise could they receive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What pleasure I from such obedience paid</v>

139
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.880
<v Speaker 1>when will and reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason also his choice,</v>

140
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.350
<v Speaker 1>useless and vein of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both despoiled made passive.</v>

141
00:09:33.351 --> 00:09:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Both had served necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not me.</v>

142
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.473
<v Speaker 1>They therefore has to write belonged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're created nor can justly accused </v>

143
00:09:46.011 --> 00:09:46.844
<v Speaker 1>there maker or they're making or their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fate as if predestination overruled </v>

144
00:09:51.921 --> 00:09:56.810
<v Speaker 1>there will dispose by absolute decrease </v>
<v Speaker 1>or high for knowledge.</v>

145
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.260
<v Speaker 1>They themselves decreed their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>reformed,</v>

146
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.950
<v Speaker 1>nor I if I for new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for knowledge,</v>

147
00:10:03.951 --> 00:10:07.580
<v Speaker 1>has no influence on their fault which </v>
<v Speaker 1>had no less proved,</v>

148
00:10:07.581 --> 00:10:08.414
<v Speaker 1>certain unfair known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so without least impulse or shouting or </v>

149
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.560
<v Speaker 1>fade or art by me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Immutably foreseen they trespass authors</v>

150
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:23.590
<v Speaker 1>to themselves in all both what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>judge and what they choose for.</v>

151
00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:24.614
<v Speaker 1>So I formed them free and free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They must remain until they throw </v>

152
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.853
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must change their nature and revoke </v>

153
00:10:33.471 --> 00:10:35.750
<v Speaker 1>the high decrease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unchangeable,</v>

154
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.840
<v Speaker 1>eternal which ordain their freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They themselves or Dane their fall.</v>

155
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.343
<v Speaker 1>The other patient I wish to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the schizophrenia in a small </v>

156
00:10:47.811 --> 00:10:48.644
<v Speaker 1>inpatient ward at a different hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was about 29 when I met him a few </v>

157
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.303
<v Speaker 1>years older than I was at the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been in and out of confinement for </v>

158
00:10:58.161 --> 00:10:58.994
<v Speaker 1>seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was of course on anti psychotic </v>

159
00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:03.194
<v Speaker 1>medication and participated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupational therapy activities on the </v>

160
00:11:06.681 --> 00:11:07.514
<v Speaker 1>ward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making coasters and pencil holders and </v>

161
00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:10.664
<v Speaker 1>so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could not maintain attention for </v>

162
00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:15.860
<v Speaker 1>any amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not even much good at craft.</v>

163
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.740
<v Speaker 1>My supervisor asked me to administer an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence test to him.</v>

164
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.823
<v Speaker 1>The standard wastes are more for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sake of my experience than for any </v>

165
00:11:25.791 --> 00:11:27.710
<v Speaker 1>possible diagnostic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

166
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.113
<v Speaker 1>I gave my patients some of the red and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white blocks that made up the block </v>

167
00:11:32.481 --> 00:11:36.050
<v Speaker 1>design subtests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was supposed to arrange the blocks,</v>

168
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.840
<v Speaker 1>so they matched a pattern printed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>some cards.</v>

169
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.393
<v Speaker 1>He picked them up and started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rearrange them on the desk in front of </v>

170
00:11:43.431 --> 00:11:44.031
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

171
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:49.031
<v Speaker 1>I timed him stupidly with a stopwatch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The task was impossible for him.</v>

172
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.073
<v Speaker 1>Even at the simplest of stages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked constantly distracted and </v>

173
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 1>frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked what's wrong?</v>

174
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.353
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle between good and evil in </v>

175
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 1>heaven is going on in my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

176
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I stopped the testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>

177
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.010
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know exactly what to make of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his comment.</v>

178
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>He was obviously suffering and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing seem to make it worse.</v>

179
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.350
<v Speaker 1>What was he experiencing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't lying,</v>

180
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the face of such a statement.</v>

181
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:28.350
<v Speaker 1>It seemed ridiculous to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent some time with him that summer.</v>

182
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 1>I'd never met someone who was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>blatantly mentally ill.</v>

183
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:33.603
<v Speaker 1>We talked on the ward and occasionally I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would take him for a walk through the </v>

184
00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:38.080
<v Speaker 1>hospital grounds outside.</v>

185
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 1>He was the third son of first generation</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>

186
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.060
<v Speaker 1>His first born brother was a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other physician,</v>

187
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.390
<v Speaker 1>his parents were obviously ambitious for</v>
<v Speaker 1>their children,</v>

188
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.253
<v Speaker 1>hardworking and disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had been a graduate student working </v>

189
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 1>towards a degree in immunology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't precisely remember.</v>

190
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.420
<v Speaker 1>His brothers had sent him a daunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>example and he felt pressured to succeed</v>

191
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.230
<v Speaker 1>his experimental work and not turned out</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he had expected,</v>

192
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.093
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he apparently came to believe that </v>

193
00:13:11.801 --> 00:13:15.250
<v Speaker 1>it might not graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at least when he had hoped to,</v>

194
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:21.210
<v Speaker 1>so he faked his experimental results and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote up his thesis.</v>

195
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.713
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me that the night he finished </v>

196
00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:25.954
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he woke up and saw the devil standing </v>

197
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:28.924
<v Speaker 1>over him at the foot of his bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This event triggered the onset of his </v>

198
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:35.380
<v Speaker 1>mental illness from which he had never </v>
<v Speaker 1>recovered.</v>

199
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.743
<v Speaker 1>It might be said that the satanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparition merely accompanied the </v>

200
00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:41.974
<v Speaker 1>expression of some pathological stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>induced neuro development whose </v>

201
00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:46.954
<v Speaker 1>appearance was biologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>predetermined or the devil was merely </v>

202
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 1>personification of his culture.</v>

203
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.433
<v Speaker 1>His conception of moral evil manifesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in imagination as a consequence </v>

204
00:13:58.121 --> 00:14:02.860
<v Speaker 1>of his guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of these levels of description have</v>

205
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:03.694
<v Speaker 1>their merits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact remains that he saw the </v>

206
00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:11.101
<v Speaker 1>devil and that division accompanied or </v>
<v Speaker 1>even was the event that destroyed him.</v>

207
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.090
<v Speaker 1>He was afraid to tell me much of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy and it was only after I had paid</v>

208
00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:18.700
<v Speaker 1>careful attention to him that he opened </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

209
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.750
<v Speaker 1>He was not bragging or trying to impress</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

210
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.793
<v Speaker 1>He was terrified about what he believed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified as a consequence of the </v>

211
00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:29.890
<v Speaker 1>fantasies that impressed themselves upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

212
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.503
<v Speaker 1>He told me that he could not leave the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital because someone was waiting to </v>

213
00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:37.300
<v Speaker 1>shoot him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A typical paranoid delusion.</v>

214
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Why did someone want to kill him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

215
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.660
<v Speaker 1>he was hospitalized during the Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at its height perhaps,</v>

216
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:47.643
<v Speaker 1>but still during a time when the threat </v>
<v Speaker 1>of purposeful nuclear annihilation </v>

217
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.770
<v Speaker 1>seemed more plausible or likely than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does now.</v>

218
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.323
<v Speaker 1>Many of the people I knew used the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence of this threat to justify to </v>

219
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:04.220
<v Speaker 1>themselves their failure to participate </v>
<v Speaker 1>fully in life,</v>

220
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:05.443
<v Speaker 1>a life which they thought of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romantically as doomed and therefore as </v>

221
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:10.574
<v Speaker 1>pointless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were some real terror in the </v>

222
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:13.124
<v Speaker 1>pose and the thought of the countless </v>
<v Speaker 1>missiles pointed here and there around </v>

223
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sap,</v>

224
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:20.960
<v Speaker 1>the energy and faith of everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypocritical or not,</v>

225
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:22.903
<v Speaker 1>my schizophrenia patient believed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in fact the incarnation of the </v>

226
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:28.094
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Annihilating force that he was destined </v>

227
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:31.883
<v Speaker 1>upon his release from the hospital to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make his way south to a nuclear missile </v>

228
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:36.524
<v Speaker 1>silo on American territory that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>faded to make the decision that would </v>

229
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:41.114
<v Speaker 1>launch the final war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people outside the hospital knew </v>

230
00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:48.590
<v Speaker 1>this and that is why they were waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to shoot him.</v>

231
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.730
<v Speaker 1>He did not want to tell me this story </v>
<v Speaker 1>and consequence,</v>

232
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.713
<v Speaker 1>although he did because he thought that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I might then want to kill him to my </v>

233
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:00.200
<v Speaker 1>friends in graduate school.</v>

234
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Thought it ironic that I had contact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a patient of this type,</v>

235
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:04.843
<v Speaker 1>my peculiar interest in young and </v>
<v Speaker 1>young's ideas regarding the collective </v>

236
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:09.104
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're well known to them and it seemed </v>

237
00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:11.874
<v Speaker 1>to absurdly fitting that I would end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to someone with delusions of </v>

238
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:16.004
<v Speaker 1>this type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know what to do with his </v>

239
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:19.364
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they were crazy and they had </v>

240
00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:26.150
<v Speaker 1>done in my patient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still seemed to me that they were</v>

241
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.013
<v Speaker 1>true from the metaphorical viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His story in totality linked is </v>

242
00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:33.194
<v Speaker 1>individual choice between good and evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the cumulative horror then facing </v>

243
00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:38.144
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>History implied that because he had </v>

244
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:42.950
<v Speaker 1>given into temptation at a critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>juncture,</v>

245
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.040
<v Speaker 1>he was in fact responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horror of the potential of nuclear war,</v>

246
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:50.263
<v Speaker 1>but how could this be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed insane to me to even consider </v>

247
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:55.184
<v Speaker 1>that the act of one powerless individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be linked in some manner to the </v>

248
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:03.581
<v Speaker 1>outcome of history as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am no longer so sure.</v>

249
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.373
<v Speaker 1>I've read much about evil and its manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>of perpetration and growth and I'm no </v>

250
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Speaker 1>longer convinced that each of us are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent,</v>

251
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.333
<v Speaker 1>so harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is of course a logical to presume </v>

252
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:16.784
<v Speaker 1>that one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one speck of dust amongst $6 billion </v>

253
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:24.830
<v Speaker 1>moats is any sense responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible course of human events,</v>

254
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:26.443
<v Speaker 1>but that course in itself is not logical</v>
<v Speaker 1>far from it and it seems likely that it </v>

255
00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:34.520
<v Speaker 1>depends on processes that we do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

256
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.380
<v Speaker 1>The most powerful arguments for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonexistence of God,</v>

257
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:40.543
<v Speaker 1>at least a good God are predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that such a being would not </v>

258
00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:48.851
<v Speaker 1>allow for the existence of evil in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical natural diseases.</v>

259
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Disasters or moral war pogroms forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such arguments can be taken further even</v>

260
00:17:57.031 --> 00:18:02.031
<v Speaker 1>than atheism can be used to dispute the </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice of the existing world itself.</v>

261
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the entire cosmos is not worth a</v>

262
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:13.671
<v Speaker 1>single innocent child suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can the universe be constructed such</v>

263
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:15.414
<v Speaker 1>that pain is permitted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can a good God allow for the </v>

264
00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:19.674
<v Speaker 1>existence of a suffering world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These difficult questions can be </v>

265
00:18:24.531 --> 00:18:28.580
<v Speaker 1>addressed in part as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful analysis of evil.</v>

266
00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.693
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems reasonable to insist upon the </v>

267
00:18:33.011 --> 00:18:36.520
<v Speaker 1>value of the natural slash moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>

268
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:37.953
<v Speaker 1>The tragic circumstances of life should </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be placed in the same category as </v>

269
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.710
<v Speaker 1>willfully undertaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harm.</v>

270
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.533
<v Speaker 1>Tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjugation to the mortal conditions of </v>

271
00:18:49.001 --> 00:18:49.834
<v Speaker 1>existence has an ennobling aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in potential and has been </v>

272
00:18:53.951 --> 00:18:58.390
<v Speaker 1>constantly exploited to that end in </v>
<v Speaker 1>great literature and mythology.</v>

273
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.920
<v Speaker 1>True evil by contrast is anything but </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>

274
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.473
<v Speaker 1>Participation in Alex whose sole purpose</v>
<v Speaker 1>is expansion of innocent pain and </v>

275
00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:09.914
<v Speaker 1>suffering destroys character forthright </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter with tragedy by contrast may </v>

276
00:19:15.171 --> 00:19:16.004
<v Speaker 1>increase it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the meaning of the Christian </v>

277
00:19:18.441 --> 00:19:23.441
<v Speaker 1>myth of the crucifixion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is Christ's full participation in and</v>

278
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:28.700
<v Speaker 1>freely chosen acceptance of his fate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he shares with all mankind.</v>

279
00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:33.620
<v Speaker 1>That enables him to manifest his full </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity with God at it is that identity</v>

280
00:19:33.621 --> 00:19:37.700
<v Speaker 1>which enables them to bear that fate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>which strips it of evil.</v>

281
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the voluntary demeaning of our own</v>

282
00:19:42.051 --> 00:19:42.884
<v Speaker 1>characters which makes the necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragic conditions of existence appear </v>

283
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.193
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>

284
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:50.463
<v Speaker 1>but why is life tragic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are we subject to unbearable </v>

285
00:19:54.371 --> 00:19:57.100
<v Speaker 1>limitation to pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>

286
00:19:57.101 --> 00:20:01.090
<v Speaker 1>and death to cruelty at the hands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature and society?</v>

287
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Why do terrible things happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone?</v>

288
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.080
<v Speaker 1>These are of course unanswerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

289
00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.880
<v Speaker 1>but they must be answered somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we are able to face our own lives,</v>

290
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:18.430
<v Speaker 1>the best I can make of it is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has helped me.</v>

291
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.493
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can exist without preconditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even a game can be played without rules </v>

292
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.613
<v Speaker 1>and the rules say what cannot be done as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much as what can perhaps the world is </v>

293
00:20:31.751 --> 00:20:35.380
<v Speaker 1>not possible as a world without its </v>
<v Speaker 1>borders.</v>

294
00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.573
<v Speaker 1>Without its rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe existence wouldn't be possible in </v>

295
00:20:40.661 --> 00:20:45.661
<v Speaker 1>the absence of our painful limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of it this way.</v>

296
00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.450
<v Speaker 1>If we could have everything wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>merely for wishing it,</v>

297
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:54.810
<v Speaker 1>if every tool performed every job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all men were omniscient and immortal,</v>

298
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.880
<v Speaker 1>that everything would be the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>

299
00:20:57.881 --> 00:20:58.714
<v Speaker 1>all powerful thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God and creation would never exist and </v>

300
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:04.733
<v Speaker 1>is the differences between things which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a function of their specific </v>

301
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 1>limitations that allows them to exist at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

302
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.113
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that things do exist does </v>
<v Speaker 1>not mean that they should exist even if </v>

303
00:21:18.321 --> 00:21:21.860
<v Speaker 1>we are willing to grant them their </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary limitations.</v>

304
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.713
<v Speaker 1>Should the world exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are the preconditions of experience so </v>

305
00:21:28.071 --> 00:21:28.904
<v Speaker 1>terrible that the whole game should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>called off and there is never any </v>

306
00:21:33.171 --> 00:21:36.800
<v Speaker 1>shortage of people working diligently </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards this end.</v>

307
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.570
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that we answer this </v>
<v Speaker 1>question implicitly,</v>

308
00:21:41.571 --> 00:21:42.404
<v Speaker 1>but profoundly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we lose someone we loved and then </v>

309
00:21:45.561 --> 00:21:48.860
<v Speaker 1>grieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very common experience.</v>

310
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we cried because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed either,</v>

311
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.310
<v Speaker 1>but because they are lost.</v>

312
00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:01.430
<v Speaker 1>This presupposes a judgment rendered at </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very fundamental level of analysis.</v>

313
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.903
<v Speaker 1>Grief presupposes having loved </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposes the judgment that this </v>

314
00:22:07.171 --> 00:22:11.010
<v Speaker 1>person's specific bounded existence was </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable,</v>

315
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.903
<v Speaker 1>was something that should have been even</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it's inevitably imperfect and </v>

316
00:22:15.301 --> 00:22:19.440
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still the question lingers,</v>

317
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.460
<v Speaker 1>why should things even loved things </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist at all?</v>

318
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.390
<v Speaker 1>If they're necessary limitations caused </v>
<v Speaker 1>some suffering.</v>

319
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we could reserve answer to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question of God's nature,</v>

320
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.300
<v Speaker 1>his responsibility for the presence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil in creation,</v>

321
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.390
<v Speaker 1>until we have solved the problem of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

322
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.733
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we can tolerate the horrors of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world if we left our own characters </v>

323
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:45.923
<v Speaker 1>intact and develop them to the fullest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we took full advantage of every gift </v>

324
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:51.844
<v Speaker 1>we had been granted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the world would not look </v>

325
00:22:56.211 --> 00:22:57.044
<v Speaker 1>horrible</v>

326
00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.393
