00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.233
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I manager Moody and this has big ideas </v>

2
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.150
<v Speaker 1>and this is a stereogram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've probably seen these before.</v>

3
00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a computer generated picture that </v>
<v Speaker 1>presents a three dimensional image.</v>

4
00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:26.030
<v Speaker 1>If you're able to focus your eyes just </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the right point,</v>

5
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.493
<v Speaker 1>it takes a while to get the hang of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to sort of relax and try to </v>

6
00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:30.554
<v Speaker 1>focus just behind the picture and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly a three dimensional image begins </v>

7
00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:38.690
<v Speaker 1>to form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't always work and sometimes</v>

8
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>you're left wondering if the three d </v>
<v Speaker 1>image is really there at all.</v>

9
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.033
<v Speaker 1>And according to Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychologist who teaches at the </v>

10
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.193
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto stereograms are </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogous to the way that we experience </v>

11
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:53.810
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music is another.</v>

12
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.933
<v Speaker 1>It is also composed of patterns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because music cannot be reduced to </v>

13
00:00:57.801 --> 00:00:58.634
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it conveys a world of meaning beyond </v>

14
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:02.144
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson is a psychologist with a </v>

15
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:06.014
<v Speaker 1>philosophical bend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is interested in how we perceive of </v>

16
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:09.944
<v Speaker 1>things and what we get from it and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes us on a tour to force through </v>

17
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:19.181
<v Speaker 1>music and computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Painting and chess get ready for a heady</v>

18
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>and complex ride.</v>

19
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.913
<v Speaker 2>Music is a genuine mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Music is one of the experiential </v>

20
00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:28.954
<v Speaker 2>phenomena that we all have access to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like looking into the night sky or </v>

21
00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:39.910
<v Speaker 2>at the Grand Canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about it that seems to</v>

22
00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:44.680
<v Speaker 2>speak about things that are beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mundane,</v>

23
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 2>and it's an interesting thing that music</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do that because although it has this</v>

24
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.123
<v Speaker 2>arguably transcendental element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also something that's very </v>

25
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:57.054
<v Speaker 2>accessible to people in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare to find someone who </v>

26
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:05.031
<v Speaker 2>doesn't like music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's transcendental and universal.</v>

27
00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:11.671
<v Speaker 2>At the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also seems to me that music</v>

28
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

29
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.790
<v Speaker 2>reliably speaks to people of meaning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are,</v>

30
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.713
<v Speaker 2>and that the reason that music plays </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a popular or powerful role in our </v>

31
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:25.494
<v Speaker 2>culture is because the meaning that </v>
<v Speaker 2>music speaks of is beyond rational </v>

32
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 2>critique and were very rational and were</v>
<v Speaker 2>very intelligent.</v>

33
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:34.194
<v Speaker 2>And so we've been able to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual hash out of most of the </v>

34
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 2>things that had traditionally offered </v>
<v Speaker 2>people a grounded sense of meaning.</v>

35
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 2>But because music is beyond rational </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism,</v>

36
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.833
<v Speaker 2>it seems to have been able to retain its</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiential connection with </v>

37
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:53.064
<v Speaker 2>transcendent meaning despite the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that our rational mind has destroyed </v>

38
00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:57.474
<v Speaker 2>almost everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's transcendental and part of the </v>

39
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:00.544
<v Speaker 2>reason I think music can do this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely because it is beyond either </v>

40
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:08.761
<v Speaker 2>verbal formulation or verbal criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you listen to a song,</v>

41
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 2>whether it has lyrics or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could perhaps assume that it doesn't.</v>

42
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.230
<v Speaker 2>It does something to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if someone who had never heard music</v>

43
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.253
<v Speaker 2>asked you what it did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't tell them in any way that </v>

44
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 2>was a reasonable summary of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience itself.</v>

45
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 2>I suppose you could consider that </v>
<v Speaker 2>analogous to trying to describe color to</v>

46
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.244
<v Speaker 2>someone who's blind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever music is about isn't </v>

47
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:37.984
<v Speaker 2>translatable into language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we can use language to augment our </v>

48
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:43.740
<v Speaker 2>pleasure in music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do that with lyrics constantly,</v>

49
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.703
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

50
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.750
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that music speaks of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it speaks of something,</v>

51
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:51.090
<v Speaker 2>is not something you can speak of in </v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

52
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as rational people,</v>

53
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:56.130
<v Speaker 2>we're also inclined to presume that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real,</v>

54
00:03:56.131 --> 00:04:00.000
<v Speaker 2>you can speak about it in words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there've been culture since the dawn</v>

55
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:00.834
<v Speaker 2>of history believed that there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things that were not only </v>

56
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:05.124
<v Speaker 2>unspeakable from a verbal perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whose meaning was actually </v>

57
00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:10.770
<v Speaker 2>demolished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was put in words.</v>

58
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.623
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in ancient Hebrew societies and </v>

59
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.310
<v Speaker 2>incurrent Islam societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

60
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.093
<v Speaker 2>heretical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>improper to make an image of the </v>

61
00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:29.891
<v Speaker 2>transcendent and the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not merely an arbitrary moral law.</v>

62
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Nonsensical from a rational perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason for that is is</v>

63
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.963
<v Speaker 2>some things lose their meaning as soon </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they're translated into something </v>

64
00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:44.810
<v Speaker 2>that's as tiny as a word and music is </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those things,</v>

65
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.323
<v Speaker 2>and I made this little painting here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about seven feet across actually </v>

66
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.343
<v Speaker 2>when I was a graduate student about 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago trying to figure out what </v>

67
00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:57.770
<v Speaker 2>meaning meant and I designed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>painting.</v>

68
00:04:57.771 --> 00:05:01.400
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you a bigger picture of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>later to be something that would kind of</v>

69
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.263
<v Speaker 2>move when you looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you make a geometrical figure that </v>

70
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:05.624
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then when your brain looks out at it </v>

71
00:05:07.431 --> 00:05:11.360
<v Speaker 2>tries on different fits and it looks to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your visual perception system as if it's</v>

72
00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:12.194
<v Speaker 2>moving a necker cube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but reversing cube as a simple example </v>

73
00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:16.184
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it to make something here that </v>

74
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.190
<v Speaker 2>moved and danced visually like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a piece of music moves and dances.</v>

75
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.460
<v Speaker 2>That seems to intimate something beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

76
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.530
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to do that with a static </v>
<v Speaker 2>sculpture.</v>

77
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.660
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to do that with visual arts in</v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

78
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.913
<v Speaker 2>We do seem to approach it to some degree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a dance and dance is another art </v>

79
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:37.010
<v Speaker 2>form that speaks of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond words.</v>

80
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.920
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that dance is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

81
00:05:39.921 --> 00:05:43.190
<v Speaker 2>It just means that it's about something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can't be easily put into words.</v>

82
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Now I actually think you can understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>what music means,</v>

83
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.173
<v Speaker 2>but there's a real problem in doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem in understanding what </v>

84
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 2>music means is that it's only sample if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you change the way you look,</v>

85
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.973
<v Speaker 2>almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing is is that music speaks </v>

86
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 2>to you of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you understand it or not,</v>

87
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the reasons it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>imperishable art.</v>

88
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 2>I think what music speaks to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was real.</v>

89
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.693
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more real than anything </v>

90
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would also say that's not normally</v>

91
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:16.370
<v Speaker 2>how people think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

92
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:17.204
<v Speaker 2>so that's the first part of the spiel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to tell you some interesting </v>

93
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:24.190
<v Speaker 2>things about perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

94
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.513
<v Speaker 2>here's this problem that's come up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last quarter of the 20th century </v>

95
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:30.284
<v Speaker 2>that was</v>

96
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

97
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 2>formally described by Daniel Dennett </v>
<v Speaker 2>among others.</v>

98
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.073
<v Speaker 2>It's been something that's been plaguing</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who've been attempting to design </v>

99
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:41.810
<v Speaker 2>machines that can actually operate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the real world.</v>

100
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Early artificial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>researchers were pretty optimistic about</v>

101
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 2>billing things like general purpose </v>
<v Speaker 2>robots because they believe that</v>

102
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.863
<v Speaker 2>a robot could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while they believed fundamentally that </v>

103
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:54.944
<v Speaker 2>the world laid itself out in easily </v>
<v Speaker 2>accessible objects and that those </v>

104
00:06:58.671 --> 00:06:59.720
<v Speaker 2>objects had some,</v>

105
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 2>some reality beyond their perceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparent appearance and that the problem</v>

106
00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:08.154
<v Speaker 2>with developing a machine that could </v>
<v Speaker 2>operate in the real world was only </v>

107
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.550
<v Speaker 2>determining how it should act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that wasn't right.</v>

108
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.613
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard to make a machine that can </v>

109
00:07:22.381 --> 00:07:24.870
<v Speaker 2>perceive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

110
00:07:24.871 --> 00:07:29.020
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems technically impossible and that</v>

111
00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:29.854
<v Speaker 2>strange because we can perceive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem we saw while we proceed </v>

112
00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:37.740
<v Speaker 2>is so complex that in some ways it </v>
<v Speaker 2>appears it on computable,</v>

113
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.000
<v Speaker 2>which is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

114
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.400
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons we don't have general</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose robots.</v>

115
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.900
<v Speaker 2>It's also why we don't have computers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can accurately translate speech.</v>

116
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:46.763
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be able to talk to </v>

117
00:07:48.271 --> 00:07:49.104
<v Speaker 2>your computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would be promising that for 30 </v>

118
00:07:50.491 --> 00:07:51.324
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't talk to your computer </v>

119
00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:55.170
<v Speaker 2>because a computer can't understand what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying.</v>

120
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.363
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is it turns out </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very difficult to listen to what </v>

121
00:07:58.591 --> 00:07:59.424
<v Speaker 2>someone's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly because all of the </v>

122
00:08:01.051 --> 00:08:04.260
<v Speaker 2>information is not encoded in the sounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're making.</v>

123
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.573
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason you can understand </v>

124
00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:07.884
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less that this is an s or a </v>

125
00:08:11.071 --> 00:08:12.980
<v Speaker 2>lecture about psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

126
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:13.814
<v Speaker 2>it has a scientific basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that there are certain things </v>

127
00:08:15.991 --> 00:08:16.824
<v Speaker 2>are not going to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The entire context within which you sit </v>

128
00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:21.534
<v Speaker 2>informs your understanding of my speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every word I say helps build a </v>

129
00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:29.700
<v Speaker 2>framework for you that informed your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to understand each word computer</v>

130
00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:32.250
<v Speaker 2>just can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

131
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.563
<v Speaker 2>Janet called this the frame problem and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the frame problem was put in a very </v>

132
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:40.034
<v Speaker 2>simple way by Medina and Nick Wheeler in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mit Encyclopedia of cognitive </v>

133
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:44.864
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Medina Nagler pointed out that you can </v>

134
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:49.304
<v Speaker 2>categorize a relatively small finite </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of objects in virtually an </v>

135
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 2>infinite number of way waves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>

136
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:57.204
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that have to do with looking </v>

137
00:08:57.811 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 2>at the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>

138
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perception is a form of categorization.</v>

139
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 2>When you look at something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what that thing is,</v>

140
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.550
<v Speaker 2>your visual system is doing a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>classification.</v>

141
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 2>But it turns out that there's a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>large number of ways to look at things.</v>

142
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.553
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now I'm looking at you as if </v>

143
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 2>you're an audience full of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I was an impressionist painter,</v>

144
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.913
<v Speaker 2>I could be looking at you as if you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>surfaces from which certain colored </v>

145
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 2>lights were reflecting.</v>

146
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:29.070
<v Speaker 2>And you might think that that I suppose </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some way is obvious.</v>

147
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 2>But it's useful to remember that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the impressionists had their first shows</v>

148
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:34.044
<v Speaker 2>in Paris basing their artistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>production on this transformation of </v>

149
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 2>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they caused riots.</v>

150
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.213
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So perception is a very difficult </v>

151
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 2>process and artists actually teach us </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to see.</v>

152
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:46.643
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean that in again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean that in some impractical </v>

153
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that the way we use our eyes is,</v>

154
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 2>has been informed from for hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years,</v>

155
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:57.384
<v Speaker 2>perhaps by the experts among us who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to use their visual systems better </v>

156
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 2>than anyone else and who could </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate that.</v>

157
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to see the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you can think of that,</v>

158
00:10:09.871 --> 00:10:11.820
<v Speaker 2>if you're playing chess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

159
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.163
<v Speaker 2>we had to build big computers to beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>Grand Masters at chess and they can </v>

160
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:17.550
<v Speaker 2>barely do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's all they can do,</v>

161
00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:17.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

162
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:18.683
<v Speaker 2>Big Blue plays chess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can't walk down the street and </v>

163
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:21.264
<v Speaker 2>it's not good at riding a bicycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one purpose machine and the way it </v>

164
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 2>plays chess isn't the way that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>play chess.</v>

165
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.863
<v Speaker 2>It plays chess by doing a reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhaustive search of every single </v>

166
00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 2>combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on a chess board,</v>

167
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:38.001
<v Speaker 2>there's an unbelievably large number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential combinations of moves.</v>

168
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.163
<v Speaker 2>It's immense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a chess game is a rather bounded </v>

169
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:44.820
<v Speaker 2>world and all things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a finite number of men.</v>

170
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 2>They have finite rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless,</v>

171
00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:49.420
<v Speaker 2>it's an unbelievably complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

172
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 2>environment in terms of its space of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>

173
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:53.783
<v Speaker 2>Expert chess players appear to identify </v>
<v Speaker 2>configurations of men that have some </v>

174
00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:01.710
<v Speaker 2>relevance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they're able to do is to look at</v>

175
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:02.544
<v Speaker 2>the board and rapidly determine what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they should pay attention to and what </v>

176
00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:05.904
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't pay attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they develop that skill by </v>

177
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:11.910
<v Speaker 2>practicing over thousands of games and </v>
<v Speaker 2>studying chess games and so forth and so</v>

178
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:12.450
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

179
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.283
<v Speaker 2>We don't duplicate that with a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what you could say is that an </v>

180
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:22.371
<v Speaker 2>expert chess player is an expert at </v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to see a chest board and they</v>

181
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 2>see extremely well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once they've seen,</v>

182
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:26.364
<v Speaker 2>they can kind of put constraints around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cognitive complexity of the problem </v>

183
00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:30.414
<v Speaker 2>and operate within that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you guys are doing that all the </v>

184
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:33.354
<v Speaker 2>time when you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's so much of your brain </v>

185
00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:37.840
<v Speaker 2>devoted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're so bloody good at it that you</v>

186
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.290
<v Speaker 2>don't even know what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at the world it's like</v>

187
00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:41.124
<v Speaker 2>there it is and that's all objective and</v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious and there's the objects and you </v>

188
00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 2>know they have nothing to do with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception,</v>

189
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:52.101
<v Speaker 2>but it is absolutely not that clear and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not clear for a lot of reasons.</v>

190
00:11:52.591 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean one is the frame problem.</v>

191
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 2>The other is that it turns out that when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the world,</v>

192
00:11:58.810 --> 00:11:59.643
<v Speaker 2>you don't see objects and then think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about them and then figure out how to </v>

193
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:02.494
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your eyes map on all sorts of parts of </v>

194
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

195
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.323
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your retinas map right onto your spinal </v>

196
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:12.520
<v Speaker 2>cord and that means your eyes can make </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body move without eat with you,</v>

197
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.710
<v Speaker 2>without you thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And without you seeing.</v>

198
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.053
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to understand it until you </v>

199
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:18.874
<v Speaker 2>understand that what your retina is </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is picking up patterns cause it's </v>

200
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 2>like a matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

201
00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:24.634
<v Speaker 2>It's like a TV screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It picks up patterns from outside world </v>

202
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.430
<v Speaker 2>and then it translates them into </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns of motor output.</v>

203
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 2>There's no intermediation of perception </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

204
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:33.964
<v Speaker 2>If you're moving very quickly and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be because it takes you too long </v>

205
00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:38.350
<v Speaker 2>to see anything to be fast.</v>

206
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.633
<v Speaker 2>That's why by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you drive down the road in your </v>

207
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:41.884
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't look right in front of the </v>

208
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:43.504
<v Speaker 2>hood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what good is that if you see it </v>

209
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.530
<v Speaker 2>in front of the hood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've already run over it.</v>

210
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.633
<v Speaker 2>You have to look like half a second down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the road because anything that happens </v>

211
00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:53.200
<v Speaker 2>to you closer than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's already too late.</v>

212
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.513
<v Speaker 2>So you look far enough down the road so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can get your body to do what </v>

213
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:01.810
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to do and take into account </v>
<v Speaker 2>how long it takes you to see the world,</v>

214
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:05.020
<v Speaker 2>which may be up to half a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one estimate.</v>

215
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:05.854
<v Speaker 2>I think that's too long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the standard estimate app at </v>

216
00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:09.184
<v Speaker 2>the time for half a second to long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go 40 feet in a car going 60 miles </v>

217
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:13.624
<v Speaker 2>an hour and half a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point I'm making there is that when </v>

218
00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:21.790
<v Speaker 2>you see the object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seeing produces the action.</v>

219
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:22.960
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

220
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.063
<v Speaker 2>you have a little mechanism and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>motor system that allows you to grab </v>

221
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:30.430
<v Speaker 2>things and you practice the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you were two years old,</v>

222
00:13:30.431 --> 00:13:31.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just grabbing things left,</v>

223
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:36.100
<v Speaker 2>right and center til you got the grip </v>
<v Speaker 2>motion down to an automated state.</v>

224
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at a cup,</v>

225
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.560
<v Speaker 2>the act of looking at the cuff reduces </v>
<v Speaker 2>the threshold for activation of the grip</v>

226
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:46.030
<v Speaker 2>mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't because you see the cup</v>

227
00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 2>and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll pick it up.</v>

228
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.600
<v Speaker 2>It happens as a consequence of seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

229
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.090
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the world,</v>

230
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:53.283
<v Speaker 2>you don't see objects exactly what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see is things that it's useful to </v>

231
00:13:57.281 --> 00:14:00.520
<v Speaker 2>interact with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those things are more like tools.</v>

232
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:01.743
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you're looking in this room and </v>

233
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.384
<v Speaker 2>what you see are things to interact with</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you think those are objective </v>

234
00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:09.070
<v Speaker 2>objects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're really not.</v>

235
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are very,</v>

236
00:14:11.531 --> 00:14:12.364
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very tiny subset of all the objects you </v>

237
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:15.184
<v Speaker 2>could see in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone like a schizophrenia whose </v>

238
00:14:17.831 --> 00:14:19.870
<v Speaker 2>perceptions of being somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>fragmented.</v>

239
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.093
<v Speaker 2>They have a hard time focusing on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universal class of usable objects that </v>

240
00:14:25.271 --> 00:14:26.104
<v Speaker 2>everybody looks at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a schizophrenia and sometimes an </v>

241
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:31.950
<v Speaker 2>artist too can get lost in contemplation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the complex patterns in the,</v>

242
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:32.873
<v Speaker 2>in the carpet or the shades of colors </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are in the person's shirt next to </v>

243
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:39.100
<v Speaker 2>you or all these complex things that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can see around you,</v>

244
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:41.170
<v Speaker 2>but that you pay no attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>

245
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.490
<v Speaker 2>How do you ignore all that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ignore almost everything.</v>

246
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.520
<v Speaker 2>99.9 and far more percent of everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's around you.</v>

247
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.943
<v Speaker 2>You don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see relevant things and we really </v>

248
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 2>don't know how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

249
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.220
<v Speaker 2>you know already how complex a chest </v>
<v Speaker 2>king,</v>

250
00:14:59.221 --> 00:15:00.054
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now uncomfortable that is yet you're </v>

251
00:15:02.251 --> 00:15:03.084
<v Speaker 2>interacting with an environment who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity leaves a chess game in the </v>

252
00:15:06.001 --> 00:15:08.730
<v Speaker 2>dusk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're environment is composed of an,</v>

253
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:09.893
<v Speaker 2>an infinite number of hierarchically </v>
<v Speaker 2>stacked chess games and yet you wander </v>

254
00:15:13.771 --> 00:15:16.800
<v Speaker 2>through it without a second thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless something goes wrong.</v>

255
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.010
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that perception is the hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>

256
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.983
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artists have always known this and you </v>

257
00:15:23.281 --> 00:15:27.300
<v Speaker 2>get modern artists like believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>some agreed</v>

258
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:29.543
<v Speaker 4>on the right,</v>

259
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.863
<v Speaker 2>the greed is telling you that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>average person is blinded by their </v>

260
00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:37.850
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

261
00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:41.990
<v Speaker 2>That's what that painting needs and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>visual illusion on the left,</v>

262
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.153
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was constructed by a perceptual </v>

263
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:46.154
<v Speaker 2>scientist shows that shows how with </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of the visual system you can </v>

264
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:52.250
<v Speaker 2>play games with it and the game there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

265
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:53.683
<v Speaker 2>well what is that exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it an amalgam of lines or is it a </v>

266
00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.960
<v Speaker 2>square in the middle of a diamond?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

267
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's both of those and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is to depends on what it is that</v>

268
00:16:03.621 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 2>you would do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

269
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:06.740
<v Speaker 2>you don't do anything with that except </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it,</v>

270
00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:08.930
<v Speaker 2>but your visual system doesn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

271
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:11.873
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

272
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:15.390
<v Speaker 2>Stu Shah on the left new descending a </v>
<v Speaker 2>staircase.</v>

273
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.050
<v Speaker 2>Well why is that a new descending a </v>
<v Speaker 2>staircase?</v>

274
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.440
<v Speaker 2>While you may be able to see it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>may not be able to see it.</v>

275
00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:23.274
<v Speaker 2>But what it is is that it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the geometric figure of a human </v>

276
00:16:27.031 --> 00:16:32.031
<v Speaker 2>being with the fourth dimension averaged</v>
<v Speaker 2>averaged across the fourth dimension.</v>

277
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.043
<v Speaker 2>Fourth dimension is time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you see is the nude transformed </v>

278
00:16:37.981 --> 00:16:42.480
<v Speaker 2>into a geometric figure at each point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the descent down the staircase.</v>

279
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.801
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

280
00:16:43.801 --> 00:16:45.750
<v Speaker 2>that's not a realist painting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>

281
00:16:45.751 --> 00:16:47.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be so sure about that.</v>

282
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Abstraction sometimes is more real than </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

283
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.820
<v Speaker 2>or do you think that numbers are less </v>
<v Speaker 2>real than things?</v>

284
00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:55.523
<v Speaker 2>While I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do a lot of things with numbers </v>

285
00:16:56.911 --> 00:17:00.180
<v Speaker 2>you can't do with things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could argue that the numbers are</v>

286
00:17:00.181 --> 00:17:01.380
<v Speaker 2>more real than the things.</v>

287
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.030
<v Speaker 2>And I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

288
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.223
<v Speaker 2>that's more real than what you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't see time across </v>

289
00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:09.510
<v Speaker 2>sequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only see it in slices.</v>

290
00:17:09.511 --> 00:17:14.400
<v Speaker 2>And that's across sequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's Picasso on the left.</v>

291
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.510
<v Speaker 2>And part of what Picasso was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from playing with time and angle,</v>

292
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.890
<v Speaker 2>was trying to determine just how badly </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could mangle and decompose.</v>

293
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

294
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.993
<v Speaker 2>an iconic image and still be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize it as an image and it turns </v>

295
00:17:28.051 --> 00:17:28.884
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

296
00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:33.750
<v Speaker 2>there's not a single thing in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>painting that's reminiscent of a face.</v>

297
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:38.280
<v Speaker 2>It's the gestalt that does it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a specialized system in your brain.</v>

298
00:17:38.281 --> 00:17:39.114
<v Speaker 2>It's attached to your emotional systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>in an area called the Amygdala that </v>

299
00:17:41.611 --> 00:17:42.444
<v Speaker 2>partly deals with fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a specialized phase detector </v>

300
00:17:45.031 --> 00:17:47.580
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's so specialized that if you turn</v>

301
00:17:47.581 --> 00:17:48.414
<v Speaker 2>faces upside down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it about 60 or 70% of its ability to </v>

302
00:17:51.851 --> 00:17:52.684
<v Speaker 2>discriminate.</v>

303
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:53.603
<v Speaker 2>It's really specialized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at people in their faces pop </v>

304
00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 2>out and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

305
00:17:56.941 --> 00:17:58.860
<v Speaker 2>there's so much difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>phases.</v>

306
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.860
<v Speaker 2>There's not that much difference at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>objectively speaking,</v>

307
00:18:01.861 --> 00:18:02.694
<v Speaker 2>and it's certainly possible for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have have a stroke that will leave you </v>

308
00:18:05.701 --> 00:18:06.534
<v Speaker 2>almost entirely intellectually and </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptually intact and yet be </v>

309
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.150
<v Speaker 2>absolutely unable to tell one face from </v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

310
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Well on the bottom left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's a little girl.</v>

311
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

312
00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:19.250
<v Speaker 2>how is it that you can know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

313
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.160
<v Speaker 2>it's partly because the castle has </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught you to see things like that,</v>

314
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.263
<v Speaker 2>but also because your visual system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably good at producing rapid </v>

315
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:29.250
<v Speaker 2>abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it this way.</v>

316
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.910
<v Speaker 2>You know those simple drawings that kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>make of stick figures?</v>

317
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Those aren't simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

318
00:18:35.761 --> 00:18:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Because a stick figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't look anything like a person.</v>

319
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.533
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks about as unlike the person has </v>

320
00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:43.380
<v Speaker 2>anything possibly could and still be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

321
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.140
<v Speaker 2>The thing that's so interesting about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid stick figures,</v>

322
00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:46.974
<v Speaker 2>it gives you insight into the tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability of them to abstract away from </v>

323
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:51.060
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

324
00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:54.750
<v Speaker 2>And they're really not images at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like Harold glyphs.</v>

325
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:55.584
<v Speaker 2>They're quasi linguistic representations</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know a stick figures the </v>

326
00:18:59.341 --> 00:19:02.430
<v Speaker 2>next best thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a written symbol kids,</v>

327
00:19:02.431 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 2>they just generate those nonstop house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a house.</v>

328
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 2>It's got some smoke coming out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

329
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 2>You recognize that house in no time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flat kid,</v>

330
00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:12.390
<v Speaker 2>three years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four years old can spin one of those off</v>

331
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:13.224
<v Speaker 2>in no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their perceptual systems are </v>

332
00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:15.864
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably sophisticated and they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>not merely map self evidence objects </v>

333
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.353
<v Speaker 2>onto the cognitive system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perception doesn't work like that at </v>

334
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to overemphasize.</v>

335
00:19:26.911 --> 00:19:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I nude</v>

336
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.880
<v Speaker 2>to people on a beach grief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

337
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.450
<v Speaker 2>that's a really interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

338
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.210
<v Speaker 2>you can just nail that as grief in no </v>
<v Speaker 2>time flat.</v>

339
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While the color death,</v>

340
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:45.200
<v Speaker 2>green and purple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he did with the eyes.</v>

341
00:19:45.201 --> 00:19:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Why it manages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wellness appears like a tour,</v>

342
00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this of course,</v>

343
00:19:49.161 --> 00:19:49.994
<v Speaker 2>it's a handkerchief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a striking image and so mangled </v>

344
00:19:54.591 --> 00:19:57.050
<v Speaker 2>that it's almost beyond recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless.</v>

345
00:19:57.051 --> 00:20:01.010
<v Speaker 2>You can categorize it from an emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and no time flat.</v>

346
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.970
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To delve nation.</v>

347
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.200
<v Speaker 2>There's the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see it?</v>

348
00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.210
<v Speaker 2>There's the leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the leg.</v>

349
00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.970
<v Speaker 2>There's the back of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does everybody see the Dalmatian?</v>

350
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.760
<v Speaker 2>How many people see it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there,</v>

351
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:22.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people don't see it?</v>

352
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it there or not?</v>

353
00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Call her head shadow leaves background </v>
<v Speaker 2>sidewalk.</v>

354
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.433
<v Speaker 2>Once you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't not see it if you don't get </v>

355
00:20:38.211 --> 00:20:39.830
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't grip it as it gets stalled.</v>

356
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.660
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Random patterns.</v>

357
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.240
<v Speaker 2>While they're not random,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's only because you had,</v>

358
00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.370
<v Speaker 2>you're familiar with dogs and living </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

359
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.980
<v Speaker 2>That's as of a random pattern is </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything you could generate deceptive.</v>

360
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.990
<v Speaker 2>It also happens to be a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we see things?</v>

361
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.430
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to answer.</v>

362
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Partly we limit our vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see through a lens,</v>

363
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.830
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to describe what this lens is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

364
00:21:06.831 --> 00:21:07.664
<v Speaker 2>it's the lens that allows us to use our </v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitions about a situation to specify </v>

365
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:12.964
<v Speaker 2>the meaning of the current moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you're reading a book and </v>

366
00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:17.920
<v Speaker 2>then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how do you read that book?</v>

367
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:20.740
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You read it letter by letter,</v>

368
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.800
<v Speaker 2>what little kids do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't like to read.</v>

369
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.720
<v Speaker 2>And that's because they have to read </v>
<v Speaker 2>letter by letter.</v>

370
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.793
<v Speaker 2>You read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>letter by letter and see how much </v>

371
00:21:27.671 --> 00:21:30.040
<v Speaker 2>enjoyment you get out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

372
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.143
<v Speaker 2>So you get the letters automated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you build a little machine in the back </v>

373
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:35.860
<v Speaker 2>of your mind that nails those letters </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then common combinations.</v>

374
00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:36.694
<v Speaker 2>And then you can read word by word and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you automate that with several </v>

375
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 2>thousand hours of practice until you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>so good at that.</v>

376
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.380
<v Speaker 2>When you look at a word you can't help </v>
<v Speaker 2>but read.</v>

377
00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:47.980
<v Speaker 2>It just goes off in your head like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word is in the outside world.</v>

378
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:49.323
<v Speaker 2>Then if you keep practicing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see phrases and if you're really </v>

379
00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:55.450
<v Speaker 2>good you start to see sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you get pretty speedy at that point.</v>

380
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:56.763
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then the question is when you're </v>

381
00:21:57.701 --> 00:21:58.534
<v Speaker 2>reading a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you read it phrase by phrase or </v>

382
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:01.750
<v Speaker 2>sentence by sentence and sentence?</v>

383
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.610
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

384
00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:05.890
<v Speaker 2>not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You read it,</v>

385
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.970
<v Speaker 2>you read the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read the phrase,</v>

386
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.970
<v Speaker 2>you read the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read the paragraph,</v>

387
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.850
<v Speaker 2>you read the chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read the book,</v>

388
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.610
<v Speaker 2>you know the cover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the culture,</v>

389
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:19.563
<v Speaker 2>you know the intent of the author.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of those things are going on </v>

390
00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:25.870
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously while you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>extract meaning out of that book.</v>

391
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:31.260
<v Speaker 2>So it's as if you're looking at the word</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a lens made up of the success of</v>

392
00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:32.134
<v Speaker 2>layers of knowledge that you have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allow you to zero in on the meaning of </v>

393
00:22:35.861 --> 00:22:38.800
<v Speaker 2>what it is that the author is attempting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to explain.</v>

394
00:22:38.801 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

395
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.790
<v Speaker 2>what does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so think about how someone translates.</v>

396
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:43.624
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it word by word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't do it phrase by phrase it </v>

397
00:22:45.641 --> 00:22:48.850
<v Speaker 2>letter by letter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just forget it and you can't get a</v>

398
00:22:48.851 --> 00:22:50.110
<v Speaker 2>computer to translate.</v>

399
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.393
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's because when you read </v>

400
00:22:52.811 --> 00:22:53.644
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you figure out what it means and then </v>

401
00:22:55.661 --> 00:22:58.570
<v Speaker 2>you translate it so that it also means </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the next language,</v>

402
00:22:58.571 --> 00:23:02.680
<v Speaker 2>so it's as if the verbal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the verbal level,</v>

403
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.180
<v Speaker 2>verbal portrayal is one motive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality perception,</v>

404
00:23:07.181 --> 00:23:08.014
<v Speaker 2>but it translates onto another mode and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that mode is meaning and then it can be </v>

405
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.393
<v Speaker 2>back translated into another lane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how a good translator does </v>

406
00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:16.024
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also white translation is an </v>

407
00:23:16.811 --> 00:23:17.381
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

408
00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:19.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you get the meaning?</v>

409
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well who knows if it's a philosopher,</v>

410
00:23:21.581 --> 00:23:23.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean philosophers mean a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

411
00:23:23.741 --> 00:23:24.574
<v Speaker 2>At the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Question is what's the level of reality </v>

412
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.450
<v Speaker 2>down at which to you translate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>words?</v>

413
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:32.883
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to have something to do with </v>

414
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.970
<v Speaker 2>movement and action and behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 2>output.</v>

415
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.060
<v Speaker 2>It seems to have something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we have a body.</v>

416
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.493
<v Speaker 2>It isn't a merely intellectual exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you read something and it </v>

417
00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 2>has meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

418
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I know what that means and what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means is having read this,</v>

419
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.130
<v Speaker 2>I know how to do something differently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I know how to conceptualize something</v>

420
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:58.360
<v Speaker 2>differently so that my actions will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>different in the future.</v>

421
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.650
<v Speaker 2>That's why we generally say if it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction,</v>

422
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:04.190
<v Speaker 2>say that it has a moral right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a behavioral consequence.</v>

423
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.530
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the meaning of the story is.</v>

424
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:07.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

425
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:08.714
<v Speaker 2>we can get the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that while you either do </v>

426
00:24:11.361 --> 00:24:15.110
<v Speaker 2>something differently or you perceive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then act generally differently,</v>

427
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.820
<v Speaker 2>and if it's really meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

428
00:24:16.821 --> 00:24:18.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that changed my life.</v>

429
00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Or what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I no longer see things the same way.</v>

430
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 2>That's as close to literal truth as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>lead,</v>

431
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I no longer think the same.</v>

432
00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 2>Things are important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

433
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.253
<v Speaker 2>it's important things to which you </v>
<v Speaker 2>devote your action and if the thing is </v>

434
00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:34.064
<v Speaker 2>powerfully meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it transforms the manner in which </v>

435
00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:39.070
<v Speaker 2>you act and the aims towards which you </v>
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>

436
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.273
<v Speaker 2>That's meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now our lens has help us specify </v>

437
00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:44.204
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>

438
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.663
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

439
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:48.623
<v Speaker 2>you know your lenses give you all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of different takes on the world and you </v>

440
00:24:52.021 --> 00:24:55.410
<v Speaker 2>might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well are those takes real?</v>

441
00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.050
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

442
00:24:58.051 --> 00:25:00.330
<v Speaker 2>here's the odd thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are real,</v>

443
00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.283
<v Speaker 2>but any visual landscape is so complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can derive a very large number </v>

444
00:25:06.361 --> 00:25:09.030
<v Speaker 2>of real representations up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could say,</v>

445
00:25:09.031 --> 00:25:12.030
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a low resolution photograph real.</v>

446
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Is it more or less real than a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution photograph?</v>

447
00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.810
<v Speaker 2>What if it's black and white?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that less or more real than color?</v>

448
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.630
<v Speaker 2>What if it's three dimensional instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of two dementia?</v>

449
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.480
<v Speaker 2>What if it's abstracted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

450
00:25:24.481 --> 00:25:25.314
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can imagine how many photographs of </v>

451
00:25:26.611 --> 00:25:28.740
<v Speaker 2>a single object you could conceivably </v>
<v Speaker 2>take.</v>

452
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:29.873
<v Speaker 2>They're all slices of what that thing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>or their representational slices of our </v>

453
00:25:34.381 --> 00:25:36.660
<v Speaker 2>conceptions of what it is and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all valid.</v>

454
00:25:36.661 --> 00:25:39.480
<v Speaker 2>There's a large number of valid </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretations.</v>

455
00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:40.883
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny thing because the </v>

456
00:25:41.281 --> 00:25:44.010
<v Speaker 2>humanities ran into the frame problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

457
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:45.263
<v Speaker 2>the humanities run into their frame </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with postmodernism because the </v>

458
00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:52.650
<v Speaker 2>postmodern is starting to become aware </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the fact that if you took a book,</v>

459
00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.173
<v Speaker 2>there was no end to the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretations you could derive from </v>

460
00:25:56.251 --> 00:25:58.680
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the postmodern start,</v>

461
00:25:58.681 --> 00:26:03.681
<v Speaker 2>well then anything goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No techs have any intrinsic meaning.</v>

462
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:05.363
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's true for a variety </v>

463
00:26:06.391 --> 00:26:07.680
<v Speaker 2>of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was certainly,</v>

464
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:08.783
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate inference given what they </v>

465
00:26:10.561 --> 00:26:11.394
<v Speaker 2>had discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't specify the meaning of a </v>

466
00:26:13.531 --> 00:26:14.364
<v Speaker 2>text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you be sure that it has any </v>

467
00:26:15.751 --> 00:26:18.630
<v Speaker 2>meaning at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very hard question.</v>

468
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that at least in part,</v>

469
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.350
<v Speaker 2>meaning is dependent on the Lens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can imagine this,</v>

470
00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:28.300
<v Speaker 2>imagine that this is what the world's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

471
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:33.780
<v Speaker 2>It's an infinite hierarchical landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not about objects but of patterns.</v>

472
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.920
<v Speaker 2>And some of those patterns are objects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns that persist,</v>

473
00:26:38.921 --> 00:26:39.754
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or patterns that persists that are </v>

474
00:26:41.741 --> 00:26:43.800
<v Speaker 2>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I to you will,</v>

475
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.260
<v Speaker 2>what's a chair?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

476
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:47.094
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chair has four legs and a seat and a </v>

477
00:26:48.451 --> 00:26:49.261
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>

478
00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:49.711
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

479
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:53.150
<v Speaker 2>a stump doesn't have any of those and </v>
<v Speaker 2>neither does a bean bag,</v>

480
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.620
<v Speaker 2>but they're both chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you say,</v>

481
00:26:55.621 --> 00:26:56.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a chair.</v>

482
00:26:56.941 --> 00:26:58.680
<v Speaker 2>If you can sit on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>

483
00:26:58.681 --> 00:27:03.030
<v Speaker 2>well you can sit on a table and it turns</v>
<v Speaker 2>out the defining what a chair is,</v>

484
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:04.920
<v Speaker 2>no easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though you know one,</v>

485
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:08.340
<v Speaker 2>when you see one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well imagine this,</v>

486
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.740
<v Speaker 2>the world's made out of patterns.</v>

487
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.610
<v Speaker 2>And those patterns can be interpreted in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very large number of ways.</v>

488
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:18.840
<v Speaker 2>But it's more complicated than that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because your mind is made up of patterns</v>

489
00:27:18.841 --> 00:27:19.674
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you take your mind in the </v>

490
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:22.764
<v Speaker 2>patterns that are in your mind and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>apply them to the world than what you </v>

491
00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:27.474
<v Speaker 2>get is an interaction between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns that the world are made out of </v>

492
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.880
<v Speaker 2>is made out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the patterns that your mind are made</v>

493
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:35.970
<v Speaker 2>out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's an even more complex pattern.</v>

494
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.970
<v Speaker 2>And it has something to do with reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>as such.</v>

495
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.280
<v Speaker 2>But it also has something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

496
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:42.323
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the reality is actually in the </v>

497
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:46.410
<v Speaker 2>interaction between the two sets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns.</v>

498
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.453
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean that metaphysically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the reality is in the </v>

499
00:27:51.571 --> 00:27:53.910
<v Speaker 2>interactions between the two sets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns.</v>

500
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.540
<v Speaker 2>And so when I said if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what music means,</v>

501
00:27:57.541 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 2>you have to change the way that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about things.</v>

502
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:00.953
<v Speaker 2>What I mean is that what music speaks of</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a way of understanding reality that </v>

503
00:28:04.951 --> 00:28:09.150
<v Speaker 2>is not like the way we understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality and yet it's a way,</v>

504
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.630
<v Speaker 2>it's a way that even when merely </v>
<v Speaker 2>intimated,</v>

505
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.613
<v Speaker 2>which is what music does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it grips people powerfully at in a way </v>

506
00:28:16.051 --> 00:28:16.884
<v Speaker 2>that cannot be irrationally criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you say that the meaning that </v>

507
00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:20.814
<v Speaker 2>music speaks of is not real well then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say it depends on your definition </v>

508
00:28:25.561 --> 00:28:29.190
<v Speaker 2>of reality and you know there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways to play that game.</v>

509
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.713
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can define thing a or thing B as </v>

510
00:28:32.941 --> 00:28:35.910
<v Speaker 2>real or out of reality in a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>

511
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Well you have to make choices about what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you decided is real.</v>

512
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:40.134
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why philosophers since time in </v>

513
00:28:41.701 --> 00:28:44.460
<v Speaker 2>memorial have pointed out that like it </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>

514
00:28:44.461 --> 00:28:49.461
<v Speaker 2>your existence is grounded in faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what's your lens like?</v>

515
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.000
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you what my lens is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine I'm writing a paper,</v>

516
00:28:54.001 --> 00:28:56.150
<v Speaker 2>which I do fairly often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

517
00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:58.710
<v Speaker 2>why do I write the paper?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

518
00:28:58.711 --> 00:28:59.544
<v Speaker 2>let's make it simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do I write the sentence while I </v>

519
00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:02.934
<v Speaker 2>write the sentence to contribute to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>paragraph and I read the paragraph to </v>

520
00:29:06.241 --> 00:29:07.074
<v Speaker 2>contribute to the essay and I write the </v>
<v Speaker 2>essay to contribute to the paper and I </v>

521
00:29:10.021 --> 00:29:10.854
<v Speaker 2>write the paper because it's part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a scientist and I am a scientist </v>

522
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:17.190
<v Speaker 2>because it's part of being a professor </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a professor because it's part of</v>

523
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.173
<v Speaker 2>least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a good citizen and being a good </v>

524
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:25.050
<v Speaker 2>citizen has a definition in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a Judeo Christian capitalist society,</v>

525
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:29.150
<v Speaker 2>being a good citizen is being a Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian capitalist for better,</v>

526
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.110
<v Speaker 2>for worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

527
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:34.703
<v Speaker 2>and so when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when I'm engaged in something as </v>

528
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.990
<v Speaker 2>potentially trivial is writing a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence in an essay,</v>

529
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.270
<v Speaker 2>all of those sources of knowledge bear </v>
<v Speaker 2>on it simultaneously.</v>

530
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.310
<v Speaker 2>And that's what helps me specify its </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

531
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.840
<v Speaker 2>And you can't say that any one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of analysis is more real than any</v>

532
00:29:49.841 --> 00:29:50.674
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can say it's more pragmatically </v>

533
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:56.440
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile to focus on a certain level </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a certain point in time.</v>

534
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:57.573
<v Speaker 2>But I'll tell you if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I get a paper that's rejected badly </v>

535
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:02.350
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happens fairly often,</v>

536
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

537
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.823
<v Speaker 2>the sentence was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started thinking I'm a pretty awful </v>

538
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:10.690
<v Speaker 2>scientist and therefore I must not be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very good professor.</v>

539
00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:13.990
<v Speaker 2>And that puts the whole productive </v>
<v Speaker 2>science citizen thing in doubt.</v>

540
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:14.843
<v Speaker 2>And you think hard about that for a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll understand real quick why </v>

541
00:30:17.691 --> 00:30:21.310
<v Speaker 2>people don't like other people who mess </v>
<v Speaker 2>around with their presuppositions,</v>

542
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:22.683
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it goes pretty quickly up the </v>

543
00:30:23.951 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 2>old reality hierarchy from you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid idea to your,</v>

544
00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

545
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:33.280
<v Speaker 2>your moral grip on your privileged </v>
<v Speaker 2>position is,</v>

546
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unjustifiable.</v>

547
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take a simple lent.</v>

548
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:38.883
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you look at the world while </v>

549
00:30:40.481 --> 00:30:41.314
<v Speaker 2>you're a motivated creature and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>alive and you're always doing something </v>

550
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:44.883
<v Speaker 2>fiddling around with something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when in the old Mesopotamian </v>

551
00:30:47.501 --> 00:30:50.590
<v Speaker 2>creation myths that God is who lived </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath everything.</v>

552
00:30:50.591 --> 00:30:51.424
<v Speaker 2>She'd always come up in a terribly </v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive rourke as people were </v>

553
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 2>running around on the planet doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in disturbing here.</v>

554
00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.230
<v Speaker 2>While we still believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

555
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Because we believe if we mess around </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the environment long enough,</v>

556
00:31:02.501 --> 00:31:04.930
<v Speaker 2>so all hell's gonna break clicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

557
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:06.730
<v Speaker 2>we're always running around messing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things up.</v>

558
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.780
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

559
00:31:07.781 --> 00:31:10.690
<v Speaker 2>We're going from point a to point B and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how it is.</v>

560
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.040
<v Speaker 2>You have a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pursue it,</v>

561
00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.080
<v Speaker 2>get the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you get the goal,</v>

562
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:15.790
<v Speaker 2>you have another goal and you pursue </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

563
00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:16.993
<v Speaker 2>As you get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says if this roll the rock up the </v>

564
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:21.640
<v Speaker 2>hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rolls down the hill,</v>

565
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.470
<v Speaker 2>roll it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hill was down the hill,</v>

566
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.020
<v Speaker 2>eventually get tired of that and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

567
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.880
<v Speaker 2>You're stuck in one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

568
00:31:30.881 --> 00:31:31.714
<v Speaker 2>and it gives your life value because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out that the way your emotional </v>

569
00:31:34.361 --> 00:31:37.120
<v Speaker 2>systems work is that they only worked if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a goal.</v>

570
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.760
<v Speaker 2>So you have a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is,</v>

571
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:44.950
<v Speaker 2>and then anything that happens to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that puts you closer to the goal,</v>

572
00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.330
<v Speaker 2>that makes you happy and it turns on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your systems that make you go ahead,</v>

573
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.193
<v Speaker 2>move forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be attracted to anything that gets in </v>

574
00:31:54.041 --> 00:31:56.290
<v Speaker 2>the way of your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depending on its</v>

575
00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.660
<v Speaker 2>potency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>produces negative emotion,</v>

576
00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.250
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frustration,</v>

577
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:04.300
<v Speaker 2>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shame,</v>

578
00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:05.163
<v Speaker 2>guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anger stops you or makes you move </v>

579
00:32:07.781 --> 00:32:08.614
<v Speaker 2>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a pretty simple creature in some </v>

580
00:32:10.331 --> 00:32:11.920
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going somewhere.</v>

581
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:13.893
<v Speaker 2>If things are going well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're happy because happy means things </v>

582
00:32:17.381 --> 00:32:20.320
<v Speaker 2>are going well in progression to a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they aren't,</v>

583
00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.420
<v Speaker 2>you're not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forward.</v>

584
00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reverse forward is happy.</v>

585
00:32:24.941 --> 00:32:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Stopped is anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reverses,</v>

586
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.420
<v Speaker 2>frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointment,</v>

587
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.343
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're linear creatures and we're always </v>

588
00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:34.270
<v Speaker 2>on the move and we look at the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a motivated led's,</v>

589
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't secondary.</v>

590
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:39.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not after perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It informs perception,</v>

591
00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:44.600
<v Speaker 2>which means really that you can't look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the world without wanting something.</v>

592
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:45.973
<v Speaker 2>And which also means that the way the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world looks to you depends what you </v>

593
00:32:49.311 --> 00:32:51.800
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a scary thought.</v>

594
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 2>What you see when you're looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

595
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

596
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.590
<v Speaker 2>they're not objects they've been called </v>
<v Speaker 2>affordances.</v>

597
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 2>You see things that have relevance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

598
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.423
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

599
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it has to persist a bit for it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be relevant to you.</v>

600
00:33:09.481 --> 00:33:12.900
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of the things that we see our </v>
<v Speaker 2>objects,</v>

601
00:33:12.901 --> 00:33:14.250
<v Speaker 2>but not everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one,</v>

602
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.510
<v Speaker 2>here's an ad hoc category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Firemen can see this,</v>

603
00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.733
<v Speaker 2>but other people can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things to take out of your apartment </v>

604
00:33:23.041 --> 00:33:26.220
<v Speaker 2>while it's burning down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

605
00:33:26.221 --> 00:33:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

606
00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.490
<v Speaker 2>You can even imagine that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptual category,</v>

607
00:33:29.491 --> 00:33:32.880
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is that it contains share </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually no objective features,</v>

608
00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.880
<v Speaker 2>pets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spouses,</v>

609
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.120
<v Speaker 2>probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>things of sentimental value money.</v>

610
00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.900
<v Speaker 2>Well then maybe the list gets more </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to define,</v>

611
00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:50.030
<v Speaker 2>but you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see that the goal there,</v>

612
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:53.270
<v Speaker 2>which is to get out of the apartment </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you die with some things of value</v>

613
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.650
<v Speaker 2>to what you see and you may object.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't actually see that.</v>

614
00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

615
00:33:59.061 --> 00:34:01.310
<v Speaker 2>you would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're looking at a bowl of fruit and</v>

616
00:34:01.311 --> 00:34:03.920
<v Speaker 2>it has three bananas and two apples in </v>
<v Speaker 2>an orange unit.</v>

617
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.070
<v Speaker 2>And I asked you what that is and you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bowl of fruit.</v>

618
00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Why you see his fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not two apples and whatever.</v>

619
00:34:10.521 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned two bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two apples and the peach.</v>

620
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.550
<v Speaker 2>You see fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see what you categorize or</v>

621
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:19.123
<v Speaker 4>opposite.</v>

622
00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.173
<v Speaker 2>You categorize when you see she moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>along from where you are to where you </v>

623
00:34:23.931 --> 00:34:24.764
<v Speaker 2>want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you parse the world up into useful </v>

624
00:34:27.171 --> 00:34:28.850
<v Speaker 2>things that get you to where you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

625
00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:29.684
<v Speaker 2>And knowing things that don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if everything works out fine while </v>

626
00:34:35.111 --> 00:34:37.260
<v Speaker 2>you get here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have a new one.</v>

627
00:34:37.261 --> 00:34:38.094
<v Speaker 2>If he's</v>

628
00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.380
<v Speaker 2>but there's a catch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the catch.</v>

629
00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.870
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hardly see anything that's there.</v>

630
00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:51.243
<v Speaker 2>You know you're simplifying things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everything that you don't see is </v>

631
00:34:53.231 --> 00:34:54.064
<v Speaker 2>still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you're inhabiting this </v>

632
00:34:56.411 --> 00:35:01.411
<v Speaker 2>little sort of simplified and somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfected domain all the time.</v>

633
00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 2>It's wandering around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

634
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:04.960
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of what you inhabit.</v>

635
00:35:04.961 --> 00:35:06.380
<v Speaker 2>But the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is,</v>

636
00:35:06.381 --> 00:35:10.810
<v Speaker 2>is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've often thought about the story of in</v>

637
00:35:10.811 --> 00:35:11.644
<v Speaker 2>Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the story of Adam and eve in </v>

638
00:35:12.851 --> 00:35:14.650
<v Speaker 2>that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what you have there is a kind of</v>

639
00:35:14.651 --> 00:35:17.170
<v Speaker 2>paradise where everything's really going</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

640
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:18.243
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've all lived in a pair of dice like </v>

641
00:35:19.181 --> 00:35:21.040
<v Speaker 2>that when things were going really well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

642
00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.410
<v Speaker 2>But there's always snakes in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradises.</v>

643
00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.460
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are going well,</v>

644
00:35:27.461 --> 00:35:28.294
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean you've accounted for </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and you can't account for </v>

645
00:35:31.601 --> 00:35:32.260
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

646
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.530
<v Speaker 2>So there's always something lurking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around from underneath.</v>

647
00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:36.663
<v Speaker 2>And if you go and mess with thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then all hell breaks loose and you </v>

648
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:41.791
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

649
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:43.230
<v Speaker 2>has that ever happened to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

650
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:44.064
<v Speaker 2>sure happens to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a relationship and the </v>

651
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:48.900
<v Speaker 2>person you're having a relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheats on you,</v>

652
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.590
<v Speaker 2>that's a snake for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens to you.</v>

653
00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:55.860
<v Speaker 2>If you're well and then you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens to you if you're dependent on</v>

654
00:35:55.861 --> 00:35:58.080
<v Speaker 2>a family member and they'd die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

655
00:35:58.081 --> 00:36:03.060
<v Speaker 2>It's the unrevealed complexity of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that manifests itself.</v>

656
00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly that wreaks havoc on our little</v>
<v Speaker 2>paradises.</v>

657
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're so damn curious,</v>

658
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:11.820
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just can't leave well enough alone.</v>

659
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.650
<v Speaker 2>That's human beings for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

660
00:36:13.651 --> 00:36:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Just like the Catholics say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heritable sit,</v>

661
00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:17.453
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put people into paradise and you </v>

662
00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:21.480
<v Speaker 2>tell them not to do one thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can bloody well be sugar.</v>

663
00:36:21.481 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do because we're so curious.</v>

664
00:36:24.211 --> 00:36:25.044
<v Speaker 2>We cannot leave things a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're always unraveling sweaters and </v>

665
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.420
<v Speaker 2>looking at things we're not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at.</v>

666
00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.250
<v Speaker 2>So on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

667
00:36:32.251 --> 00:36:35.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a great thing and we learned a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we pay a big price for it.</v>

668
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.230
<v Speaker 2>The question is</v>

669
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.460
<v Speaker 2>what do you look at when you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you see?</v>

670
00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:46.880
<v Speaker 2>What is it that you see when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what you see?</v>

671
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:48.710
<v Speaker 2>So think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very,</v>

672
00:36:48.711 --> 00:36:53.120
<v Speaker 2>very hard thing to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when the towers fell?</v>

673
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.600
<v Speaker 2>What did you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you say,</v>

674
00:36:56.601 --> 00:36:57.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the towers fall and I said,</v>

675
00:36:57.951 --> 00:36:58.221
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

676
00:36:58.221 --> 00:37:00.800
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If all you saw was that the towers fell,</v>

677
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:02.720
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 types.</v>

678
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.550
<v Speaker 2>Why did you have to look at it 50 times </v>
<v Speaker 2>or cause you couldn't believe it?</v>

679
00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:08.893
<v Speaker 2>What did that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It meant that the event was so complex </v>

680
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:15.320
<v Speaker 2>that you couldn't perceive it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What fell?</v>

681
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:17.803
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monetary system in the u s the </v>

682
00:37:19.851 --> 00:37:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Western economy,</v>

683
00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.660
<v Speaker 2>it was the transformation of the Cold </v>
<v Speaker 2>War,</v>

684
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a new paradigm.</v>

685
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:30.783
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a battle between good and evil </v>

686
00:37:32.511 --> 00:37:34.460
<v Speaker 2>that popped up pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the next day,</v>

687
00:37:34.461 --> 00:37:35.294
<v Speaker 2>pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to look at it over and over and </v>

688
00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:39.020
<v Speaker 2>over and over because he didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you were seeing.</v>

689
00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.570
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know how to see what you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing and you think,</v>

690
00:37:41.571 --> 00:37:42.830
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't quite get that.</v>

691
00:37:42.831 --> 00:37:43.880
<v Speaker 2>And then I would think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

692
00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.240
<v Speaker 2>when you're driving your car and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks down,</v>

693
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.100
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it breaks down?</v>

694
00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:50.443
<v Speaker 2>And you might say it's a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say if you persist on </v>

695
00:37:53.301 --> 00:37:55.640
<v Speaker 2>thinking that that thing that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving as a car,</v>

696
00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.653
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustration because what it is now is a </v>

697
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:04.010
<v Speaker 2>very complex assemblage of parts you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>

698
00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.550
<v Speaker 2>One of which is key to transforming it </v>
<v Speaker 2>back into a car.</v>

699
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:08.743
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens is that it reveals </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself suddenly as a consequence of its </v>

700
00:38:12.501 --> 00:38:13.334
<v Speaker 2>noncompliance with your wishes as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex structured entity that it </v>

701
00:38:16.941 --> 00:38:17.774
<v Speaker 2>actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to go pay a mechanic because </v>

702
00:38:20.601 --> 00:38:21.434
<v Speaker 2>the mechanic knows the magic sequence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will turn this intransigent bit of </v>

703
00:38:25.251 --> 00:38:26.084
<v Speaker 2>complex junk back into the simple thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can drive to work well and </v>

704
00:38:29.781 --> 00:38:31.500
<v Speaker 2>you'll pay for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

705
00:38:31.501 --> 00:38:32.334
<v Speaker 2>Because it's valuable because for you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get that thing back to being in a car </v>

706
00:38:36.071 --> 00:38:36.904
<v Speaker 2>and take you maybe 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause what do you know near Bro Likely </v>

707
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:43.960
<v Speaker 2>to make it worse than mechanical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just still tap and you'll say,</v>

708
00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 2>well you've charged me $500 for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he'll say,</v>

709
00:38:46.601 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a savings for you,</v>

710
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know where to tap.</v>

711
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.240
<v Speaker 2>So long trip,</v>

712
00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.193
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

713
00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.600
<v Speaker 2>what do you see when you don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>to seek?</v>

714
00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:02.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think music is about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'll tell you why.</v>

715
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.883
<v Speaker 2>So what music does think of Bach?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what he does is he takes this </v>

716
00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:12.770
<v Speaker 2>temporal span and then he builds these </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex patterns across it,</v>

717
00:39:12.771 --> 00:39:14.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of the patterns like,</v>

718
00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.153
<v Speaker 2>and some of them go like this and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them go like this and there's a </v>

719
00:39:18.741 --> 00:39:21.590
<v Speaker 2>pattern here in a pattern here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a pattern here and pattern there.</v>

720
00:39:21.591 --> 00:39:24.650
<v Speaker 2>And some of them are going backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the guy's complicated,</v>

721
00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.650
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

722
00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:27.943
<v Speaker 2>it's stunning actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually wrote a song that you can </v>

723
00:39:29.451 --> 00:39:31.820
<v Speaker 2>play upside down and backwards and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same song,</v>

724
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.550
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>

725
00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Bach wrote so much music that it would </v>
<v Speaker 2>take a talented copyist,</v>

726
00:39:39.411 --> 00:39:40.244
<v Speaker 2>someone who just copies music 40 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>of eight hour days just to transcribe </v>

727
00:39:43.221 --> 00:39:44.054
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

728
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:45.423
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

729
00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Bach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he presents you with this landscape.</v>

730
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.033
<v Speaker 2>It's an abstracted landscape of what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>landscape says is look at all the cool </v>

731
00:39:53.131 --> 00:39:56.160
<v Speaker 2>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just layers and layers of them.</v>

732
00:39:56.161 --> 00:39:58.370
<v Speaker 2>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he asks your perceptual system,</v>

733
00:39:58.371 --> 00:39:59.970
<v Speaker 2>it says here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus on this one.</v>

734
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:02.130
<v Speaker 2>There's this little interesting thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

735
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.370
<v Speaker 2>It's partly patterned and predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not too much.</v>

736
00:40:05.371 --> 00:40:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Cause then it's like a computer road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's patterned and predictable,</v>

737
00:40:08.281 --> 00:40:10.320
<v Speaker 2>but it has this little edge of novelty </v>
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>

738
00:40:10.321 --> 00:40:11.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

739
00:40:11.641 --> 00:40:14.850
<v Speaker 2>That novelty keeps you dripped and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can pick out the patterns.</v>

740
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.270
<v Speaker 2>It's as if you're turning them into </v>
<v Speaker 2>auditory objects on with Bach,</v>

741
00:40:18.271 --> 00:40:20.190
<v Speaker 2>you can do that at 10 levels at the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

742
00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:24.390
<v Speaker 2>It's an an analog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an analog of the real world and you</v>

743
00:40:24.391 --> 00:40:25.224
<v Speaker 2>get that as soon as you stopped thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the real world as a simple place of </v>

744
00:40:27.571 --> 00:40:29.010
<v Speaker 2>objects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

745
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.053
<v Speaker 2>it's a complex place of patterns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those patterns shift and change with </v>

746
00:40:34.021 --> 00:40:34.854
<v Speaker 2>different in different situations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>with different temporal frames of </v>

747
00:40:37.381 --> 00:40:38.040
<v Speaker 2>reference.</v>

748
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's what music is telling you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's so deeply meaningful.</v>

749
00:40:41.671 --> 00:40:42.504
<v Speaker 2>Cause Music says to you here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually the structure of the </v>

750
00:40:44.431 --> 00:40:48.630
<v Speaker 2>world beyond your simple perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the structure of the world.</v>

751
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Well that's kind of what I figured out </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was making this thing,</v>

752
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:56.700
<v Speaker 2>why I wanted it to kind of rotate a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's successful.</v>

753
00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:02.220
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a cube that said on edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the edge of the cute there.</v>

754
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:04.103
<v Speaker 2>And so you can see into the cube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a spiral at the same time and then </v>

755
00:41:07.291 --> 00:41:08.124
<v Speaker 2>it's a tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's imagine a tunnel that's going back </v>

756
00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:13.830
<v Speaker 2>to a point and it's fragmented into </v>
<v Speaker 2>these four things here.</v>

757
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.233
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like things are bursting out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the middle of this tunnel and that </v>

758
00:41:18.571 --> 00:41:19.860
<v Speaker 2>that's what music is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

759
00:41:19.861 --> 00:41:24.861
<v Speaker 2>There's this just constant onslaught of </v>
<v Speaker 2>new complex pattern forms.</v>

760
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

761
00:41:27.211 --> 00:41:28.670
<v Speaker 2>It means something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen to music things.</v>

762
00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.720
<v Speaker 2>This means something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means something.</v>

763
00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:33.620
<v Speaker 2>I can feel it like I can experience it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I say,</v>

764
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:34.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you experience it,</v>

765
00:41:34.641 --> 00:41:36.860
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How will you might think,</v>

766
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meaning of music isn't real.</v>

767
00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what you mean,</v>

768
00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on your presuppositions.</v>

769
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:46.490
<v Speaker 2>I think what means things is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this old idea,</v>

770
00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:48.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a funny little turn of phrase,</v>

771
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:50.390
<v Speaker 2>but I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Materialists,</v>

772
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:52.100
<v Speaker 2>they think the world's made out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>

773
00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:53.901
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

774
00:41:53.901 --> 00:41:56.270
<v Speaker 2>this perspective isn't predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea.</v>

775
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:57.403
<v Speaker 2>This perspective is predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that reality is made out of what </v>

776
00:42:01.011 --> 00:42:04.280
<v Speaker 2>matters and music expresses what </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters.</v>

777
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you think,</v>

778
00:42:06.471 --> 00:42:08.450
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there any reason to think that way?</v>

779
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.231
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say,</v>

780
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:10.064
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldier Nansen he said it's taking a </v>

781
00:42:12.741 --> 00:42:16.160
<v Speaker 2>page from Dostoyevsky said beauty will </v>
<v Speaker 2>save the world.</v>

782
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.593
<v Speaker 2>So funny thing a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Solzhenitsyn is actually one of </v>

783
00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:23.060
<v Speaker 2>the people who helped save the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>because his truth was at least in part,</v>

784
00:42:23.061 --> 00:42:26.120
<v Speaker 2>responsible for knocking out material in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union.</v>

785
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.493
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe he's someone worth listening </v>

786
00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:29.310
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

787
00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.730
<v Speaker 2>what's meaning worth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

788
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.350
<v Speaker 2>if you listen to music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

789
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.710
<v Speaker 2>you can experience what music does to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

790
00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:39.740
<v Speaker 2>It's direct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in your own experiential field.</v>

791
00:42:39.741 --> 00:42:40.574
<v Speaker 2>The problem is you can't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantify or qualify it by referring to </v>

792
00:42:44.031 --> 00:42:45.890
<v Speaker 2>other people cause it's a personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

793
00:42:45.891 --> 00:42:46.724
<v Speaker 2>But just because it's a personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience doesn't mean it isn't real </v>

794
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:54.670
<v Speaker 2>pains real or isn't it by Italia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're in enough pain,</v>

795
00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be rationally </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguing about that point.</v>

796
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have an idea in our culture that it's</v>

797
00:43:02.301 --> 00:43:06.260
<v Speaker 2>what we know that saves us in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

798
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:11.740
<v Speaker 2>that that keeps us able to cope with all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the pressures of being alive.</v>

799
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:14.510
<v Speaker 2>And that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

800
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.060
<v Speaker 2>what we do is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very useful,</v>

801
00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:21.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's not useful enough because no </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter how much you know,</v>

802
00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.190
<v Speaker 2>there are certain problems that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>still have and they're,</v>

803
00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.143
<v Speaker 2>they're eternal problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are the problems that you're </v>

804
00:43:28.971 --> 00:43:32.690
<v Speaker 2>fragile and all sorts of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally fragile,</v>

805
00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:34.740
<v Speaker 2>physically fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally fragile,</v>

806
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:35.923
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not as good looking as you might </v>

807
00:43:37.071 --> 00:43:38.050
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

808
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.700
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no matter how much you know,</v>

809
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:41.803
<v Speaker 2>none of that's really going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you find cold comfort in </v>

810
00:43:45.291 --> 00:43:48.320
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and I'm not putting down </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

811
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Knowledge is a great thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not enough.</v>

812
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.540
<v Speaker 2>And so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

813
00:43:53.541 --> 00:43:54.374
<v Speaker 2>what do you have except what you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say you have what you </v>

814
00:43:57.501 --> 00:43:59.660
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of that,</v>

815
00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.093
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to run out of what </v>

816
00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:04.400
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say,</v>

817
00:44:04.401 --> 00:44:09.401
<v Speaker 2>well then maybe what makes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between having a life that is</v>

818
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:14.980
<v Speaker 2>acceptable and and appropriate and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's resentful and,</v>

819
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:17.383
<v Speaker 2>and full of hatred is what sort of real </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship you establish with what it </v>

820
00:44:23.421 --> 00:44:24.590
<v Speaker 2>is that you don't know.</v>

821
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:27.463
<v Speaker 2>There's always more to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see in in fairy tales and </v>

822
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:35.310
<v Speaker 2>religious mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are always exhorted to be humble.</v>

823
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:38.040
<v Speaker 2>It's very annoying thing to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

824
00:44:38.041 --> 00:44:41.370
<v Speaker 2>But there's a funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a twist on that.</v>

825
00:44:41.371 --> 00:44:42.204
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very interesting notion because </v>

826
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.233
<v Speaker 2>the humble person isn't exactly meek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The humble person is someone who knows </v>

827
00:44:49.471 --> 00:44:50.304
<v Speaker 2>that the expanse of what they don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>supersedes the expanse of what they do </v>

828
00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:55.134
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that it's in the encounter with </v>

829
00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.640
<v Speaker 2>what's not known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all the real information,</v>

830
00:44:59.641 --> 00:45:02.370
<v Speaker 2>that's where all the action takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you kind of know that a,</v>

831
00:45:02.371 --> 00:45:04.890
<v Speaker 2>because when you're really interested in</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and it grips you,</v>

832
00:45:04.891 --> 00:45:05.724
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right on the edge of where all </v>

833
00:45:06.421 --> 00:45:07.740
<v Speaker 2>the information is coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

834
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:09.960
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes it exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know something,</v>

835
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:11.550
<v Speaker 2>but you're on the trail or something you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know,</v>

836
00:45:11.551 --> 00:45:12.384
<v Speaker 2>and that really grips you and it should </v>
<v Speaker 2>grip you because that's where you're </v>

837
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:16.170
<v Speaker 2>getting all the new information.</v>

838
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.200
<v Speaker 2>And I think what music does as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned,</v>

839
00:45:19.201 --> 00:45:21.810
<v Speaker 2>is it speaks to us about what we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

840
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:22.801
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

841
00:45:22.801 --> 00:45:23.634
<v Speaker 2>there's outside of our presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this domain that that is </v>

842
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:28.703
<v Speaker 2>constantly patterned and informative and</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful and if you're open to it in </v>

843
00:45:33.991 --> 00:45:34.824
<v Speaker 2>the appropriate way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to pay attention to the </v>

844
00:45:36.271 --> 00:45:37.104
<v Speaker 2>limitations of your knowledge and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch what you're doing and more than a </v>

845
00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:43.560
<v Speaker 2>merely intellectual sense that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown pattern,</v>

846
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:47.400
<v Speaker 2>expats is richly informative events </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustain it.</v>

847
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:51.120
<v Speaker 2>And I think that every time you listen </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a piece of music and it grabs you,</v>

848
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.193
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also think you know that now you </v>

849
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:56.124
<v Speaker 2>don't know what to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's lots of things you don't </v>

850
00:45:58.081 --> 00:45:58.914
<v Speaker 2>know to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how to keep your heart </v>

851
00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:02.370
<v Speaker 2>beating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how to walk.</v>

852
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean the list of things you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very long list.</v>

853
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.790
<v Speaker 2>And the mere fact that you don't know it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean that it isn't true.</v>

854
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Well then you ask yourself with regards </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your relationship with something like</v>

855
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:17.750
<v Speaker 2>music is what it says real or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say like pain.</v>

856
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.500
<v Speaker 2>What music tells you is so real that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes other things that are real seem to</v>

857
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:23.334
<v Speaker 2>pale in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you know I like music a lot so </v>

858
00:46:27.001 --> 00:46:30.060
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's an experience that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiosyncratic to me.</v>

859
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.073
<v Speaker 2>But then you have to explain I suppose </v>
<v Speaker 2>why music has had such a powerful grip </v>

860
00:46:34.471 --> 00:46:35.304
<v Speaker 2>on our culture or it's funny cause I </v>
<v Speaker 2>read a book on evolutionary psychology </v>

861
00:46:40.651 --> 00:46:44.190
<v Speaker 2>while ago written by Steven Pinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big thick book.</v>

862
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:48.870
<v Speaker 2>It was like one little thin chapter at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end devoted to aesthetics,</v>

863
00:46:48.871 --> 00:46:52.950
<v Speaker 2>music and religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought that's pretty interesting.</v>

864
00:46:52.951 --> 00:46:57.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because for some people like aesthetics,</v>

865
00:46:57.001 --> 00:46:57.834
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's say philosophy is like this </v>

866
00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:04.050
<v Speaker 2>much of the book with the rest of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>being this much and</v>

867
00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:06.873
<v Speaker 2>our mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really interested in debating </v>

868
00:47:08.051 --> 00:47:08.884
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I am interested more in saying is </v>

869
00:47:11.441 --> 00:47:12.274
<v Speaker 2>that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a way to understand what it is </v>

870
00:47:16.891 --> 00:47:17.724
<v Speaker 2>that our aesthetic experiences tell us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they tell us isn't in the </v>

871
00:47:22.141 --> 00:47:22.974
<v Speaker 2>language that we normally speak and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>language that aesthetics toxin has </v>

872
00:47:28.051 --> 00:47:31.420
<v Speaker 2>something genuine to offer us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not HEPA.</v>

873
00:47:31.421 --> 00:47:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not derivative.</v>

874
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:37.090
<v Speaker 2>It's not secondary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fundamental and primary.</v>

875
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.910
<v Speaker 2>It's about what things mean and how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>

876
00:47:39.911 --> 00:47:40.744
<v Speaker 2>And for us that's a big deal because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to know how to act and the arts </v>

877
00:47:44.681 --> 00:47:47.890
<v Speaker 2>tell us that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And music tells us that in the most sort</v>

878
00:47:47.891 --> 00:47:49.120
<v Speaker 2>of comprehensive and</v>

879
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:54.450
<v Speaker 2>the most comprehensive and abstract way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

880
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:55.650
<v Speaker 2>it's still grips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You though.</v>

881
00:47:55.651 --> 00:47:57.510
<v Speaker 2>It grips your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even it makes you move.</v>

882
00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.680
<v Speaker 2>It's abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

883
00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.720
<v Speaker 2>it's concrete at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can't argue it away.</v>

884
00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:05.070
<v Speaker 2>If you experience it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see exactly what it means.</v>

885
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think that when you listen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>

886
00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:12.600
<v Speaker 2>what you experience is what you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience in relationship to reality.</v>

887
00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.793
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's that observation that </v>
<v Speaker 2>does for you what it is that music does </v>

888
00:48:18.001 --> 00:48:19.950
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all great art does that.</v>

889
00:48:19.951 --> 00:48:23.460
<v Speaker 2>And all great literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say there's no reason not to</v>

890
00:48:23.461 --> 00:48:24.330
<v Speaker 2>assume it's real.</v>

891
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.033
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

892
00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Music could be the fruit of love.</v>

893
00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:37.573
<v Speaker 2>Play on according to Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>existence is made up of infinite </v>

894
00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:47.180
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical landscapes of patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is only through focusing the lens</v>

895
00:48:47.181 --> 00:48:48.014
<v Speaker 2>of your perception that you actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>make any sense of existence at all the </v>

896
00:48:51.411 --> 00:48:52.244
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you look at the world is guided by </v>

897
00:48:53.811 --> 00:48:56.170
<v Speaker 2>your wants and the way that the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks at you.</v>

898
00:48:56.171 --> 00:48:57.890
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what you.</v>
