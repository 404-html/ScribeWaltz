1
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm here today in Manhattan talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Jonathan Heit,</v>

2
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>who's a professor at Nyu and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here for a bunch of reasons.</v>

3
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan is an extremely interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>researcher.</v>

4
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>I've been following his work on disgust </v>
<v Speaker 1>and political belief for literally for </v>

5
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.641
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the first people who </v>

6
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:35.641
<v Speaker 1>started to do serious research on </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>

7
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>which is its own emotional system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore very much worth attending to,</v>

8
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also have some other interests in</v>

9
00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:42.370
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan also started this institute </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Heterodox Academy,</v>

11
00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:50.830
<v Speaker 1>which is attempting to bring back a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable diversity of views or what he</v>

12
00:00:50.831 --> 00:00:55.831
<v Speaker 1>regards as a reasonable diversity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>views to university faculty on campuses </v>

13
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:56.710
<v Speaker 1>and discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

14
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I first met Jonathan.</v>

15
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be just about 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

16
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five years ago.</v>

17
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.710
<v Speaker 2>20 14?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

18
00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:07.780
<v Speaker 2>20 site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 1994.</v>

19
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in 1994.</v>

20
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

21
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

22
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:12.800
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you came to do a job talk at Harvard too</v>

23
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>for an assistant professorship position </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd been aware of your work on </v>

24
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.611
<v Speaker 1>disgust then and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and agitated hard for them to hire you </v>

25
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>because I thought it was of great </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance,</v>

26
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:25.700
<v Speaker 1>which turned out to be exactly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you remember about that?</v>

27
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.730
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was so excited to have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview at Harvard.</v>

28
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 2>It was my only interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get that job.</v>

29
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:36.221
<v Speaker 2>I had no job for the following year and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a very strange day in which I </v>

30
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:39.290
<v Speaker 2>didn't feel particularly welcome or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted.</v>

31
00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:44.291
<v Speaker 2>And then I had my session with you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which he was this guy who was had,</v>

32
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 2>he actually got a job at Harvard and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was studying young,</v>

33
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:54.131
<v Speaker 2>which is like almost taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was talking about dreams and </v>

34
00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 2>creativity and so I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the really bright.</v>

35
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:59.450
<v Speaker 2>That was the bright memory of the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>was our hour long conversation.</v>

36
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I was also really interested at the</v>

37
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

38
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>now in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the biological basis of behavior.</v>

39
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

40
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the,</v>

41
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the relationship between fundamental </v>

42
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.041
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems and thought because</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously our thought is grounded in </v>

43
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:17.930
<v Speaker 1>fundamental motivational systems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your work on disgust,</v>

44
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:19.940
<v Speaker 1>which maybe you can tell the viewers a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit about,</v>

45
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.360
<v Speaker 1>was really interesting to me because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was an emotional system that</v>

46
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 2>hadn't been studied much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

47
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:30.201
<v Speaker 2>you were really one of the pioneers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychological study of discuss what </v>

48
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:34.180
<v Speaker 2>other way to explain it is that Paul </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ross and my advisor at Penn is the </v>

49
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.911
<v Speaker 2>pioneer in this study of disgust and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd studied it as a food related </v>

50
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 2>emotion and he'd written a bit about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a moral emotion.</v>

51
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.390
<v Speaker 2>And I was a graduate student at Penn and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was interested in morality and I was </v>

52
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:47.980
<v Speaker 2>reading the Bible and I was reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

53
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anthropological accounts of different </v>

54
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.891
<v Speaker 2>countries and different cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the time morality was all about </v>

55
00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:58.970
<v Speaker 2>reasoning about harm rights and justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Lawrence Kohlberg was the leading </v>

56
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 2>figure in the field and because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at morality cross cultures,</v>

57
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you look across cultures,</v>

58
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 2>it's not just about fairness and harmon </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

59
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:12.451
<v Speaker 2>It's about menstruation and food taboos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and skin lesions and it's very physical </v>

60
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 2>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

61
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

62
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Why does so many societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it like the normal default way of</v>

63
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 2>being is to somehow bring the body into </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality?</v>

64
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:26.251
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I just happened to be at Penn </v>

65
00:03:26.251 --> 00:03:29.011
<v Speaker 2>where the world's expert in disgust was </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I went to talk to them and that </v>

66
00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 2>started one of the best collaborations </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my life.</v>

67
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.400
<v Speaker 2>And what it led to is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a broadening of the,</v>

68
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 2>of the moral domain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically there's a sort of a western,</v>

69
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 2>a secular approach you see in western </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophers.</v>

70
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Either morality is about harm and </v>
<v Speaker 2>utilitarianism and it's minimize harm or</v>

71
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:48.900
<v Speaker 2>it's about rights and principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.940
<v Speaker 2>manual con and a much better way </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically I think about morality </v>

73
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 2>is virtue ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a lot of stuff.</v>

74
00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 2>It's just we have just a lot of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we judge on and this led me </v>

75
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.501
<v Speaker 2>eventually to realize that people on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left and people on the right care about </v>

76
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 2>different stuff.</v>

77
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Everybody cares about harm and fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the stuff about keeping boundaries </v>

78
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:13.020
<v Speaker 2>around the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build a wall,</v>

79
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 2>protect the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold the group together,</v>

80
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.370
<v Speaker 2>hate traders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

81
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody can do that,</v>

82
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 2>but right wing morality builds on these </v>
<v Speaker 2>additional additional foundations of </v>

83
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.280
<v Speaker 2>these additional motions and foundations</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that work on disgust that I was just </v>

84
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.451
<v Speaker 2>beginning to talk about them when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>first met in 1994 lead eventually to </v>

85
00:04:33.451 --> 00:04:35.550
<v Speaker 2>what we now call moral foundations </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory and with my,</v>

86
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 2>with that five or six colleagues that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to your morals.org,</v>

87
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take our tests,</v>

88
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:42.810
<v Speaker 2>you can learn all about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

89
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.690
<v Speaker 2>but it led to the perspective that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately was,</v>

90
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.940
<v Speaker 2>I think the right perspective as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural war was heating up and as left </v>

91
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.991
<v Speaker 2>and right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're essentially becoming like </v>

92
00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:54.991
<v Speaker 2>different countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different cultures.</v>

93
00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:59.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not obvious on first </v>

94
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.670
<v Speaker 1>consideration why discussed would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral emotion.</v>

95
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the work that's done that's </v>

96
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.761
<v Speaker 1>outside of the disgust realm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say is predicated on the </v>

97
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:11.090
<v Speaker 1>assumption that the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives in particular,</v>

98
00:05:11.091 --> 00:05:16.091
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps people who are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian and general draw </v>

99
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:18.950
<v Speaker 1>boundaries around their territories </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're afraid of the other,</v>

100
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't really how it plays out as </v>

101
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because conservatives,</v>

102
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.901
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are less neurotic than treat in the big </v>

103
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:28.901
<v Speaker 1>five traits sense than liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's a,</v>

104
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:33.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a minor difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the disgust issue seems to be </v>

105
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.450
<v Speaker 1>particularly relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

106
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.890
<v Speaker 1>So can you tell us a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>why disgust per se?</v>

107
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives are a little less </v>

108
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.620
<v Speaker 2>neurotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also add,</v>

109
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.730
<v Speaker 2>if you do very low level perceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments,</v>

110
00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:46.500
<v Speaker 2>just like a puff of white noise in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ear.</v>

111
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.120
<v Speaker 2>People who react more strongly to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>to any sort of very low level threat are</v>

112
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:53.190
<v Speaker 2>more likely to vote Republican in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

113
00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:53.910
<v Speaker 2>So they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

114
00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:58.911
<v Speaker 2>there are all these interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality differences that lead to </v>

115
00:05:58.911 --> 00:05:58.911
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as for why discussed,</v>

116
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

117
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Durkheimian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say I love the,</v>

118
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sociologists,</v>

119
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Emile Durkheim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm also,</v>

120
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm a social psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm always thinking not about people </v>

121
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 2>as individual utility maximizers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people as members of social groups,</v>

122
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.800
<v Speaker 2>people who are totally focused on </v>
<v Speaker 2>belonging in their social groups and </v>

123
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 2>people who have some pro social motives </v>
<v Speaker 2>about keeping the group together,</v>

124
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 2>about doing things that are good for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

125
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 2>So as I tried to argue in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the righteous mind,</v>

126
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.920
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're selfish.</v>

127
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.920
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt that we often will do </v>
<v Speaker 2>things to advance our own self interest </v>

128
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 2>at the expense of others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're also really groupish,</v>

129
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.930
<v Speaker 2>which means we'll do all sorts of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>to advance our group at the expense of </v>

130
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

131
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 2>we're tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We evolved as a tribal species and we're</v>

132
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have all this software.</v>

133
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

134
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these predispositions,</v>

135
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 2>these mental predispositions for life </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

136
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 2>in tribes that are battling other </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribes.</v>

137
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it comes out so easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the way boys organized </v>

138
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.260
<v Speaker 2>themselves when they get a fraternity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

139
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.490
<v Speaker 2>the hazing rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the weights,</v>

140
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 2>especially clear in boys the way street </v>
<v Speaker 2>gangs organized themselves,</v>

141
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 2>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribalism is a little different.</v>

142
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say this,</v>

143
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 2>and that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

144
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 2>I love the [inaudible] and approach of </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypes or something.</v>

145
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 2>There's just this weird stuff that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pan human,</v>

146
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 2>even if it comes out slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently around the world,</v>

147
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.580
<v Speaker 2>there really is a human nature and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes complete with a whole bunch of </v>

148
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.580
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predesigned idea.</v>

149
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 3>So there was a new article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was published in nature.</v>

150
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to find the link for it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a year old,</v>

151
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

152
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.480
<v Speaker 3>that was based on high resolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>imaging of neuronal connections.</v>

153
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 3>It's actually reviewed and Kurt Selles </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kurzweil's book,</v>

154
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.610
<v Speaker 3>how to build a mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the name of it.</v>

155
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it turns out that the Cortex is </v>

156
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.341
<v Speaker 3>made out of these columnar structures </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are pre-organized units of neurons </v>

157
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:53.550
<v Speaker 3>and they're replicated across the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>cortex.</v>

158
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.360
<v Speaker 3>Basically the same structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like the,</v>

159
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.130
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the older,</v>

160
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:03.131
<v Speaker 3>let's say connectionist idea was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurons that fire together wire </v>

161
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:03.131
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

162
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:07.691
<v Speaker 3>That that's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course that's pretty standard </v>

163
00:08:07.691 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 3>neurology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the columns are already prewired.</v>

164
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 3>So it's actually columns that fire </v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

165
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 3>wire together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

166
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 3>but there's even more with the high </v>
<v Speaker 3>resolution scanning.</v>

167
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.690
<v Speaker 3>So it turns out that underneath the </v>
<v Speaker 3>columnar structure,</v>

168
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 3>there are these prebuilt highways that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are connected,</v>

169
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 3>connective tissue that are pre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pre prepared.</v>

170
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.890
<v Speaker 3>So the columns have the option to </v>
<v Speaker 3>connect to the,</v>

171
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.950
<v Speaker 3>to the underlying highway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that highway can connect other </v>

172
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.831
<v Speaker 3>columns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's as if in implicit in the brain </v>

173
00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 3>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is at the cortical level,</v>

174
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 3>say nothing of subcortical organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's already preexistent,</v>

175
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

176
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.740
<v Speaker 3>likelihoods that certain neurons will </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire wire together.</v>

177
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

178
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:51.371
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what else is cool is that this is </v>

179
00:08:51.371 --> 00:08:52.850
<v Speaker 3>actually architecturally quite a </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular.</v>

180
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.060
<v Speaker 3>So they found that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these superhighways arranged in lines </v>

181
00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:58.060
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

182
00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in,</v>

183
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.430
<v Speaker 3>at right angles to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's almost like a three dimensional </v>

184
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 3>structure of why your cubes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>underlies the neuronal structure.</v>

185
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.370
<v Speaker 3>So that's a neurological evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the architects.</v>

186
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Cool idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just explain to explain to the </v>

187
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 2>viewers here why this isn't just some </v>
<v Speaker 2>like psychological geek conversation.</v>

188
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
<v Speaker 2>This is actually really relevant to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the things that we'll be talking </v>

189
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.821
<v Speaker 2>about that your audience product cares </v>
<v Speaker 2>about because one of the most contested </v>

190
00:09:22.821 --> 00:09:26.661
<v Speaker 2>ideas and the social sciences is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of uniqueness and the idea is what </v>

191
00:09:26.661 --> 00:09:28.500
<v Speaker 2>if something has a need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it can't.</v>

192
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 2>It can't vary across societies and if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>varies across societies then it's not an</v>

193
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:36.950
<v Speaker 2>eight and if gender varies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if masculinity or femininity vary across</v>

194
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 2>society is not innate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's socially constructed,</v>

195
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 2>but that's the wrong understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintenance.</v>

196
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.970
<v Speaker 2>The definition that I use comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary.</v>

197
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Marcus was actually neuroscientist here </v>
<v Speaker 2>at Nyu.</v>

198
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:51.891
<v Speaker 2>He says innate doesn't mean hardwired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's almost nothing interesting </v>

199
00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:55.581
<v Speaker 2>that's hardwired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Innate means structured in advance of </v>

200
00:09:55.581 --> 00:09:58.971
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that experience can still revise it </v>

201
00:09:58.971 --> 00:10:01.110
<v Speaker 2>and boy does that work for gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for almost everything,</v>

202
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 2>for almost everything that we're not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>blank slate about anything.</v>

203
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.360
<v Speaker 2>And something I used to tell my students</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Uva I taught at Uva for 16 years is,</v>

204
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's a social construction,</v>

205
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.880
<v Speaker 2>masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>femininity,</v>

206
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.370
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun,</v>

207
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.900
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

208
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:24.020
<v Speaker 2>There's a social construction for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't find a society that doesn't have </v>

209
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.051
<v Speaker 2>thoughts about these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that societies have social </v>

210
00:10:27.051 --> 00:10:31.311
<v Speaker 2>constructions tells us nothing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether there's not also an underlying </v>

211
00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:33.650
<v Speaker 2>biological reality and in almost all </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases there.</v>

212
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 3>Well otherwise we wouldn't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate,</v>

213
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:38.220
<v Speaker 3>which is one of Eo Wilson's comments </v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

214
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 3>When Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

215
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 3>the entomologist who studied dance at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Harvard and also wrote a number of books</v>

216
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:45.960
<v Speaker 3>about sociobiology that got him in </v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble with the radical leftists.</v>

217
00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 3>And he said even if we could communicate</v>
<v Speaker 3>with ants,</v>

218
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:53.691
<v Speaker 3>there'd be nothing to say to each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're fundamental mode of </v>

219
00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:57.560
<v Speaker 3>being in the world is based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivations and interests that are so </v>

220
00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.500
<v Speaker 3>different from ours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there wouldn't be any structure for</v>

221
00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:03.501
<v Speaker 3>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can kind of tell that with </v>

222
00:11:03.501 --> 00:11:03.501
<v Speaker 3>regards to the animals that we make </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends with,</v>

223
00:11:03.501 --> 00:11:08.301
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're much more likely to make friends </v>

224
00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:08.940
<v Speaker 3>with animals who has a who have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental biological and social nature</v>

225
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:13.941
<v Speaker 3>that's very close to ours like dogs </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we can basically speak their </v>

226
00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 3>language even though not completely</v>

227
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.980
<v Speaker 2>a mammo language of love and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I miss you and I want to play with you.</v>

228
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

229
00:11:19.791 --> 00:11:20.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

230
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.250
<v Speaker 2>And that bonding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

231
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.750
<v Speaker 2>so back to discuss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to discuss.</v>

232
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:29.050
<v Speaker 2>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fundamental thing that I learned </v>

233
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.770
<v Speaker 2>from Paul Rosin is to see us as these </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing omnivores.</v>

234
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.430
<v Speaker 2>This is part of our survival strategy </v>
<v Speaker 2>even more than other other apes.</v>

235
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.480
<v Speaker 2>We are just brilliant omnivores and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the Omnivore's dilemma,</v>

236
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.900
<v Speaker 2>which is we've got to be interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of new stuff.</v>

237
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.710
<v Speaker 2>We're not tied to one place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can roam onto a whole new continent.</v>

238
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.280
<v Speaker 2>So we were interested in stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but stuff has all kinds of toxins and </v>

239
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.880
<v Speaker 2>microbes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to be careful about that.</v>

240
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:58.170
<v Speaker 2>And so these motives have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>intention and this is actually an </v>

241
00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:58.170
<v Speaker 2>interesting way to understand the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

242
00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 2>Difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have both motives,</v>

243
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 2>but if so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine two siblings,</v>

244
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 2>one of whom is set more towards trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>new stuff,</v>

245
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 2>seeking out new stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other is a little more fearful.</v>

246
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 2>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

247
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

248
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not try that.</v>

249
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 2>That stayed with what's tried and true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

250
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 2>that's progressivism and conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the origins of it.</v>

251
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at kids' behavior at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>age of two or three,</v>

252
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 2>it does predict how they'll vote much </v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

253
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.160
<v Speaker 2>Not Hugely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a clear prediction there.</v>

254
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.160
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

255
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.750
<v Speaker 2>so disgust is part of a regulatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>system about our engagement with the </v>

256
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.550
<v Speaker 2>world and whether we are just sorta out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and,</v>

257
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

258
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we seek out variety and diversity.</v>

259
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:41.131
<v Speaker 2>We think diversity is just a great thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whether we want a little more order </v>

260
00:12:41.131 --> 00:12:41.131
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predictability.</v>

261
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives are neater than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive's if you take photos of </v>

262
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:46.820
<v Speaker 2>their rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

263
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

264
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:51.310
<v Speaker 2>you can actually cleanliness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>

265
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 2>you can predict how they vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

266
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.340
<v Speaker 2>discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out what's really cool about </v>

267
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.651
<v Speaker 2>disgust in modern politics is if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at all the different things that </v>

268
00:13:01.651 --> 00:13:01.960
<v Speaker 2>we're fighting over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in this country,</v>

269
00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:03.730
<v Speaker 2>our culture war is over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

270
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 2>going back in a few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

271
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.490
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

272
00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:07.810
<v Speaker 2>the flag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration,</v>

273
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:08.470
<v Speaker 2>all of these things.</v>

274
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to study with my colleagues.</v>

275
00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:15.931
<v Speaker 2>It was led by Seneca Leyva in which we </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked all these cultural war attitudes </v>

276
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 2>of people and we also had their scores </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the discus scale,</v>

277
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 2>but one of the foundations of morality </v>
<v Speaker 2>is sanctity and purity.</v>

278
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.690
<v Speaker 2>And it relates to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we found is that if,</v>

279
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:27.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

280
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

281
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.280
<v Speaker 2>what people's left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

282
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.320
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they place themselves in the left </v>

283
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.631
<v Speaker 2>rightscale you can pretty much predict </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they fall on most culture war </v>

284
00:13:36.631 --> 00:13:40.750
<v Speaker 2>attitudes except for those that load on </v>
<v Speaker 2>or implicate sanctity,</v>

285
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.770
<v Speaker 2>purity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I mean,</v>

286
00:13:41.771 --> 00:13:43.570
<v Speaker 2>his flag burning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

287
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

288
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:49.290
<v Speaker 2>do you think that people should have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to burn the American flag or the </v>

289
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.200
<v Speaker 2>country's flag as an expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a political action?</v>

290
00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:55.201
<v Speaker 2>What do you think people can give some </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer on a one to seven scale and </v>

291
00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:56.140
<v Speaker 2>people on the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

292
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:56.590
<v Speaker 2>more like this.</v>

293
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Ain't no people in the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

294
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.110
<v Speaker 2>People who score high on loyalty are </v>
<v Speaker 2>more likely to say no.</v>

295
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.140
<v Speaker 2>People who low lower and say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's even taking account of where </v>

296
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:07.140
<v Speaker 2>they are on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right dimension.</v>

297
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.430
<v Speaker 2>But here's the cool thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

298
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:13.890
<v Speaker 2>it's only if you add in the purity or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctity thing that you can really </v>

299
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.951
<v Speaker 2>understand what people are doing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people see the flag not as just a </v>

300
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:22.561
<v Speaker 2>piece of cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see it as having some innate </v>

301
00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:24.661
<v Speaker 2>essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some something sacred about it which </v>

302
00:14:24.661 --> 00:14:24.661
<v Speaker 2>must be protected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

303
00:14:24.661 --> 00:14:25.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is true.</v>

304
00:14:25.391 --> 00:14:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Even they think of it as a unifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>

305
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

306
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.650
<v Speaker 2>So if there's something sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the,</v>

307
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:35.670
<v Speaker 2>this is the central piece of my work </v>
<v Speaker 2>around politics and morality is the </v>

308
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.710
<v Speaker 2>psychology of sanctity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you hold something sacred,</v>

309
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.040
<v Speaker 2>then your team's circles around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's only those who circle around </v>

310
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.770
<v Speaker 2>with you and sometimes literally circled</v>
<v Speaker 2>around like Muslims at prayer in Mecca.</v>

311
00:14:47.771 --> 00:14:51.100
<v Speaker 2>They literally circle the Kebab circling</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very primitive,</v>

312
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 2>ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels right to circle something,</v>

313
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.810
<v Speaker 2>but even if even if you do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolically or you all bow at the same </v>

314
00:14:58.810 --> 00:14:58.810
<v Speaker 2>time that binds you together,</v>

315
00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.580
<v Speaker 3>children do that with their mothers when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

316
00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.100
<v Speaker 3>when they engage in exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior,</v>

317
00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:08.101
<v Speaker 3>right where all they used their mother </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a center of the world and children </v>

318
00:15:08.101 --> 00:15:09.580
<v Speaker 3>differ in the degree to which they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>move outward from their mother.</v>

319
00:15:09.581 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 3>So they move out until they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

320
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.040
<v Speaker 3>they trip over their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their uncertainty threshold.</v>

321
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.870
<v Speaker 3>Neat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is it a distance,</v>

322
00:15:16.871 --> 00:15:18.070
<v Speaker 3>like it's a district?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

323
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

324
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:24.090
<v Speaker 3>so the more exploratory kids who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>lower negative emotion will go out </v>

325
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:24.310
<v Speaker 3>farther before they come back to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother.</v>

326
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:29.430
<v Speaker 3>So the mother is the center and you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that would be associated </v>

327
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.881
<v Speaker 3>symbolically with the idea of the center</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a motherland or potentially as a </v>

328
00:15:32.881 --> 00:15:32.881
<v Speaker 3>father like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

329
00:15:32.881 --> 00:15:33.960
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this way that we're,</v>

330
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.740
<v Speaker 2>we're incredibly symbolic creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not just out to make as much money</v>

331
00:15:37.741 --> 00:15:42.741
<v Speaker 2>as we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's this symbolic and social </v>

332
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:45.111
<v Speaker 2>creatures and this psychology of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctity or purity has become really </v>

333
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.380
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just on the right.</v>

334
00:15:46.381 --> 00:15:51.381
<v Speaker 2>It's always been important for </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially religious conservatives were </v>

335
00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:52.500
<v Speaker 2>beginning to see it even on the campus </v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

336
00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.970
<v Speaker 2>and this is why I think we see some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the odd things we see on campus that the</v>

337
00:15:56.971 --> 00:16:00.660
<v Speaker 2>campus must be kept as a sacred and pure</v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

338
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:06.230
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that really alarms me </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what's happening on campus last </v>

339
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.351
<v Speaker 2>couple of years is that the older idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>we had that it's a place for contesting </v>

340
00:16:09.661 --> 00:16:11.100
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>

341
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a zone of enormous choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can take what courses they want,</v>

342
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.680
<v Speaker 2>say what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a wonderful free for all </v>

343
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.881
<v Speaker 2>with some with norms of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's now becoming much more of a </v>

344
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:26.661
<v Speaker 2>religious zone where the perimeter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the campus is the boundaries and within </v>

345
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.640
<v Speaker 2>its they're almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're blasphemy laws basically,</v>

346
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 2>and I really started noticing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the videos of the </v>

347
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.421
<v Speaker 2>Middlebury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a protest when Charles Murray spoke at </v>

348
00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Middlebury and as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as everybody knows,</v>

349
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 2>he was shouted down so the students are </v>
<v Speaker 2>chanting and they're chanting in unison </v>

350
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.200
<v Speaker 2>and it seems like a religious revival </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting and they're swaying and they're </v>

351
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.220
<v Speaker 2>saying they're sacred in a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist,</v>

352
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.710
<v Speaker 2>antigay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charles Murray go away.</v>

353
00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:54.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like a ritual incantation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

354
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.870
<v Speaker 3>so that all the space is safe and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>safe and</v>

355
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:04.770
<v Speaker 2>not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So far all of this happening is they're </v>

356
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:04.770
<v Speaker 2>binding together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're moving and you know,</v>

357
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:05.790
<v Speaker 2>synchronous movement and call and </v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

358
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's using a lot of tropes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and religious worship.</v>

359
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.540
<v Speaker 2>But here's the cool thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the administrator,</v>

360
00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I forget who it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes on to say,</v>

361
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.130
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have moved,</v>

362
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:22.250
<v Speaker 2>we're moving the talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you hear a couple people </v>

363
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.821
<v Speaker 2>screaming out off campus off campus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he says to another location on campus </v>

364
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.600
<v Speaker 2>and there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

365
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

366
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:38.360
<v Speaker 2>no one had to go to this talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everyone could have just stayed home </v>

367
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.620
<v Speaker 2>and the students did succeed in shutting</v>
<v Speaker 2>down the venues so they could have </v>

368
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.850
<v Speaker 2>declared victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not a full victory unless he is</v>

369
00:17:44.851 --> 00:17:49.851
<v Speaker 2>physically off the campus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't have him speaking on because </v>

370
00:17:49.851 --> 00:17:50.640
<v Speaker 2>that defiles</v>

371
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.080
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that pollutes us.</v>

372
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.710
<v Speaker 3>We must shut that down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where I started saying,</v>

373
00:17:55.711 --> 00:18:00.711
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like full blown psychology of </v>

374
00:18:00.711 --> 00:18:00.711
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Durkheim,</v>

375
00:18:00.711 --> 00:18:01.200
<v Speaker 3>sanctity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>purity,</v>

376
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:02.760
<v Speaker 3>blast for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

377
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.120
<v Speaker 3>and that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

378
00:18:04.121 --> 00:18:05.730
<v Speaker 3>that that doesn't describe most students</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

379
00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:09.870
<v Speaker 3>that describes this sort of the core,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those who who really have their identity</v>

380
00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:11.990
<v Speaker 3>is wrapped up in this movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

381
00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.770
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we discussed,</v>

382
00:18:13.771 --> 00:18:18.771
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to ask you a couple of things </v>

383
00:18:18.771 --> 00:18:18.771
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

384
00:18:18.771 --> 00:18:22.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big five research into political </v>

385
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:23.850
<v Speaker 3>differences basically shows that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberals are high in trait,</v>

386
00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:28.851
<v Speaker 3>openness and low in trait </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness and the conservatives </v>

387
00:18:28.851 --> 00:18:30.210
<v Speaker 3>or the reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we fragmented conscientiousness into</v>

388
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:33.590
<v Speaker 3>orderliness and industriousness with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>big five aspects.</v>

389
00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Scale and orderliness is strongly </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with disgust.</v>

390
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it sounds like Freud.</v>

391
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

392
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

393
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:42.770
<v Speaker 3>It does sound a lot like Freud but it.</v>

394
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:47.810
<v Speaker 3>But it also is in accordance with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>observations that conservatives have </v>

395
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:48.000
<v Speaker 3>neater spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>

396
00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:53.001
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now and they're meeting start on </v>

397
00:18:53.001 --> 00:18:53.001
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

398
00:18:53.001 --> 00:18:53.001
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

399
00:18:53.001 --> 00:18:53.001
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

400
00:18:53.001 --> 00:18:54.700
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then the,</v>

401
00:18:54.701 --> 00:18:59.701
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nexus for political belief seems to </v>

402
00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:02.151
<v Speaker 3>be openness so that that exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 3>tendency that you talked about </v>

403
00:19:02.151 --> 00:19:07.070
<v Speaker 3>exploration of ideas and creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>low orderliness and so then I thought,</v>

404
00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:12.681
<v Speaker 3>well why in the world would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would the political nexus go across </v>

405
00:19:12.681 --> 00:19:16.431
<v Speaker 3>those dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are some relatively uncorrelated </v>

406
00:19:16.431 --> 00:19:17.430
<v Speaker 3>than I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is in keeping with your work on</v>

407
00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:20.220
<v Speaker 3>discussed is that it's an issue of </v>
<v Speaker 3>borders,</v>

408
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:25.250
<v Speaker 3>which of course seems more or less self </v>
<v Speaker 3>evident in the wake of trump's election </v>

409
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.090
<v Speaker 3>when he talked about borders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you might say,</v>

410
00:19:27.091 --> 00:19:32.091
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the conservative is someone who </v>

411
00:19:32.091 --> 00:19:36.260
<v Speaker 3>wants the borders between categories to </v>
<v Speaker 3>remain intact no matter what level of </v>

412
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:36.540
<v Speaker 3>analysis.</v>

413
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:42.110
<v Speaker 3>So it's borders from the highest </v>
<v Speaker 3>resolution level of cognition all the </v>

414
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.580
<v Speaker 3>way up to the actual physical borders </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

415
00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.000
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of rooms,</v>

416
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 3>towns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>states,</v>

417
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:48.150
<v Speaker 3>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>

418
00:19:48.151 --> 00:19:51.900
<v Speaker 3>So the borders should be thicker and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason they want that.</v>

419
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.240
<v Speaker 3>Now there was a paper published in Plos </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

420
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:56.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a couple of years ago,</v>

421
00:19:56.161 --> 00:20:01.161
<v Speaker 3>it was a mind boggling paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should have been front page news as </v>

422
00:20:01.161 --> 00:20:04.131
<v Speaker 3>far as I was concerned and what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>researchers did was between countries </v>

423
00:20:04.131 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 3>and then within provinces or states </v>
<v Speaker 3>within countries,</v>

424
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.860
<v Speaker 3>they correlated the level of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

425
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.400
<v Speaker 3>of frequency of infectious disease with </v>
<v Speaker 3>authoritarian political beliefs and </v>

426
00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.700
<v Speaker 3>found a walloping correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like point six.</v>

427
00:20:20.701 --> 00:20:22.320
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the highest by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

428
00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for those of you who don't know,</v>

429
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.090
<v Speaker 3>social scientists never discover </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that's associated with anything</v>

430
00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 3>else at a correlation of point six other</v>
<v Speaker 3>than heritability.</v>

431
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.470
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other than heritability.</v>

432
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:36.471
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what they found was that the </v>

433
00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:36.471
<v Speaker 3>higher the prevalence of infectious </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>

434
00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:40.641
<v Speaker 3>the higher the probability of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of totalitarian authoritarian political </v>

435
00:20:40.641 --> 00:20:44.991
<v Speaker 3>attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they controlled for governance </v>

436
00:20:44.991 --> 00:20:47.600
<v Speaker 3>because one of the questions was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was this pop down authoritarianism or </v>

437
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.681
<v Speaker 3>bottom authoritarianism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer was that it was bottom </v>

438
00:20:51.681 --> 00:20:51.681
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

439
00:20:51.681 --> 00:20:55.381
<v Speaker 3>And so I thought about that in two from </v>
<v Speaker 3>two perspectives simultaneously at the </v>

440
00:20:57.101 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

441
00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:00.820
<v Speaker 3>So we identified disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity with orderliness,</v>

442
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.880
<v Speaker 3>so say a fundamental sub trait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I was reading this book that was </v>

443
00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:08.740
<v Speaker 3>called Hitler's table talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was a,</v>

444
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.860
<v Speaker 3>it was the recordings of virtually </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything he said at dinner from 1939 </v>

445
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.650
<v Speaker 3>to 1942.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

446
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:18.300
<v Speaker 3>So it's a spontaneous utterance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say and um,</v>

447
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 3>it's full of discussions about Jews and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gypsies and older people he tormented.</v>

448
00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:26.750
<v Speaker 3>But what's really interesting is all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>language is discussed.</v>

449
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.930
<v Speaker 3>It's not fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

450
00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.940
<v Speaker 3>so Hitler is basic metaphor was that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aryan race and country was a pure body </v>

451
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.900
<v Speaker 3>and then it was assaulted by parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

452
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:42.901
<v Speaker 3>And then I remembered what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the native Americans when the Europeans </v>

453
00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:46.231
<v Speaker 3>showed up and shook hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened was that 95 percent of </v>

454
00:21:46.231 --> 00:21:46.480
<v Speaker 3>them are dead within 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

455
00:21:46.481 --> 00:21:50.260
<v Speaker 3>Because of smallpox and measles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that,</v>

456
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 3>that border issue that separates </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives from liberals,</v>

457
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:59.521
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the conservative say the novel is </v>

458
00:21:59.521 --> 00:22:01.270
<v Speaker 3>potentially contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not so much that it's dangerous.</v>

459
00:22:01.271 --> 00:22:02.590
<v Speaker 3>That's different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fear.</v>

460
00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:04.540
<v Speaker 3>It's contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Liberals say,</v>

461
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 3>hold on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you make the borders too thick,</v>

462
00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:09.400
<v Speaker 3>then information can't pass through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

463
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:11.100
<v Speaker 3>So that's the Omnivore's dilemma right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

464
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

465
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:17.060
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then since we have a biological </v>

466
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:17.800
<v Speaker 3>architecture on which are cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>platforms are erected,</v>

467
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.460
<v Speaker 3>we have the same attitude towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstract information,</v>

468
00:22:21.461 --> 00:22:25.010
<v Speaker 3>which would be ideas that we do to </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like food or,</v>

469
00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:26.560
<v Speaker 3>or illness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

470
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:31.590
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we can think of an invading idea </v>

471
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.590
<v Speaker 3>or a polluting idea or contaminated.</v>

472
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's right now I'm a big fan of </v>
<v Speaker 2>George lakoff metaphors.</v>

473
00:22:34.071 --> 00:22:36.110
<v Speaker 2>We live by a that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

474
00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:41.140
<v Speaker 2>we use our bodily or bodily Schema data </v>
<v Speaker 2>to think about abstract things like </v>

475
00:22:41.241 --> 00:22:44.870
<v Speaker 2>politics and like what our policies </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be about borders and immigration.</v>

476
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a Canadian psychologist,</v>

477
00:22:46.401 --> 00:22:51.401
<v Speaker 2>mark shaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and his colleagues have developed </v>

478
00:22:51.401 --> 00:22:51.800
<v Speaker 2>what they call an account over these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the behavioral immune system,</v>

479
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:53.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we don't just try to,</v>

480
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:58.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>microbes killed probably many more of </v>

481
00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.661
<v Speaker 2>our ancestors then did lions and tigers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bears and so whoever can keep </v>

482
00:23:01.661 --> 00:23:05.180
<v Speaker 2>themselves and their children from being</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to fatal illnesses,</v>

483
00:23:05.181 --> 00:23:10.181
<v Speaker 2>winds the evolutionary game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of that is judging </v>

484
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:10.280
<v Speaker 2>carefully about people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he dangerous,</v>

485
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.860
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's both for sexuality,</v>

486
00:23:12.861 --> 00:23:15.170
<v Speaker 2>for contact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for all kinds of association.</v>

487
00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:16.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

488
00:23:16.221 --> 00:23:20.150
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of ways our emotions and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodily interactions structure,</v>

489
00:23:20.151 --> 00:23:22.940
<v Speaker 2>how we think and feel about about </v>
<v Speaker 2>social.</v>

490
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.180
<v Speaker 3>Well even with the black death in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe,</v>

491
00:23:25.181 --> 00:23:30.181
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the black death occurred in Europe </v>

492
00:23:30.181 --> 00:23:32.701
<v Speaker 3>when the Europeans started to move </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world and they brought back </v>

493
00:23:32.701 --> 00:23:32.701
<v Speaker 3>rats that were infected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

494
00:23:32.701 --> 00:23:37.201
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what you saw there was both of those </v>

495
00:23:37.201 --> 00:23:39.151
<v Speaker 3>forces at work at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the European expansion produced a </v>

496
00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:41.080
<v Speaker 3>tremendous interchange of ideas from all</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world.</v>

497
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:46.081
<v Speaker 3>That's globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wiped out somewhere between 30 </v>

498
00:23:46.081 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 3>and 60 percent of the population at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>

499
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:49.050
<v Speaker 2>So wouldn't it be good if in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

500
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 2>every organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had some people who specialized </v>

501
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.080
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

502
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.290
<v Speaker 2>a specialized in saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

503
00:23:55.291 --> 00:24:00.291
<v Speaker 2>what are the opportunities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we had other people who </v>

504
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:00.291
<v Speaker 2>specialize in saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

505
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:03.501
<v Speaker 2>but what are the risks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just so happens that a lot of </v>

506
00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:03.750
<v Speaker 2>people have trouble doing all that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

507
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.080
<v Speaker 2>When we have systems that are well </v>
<v Speaker 2>constituted with people who have </v>

508
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:09.240
<v Speaker 2>different personalities and different </v>
<v Speaker 2>motives and goals,</v>

509
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:10.420
<v Speaker 2>we actually can get better at.</v>

510
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.500
<v Speaker 3>We can have a discussion between them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

511
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:16.300
<v Speaker 3>well that's exactly why that is for that</v>
<v Speaker 3>precise reason that,</v>

512
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.220
<v Speaker 3>that I've been so interested in free </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech as a,</v>

513
00:24:19.221 --> 00:24:24.221
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a value because or even on the </v>

514
00:24:24.221 --> 00:24:26.801
<v Speaker 3>economic front,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty obvious if you look at </v>

515
00:24:26.801 --> 00:24:29.411
<v Speaker 3>things economically that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneur types who start businesses </v>

516
00:24:29.411 --> 00:24:31.160
<v Speaker 3>are lumped in with the liberal creative </v>
<v Speaker 3>types.</v>

517
00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:36.161
<v Speaker 3>We've done a lot of work on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prediction of entrepreneurial behavior </v>

518
00:24:36.161 --> 00:24:36.680
<v Speaker 3>on the ability and his openness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the big predictor.</v>

519
00:24:36.681 --> 00:24:39.230
<v Speaker 3>It's not the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's openness and ICU fundamentally,</v>

520
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.350
<v Speaker 3>but for managerial and administrative </v>
<v Speaker 3>expertise,</v>

521
00:24:42.351 --> 00:24:42.900
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

522
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 3>it's Iq and conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the liberal start businesses,</v>

523
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.860
<v Speaker 3>but they can't run them because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

524
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Their interests flipped and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the organizational ability and the </v>

525
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:56.330
<v Speaker 3>conservatives can run them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can't continue to transform and</v>

526
00:24:56.331 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 3>expand them.</v>

527
00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 and Yang.</v>

528
00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Yin and Yang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

529
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.710
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so one more thing about what happened in</v>

530
00:25:03.711 --> 00:25:07.120
<v Speaker 3>Nazi Germany that that's very relevant </v>
<v Speaker 3>and interesting because it's,</v>

531
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.710
<v Speaker 3>it's useful to get these motives right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

532
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.880
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

533
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.130
<v Speaker 3>if something disgusts you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if something,</v>

534
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.790
<v Speaker 3>if you're afraid of something then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>run away from it or you free,</v>

535
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 3>but if something disgusts you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you try to burn it or dig or kill it.</v>

536
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You try to get rid of or expel it.</v>

537
00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:23.060
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right though.</v>

538
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:28.150
<v Speaker 3>You want to get it away and destroy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when Hitler came to power,</v>

539
00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 3>he putting a bunch of public health </v>
<v Speaker 3>schemes,</v>

540
00:25:31.341 --> 00:25:36.341
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had vans that went around and screen </v>

541
00:25:36.341 --> 00:25:36.830
<v Speaker 3>people for tuberculosis and then he went</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a factory,</v>

542
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 3>cleanliness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a campaign.</v>

543
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.690
<v Speaker 3>So the factories were supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>tidy it up and he,</v>

544
00:25:42.691 --> 00:25:47.691
<v Speaker 3>he washed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made about four times a day by the </v>

545
00:25:47.691 --> 00:25:47.691
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

546
00:25:47.691 --> 00:25:47.691
<v Speaker 3>It's also a great worship or of </v>
<v Speaker 3>willpower,</v>

547
00:25:47.691 --> 00:25:52.241
<v Speaker 3>which is associated with orderliness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems maybe to be associated with </v>

548
00:25:52.241 --> 00:25:53.750
<v Speaker 3>disgust sensitivity in some way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't yet understood.</v>

549
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

550
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

551
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand that connection </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

552
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.040
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he convinced factory owners in Germany </v>

553
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.700
<v Speaker 3>to get rid of the rats and the mice and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mice and the and the insects in the </v>

554
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.360
<v Speaker 3>factories and also to clean them up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautify them.</v>

555
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.640
<v Speaker 3>But the gas they use to clean up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>factories was like lawn a and it was the</v>

556
00:26:13.641 --> 00:26:16.580
<v Speaker 3>variation of that gas cycle on b that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was then used in.</v>

557
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you could see this ramping up based.</v>

558
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.820
<v Speaker 3>So it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

559
00:26:19.821 --> 00:26:22.190
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was public health,</v>

560
00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.460
<v Speaker 3>then it was social cleanliness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he went into the asylums and </v>

561
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.871
<v Speaker 3>cleaned them up and so it was just this </v>
<v Speaker 3>expansion of who was contaminated and </v>

562
00:26:31.871 --> 00:26:36.761
<v Speaker 3>who was impure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think also his fascination with </v>

563
00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:39.380
<v Speaker 3>fire and his use of fire symbolism was </v>
<v Speaker 3>also associated with that.</v>

564
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.680
<v Speaker 3>Would that appeal to purification?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the whole idea of purification </v>

565
00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:44.680
<v Speaker 3>by fire</v>

566
00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.440
<v Speaker 2>is a very ancient idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

567
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

568
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:53.630
<v Speaker 2>so how did your work on discuss change </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that you looked at things </v>

569
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.010
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally mean you gave some </v>
<v Speaker 2>indication of that already,</v>

570
00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:58.250
<v Speaker 2>but what else has changed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

571
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.440
<v Speaker 2>so since I was coming out of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a psychological literature that was </v>

572
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.510
<v Speaker 2>very focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on sort of secular,</v>

573
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.200
<v Speaker 2>secular ethics about justice and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairness,</v>

574
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.760
<v Speaker 2>and then I began studying disgust and </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the broader moral domain.</v>

575
00:27:14.761 --> 00:27:19.290
<v Speaker 2>They're almost all societies have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That then also led me to think about,</v>

576
00:27:19.291 --> 00:27:19.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

577
00:27:19.591 --> 00:27:23.730
<v Speaker 2>if disgust is a reaction to things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to be degrading.</v>

578
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:29.060
<v Speaker 2>So an interesting element of discusses </v>
<v Speaker 2>this notion of degradation that there </v>

579
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.840
<v Speaker 2>are always these vertical metaphors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a image discuss,</v>

580
00:27:30.841 --> 00:27:35.841
<v Speaker 2>brings us down and discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of some religious practice in </v>

581
00:27:35.841 --> 00:27:39.321
<v Speaker 2>Judaism and Islam and Hinduism is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>preparing your body to approach God and </v>

582
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>purification.</v>

583
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.480
<v Speaker 2>And so that led me to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

584
00:27:42.481 --> 00:27:47.481
<v Speaker 2>if there's an emotion which is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing our lower base or animal </v>

585
00:27:47.481 --> 00:27:49.530
<v Speaker 2>biological nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there an opposite?</v>

586
00:27:49.531 --> 00:27:54.531
<v Speaker 2>Emotion is an emotion of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We feel when we see some manifestation </v>

587
00:27:54.531 --> 00:27:57.871
<v Speaker 2>of a higher nobler nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just beginning to think this </v>

588
00:27:57.871 --> 00:27:57.871
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved to Uva.</v>

589
00:27:57.871 --> 00:28:02.481
<v Speaker 2>I got my first job at University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia in 1995 and I read a stat of </v>

590
00:28:02.521 --> 00:28:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Jefferson's letters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in one letter he describes,</v>

591
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.230
<v Speaker 2>he describes the feelings you get from </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading great fiction,</v>

592
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.100
<v Speaker 2>he advises a cousin of his that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>should buy fiction for his library,</v>

593
00:28:14.101 --> 00:28:16.650
<v Speaker 2>not just serious works of law and </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>

594
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.330
<v Speaker 2>And he described,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

595
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.210
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he describes the feeling of,</v>

596
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.170
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

597
00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.860
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having your sentence be elevated,</v>

598
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.900
<v Speaker 2>does it not dilate your breast or give </v>
<v Speaker 2>you an open feeling in your chest when </v>

599
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.160
<v Speaker 2>you see these acts of beauty and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kindness and gratitude?</v>

600
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

601
00:28:33.001 --> 00:28:34.550
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

602
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.540
<v Speaker 2>and so because I've been studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgust,</v>

603
00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:41.541
<v Speaker 2>I then started studying its opposite </v>
<v Speaker 2>which I and some others called moral </v>

604
00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:45.170
<v Speaker 2>elevation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is kind of vertical metaphor of </v>

605
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:46.470
<v Speaker 2>elevation and degradation and snaps onto</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body to,</v>

606
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.000
<v Speaker 2>with regards to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

607
00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:49.740
<v Speaker 2>High low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a clean,</v>

608
00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:51.390
<v Speaker 2>dirty in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

609
00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:55.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a beautiful pairing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so having this language of elevation</v>

610
00:28:55.741 --> 00:28:58.650
<v Speaker 2>and discussed just really has helped me </v>
<v Speaker 2>see a lot of things.</v>

611
00:28:58.651 --> 00:29:00.720
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just see a lot of things happening.</v>

612
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.000
<v Speaker 2>It allows me to like even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

613
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:04.850
<v Speaker 2>manipulate like have been applying for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>grant proposal.</v>

614
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I can get very good at like having </v>
<v Speaker 2>an elevating ending,</v>

615
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:08.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

616
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

617
00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:13.920
<v Speaker 2>to end with a note of uplift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it just brought,</v>

618
00:29:13.921 --> 00:29:15.780
<v Speaker 2>it just broadened my thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality.</v>

619
00:29:15.781 --> 00:29:18.150
<v Speaker 2>And this was around 1995.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so again,</v>

620
00:29:18.151 --> 00:29:21.870
<v Speaker 2>it just prepared me is that I'm a and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd already been to India by that point.</v>

621
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.960
<v Speaker 2>I spent three months doing research in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rissa in eastern India.</v>

622
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it just broadened my thinking and </v>

623
00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.660
<v Speaker 2>that's what allowed me finally to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand conservatives because I had </v>

624
00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:36.330
<v Speaker 2>always been on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hated Ronald Reagan.</v>

625
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought Republicans were stupid and </v>

626
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.331
<v Speaker 2>evil and it was only when I had gone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>India and really tried to understand a </v>

627
00:29:44.331 --> 00:29:48.631
<v Speaker 2>traditional religious hierarchical </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender stratified society.</v>

628
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Tried to understand it in their terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't try to just bring in my own,</v>

629
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.980
<v Speaker 2>my own western left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

630
00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:55.940
<v Speaker 2>left leaning perspectives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

631
00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:01.110
<v Speaker 2>that I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was all under the guidance of </v>

632
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.751
<v Speaker 2>Richard Schwayder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my postdoc supervisor at the University </v>

633
00:30:03.751 --> 00:30:05.950
<v Speaker 2>of Chicago where did a postdoc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was only then that I was able to sort</v>

634
00:30:05.951 --> 00:30:10.951
<v Speaker 2>of get inside their minds and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral system and see that there were </v>

635
00:30:10.951 --> 00:30:13.981
<v Speaker 2>alternative moral worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They each had their own logic and that </v>

636
00:30:13.981 --> 00:30:14.250
<v Speaker 2>was the metaphor I came to it.</v>

637
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:14.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

638
00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the matrix movies were very popular.</v>

639
00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:20.290
<v Speaker 2>So the metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Matrix as a consensual hallucination</v>

640
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:25.590
<v Speaker 2>made a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's where I can up with the idea of </v>

641
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.421
<v Speaker 2>just speaking about moral matrices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whichever different matrices that are </v>

642
00:30:27.421 --> 00:30:30.751
<v Speaker 2>grounded in biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biology in the sense that it gives us </v>

643
00:30:30.751 --> 00:30:34.171
<v Speaker 2>the potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the building blocks of this </v>

644
00:30:34.171 --> 00:30:34.171
<v Speaker 2>matrix can't be just anything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes,</v>

645
00:30:34.171 --> 00:30:37.000
<v Speaker 2>it comes from our experiences are </v>
<v Speaker 2>embodied experiences and again,</v>

646
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:38.750
<v Speaker 2>George Lakoff is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the master of,</v>

647
00:30:38.751 --> 00:30:40.000
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that thinking.</v>

648
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:45.570
<v Speaker 2>And so it was only then that I was able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to now listen to conservative talk radio</v>

649
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:51.130
<v Speaker 2>and Christian religious radio and see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than just saying,</v>

650
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.360
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was stupid terrible.</v>

651
00:30:52.361 --> 00:30:54.280
<v Speaker 2>People say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow.</v>

652
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see that they're striving for </v>

653
00:30:59.380 --> 00:30:59.380
<v Speaker 2>certain version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

654
00:30:59.380 --> 00:30:59.860
<v Speaker 2>So you started to understand their </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorical language essentially.</v>

655
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:01.420
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was like kind of like my,</v>

656
00:31:01.421 --> 00:31:06.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a great awakening or scales </v>

657
00:31:06.421 --> 00:31:06.421
<v Speaker 2>falling from my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

658
00:31:06.421 --> 00:31:06.421
<v Speaker 2>since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it took a few more.</v>

659
00:31:06.421 --> 00:31:07.180
<v Speaker 2>It took a number of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot more years.</v>

660
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:12.270
<v Speaker 2>But eventually I kind of just pulled out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the implants from my eyes and I stopped </v>

661
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.700
<v Speaker 2>seeing everything through a partisan </v>
<v Speaker 2>lens and I'm not on any side now.</v>

662
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to understand what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell is.</v>

663
00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really useful.</v>

664
00:31:18.491 --> 00:31:23.491
<v Speaker 3>It's really useful to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are actual reasons why people see </v>

665
00:31:23.491 --> 00:31:28.051
<v Speaker 3>the world differently and that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>just easily say that one is right and </v>

666
00:31:28.051 --> 00:31:30.070
<v Speaker 3>the other is wrong because the liberals </v>
<v Speaker 3>are correct when it comes to borders.</v>

667
00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:33.070
<v Speaker 3>That if you thicken them too much and </v>
<v Speaker 3>diminish the information flow,</v>

668
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:38.370
<v Speaker 3>you risk making the society so static </v>
<v Speaker 3>that any radical environmental </v>

669
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.210
<v Speaker 3>transformation will sink it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the case,</v>

670
00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:45.390
<v Speaker 3>but the conservatives are right in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you pay a big price with regards to </v>

671
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.171
<v Speaker 3>newcomers and new information with </v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to risk to exposure to </v>

672
00:31:49.171 --> 00:31:50.320
<v Speaker 3>contaminating while to contamination </v>
<v Speaker 3>period,</v>

673
00:31:50.321 --> 00:31:54.040
<v Speaker 3>but also to contaminating ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then I've always thought,</v>

674
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:59.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the environment itself moves back and </v>

675
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.981
<v Speaker 3>forth like a snake in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what we're trying to do is stay on </v>

676
00:32:01.981 --> 00:32:04.330
<v Speaker 3>the center of its back and the only way </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can do that is by people,</v>

677
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:06.250
<v Speaker 3>by having people pull to the right and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

678
00:32:06.251 --> 00:32:08.320
<v Speaker 3>be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people pulled to the left and say,</v>

679
00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:08.800
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

680
00:32:08.801 --> 00:32:13.801
<v Speaker 3>but be open with that dialogue and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the exchange of information that,</v>

681
00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:19.021
<v Speaker 3>that dialogue allows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can maybe specify the center of that </v>

682
00:32:19.021 --> 00:32:21.700
<v Speaker 3>moving target and stay and stay well and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay on the back,</v>

683
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:22.170
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

684
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:27.450
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a really complicated metaphor </v>

685
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:28.951
<v Speaker 2>with the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a perfect way in to </v>

686
00:32:28.951 --> 00:32:28.951
<v Speaker 2>what's going on on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And two,</v>

687
00:32:28.951 --> 00:32:30.490
<v Speaker 2>why viewpoint diversity is so important </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's,</v>

688
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I agree exactly with what you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I,</v>

689
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 2>the view that I've come to in studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral psychology is that we have,</v>

690
00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:43.990
<v Speaker 2>is that humans are ultra social apes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

691
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.970
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we evolved to live in these small groups</v>

692
00:32:46.971 --> 00:32:49.560
<v Speaker 2>that are fighting with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

693
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.030
<v Speaker 2>we evolved to have these low level </v>
<v Speaker 2>animistic religions.</v>

694
00:32:53.031 --> 00:32:58.031
<v Speaker 2>That's our steady state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way we were for at least </v>

695
00:32:58.031 --> 00:32:58.031
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

696
00:32:58.031 --> 00:32:59.840
<v Speaker 2>are much more closer to a million in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some form.</v>

697
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's sort of our design.</v>

698
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.740
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're designed for in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

699
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in that sense where as individuals </v>

700
00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.050
<v Speaker 2>really kind of stupid tribal creatures </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed to do post hoc reasoning,</v>

701
00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:17.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you put us together in the right </v>

702
00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 2>way with the right checks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the right,</v>

703
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.130
<v Speaker 2>the right systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

704
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.770
<v Speaker 2>the whole can be vastly smarter than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>components that go into it,</v>

705
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.650
<v Speaker 2>which is true of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the brain is composed of neurons.</v>

706
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Each neuron is kind of stupid little </v>
<v Speaker 2>switch,</v>

707
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:35.430
<v Speaker 2>but you put them together in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>way and you get something really </v>

708
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.430
<v Speaker 2>brilliant and at the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

709
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know all the history here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my understanding is that science </v>

710
00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:43.241
<v Speaker 2>begins or the culture of science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientific revolution begins in </v>

711
00:33:43.241 --> 00:33:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Europe in the 17th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you begin getting,</v>

712
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.850
<v Speaker 2>you get the printing press so people can</v>
<v Speaker 2>share their ideas,</v>

713
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:52.910
<v Speaker 2>but you get communities of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are challenging each other's ideas.</v>

714
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:58.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's what makes it so brilliant is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is that people have to do their </v>

715
00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.410
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're really bad at this confirming our </v>

716
00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.511
<v Speaker 2>own ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to make it very hard to </v>

717
00:34:04.511 --> 00:34:06.641
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you put your ideas out there and </v>

718
00:34:06.641 --> 00:34:06.641
<v Speaker 2>then everyone else is motivated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge them.</v>

719
00:34:06.641 --> 00:34:08.720
<v Speaker 2>And so if you put us together in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right way,</v>

720
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:09.830
<v Speaker 2>the truth comes out.</v>

721
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.310
<v Speaker 2>And so adversarial systems of law </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists know this.</v>

722
00:34:13.311 --> 00:34:15.680
<v Speaker 2>They have to listen to both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists know this.</v>

723
00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Social scientists should know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

724
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.850
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

725
00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the academy has,</v>

726
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.830
<v Speaker 2>has always leaned left in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

727
00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.280
<v Speaker 2>but leaning isn't a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people think,</v>

728
00:34:28.281 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint diversity we need,</v>

729
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.700
<v Speaker 2>we need everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need Nazis.</v>

730
00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:32.350
<v Speaker 2>We need every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

731
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:33.950
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't need everybody.</v>

732
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 2>What we need is no orthodoxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's fatal orthodoxy.</v>

733
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:41.060
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have to feel it,</v>

734
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:46.061
<v Speaker 2>like sociology or social psychology in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which it's two or three to one left to </v>

735
00:34:46.061 --> 00:34:47.120
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's totally fine with me.</v>

736
00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:48.980
<v Speaker 2>That's totally fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

737
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:53.570
<v Speaker 2>because if someone makes some claim </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just like ideologically blind,</v>

738
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.520
<v Speaker 2>someone will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

739
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:56.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>common sense,</v>

740
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.660
<v Speaker 2>other evidence that you've missed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the system works.</v>

741
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.710
<v Speaker 2>But what I learned when I started down </v>
<v Speaker 2>this road in 2011,</v>

742
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I gave a talk at the big conference with</v>
<v Speaker 2>social psychologists.</v>

743
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.100
<v Speaker 2>I gave a talk about this problem that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're losing our diversity,</v>

744
00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:15.200
<v Speaker 2>that I could only find one conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the entire field and I gave a talk on</v>

745
00:35:15.201 --> 00:35:16.370
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

746
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.040
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

747
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:24.550
<v Speaker 2>and so what I've learned since then is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the ratio in psychology was between</v>

748
00:35:26.271 --> 00:35:27.590
<v Speaker 2>two to one in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One left,</v>

749
00:35:27.591 --> 00:35:29.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the way up to the early nineties.</v>

750
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:31.820
<v Speaker 2>We've gathered together all the studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>we could find.</v>

751
00:35:31.821 --> 00:35:36.821
<v Speaker 2>So all the up to the early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only three or four to one left to </v>

752
00:35:36.821 --> 00:35:36.821
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be okay,</v>

753
00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:41.860
<v Speaker 2>but between 1995 or four and 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes to a 14 to one.</v>

754
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any idea why and why that </v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

755
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

756
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you get the same story whether you </v>

757
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.971
<v Speaker 2>look at Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat ratios or liberal conservative </v>

758
00:35:55.971 --> 00:35:55.971
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tell the same story.</v>

759
00:35:55.971 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two of the big things going on there are</v>

760
00:35:57.901 --> 00:36:01.830
<v Speaker 2>one is that the greatest generation </v>
<v Speaker 2>which had a lot of Republicans,</v>

761
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of men go off to World War Two,</v>

762
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.630
<v Speaker 2>they on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Gi bill,</v>

763
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.850
<v Speaker 2>they entered the academy in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties.</v>

764
00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:13.980
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are conservative or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican and so you have a lot of </v>

765
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:14.910
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the sixties and seventies,</v>

766
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.450
<v Speaker 2>one of the main reasons to go to Grad </v>
<v Speaker 2>school and the social sciences is either</v>

767
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.720
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stay in school to escape the Vietnam </v>

768
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.960
<v Speaker 2>war draft or be to fight for social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice and against racism.</v>

769
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.380
<v Speaker 2>So in sociology and psychology in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular in political science,</v>

770
00:36:28.381 --> 00:36:29.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure,</v>

771
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.520
<v Speaker 2>you get a huge influx of left leaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are there to pursue social </v>

772
00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.760
<v Speaker 2>justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

773
00:36:35.761 --> 00:36:39.330
<v Speaker 2>the motives are fine and if it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>balanced to be totally fine,</v>

774
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.100
<v Speaker 2>but as you get these young junior people</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the left come in in the seventies and</v>

775
00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:49.101
<v Speaker 2>eighties and then you get the older </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are more politically </v>

776
00:36:49.101 --> 00:36:49.110
<v Speaker 2>bounced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>retiring of the eighties and nineties by</v>

777
00:36:49.111 --> 00:36:52.470
<v Speaker 2>the time you get to the late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all baby boomers.</v>

778
00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.640
<v Speaker 2>And so do you get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a positive feedback loop </v>

779
00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:57.640
<v Speaker 2>developing their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

780
00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.410
<v Speaker 2>it's like three to one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay,</v>

781
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.620
<v Speaker 2>but maybe when it hits four to one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes to like 20 to one,</v>

782
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.580
<v Speaker 2>then you stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

783
00:37:02.581 --> 00:37:07.581
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then you start getting hostile </v>

784
00:37:07.581 --> 00:37:09.921
<v Speaker 2>climate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote a review paper on this with </v>

785
00:37:09.921 --> 00:37:12.590
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Joe Duarte and Phil tetlock and </v>

786
00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:12.590
<v Speaker 2>lead Justin Jarrett,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crawford.</v>

787
00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

788
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.200
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

789
00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:21.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we reviewed everything that we could </v>

790
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:22.380
<v Speaker 2>find and we concluded that most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on is self selection.</v>

791
00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.870
<v Speaker 2>That is people on the left are more open</v>
<v Speaker 2>to experience.</v>

792
00:37:24.871 --> 00:37:27.240
<v Speaker 2>They're always going to get self </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection.</v>

793
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:30.690
<v Speaker 2>But then there's really good evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's also hostile climate.</v>

794
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's undeniable now that if you are not </v>

795
00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.541
<v Speaker 2>on the left in a Grad program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just constant little subtle or </v>

796
00:37:38.541 --> 00:37:39.840
<v Speaker 2>not so subtle reminders that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>belong.</v>

797
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.360
<v Speaker 2>And look in the academy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all about saying,</v>

798
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there are subtle hints here and </v>

799
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.630
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't succeed,</v>

800
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

801
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.010
<v Speaker 2>that's what we do for a living is we say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little things will stop people.</v>

802
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

803
00:37:51.211 --> 00:37:53.850
<v Speaker 2>little things are put in the way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone who doesn't fit politically.</v>

804
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you do get hostile climate.</v>

805
00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 2>You do get over discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's evidence of that.</v>

806
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:03.650
<v Speaker 2>And then there is also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is part of the story here that what </v>

807
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:05.610
<v Speaker 2>it means to be a conservative in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties and especially to thousands has</v>

808
00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:08.540
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is true that you know,</v>

809
00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:09.690
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

810
00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.360
<v Speaker 2>the conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not in any way anti science,</v>

811
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until much more recent times.</v>

812
00:38:15.511 --> 00:38:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Now actually all sides are anti science </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>

813
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:20.400
<v Speaker 2>different sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm in America,</v>

814
00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:23.460
<v Speaker 2>they're the right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Republican Party has,</v>

815
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:29.270
<v Speaker 2>it's controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do believe that the polarization </v>

816
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.270
<v Speaker 2>starts with the right moving further </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

817
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.380
<v Speaker 2>So what it means to be conservative to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the anti anti evolutionary,</v>

818
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.170
<v Speaker 2>which is actually what's happening on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left now to exactly.</v>

819
00:38:34.171 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 2>That's so as this modern like talked to</v>

820
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 3>Brent Weinstein the other day and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

821
00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:38.770
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

822
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.800
<v Speaker 3>one of his claims is that evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology has something in it to offend </v>

823
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.130
<v Speaker 3>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

824
00:38:45.131 --> 00:38:48.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a science that's very likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>targeted by extremist.</v>

825
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:53.580
<v Speaker 3>You also brought up something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually touches on the ICT on the </v>

826
00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:57.730
<v Speaker 3>difficult problem of how it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might define someone whose ideologically</v>

827
00:38:57.731 --> 00:38:58.720
<v Speaker 3>possessed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

828
00:38:58.721 --> 00:39:03.721
<v Speaker 3>or ideologically rigid because the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>was that you can make a valid case for </v>

829
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:07.100
<v Speaker 3>the utility of free information flow </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

830
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:12.230
<v Speaker 3>and the free flow of people that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>go along with that and you could make a </v>

831
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:15.451
<v Speaker 3>good case for the danger of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea might be that if you're </v>

832
00:39:15.451 --> 00:39:16.480
<v Speaker 3>only making a case for the danger of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

833
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.020
<v Speaker 3>then you're tilted too far to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're only making a case for the</v>

834
00:39:20.021 --> 00:39:22.390
<v Speaker 3>utility of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're tilted too far to the left.</v>

835
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

836
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:26.130
<v Speaker 2>And so we can look at immigration as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice example.</v>

837
00:39:26.131 --> 00:39:27.720
<v Speaker 2>There was a recent essay in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Atlantic,</v>

838
00:39:27.721 --> 00:39:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it was by Peter Beinart where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

839
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he reviews,</v>

840
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:38.480
<v Speaker 2>he had started with a lot of quotes that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are pretty nuanced positions about </v>

841
00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.140
<v Speaker 2>immigration from Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Krugman and a bunch of other people</v>

842
00:39:40.141 --> 00:39:43.260
<v Speaker 2>on the left who used to be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand,</v>

843
00:39:43.261 --> 00:39:44.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion,</v>

844
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.080
<v Speaker 2>economic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand,</v>

845
00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:51.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to have a legal process and </v>

846
00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:52.380
<v Speaker 2>there's a threat to low wage workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people on the left,</v>

847
00:39:52.381 --> 00:39:55.530
<v Speaker 2>you still have to talk about immigration</v>
<v Speaker 2>and talk about the pros and cons,</v>

848
00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:00.560
<v Speaker 2>the pluses and minuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But beinart shows how in the last four </v>

849
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.980
<v Speaker 2>or five years you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you so much as suggest that will,</v>

850
00:40:01.981 --> 00:40:06.981
<v Speaker 2>maybe immigration is a net good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it might have some deleterious </v>

851
00:40:07.111 --> 00:40:10.380
<v Speaker 2>effects on certain classes of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of low wage American workers.</v>

852
00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.630
<v Speaker 2>You could get in big trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

853
00:40:12.631 --> 00:40:17.631
<v Speaker 2>Because that's instantly prejudicial </v>
<v Speaker 2>because immigration has become a sacred </v>

854
00:40:17.631 --> 00:40:21.891
<v Speaker 2>topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the key thing that I want </v>

855
00:40:21.891 --> 00:40:23.811
<v Speaker 2>everyone to keep in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are fundamentally religious </v>

856
00:40:23.811 --> 00:40:25.500
<v Speaker 2>creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were built for religion and it's a great</v>

857
00:40:25.501 --> 00:40:30.501
<v Speaker 2>achievement to create a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment and an academic </v>

858
00:40:30.501 --> 00:40:31.140
<v Speaker 2>establishment that keeps that way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking out.</v>

859
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Scientific thinking is not natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

860
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Religious thinking is natural thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's happening to us in the last </v>

861
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:41.250
<v Speaker 2>few years especially is a flooding in of</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious thinking,</v>

862
00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:44.850
<v Speaker 2>and so let's get a bunch of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists talk about immigration.</v>

863
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.920
<v Speaker 2>What are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the data,</v>

864
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.540
<v Speaker 2>way up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pluses and minuses.</v>

865
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to.</v>

866
00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Many of them feel they're on a team and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that team is fighting the right.</v>

867
00:40:54.931 --> 00:40:57.390
<v Speaker 2>The right is anti-immigrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It includes racist elements,</v>

868
00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:00.900
<v Speaker 2>therefore that justifies us in being </v>
<v Speaker 2>pro.</v>

869
00:41:00.901 --> 00:41:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Immigration and social sciences are </v>
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

870
00:41:03.871 --> 00:41:06.770
<v Speaker 2>There's always ambiguity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always conflicting studies,</v>

871
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:12.190
<v Speaker 2>multiple causal factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that always in the social science </v>

872
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:12.190
<v Speaker 2>study?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

873
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:16.310
<v Speaker 2>So buying art's point was that the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be able to think straight about </v>

874
00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:20.991
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly it had a generally pro </v>

875
00:41:20.991 --> 00:41:23.481
<v Speaker 2>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it used to be able to think </v>

876
00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:24.951
<v Speaker 2>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the last few years a religious </v>

877
00:41:24.951 --> 00:41:24.960
<v Speaker 2>orthodox mindset has overtaken it.</v>

878
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:29.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we might as well also pointed out </v>

879
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:29.990
<v Speaker 3>that it's a primordial religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>mindset,</v>

880
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I mean there are,</v>

881
00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely Christian or Jewish,</v>

882
00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean ancient tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small scale,</v>

883
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:36.760
<v Speaker 2>lots of gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

884
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.310
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

885
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:42.311
<v Speaker 2>so then one of the things that you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggest is that when you throw out a </v>

886
00:41:42.311 --> 00:41:45.851
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated religious structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an unsophisticated religious structure </v>

887
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:47.780
<v Speaker 2>comes in to fill the gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

888
00:41:47.781 --> 00:41:50.930
<v Speaker 2>So that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's definitely worth thinking about.</v>

889
00:41:50.931 --> 00:41:52.400
<v Speaker 2>So that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's right.</v>

890
00:41:52.401 --> 00:41:57.401
<v Speaker 2>The thing to the right with religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to clarify a fundamentalism is </v>

891
00:41:57.401 --> 00:41:57.650
<v Speaker 2>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not religion.</v>

892
00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.800
<v Speaker 2>And so if you close tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

893
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:03.100
<v Speaker 2>If you get a fundamentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

894
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you have people applying to a </v>

895
00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Grad program in psychology and I find </v>
<v Speaker 2>out that they're Christian,</v>

896
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:10.670
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no problem.</v>

897
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.210
<v Speaker 2>But if they're fundamentalist Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think,</v>

898
00:42:14.211 --> 00:42:15.330
<v Speaker 2>well let's say let's say it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists,</v>

899
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:16.500
<v Speaker 2>suppose it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

900
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.970
<v Speaker 2>geology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone applies to a geology program,</v>

901
00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:22.880
<v Speaker 2>there are fundamentalist young earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>creationist.</v>

902
00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Are you gonna admit them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

903
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not able to do the right kind of</v>

904
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:32.150
<v Speaker 2>thinking based on what we know to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

905
00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not in the scientific paradigm,</v>

906
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.080
<v Speaker 2>not in the Santa that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

907
00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:40.130
<v Speaker 2>so if we wouldn't admit a fundamentalist</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian to a geology program,</v>

908
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:45.430
<v Speaker 2>why would we admit someone who is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>as fundamentalist about certain moral </v>

909
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:49.391
<v Speaker 2>and political issues into a sociology </v>
<v Speaker 2>program or into a psychology program if </v>

910
00:42:49.391 --> 00:42:53.741
<v Speaker 2>they come in knowing what the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer is committed to that right </v>

911
00:42:53.741 --> 00:42:57.221
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Likely to get angry at anyone who </v>

912
00:42:57.221 --> 00:42:58.130
<v Speaker 2>contravenes that right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

913
00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:01.790
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and showing signs of close mindedness.</v>

914
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they belong in a grab the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the question is how in the world</v>

915
00:43:05.301 --> 00:43:10.301
<v Speaker 2>do you set up mechanisms to ensure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not swamped by fundamentalists of</v>

916
00:43:10.731 --> 00:43:11.420
<v Speaker 2>any sort?</v>

917
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.360
<v Speaker 2>So those are people who are reducing </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything to a single cause.</v>

918
00:43:14.361 --> 00:43:19.361
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you implement a structure that </v>

919
00:43:19.361 --> 00:43:23.050
<v Speaker 2>protects the organization against that </v>
<v Speaker 2>without the structure itself becoming </v>

920
00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:24.470
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because these things,</v>

921
00:43:24.471 --> 00:43:26.450
<v Speaker 2>these things spin out of control so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast.</v>

922
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:31.700
<v Speaker 2>But so what we have to realize in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>academy is that we face,</v>

923
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I think we face an existential crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

924
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:38.540
<v Speaker 2>we rely in enormous amount on public </v>
<v Speaker 2>goodwill.</v>

925
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:43.250
<v Speaker 2>We get enormous tax subsidies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a direct research support,</v>

926
00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:48.850
<v Speaker 2>and recent polling shows that while </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats have always had a higher </v>

927
00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:50.840
<v Speaker 2>opinion of the universities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans until two years ago,</v>

928
00:43:50.841 --> 00:43:53.030
<v Speaker 2>everybody thought universities are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good thing.</v>

929
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:58.090
<v Speaker 2>They make life better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Americans have been very supportive </v>

930
00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.881
<v Speaker 2>of higher education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There have been rising grapes on the </v>

931
00:44:00.881 --> 00:44:02.030
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's only between 2015 and 2017 that</v>

932
00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:07.031
<v Speaker 2>now republicans go from saying mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities are good things in two </v>

933
00:44:07.031 --> 00:44:07.031
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

934
00:44:07.031 --> 00:44:08.540
<v Speaker 2>They go way down and say universities </v>
<v Speaker 2>are bad things.</v>

935
00:44:08.541 --> 00:44:10.370
<v Speaker 2>They're making things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

936
00:44:10.371 --> 00:44:14.380
<v Speaker 2>how is this news greeted pundits on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Left Rsa?</v>

937
00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those republicans are so anti science.</v>

938
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:21.050
<v Speaker 2>Look how ignorant they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They now hate universities.</v>

939
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who's been watching the news,</v>

940
00:44:24.621 --> 00:44:27.130
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's seen the mobs to shout </v>
<v Speaker 2>downs,</v>

941
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.390
<v Speaker 2>the illiberal behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

942
00:44:29.391 --> 00:44:30.920
<v Speaker 2>the metaphor I use is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

943
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Americans on the right and left are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really supportive of the military.</v>

944
00:44:34.261 --> 00:44:36.150
<v Speaker 2>We have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the few institutions that we</v>

945
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:37.800
<v Speaker 2>still hold in highest team on both </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides,</v>

946
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.380
<v Speaker 2>and so the Republicans more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats.</v>

947
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.370
<v Speaker 2>So suppose you had Gallup poll and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

948
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.000
<v Speaker 2>showing Republicans liked the military </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than Democrats,</v>

949
00:44:45.001 --> 00:44:50.001
<v Speaker 2>but both really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then suddenly in 2015 we started seeing </v>

950
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:55.060
<v Speaker 2>video from all over military bases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military academies in which the,</v>

951
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.260
<v Speaker 2>the military leaders are overtly right </v>
<v Speaker 2>wing.</v>

952
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:03.350
<v Speaker 2>They're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying terrible things about </v>

953
00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:04.710
<v Speaker 2>leftists and progressives and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>midshipmen and cadets,</v>

954
00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:08.580
<v Speaker 2>and everybody is mobbing the occasional </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal and they're behaving in a really</v>

955
00:45:08.581 --> 00:45:10.740
<v Speaker 2>despicable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary and intimidating way.</v>

956
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:14.070
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the left would now </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about the military?</v>

957
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Obviously support for the military would</v>
<v Speaker 2>plummet and that's what's happening in </v>

958
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.791
<v Speaker 2>America with universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are losing the support of half the </v>

959
00:45:22.791 --> 00:45:23.220
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is unsustainable,</v>

960
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.700
<v Speaker 2>especially in red states where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>control the purse strings.</v>

961
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:31.530
<v Speaker 2>So I think we have a major crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've got to go into crisis mode</v>

962
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:36.710
<v Speaker 2>and we've got to clean up our act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just as we're doing in psychology </v>

963
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:39.951
<v Speaker 2>with replication project W,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we recognize that our methods weren't </v>

964
00:45:39.951 --> 00:45:40.950
<v Speaker 2>good enough and we're doing a crash </v>
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>

965
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:43.590
<v Speaker 2>a thanks to Brian Nosek and others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the open science project.</v>

966
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.830
<v Speaker 2>We're really trying to improve our game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God we need to.</v>

967
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:50.130
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to do the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about partisanship,</v>

968
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:51.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our,</v>

969
00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 2>our duties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

970
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:55.410
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about Heterodox Academy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you set that up,</v>

971
00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.040
<v Speaker 2>this organization that you should tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody about in,</v>

972
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.170
<v Speaker 2>in precisely to deal with this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'd like,</v>

973
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to know about how it's growing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's doing,</v>

974
00:46:04.741 --> 00:46:06.120
<v Speaker 2>what your aims are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

975
00:46:06.121 --> 00:46:11.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I gave this talk in 2011 laying out </v>

976
00:46:11.121 --> 00:46:14.330
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we have no more </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives and social psychology and </v>

977
00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:15.360
<v Speaker 2>why this makes it hard for us to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

978
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.610
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the months after that,</v>

979
00:46:17.611 --> 00:46:20.010
<v Speaker 2>a few social psychologists resonated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the message.</v>

980
00:46:20.011 --> 00:46:20.550
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

981
00:46:20.551 --> 00:46:21.630
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

982
00:46:21.631 --> 00:46:23.820
<v Speaker 2>I have some data on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the five of us,</v>

983
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:30.200
<v Speaker 2>six of us wrote this paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came out in behavioral and brain </v>

984
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.790
<v Speaker 2>sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Charlotte a stern,</v>

985
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:36.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the sixth one that I forgot to </v>

986
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:36.800
<v Speaker 2>add in before?</v>

987
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got this paper published and behavior</v>

988
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.250
<v Speaker 2>and brain sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It came out,</v>

989
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:43.340
<v Speaker 2>it was sort of online in 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it came out for good in the summer </v>

990
00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.940
<v Speaker 2>of Twenty 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which coincidentally was the same summer</v>

991
00:46:44.941 --> 00:46:49.941
<v Speaker 2>that my article came out with Greg </v>
<v Speaker 2>Glucagon off of the coddling of the </v>

992
00:46:49.941 --> 00:46:53.151
<v Speaker 2>American mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was about things going on with </v>

993
00:46:53.151 --> 00:46:53.410
<v Speaker 2>undergrads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But our concern was entirely faculty.</v>

994
00:46:53.411 --> 00:46:56.070
<v Speaker 2>It was just the nature of the academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

995
00:46:56.071 --> 00:47:01.071
<v Speaker 2>the research community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we got these two things going on </v>

996
00:47:01.071 --> 00:47:01.071
<v Speaker 2>summer of Twenty 15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

997
00:47:01.071 --> 00:47:03.930
<v Speaker 2>and then that summer I hear from Nick </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rosenkranz,</v>

998
00:47:03.931 --> 00:47:06.810
<v Speaker 2>a law professor who says we have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same problem in law,</v>

999
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:09.100
<v Speaker 2>lost worse in law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1000
00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.070
<v Speaker 2>it really bad and Canada law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1001
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.600
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as he points out,</v>

1002
00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:16.740
<v Speaker 2>we're training all these students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never meet a conservative.</v>

1003
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Then they have to go argue cases in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of judges,</v>

1004
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.600
<v Speaker 2>half of whom were appointed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans.</v>

1005
00:47:21.601 --> 00:47:23.610
<v Speaker 2>They have no idea what a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks.</v>

1006
00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.290
<v Speaker 2>This is malpractice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to train.</v>

1007
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.300
<v Speaker 2>So say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hear from a sociologist,</v>

1008
00:47:27.301 --> 00:47:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Chris Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing in sociology,</v>

1009
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 2>so the three of us said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1010
00:47:30.161 --> 00:47:35.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a big problem for the whole </v>

1011
00:47:35.161 --> 00:47:37.321
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you looked at faculties of </v>

1012
00:47:37.321 --> 00:47:37.321
<v Speaker 2>education?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1013
00:47:37.321 --> 00:47:37.660
<v Speaker 2>those are the worst by worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the numbers,</v>

1014
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:42.870
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of the vindictiveness that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the increased the pressure put on any </v>

1015
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:45.160
<v Speaker 2>nonconforming opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My impression,</v>

1016
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:47.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't have data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my impression from the letters I get</v>

1017
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.130
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>

1018
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:52.450
<v Speaker 3>education schools and social work </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools are the worst.</v>

1019
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:55.360
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly in keeping with my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My understanding as well.</v>

1020
00:47:55.361 --> 00:48:00.361
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to tell which of those two or </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst I would say it's the faculties of </v>

1021
00:48:00.361 --> 00:48:01.630
<v Speaker 3>education because they have a direct </v>
<v Speaker 3>pipeline to kids,</v>

1022
00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.300
<v Speaker 3>but in terms of their effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>farmer pernicious.</v>

1023
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1024
00:48:04.901 --> 00:48:05.320
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.930
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but equally equally worked let's say,</v>

1026
00:48:07.931 --> 00:48:12.931
<v Speaker 3>but but more pernicious and the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are happening in the Canadian </v>

1027
00:48:12.931 --> 00:48:14.130
<v Speaker 3>education system as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that or so reprehensible,</v>

1028
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:19.190
<v Speaker 3>which we'll get to that because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening here too with these ideas </v>

1029
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.190
<v Speaker 3>filtered down to high school.</v>

1030
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I've been so focused on college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we're discovering the problem is </v>

1031
00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.400
<v Speaker 2>actually baked in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The liberal attitudes are often baked in</v>

1032
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:24.890
<v Speaker 2>by the time,</v>

1033
00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:25.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1034
00:48:25.581 --> 00:48:26.840
<v Speaker 3>And purposefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in,</v>

1035
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.020
<v Speaker 3>in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>increasingly the,</v>

1036
00:48:29.021 --> 00:48:34.021
<v Speaker 3>the radical leftists have control over </v>
<v Speaker 3>curriculum development and they're </v>

1037
00:48:34.021 --> 00:48:35.060
<v Speaker 3>starting to develop social justice </v>
<v Speaker 3>curriculum,</v>

1038
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:39.020
<v Speaker 3>which is what they call them for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for kindergarten kids.</v>

1039
00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:44.340
<v Speaker 3>So let's finish up the headrest academy </v>
<v Speaker 3>then we'll get back to the earlier </v>

1040
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:44.340
<v Speaker 3>grades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1041
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so originally three of us decided to put</v>

1042
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:50.580
<v Speaker 2>up a website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I invited all the other authors from </v>

1043
00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:50.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bbs paper.</v>

1044
00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.280
<v Speaker 2>We invited a few other people working on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1045
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:53.700
<v Speaker 2>And so for the first year we had this </v>
<v Speaker 2>project,</v>

1046
00:48:53.701 --> 00:48:56.230
<v Speaker 2>it was called Heterodoxacademy.org.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1047
00:48:56.231 --> 00:48:58.900
<v Speaker 2>we put the site up on about September </v>
<v Speaker 2>10th,</v>

1048
00:48:58.901 --> 00:49:03.901
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a 2015 and it was just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>community of researchers who are </v>

1049
00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:07.930
<v Speaker 2>studying the problem of the lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint diversity.</v>

1050
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:13.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five days later the protest start at </v>

1051
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.961
<v Speaker 2>Missouri.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are racially motivated protest </v>

1052
00:49:15.961 --> 00:49:18.520
<v Speaker 2>or protest about racial insensitivity in</v>
<v Speaker 2>racial problems at Missouri.</v>

1053
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at first it seemed like this is just</v>

1054
00:49:20.861 --> 00:49:23.110
<v Speaker 2>a Missouri prompt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but coming in the wake of course,</v>

1055
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.570
<v Speaker 2>of of Ferguson and all the videos we saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1056
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:28.060
<v Speaker 2>of unarmed black men being killed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>police,</v>

1057
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:33.600
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these concerns spread to other </v>

1058
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:33.600
<v Speaker 2>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The protests aren't just about race,</v>

1059
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:38.550
<v Speaker 2>but it was that fall of 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the Yale protest when the </v>

1060
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:41.860
<v Speaker 2>president of Yale validates their </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative that Yale's are racist place.</v>

1061
00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:46.030
<v Speaker 2>We have to reform Yale and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>spreads nationally and now suddenly this</v>

1062
00:49:46.031 --> 00:49:48.710
<v Speaker 2>is not just a faculty issue anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though it Heterodox Academy,</v>

1063
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.170
<v Speaker 2>we're mostly focused on the faculty were</v>
<v Speaker 2>now seeing it's a complex ecosystem with</v>

1064
00:49:53.171 --> 00:49:58.171
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of forces acting on </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities so that between 2015 and </v>

1065
00:49:58.171 --> 00:50:02.761
<v Speaker 2>2017,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the danger of speaking honestly about </v>

1066
00:50:02.761 --> 00:50:06.931
<v Speaker 2>what you think about an academic or </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual proposition has </v>

1067
00:50:06.931 --> 00:50:07.840
<v Speaker 2>skyrocketed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The risk of being mobbed,</v>

1068
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:12.870
<v Speaker 2>ostracized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>formally investigated by title nine </v>

1069
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:14.110
<v Speaker 2>people for each title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nine people here,</v>

1070
00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:16.060
<v Speaker 2>we're sitting here at Nyu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to any bathroom,</v>

1071
00:50:16.061 --> 00:50:16.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

1072
00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.880
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you on this floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to any bathroom.</v>

1073
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:23.881
<v Speaker 2>There's a sign telling students exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what number to call to report you or me </v>

1074
00:50:23.881 --> 00:50:27.100
<v Speaker 2>if we say something that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone takes to be a bias.</v>

1075
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:28.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have bias.</v>

1076
00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:31.390
<v Speaker 2>You have bias investigation teams here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1077
00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:36.480
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't got to that point at that </v>

1078
00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.400
<v Speaker 2>particular point in Canada yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we're farther ahead down that</v>

1079
00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:39.700
<v Speaker 2>path in some ways but not quite as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>and others.</v>

1080
00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really,</v>

1081
00:50:40.581 --> 00:50:42.860
<v Speaker 2>that's really unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So things are changing very,</v>

1082
00:50:42.861 --> 00:50:44.810
<v Speaker 2>very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not at all schools.</v>

1083
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then again,</v>

1084
00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:47.420
<v Speaker 2>things are changing so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't really know.</v>

1085
00:50:47.421 --> 00:50:49.550
<v Speaker 2>We don't have good data on what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1086
00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:55.090
<v Speaker 2>What I can tell you though is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Heterodoxacademy when we started out </v>

1087
00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:56.600
<v Speaker 2>in 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of suspicion.</v>

1088
00:50:56.601 --> 00:50:59.000
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people on the left were afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1089
00:50:59.001 --> 00:51:00.560
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this some right wing group?</v>

1090
00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.570
<v Speaker 2>Now very few of us are actually on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1091
00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because we end up mostly speaking up</v>

1092
00:51:05.901 --> 00:51:08.900
<v Speaker 2>for Libertarians and conservatives who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are attacked or silenced,</v>

1093
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:10.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will think,</v>

1094
00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:11.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we must be right wing,</v>

1095
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.720
<v Speaker 2>but we're not.</v>

1096
00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:12.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1097
00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.120
<v Speaker 2>I've never voted for a Republican in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

1098
00:51:14.121 --> 00:51:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I've never given money to Republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>

1099
00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm now increasingly calling myself a </v>

1100
00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:21.470
<v Speaker 2>liberal now that we see illiberalism </v>
<v Speaker 2>flourishing.</v>

1101
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so when we started out,</v>

1102
00:51:23.931 --> 00:51:28.160
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of suspicion of us from </v>
<v Speaker 2>many professors,</v>

1103
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 2>but now that it's clear that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

1104
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:33.410
<v Speaker 2>these are not just a few anecdotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the new normal,</v>

1105
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:35.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just in the university.</v>

1106
00:51:35.631 --> 00:51:36.860
<v Speaker 2>So as you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1107
00:51:36.861 --> 00:51:37.630
<v Speaker 2>It's reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading,</v>

1108
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.840
<v Speaker 2>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just in the U.</v>

1109
00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.720
<v Speaker 2>S it's spread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When in Twenty 15,</v>

1110
00:51:41.721 --> 00:51:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was uniquely American </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

1111
00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in Canada and the UK and Australia </v>

1112
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:48.260
<v Speaker 2>and New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1113
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.910
<v Speaker 2>It is a uniquely anglosphere problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is really interesting.</v>

1114
00:51:49.911 --> 00:51:51.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not on the continent very much at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

1115
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.540
<v Speaker 2>What about in the Nordic countries?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1116
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have.</v>

1117
00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:57.380
<v Speaker 2>So political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have lots of places.</v>

1118
00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:02.800
<v Speaker 2>The unique thing that identifies this </v>
<v Speaker 2>new culture is linking the political </v>

1119
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.941
<v Speaker 2>correctness with the sense of fragility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is something America's </v>

1120
00:52:06.941 --> 00:52:08.560
<v Speaker 2>pioneered the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1121
00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:10.550
<v Speaker 2>so the in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've always had,</v>

1122
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:11.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1123
00:52:11.241 --> 00:52:14.040
<v Speaker 2>no platforming they call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if there's an end,</v>

1124
00:52:14.041 --> 00:52:15.560
<v Speaker 2>there was an effort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>British National Party,</v>

1125
00:52:15.561 --> 00:52:17.170
<v Speaker 2>it's actual fascist party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1126
00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.060
<v Speaker 2>So if a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a BNP is going to speak on campus,</v>

1127
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.740
<v Speaker 2>mob him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shut it down.</v>

1128
00:52:21.741 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't give him a platform.</v>

1129
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:23.960
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1130
00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:27.440
<v Speaker 2>you've had passionate politics certainly</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the sixties.</v>

1131
00:52:27.441 --> 00:52:29.920
<v Speaker 2>So that's not new and that's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1132
00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:35.110
<v Speaker 2>what's new is the American idea that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone says something and it could be a</v>

1133
00:52:35.181 --> 00:52:38.060
<v Speaker 2>sincerely expressed idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a racist rant,</v>

1134
00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:39.160
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1135
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that maybe hormones do affect </v>

1136
00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:44.270
<v Speaker 2>gender behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you say that?</v>

1137
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:47.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if someone takes that as,</v>

1138
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:53.200
<v Speaker 2>as somehow essentially using gender and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then saying that women are inferior or </v>

1139
00:52:53.421 --> 00:52:54.110
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they don't.</v>

1140
00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Well happened to James Demora for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1141
00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1142
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.790
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1143
00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:02.990
<v Speaker 2>so that's what's new is the idea that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone says something that someone,</v>

1144
00:53:02.991 --> 00:53:06.110
<v Speaker 2>a member of a protected or marginalized </v>
<v Speaker 2>group is offended by,</v>

1145
00:53:06.111 --> 00:53:09.200
<v Speaker 2>that person is harmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that person has harmed,</v>

1146
00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.640
<v Speaker 2>we must protect that person and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>ominously just in the last year or two.</v>

1147
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that they're harming their</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>

1148
00:53:15.231 --> 00:53:18.110
<v Speaker 2>it's that this was violating his right </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>

1149
00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the postmodern narrative.</v>

1150
00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.760
<v Speaker 2>That and distributes whole thing to pass</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so dangerous.</v>

1151
00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.070
<v Speaker 2>The crossing the line into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into violence.</v>

1152
00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.490
<v Speaker 2>It just occurred to me just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday,</v>

1153
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:27.720
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

1154
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.930
<v Speaker 2>the state is supposed to have a monopoly</v>
<v Speaker 2>on violence,</v>

1155
00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:32.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if speech,</v>

1156
00:53:32.821 --> 00:53:35.070
<v Speaker 2>especially his speech and her speech and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people,</v>

1157
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.400
<v Speaker 2>the speech of those people in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>academic movement or on the and that,</v>

1158
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:43.880
<v Speaker 2>if their speech is violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the state is supposed to have a </v>

1159
00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:43.880
<v Speaker 2>monopoly on their speech then.</v>

1160
00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.350
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it's violence,</v>

1161
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:49.500
<v Speaker 2>well then we have a right to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence back.</v>

1162
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.690
<v Speaker 2>The state doesn't have a monopoly on </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence because our violence is,</v>

1163
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:54.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>morally motivated.</v>

1164
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:59.070
<v Speaker 2>So just the Orwellian and authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>implications of this move.</v>

1165
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Once you say that speech is violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're unlocking your opening Pandora's </v>

1166
00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:04.490
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your,</v>

1167
00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:08.100
<v Speaker 2>your five steps down the road to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd say we're about seven steps down</v>

1168
00:54:08.101 --> 00:54:08.890
<v Speaker 2>the road too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1169
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

1170
00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:11.550
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're that concerned about it.</v>

1171
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:14.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now tell me how many,</v>

1172
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.760
<v Speaker 2>how many members are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have to discuss any of this</v>

1173
00:54:17.761 --> 00:54:22.761
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how many members of Heterodox </v>

1174
00:54:22.761 --> 00:54:22.761
<v Speaker 2>Academy are there now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have 1300 members,</v>

1175
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:27.800
<v Speaker 2>so once we opened up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So originally it was just for </v>

1176
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:27.800
<v Speaker 2>researchers who were studying this </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

1177
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:30.150
<v Speaker 2>but we had lots of people wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>join and so we said,</v>

1178
00:54:30.151 --> 00:54:30.570
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1179
00:54:30.571 --> 00:54:31.020
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

1180
00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.160
<v Speaker 2>And so we just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1181
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:34.740
<v Speaker 2>if as long as you're a professor that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1182
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:37.440
<v Speaker 2>you have a phd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're living more or less the life of a</v>

1183
00:54:37.441 --> 00:54:39.150
<v Speaker 2>professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a university affiliation.</v>

1184
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:42.060
<v Speaker 2>So we now take adjuncts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they have a phd,</v>

1185
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:45.300
<v Speaker 2>we take postdocs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically if you're in the guild,</v>

1186
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:50.630
<v Speaker 2>if you're living the life of a professor</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're concerned about the rise of </v>

1187
00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:53.850
<v Speaker 2>intimidation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>

1188
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.930
<v Speaker 2>if you're concerned that our wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution I love,</v>

1189
00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:03.350
<v Speaker 2>I love being a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the academy and I feel like it's </v>

1190
00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:06.780
<v Speaker 2>not just losing public respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's losing its ability to function.</v>

1191
00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:10.350
<v Speaker 2>It's losing its ability to teach and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>research on politicized topics,</v>

1192
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:13.140
<v Speaker 2>so there were more politicized topics </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

1193
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:13.980
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>

1194
00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:15.420
<v Speaker 2>and there are a few in the natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>sciences,</v>

1195
00:55:15.421 --> 00:55:20.421
<v Speaker 2>not many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are some in the natural </v>

1196
00:55:20.421 --> 00:55:20.421
<v Speaker 2>sciences as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1197
00:55:20.421 --> 00:55:23.300
<v Speaker 2>my point is we're now growing very </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly and something I'm very excited </v>

1198
00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.271
<v Speaker 2>by is since we started having more </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence on campus with beginning with </v>

1199
00:55:26.271 --> 00:55:30.740
<v Speaker 2>birth and Middlebury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing a pervasive sense among </v>

1200
00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:34.340
<v Speaker 2>people on the left that there really is </v>
<v Speaker 2>this problem here that something has to </v>

1201
00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.110
<v Speaker 2>be done and so we are finding much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptance now.</v>

1202
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm from professors on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I like to think about there's the </v>

1203
00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:42.840
<v Speaker 2>liberal left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the great majority,</v>

1204
00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:48.140
<v Speaker 2>and there's the illiberal left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did a factor analysis of politically </v>

1205
00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.090
<v Speaker 2>correct beliefs and found exactly that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that the and that the illiberal left</v>

1206
00:55:51.091 --> 00:55:53.520
<v Speaker 2>was also high in orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1207
00:55:53.521 --> 00:55:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Just the authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1208
00:55:55.140 --> 00:56:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Predisposition and also kind of markedly</v>
<v Speaker 2>declined was also characterized by a </v>

1209
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:03.960
<v Speaker 2>market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of verbal intelligence.</v>

1210
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's point four.</v>

1211
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Well that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1212
00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:09.210
<v Speaker 2>that's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful.</v>

1213
00:56:09.211 --> 00:56:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the simplest formulation </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard really great formulation from</v>

1214
00:56:12.741 --> 00:56:17.741
<v Speaker 2>Mark Lilla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so mark Lilla wrote this fantastic op </v>

1215
00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:20.721
<v Speaker 2>Ed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times week after trump was </v>

1216
00:56:20.721 --> 00:56:21.660
<v Speaker 2>elected saying identity politics is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really foolish thing to do.</v>

1217
00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:24.580
<v Speaker 2>It pushes lots of people over to trump's</v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

1218
00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.380
<v Speaker 2>You have identity politics is part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>

1219
00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he writes this off Ed and one of his </v>

1220
00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:31.410
<v Speaker 2>fellow professors at Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget how she does it,</v>

1221
00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:33.520
<v Speaker 2>but she basically says something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1222
00:56:33.521 --> 00:56:35.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mask with eye holes,</v>

1223
00:56:35.321 --> 00:56:36.190
<v Speaker 2>falls from his face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1224
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:41.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a Ku Klux Klan member or something </v>

1225
00:56:41.191 --> 00:56:41.191
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1226
00:56:41.191 --> 00:56:42.430
<v Speaker 2>And so Lilla Lilla who isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanities,</v>

1227
00:56:42.431 --> 00:56:45.640
<v Speaker 2>he's an intellectual historian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lilla has this simple formulation.</v>

1228
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:48.340
<v Speaker 2>He says that's a slur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not an argument.</v>

1229
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:50.590
<v Speaker 2>And once they had that simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>formulation,</v>

1230
00:56:50.591 --> 00:56:51.490
<v Speaker 2>I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1231
00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:54.280
<v Speaker 2>that's almost all the pushback I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten.</v>

1232
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.620
<v Speaker 2>It's somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1233
00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:57.220
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1234
00:56:57.221 --> 00:57:01.660
<v Speaker 2>you're winking at Nazis or your comfort </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me over and over.</v>

1235
00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:06.690
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my neighborhood was just posters with </v>

1236
00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:06.690
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intimidation.</v>

1237
00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:08.290
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is really key.</v>

1238
00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:12.220
<v Speaker 2>We're supposed to be all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say anything you want,</v>

1239
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:14.680
<v Speaker 2>you can make any argument you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can support it,</v>

1240
00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:20.400
<v Speaker 2>if you can back it with reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is critical thinking and this is </v>

1241
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:20.400
<v Speaker 2>what we're supposed to train our </v>
<v Speaker 2>students to do.</v>

1242
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not only that you can say anything,</v>

1243
00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:24.460
<v Speaker 2>but you can say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a boundary on that,</v>

1244
00:57:24.461 --> 00:57:27.520
<v Speaker 2>which especially if you're a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less so in the humanities,</v>

1245
00:57:27.521 --> 00:57:32.521
<v Speaker 2>but if you're a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things you say have to be vetted by </v>

1246
00:57:32.521 --> 00:57:33.460
<v Speaker 2>people who are going to be critical of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1247
00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1248
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:39.450
<v Speaker 2>so not only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only there's accountability built </v>

1249
00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:39.450
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1250
00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:41.310
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't mean to say you can say </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want rant.</v>

1251
00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can put forth any idea you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

1252
00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:49.231
<v Speaker 2>if you can back it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're seeing with anything </v>

1253
00:57:49.231 --> 00:57:49.510
<v Speaker 2>politicize is it's not about backing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1254
00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Students are learning rhetorical </v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques to link their enemies to </v>

1255
00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:55.680
<v Speaker 2>something racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist,</v>

1256
00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:01.200
<v Speaker 2>contemptible sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are the things that are not </v>

1257
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:06.600
<v Speaker 2>only worthy of being destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you have a moral duty to </v>

1258
00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:06.600
<v Speaker 2>destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1259
00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:07.600
<v Speaker 2>So that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like the immune system,</v>

1260
00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:13.070
<v Speaker 2>how exactly works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some cell that tags Acel as </v>

1261
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:18.240
<v Speaker 2>enemy enemy and once that tag is put on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cell that attract other effort that </v>

1262
00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.200
<v Speaker 2>what kind of sell to mob it and so we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should look into this,</v>

1263
00:58:20.201 --> 00:58:22.510
<v Speaker 2>this metaphor of the immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because once they know,</v>

1264
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:26.650
<v Speaker 2>once you're labeled as a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the students don't have to read you that</v>

1265
00:58:26.651 --> 00:58:28.330
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter what you actually say.</v>

1266
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:32.050
<v Speaker 2>You will now be attached to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you're labeled that way,</v>

1267
00:58:32.051 --> 00:58:35.860
<v Speaker 2>if someone defends you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the label is contagious.</v>

1268
00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how we know we're in this super </v>

1269
00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:43.360
<v Speaker 2>religious territory of witch hunts that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you stand up for someone,</v>

1270
00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 2>you are tagged and then you will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>mobbed.</v>

1271
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.360
<v Speaker 2>And that's why there's so much that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why there's so much cowardice</v>

1272
00:58:49.361 --> 00:58:51.820
<v Speaker 2>on campus among both students and </v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty.</v>

1273
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:57.030
<v Speaker 2>People are afraid to stand up even if </v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority think that what's going on </v>

1274
00:58:57.030 --> 00:59:00.460
<v Speaker 2>is nuts or is unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're afraid to stand up and that's in</v>

1275
00:59:00.461 --> 00:59:03.160
<v Speaker 2>part due to social media because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

1276
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:08.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>students today had been raised with </v>

1277
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 2>various platforms that make it easy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to join in attacks,</v>

1278
00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:15.590
<v Speaker 2>someone they look at who liked what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if in that article we just saw on </v>

1279
00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:19.321
<v Speaker 2>read a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a bit of a counterrevolution </v>

1280
00:59:19.321 --> 00:59:21.890
<v Speaker 2>and read the students had to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>together somehow and decide should I </v>

1281
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:23.630
<v Speaker 2>like that post?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about if we all liked it at the same</v>

1282
00:59:23.631 --> 00:59:25.010
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we'll get in less trouble.</v>

1283
00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1284
00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:27.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to what degree.</v>

1285
00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:30.270
<v Speaker 3>So let's talk about the aims of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Heterodox Academy.</v>

1286
00:59:30.271 --> 00:59:35.271
<v Speaker 3>So you brought people together who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>in principle interested in a diversity </v>

1287
00:59:35.611 --> 00:59:40.611
<v Speaker 3>of opinions and but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in what manner is that going to be </v>

1288
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:41.460
<v Speaker 3>utilized to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1289
00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to use the word combat but </v>

1290
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:49.401
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to deal with this emergent problem </v>

1291
00:59:49.401 --> 00:59:49.401
<v Speaker 3>of ideological rigidity in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities.</v>

1292
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:52.670
<v Speaker 2>So two useful concepts here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the emperor's new clothes.</v>

1293
00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all know that story.</v>

1294
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Even if most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if everybody sees this is nuts,</v>

1295
00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:59.600
<v Speaker 2>the emperor's walking around with no </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes,</v>

1296
00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.630
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid to say it until one </v>
<v Speaker 2>person says it.</v>

1297
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.220
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is also the ash experiment,</v>

1298
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:06.710
<v Speaker 2>everybody says that that line is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same as that line.</v>

1299
01:00:06.711 --> 01:00:10.700
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If one person says the truth,</v>

1300
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:15.820
<v Speaker 2>then nobody conforms after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the mere presence of a group of </v>

1301
01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:16.250
<v Speaker 2>people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1302
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:21.280
<v Speaker 2>we actually need a diversity of opinions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that on our site we'll </v>

1303
01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.360
<v Speaker 2>publish things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes when professors are mob,</v>

1304
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:24.400
<v Speaker 2>like when Bret Weinstein was mobbed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1305
01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.180
<v Speaker 2>so I wrote an essay that stood up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1306
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done that for some of them.</v>

1307
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.270
<v Speaker 2>It's happening so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep up,</v>

1308
01:00:29.271 --> 01:00:30.590
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got books to write and I,</v>

1309
01:00:30.591 --> 01:00:32.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every week there's some new member who's</v>

1310
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:33.230
<v Speaker 2>getting mobbed.</v>

1311
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:36.140
<v Speaker 2>And so we're going to develop a team of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who will write.</v>

1312
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.780
<v Speaker 2>But just knowing that there are people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who will stand up for you.</v>

1313
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing that there are people who will </v>

1314
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:44.000
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>

1315
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:44.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1316
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.520
<v Speaker 2>this is not what we do in the academy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one things we just stand up </v>

1317
01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.461
<v Speaker 2>for each other too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is we develop products that we think can</v>

1318
01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:57.041
<v Speaker 2>basically fix the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of our products is called the </v>

1319
01:00:57.041 --> 01:01:01.031
<v Speaker 2>campus expression survey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a survey designed to actually </v>

1320
01:01:01.031 --> 01:01:03.590
<v Speaker 2>measure who was afraid of speaking up </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what topics and why,</v>

1321
01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:08.591
<v Speaker 2>what are they afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out everyone's afraid of </v>

1322
01:01:08.591 --> 01:01:08.591
<v Speaker 2>the students more than the faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1323
01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.190
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid of mostly to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

1324
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.500
<v Speaker 2>What about the administrators?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's afraid of the students.</v>

1325
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.320
<v Speaker 2>They're afraid of the students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't have,</v>

1326
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:17.600
<v Speaker 2>we have not sorted them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only surveyed students,</v>

1327
01:01:17.601 --> 01:01:22.601
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from what we hear people are afraid </v>

1328
01:01:22.601 --> 01:01:24.200
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the students,</v>

1329
01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:25.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1330
01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:30.130
<v Speaker 3>hauling in its own manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like was that failure of leadership?</v>

1331
01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:35.360
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They let those kids come into the </v>

1332
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.100
<v Speaker 3>classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual classroom and disrupt a class</v>

1333
01:01:36.101 --> 01:01:37.810
<v Speaker 3>on an ongoing basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1334
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.930
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I couldn't understand that exactly.</v>

1335
01:01:40.931 --> 01:01:45.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my response to that would be first I </v>

1336
01:01:45.931 --> 01:01:46.720
<v Speaker 3>would tell them to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second,</v>

1337
01:01:46.721 --> 01:01:48.790
<v Speaker 3>I would call campus security.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Third,</v>

1338
01:01:48.791 --> 01:01:51.190
<v Speaker 3>if something wasn't done about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wouldn't teach the class.</v>

1339
01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:56.400
<v Speaker 3>So I don't understand like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that it's also up to </v>

1340
01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.611
<v Speaker 3>individual professors to draw a line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that if you're being </v>

1341
01:01:59.611 --> 01:02:00.370
<v Speaker 3>intimidated dated by students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you,</v>

1342
01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.520
<v Speaker 3>why do you show up and teach the class?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand that.</v>

1343
01:02:03.521 --> 01:02:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1344
01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:09.100
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are afraid to stand up if it </v>

1345
01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.070
<v Speaker 2>means that people will call you a racist</v>

1346
01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.370
<v Speaker 3>cabot garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1347
01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:15.390
<v Speaker 3>it's weird in that situation though </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's carried to enroll her to go</v>

1348
01:02:15.391 --> 01:02:16.740
<v Speaker 3>to your class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1349
01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:21.860
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a much more proximal </v>

1350
01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:21.860
<v Speaker 3>threats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I mean.</v>

1351
01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:21.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm most alarming</v>

1352
01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:25.910
<v Speaker 2>by is the rise of intimidation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intimidation is now a factor in many </v>

1353
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:27.290
<v Speaker 2>aspects of academic life and that's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

1354
01:02:27.291 --> 01:02:31.010
<v Speaker 2>That's completely incompatible with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with what we do and who we are.</v>

1355
01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:32.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's especially,</v>

1356
01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:37.290
<v Speaker 3>it's especially appalling given that </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever happens in the university </v>

1357
01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:40.510
<v Speaker 3>campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the Christians I'd faced in </v>

1358
01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:42.961
<v Speaker 3>Canada as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should we care about what's </v>

1359
01:02:42.961 --> 01:02:45.571
<v Speaker 3>happening in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Ivy Tower is going to hire these </v>

1360
01:02:45.571 --> 01:02:45.571
<v Speaker 3>people next year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are.</v>

1361
01:02:45.571 --> 01:02:45.571
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1362
01:02:45.571 --> 01:02:50.521
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the heart like what's happening in </v>

1363
01:02:50.521 --> 01:02:50.521
<v Speaker 3>the campus is going to happen in society</v>
<v Speaker 3>in five years.</v>

1364
01:02:50.521 --> 01:02:51.940
<v Speaker 3>It's already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's already happened.</v>

1365
01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:53.550
<v Speaker 3>This is actually an important point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1366
01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:54.670
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just gave a talk,</v>

1367
01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:58.580
<v Speaker 2>get a at a big law firm here in New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're very devoted to diversity,</v>

1368
01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.830
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really thinking about diversity.</v>

1369
01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Why is diversity good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And say have a whole month on viewpoint </v>

1370
01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:05.860
<v Speaker 2>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just fantastic.</v>

1371
01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>And what I'm learning from talking to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of people in the business world </v>

1372
01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:14.440
<v Speaker 2>is that in the last year they're now all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these pressures on leaders to endorse </v>

1373
01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:19.991
<v Speaker 2>this condemned that sign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this open letter and through human </v>

1374
01:03:19.991 --> 01:03:20.180
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1375
01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:25.360
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's the same dynamic we have on </v>

1376
01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:25.490
<v Speaker 2>campus and the answer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if anybody,</v>

1377
01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.290
<v Speaker 2>anybody watching here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you run a business,</v>

1378
01:03:27.291 --> 01:03:29.630
<v Speaker 2>if you have friends who are in business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the only,</v>

1379
01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:30.280
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1380
01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are only two stable equilibria.</v>

1381
01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:37.540
<v Speaker 2>One is that every organization is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>either all right when we're all left </v>

1382
01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:37.540
<v Speaker 2>wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that will be disastrous.</v>

1383
01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:38.960
<v Speaker 2>So either you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1384
01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:44.020
<v Speaker 2>we're on one side that we terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other is what we call the Chicago </v>

1385
01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:48.071
<v Speaker 2>principles of free expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The University of Chicago has the best </v>

1386
01:03:48.071 --> 01:03:51.371
<v Speaker 2>statement out there on how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university provides a platform on which </v>

1387
01:03:51.371 --> 01:03:55.040
<v Speaker 2>multiple views can contest the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university does not take anyone's side.</v>

1388
01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:57.860
<v Speaker 2>That's the only other stable </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative.</v>

1389
01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:00.560
<v Speaker 2>And I think leaders need to do this in </v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

1390
01:04:00.561 --> 01:04:03.350
<v Speaker 2>It certainly universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're encouraging every university to</v>

1391
01:04:03.351 --> 01:04:07.530
<v Speaker 2>adopt the Chicago principles because a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of what mass action is,</v>

1392
01:04:07.531 --> 01:04:12.531
<v Speaker 2>is an attempt to compel the authority to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come in on your side and punish your </v>

1393
01:04:12.531 --> 01:04:12.900
<v Speaker 2>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1394
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:15.180
<v Speaker 3>And so that has to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can go how,</v>

1395
01:04:15.181 --> 01:04:18.270
<v Speaker 3>how effectively is the Chicago statement</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1396
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:22.470
<v Speaker 3>on how effectively is the Chicago </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement being disseminated?</v>

1397
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.810
<v Speaker 3>How rapidly our universities signing up</v>

1398
01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.060
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or um,</v>

1399
01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:29.210
<v Speaker 2>there a few signed on early in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole crisis.</v>

1400
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:32.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm a purdue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're about 10 or 15 that have,</v>

1401
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:34.370
<v Speaker 2>that have endorsed it or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1402
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not enough to just endorse </v>

1403
01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.441
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you have leadership that's </v>

1404
01:04:41.441 --> 01:04:43.430
<v Speaker 2>committed to creating an open platform </v>
<v Speaker 2>in which people can disagree.</v>

1405
01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1406
01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:49.500
<v Speaker 2>and one sense very encouraging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been invited by a number of </v>

1407
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.380
<v Speaker 2>university presidents to come speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have all kinds of,</v>

1408
01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:56.480
<v Speaker 2>of innovation to Heterodox Academy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>foster a more inclusive climate in which</v>

1409
01:04:56.481 --> 01:04:59.390
<v Speaker 2>people can actually engage with </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>

1410
01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:04.870
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the university leaders were </v>

1411
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:07.901
<v Speaker 2>very slow to react.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to alienate certain </v>

1412
01:05:07.901 --> 01:05:11.411
<v Speaker 2>factions of students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're almost all reasonable </v>

1413
01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:12.260
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're almost all liberal left.</v>

1414
01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not illiberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're horrified by what's going on.</v>

1415
01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:17.210
<v Speaker 2>They know they're sitting on top of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>powder.</v>

1416
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:21.550
<v Speaker 2>They don't want things to blow up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their face as happened at Evergreen.</v>

1417
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:23.740
<v Speaker 2>So this brings us to our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1418
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:24.820
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another product,</v>

1419
01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:28.210
<v Speaker 2>the one that we're most excited by a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just went online,</v>

1420
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:28.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1421
01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:29.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

1422
01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called the open mind platform.</v>

1423
01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:37.561
<v Speaker 2>If you go to open mind platform.org,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find we've developed a,</v>

1424
01:05:38.570 --> 01:05:43.570
<v Speaker 2>an APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a whole library of readings and </v>

1425
01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:44.890
<v Speaker 2>videos who developed an APP that guides </v>
<v Speaker 2>you through.</v>

1426
01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:50.250
<v Speaker 2>We don't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how engaged with different </v>

1427
01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:51.630
<v Speaker 2>viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We start by saying why is it good and we</v>

1428
01:05:51.631 --> 01:05:54.010
<v Speaker 2>make the case that you need this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody needs this.</v>

1429
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:55.960
<v Speaker 2>And to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1430
01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.310
<v Speaker 2>we remind people that we're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically self righteous hypocrites.</v>

1431
01:06:00.311 --> 01:06:05.311
<v Speaker 2>We have quotes from wisdom traditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world and we've all heard </v>

1432
01:06:05.311 --> 01:06:05.311
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just a little bit of a,</v>

1433
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:10.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can call it emotional manipulation </v>

1434
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.001
<v Speaker 2>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just get people into a mindset in </v>

1435
01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:12.430
<v Speaker 2>which they're willing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1436
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm down.</v>

1437
01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:16.960
<v Speaker 2>We're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all a on to self righteous here.</v>

1438
01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.410
<v Speaker 2>And then we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we teach them some psychology about</v>

1439
01:06:20.411 --> 01:06:23.980
<v Speaker 2>motivated reasoning and only then do we </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach them to engage with views that are</v>

1440
01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:27.680
<v Speaker 2>not their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've already run this in about 15 to</v>

1441
01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:28.970
<v Speaker 2>20 classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1442
01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:31.450
<v Speaker 2>the results so far look promising that </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of it,</v>

1443
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.940
<v Speaker 2>the measures show that students are more</v>
<v Speaker 2>open to other ideas.</v>

1444
01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:39.270
<v Speaker 2>So the open my platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think is a tool that we think a </v>

1445
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:40.530
<v Speaker 2>lot of universities are going to adopt </v>
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>

1446
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:41.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of interest in it.</v>

1447
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:47.950
<v Speaker 3>If there's leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the professors generally do support </v>

1448
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:51.850
<v Speaker 3>viewpoint diversity and open inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we change freshmen orientation so </v>

1449
01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:55.430
<v Speaker 3>that students are trained first and </v>
<v Speaker 3>foremost in how to step back,</v>

1450
01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:57.920
<v Speaker 3>give people the benefit of the doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be open minded.</v>

1451
01:06:57.921 --> 01:07:02.180
<v Speaker 3>If we do that first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that's like behavioral exposure</v>

1452
01:07:02.181 --> 01:07:03.140
<v Speaker 3>to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1453
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:08.170
<v Speaker 3>The idea would be that if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're afraid or disgusted by </v>

1454
01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:11.210
<v Speaker 3>something that you don't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate treatment,</v>

1455
01:07:11.211 --> 01:07:16.211
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the treatment is necessary because </v>

1456
01:07:16.211 --> 01:07:18.131
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you'll isolate yourself in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways that you already described and </v>

1457
01:07:18.131 --> 01:07:18.770
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that brief exposure.</v>

1458
01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Voluntary exposure's going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best curative.</v>

1459
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:25.750
<v Speaker 3>That's the opposite of the safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Id exactly need to be protected.</v>

1460
01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:30.830
<v Speaker 3>Safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The safe space idea is the worst thing </v>

1461
01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:30.830
<v Speaker 3>you could possibly do for the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>people you're trying to.</v>

1462
01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly mean to psychology,</v>

1463
01:07:31.971 --> 01:07:36.971
<v Speaker 3>what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the psychology behind safe spaces and </v>

1464
01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:40.151
<v Speaker 3>microaggressions is just the exact </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite of what we should be doing if </v>

1465
01:07:40.151 --> 01:07:41.540
<v Speaker 3>we want to create kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially black kids,</v>

1466
01:07:41.541 --> 01:07:43.510
<v Speaker 3>gay kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we made whatever.</v>

1467
01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.550
<v Speaker 3>If you think that they are vulnerable to</v>
<v Speaker 3>more stigma,</v>

1468
01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:49.100
<v Speaker 3>more conflict if you think that they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable,</v>

1469
01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:54.160
<v Speaker 3>that's especially when a safe space will</v>
<v Speaker 3>be temporarily pleasant,</v>

1470
01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:55.530
<v Speaker 3>but in the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad for.</v>

1471
01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the critical issue too with </v>

1472
01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.531
<v Speaker 3>regards to safe spaces is that there are</v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrificing the medium and longterm of </v>

1473
01:08:02.531 --> 01:08:07.280
<v Speaker 3>the students' wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say to the short term lack of fear</v>

1474
01:08:07.281 --> 01:08:09.770
<v Speaker 3>and conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their infant dialyzing them essentially.</v>

1475
01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.690
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1476
01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:12.920
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

1477
01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:18.040
<v Speaker 3>so I was thinking about discussion idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a personality test online now </v>

1478
01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:21.410
<v Speaker 3>that's based on this big five aspect </v>
<v Speaker 3>scale,</v>

1479
01:08:21.411 --> 01:08:24.830
<v Speaker 3>but it might be interesting as something</v>
<v Speaker 3>for us to think about to do,</v>

1480
01:08:24.831 --> 01:08:29.831
<v Speaker 3>find people who are high in openness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>low in conscientiousness or orderliness </v>

1481
01:08:29.831 --> 01:08:34.330
<v Speaker 3>and offer them the opportunity to engage</v>
<v Speaker 3>in dialogue with people who have the </v>

1482
01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:35.410
<v Speaker 3>opposite personality traits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1483
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:36.680
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1484
01:08:36.681 --> 01:08:38.300
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're going to run into people</v>

1485
01:08:38.301 --> 01:08:39.580
<v Speaker 3>like that always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1486
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.530
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1487
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:45.630
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe even establish a relationship </v>

1488
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:47.630
<v Speaker 3>with them inadvertently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so being able to tolerate that might</v>

1489
01:08:47.631 --> 01:08:52.631
<v Speaker 3>give them the kind of insight that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>said you developed when you realized </v>

1490
01:08:52.631 --> 01:08:55.751
<v Speaker 3>that the conservative ethos was based on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a reasonable but not complete set of,</v>

1491
01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.870
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of beneficial axiomatic presuppositions.</v>

1492
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.640
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

1493
01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:04.100
<v Speaker 3>so now this is pretty much taken over </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>

1494
01:09:04.101 --> 01:09:07.010
<v Speaker 3>this heterodox academy as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing.</v>

1495
01:09:07.011 --> 01:09:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Now you're writing a couple of new </v>
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>

1496
01:09:08.451 --> 01:09:09.690
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1497
01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.090
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1498
01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.490
<v Speaker 2>so since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was in the psychology department at</v>

1499
01:09:13.491 --> 01:09:18.110
<v Speaker 2>the University of Virginia for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 17 years and one of my book,</v>

1500
01:09:18.111 --> 01:09:23.111
<v Speaker 2>the righteous mind was coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to move to New York City for a </v>

1501
01:09:23.111 --> 01:09:24.830
<v Speaker 2>year so I could do promotional work for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and I just had,</v>

1502
01:09:24.831 --> 01:09:29.831
<v Speaker 2>my second child was just born and I knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be hard to fly from </v>

1503
01:09:29.831 --> 01:09:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Charlottesville.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just happened to get a position,</v>

1504
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:32.840
<v Speaker 2>temporary position here at Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the business school.</v>

1505
01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I first arrived I wasn't that </v>

1506
01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:38.280
<v Speaker 2>interested in business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1507
01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.430
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as I got here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>occupy Wall Street happened and suddenly</v>

1508
01:09:40.431 --> 01:09:43.760
<v Speaker 2>it was like everyone's talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality and politics and capitalism and</v>

1509
01:09:43.761 --> 01:09:48.761
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I started learning about the </v>

1510
01:09:48.761 --> 01:09:50.891
<v Speaker 2>history of capitalism and I knew nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it was fascinating and I started </v>

1511
01:09:50.891 --> 01:09:54.120
<v Speaker 2>seeing how free enterprise free markets </v>
<v Speaker 2>have helped raise,</v>

1512
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:56.270
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raise living standards around the world.</v>

1513
01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1514
01:09:57.490 --> 01:10:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Poverty in a staggeringly rapid fashion </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's completely unprecedented threat,</v>

1515
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.090
<v Speaker 3>especially since the year 2000.</v>

1516
01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:05.520
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So since,</v>

1517
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:06.280
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1518
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:11.290
<v Speaker 2>here I was 48 years old discovering it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing about it was like when I first </v>

1519
01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:11.780
<v Speaker 2>learned about evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wow,</v>

1520
01:10:11.781 --> 01:10:16.070
<v Speaker 2>this explains everything in the natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and learning about capitalism.</v>

1521
01:10:16.071 --> 01:10:21.071
<v Speaker 2>Business explained everything about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>built world and the world that we </v>

1522
01:10:21.071 --> 01:10:21.110
<v Speaker 2>actually live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1523
01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:24.170
<v Speaker 2>and they were also all these business </v>
<v Speaker 2>scandals.</v>

1524
01:10:24.171 --> 01:10:29.171
<v Speaker 2>This was 2011 and the wake of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial crisis and I saw a huge </v>

1525
01:10:29.171 --> 01:10:33.010
<v Speaker 2>opening to begin applying moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology to help corporations have </v>

1526
01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:34.180
<v Speaker 2>better ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1527
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:39.250
<v Speaker 2>so I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I do involves applying moral </v>

1528
01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:39.920
<v Speaker 2>psychology to help complex systems work </v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

1529
01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:45.040
<v Speaker 2>so I've been focused on political </v>
<v Speaker 2>polarization and governance for years </v>

1530
01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:48.251
<v Speaker 2>before then and that led to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>righteous mind and then I got here to </v>

1531
01:10:48.251 --> 01:10:52.181
<v Speaker 2>Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they offered me a job during that first </v>

1532
01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:52.181
<v Speaker 2>year and I took it and it's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic.</v>

1533
01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:52.700
<v Speaker 2>It's been really exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a whole new,</v>

1534
01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.700
<v Speaker 2>almost like being back in Grad school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole bunch of new things to learn.</v>

1535
01:10:55.830 --> 01:11:00.830
<v Speaker 2>You must be a kind of a shock and </v>
<v Speaker 2>existential shock to be in a business </v>

1536
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.830
<v Speaker 2>school in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1537
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:01.280
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a shock.</v>

1538
01:11:01.281 --> 01:11:06.281
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a different culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much more open in the sense that </v>

1539
01:11:06.281 --> 01:11:06.890
<v Speaker 2>it's so diverse like the things people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing,</v>

1540
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:12.130
<v Speaker 2>there's not like a way that we do things</v>
<v Speaker 2>here and it's much more open to applied </v>

1541
01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:13.470
<v Speaker 2>projects to actually to applied </v>
<v Speaker 2>projects.</v>

1542
01:11:13.471 --> 01:11:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was a perfect time for me.</v>

1543
01:11:14.941 --> 01:11:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1544
01:11:15.661 --> 01:11:20.661
<v Speaker 2>the righteous mind that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wraps up like the first half of my </v>

1545
01:11:20.661 --> 01:11:23.181
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everything I did is in that book </v>

1546
01:11:23.181 --> 01:11:25.580
<v Speaker 2>and now it's time for something new and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that new thing was going to be I'm </v>

1547
01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:29.240
<v Speaker 2>looking at how morality or moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology both underlines or,</v>

1548
01:11:29.241 --> 01:11:34.241
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is the foundation for our ability to </v>

1549
01:11:34.241 --> 01:11:34.590
<v Speaker 2>do capitalism like contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reciprocity,</v>

1550
01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:35.220
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of things.</v>

1551
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:36.750
<v Speaker 2>And how are left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1552
01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Divide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1553
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.610
<v Speaker 2>from the righteous mind makes it hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>for us to figure out what's true.</v>

1554
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:45.150
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're raised the minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that help or hurt the working poor?</v>

1555
01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're an economist on the left,</v>

1556
01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:48.570
<v Speaker 2>obviously helps them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're on the right,</v>

1557
01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:53.571
<v Speaker 2>it obviously hurts them because fewer of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them have jobs and you can gerrymander </v>

1558
01:11:53.571 --> 01:11:55.590
<v Speaker 2>the measurement devices to reduce the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusions that you want,</v>

1559
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.210
<v Speaker 2>which is a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1560
01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.480
<v Speaker 2>So I'm supposed to be writing a book </v>
<v Speaker 2>called three stories about capitalism,</v>

1561
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:05.630
<v Speaker 2>the moral psychology of economic life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I started traveling around the </v>

1562
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:08.250
<v Speaker 2>world looking at how development is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going in various countries.</v>

1563
01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:13.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a three month trip to Asia in </v>

1564
01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:13.440
<v Speaker 2>2015.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came back from Asia,</v>

1565
01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.140
<v Speaker 2>my article came out with [inaudible] off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the colony,</v>

1566
01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:18.210
<v Speaker 2>American mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bbs article was published,</v>

1567
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:19.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

1568
01:12:19.171 --> 01:12:20.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we can get back to this,</v>

1569
01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it in this capitalism book.</v>

1570
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:26.900
<v Speaker 2>And then the university is kind of began</v>
<v Speaker 2>melting down in the fall and then we </v>

1571
01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:27.450
<v Speaker 2>started heterodox academy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yes,</v>

1572
01:12:27.451 --> 01:12:28.770
<v Speaker 2>it has taken over my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1573
01:12:28.771 --> 01:12:32.930
<v Speaker 2>it's basically a full time job in </v>
<v Speaker 2>addition to trying to write the.</v>

1574
01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:38.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm also working on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so looking on it and I didn't want to </v>

1575
01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.480
<v Speaker 2>turn our article into a book because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought we'd said everything but men </v>

1576
01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:45.411
<v Speaker 2>have things been happening fast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've learned so much more since we </v>

1577
01:12:45.411 --> 01:12:45.480
<v Speaker 2>wrote that article and that article </v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1578
01:12:45.481 --> 01:12:46.020
<v Speaker 2>how long?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1579
01:12:46.021 --> 01:12:51.021
<v Speaker 2>we wrote it in late 2014 and then we </v>
<v Speaker 2>edit it in early 2015 and it finally </v>

1580
01:12:51.021 --> 01:12:52.740
<v Speaker 2>came out in August of 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1581
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:55.290
<v Speaker 2>and so in our last October,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg,</v>

1582
01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote to me and said,</v>

1583
01:12:56.491 --> 01:13:01.491
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I do want to turn the article </v>

1584
01:13:01.491 --> 01:13:01.491
<v Speaker 2>into a book because we know so much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>now and it's,</v>

1585
01:13:01.491 --> 01:13:04.110
<v Speaker 2>the problem is so much more serious than</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was any evidence.</v>

1586
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:06.420
<v Speaker 2>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence about mental,</v>

1587
01:13:06.421 --> 01:13:09.690
<v Speaker 2>the mental health crisis of adolescence </v>
<v Speaker 2>when Greg and I wrote the article,</v>

1588
01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:10.680
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1589
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:15.890
<v Speaker 2>we saw lots of hints that depression and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety were going way up and we think </v>

1590
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:17.910
<v Speaker 2>that's related to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overprotection yeah,</v>

1591
01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:18.480
<v Speaker 2>part two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1592
01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:20.370
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about that just for a sec and</v>

1593
01:13:20.371 --> 01:13:25.371
<v Speaker 2>then go back to the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've got a potential demographic </v>

1594
01:13:25.371 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 2>explanation for that in part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1595
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:27.780
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if you guys have looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>into this or not.</v>

1596
01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1597
01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:31.710
<v Speaker 2>there's two things that I think might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>contributing to it.</v>

1598
01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:38.540
<v Speaker 2>One is two or three things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the average age at which children</v>

1599
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:43.140
<v Speaker 2>are the average age at which people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>children has gone way up.</v>

1600
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:43.830
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1601
01:13:43.831 --> 01:13:48.831
<v Speaker 2>So why does that matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all because I think people get </v>

1602
01:13:48.831 --> 01:13:49.080
<v Speaker 2>more conservative and cautious as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>get older a little bit,</v>

1603
01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:51.510
<v Speaker 2>but that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a very small effect and it's,</v>

1604
01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:54.000
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the having of the kids,</v>

1605
01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:55.560
<v Speaker 2>which is what makes them more </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>

1606
01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.260
<v Speaker 2>When you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are more threat sensitive,</v>

1607
01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.060
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to vote for the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>wing party.</v>

1608
01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:04.350
<v Speaker 2>So just delaying child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>child a childbirth wouldn't.</v>

1609
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>

1610
01:14:05.311 --> 01:14:07.260
<v Speaker 2>what about fewer siblings?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would.</v>

1611
01:14:07.261 --> 01:14:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it.</v>

1612
01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what we're seeing in Asia </v>

1613
01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:13.980
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have a lot of kids,</v>

1614
01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:17.940
<v Speaker 2>you're not quite as worried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have all your eggs in one </v>

1615
01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:17.940
<v Speaker 2>basket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1616
01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.090
<v Speaker 2>and you can't quite as worried and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>siblings raised each other.</v>

1617
01:14:19.091 --> 01:14:19.720
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1618
01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:23.080
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a lot of keystrokes </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1619
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the free play and the fighting,</v>

1620
01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:28.960
<v Speaker 2>the working things out for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are essential skills of adulthood.</v>

1621
01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So see,</v>

1622
01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:30.620
<v Speaker 2>so then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1623
01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:32.850
<v Speaker 2>So smaller family sizes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of it.</v>

1624
01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:33.490
<v Speaker 2>Agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1625
01:14:33.491 --> 01:14:38.491
<v Speaker 2>and then also what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly in schools is that kids </v>

1626
01:14:38.491 --> 01:14:39.840
<v Speaker 2>aren't allowed free play and there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain not even allowed.</v>

1627
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Rough and tumble free play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which that's right.</v>

1628
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:47.910
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the biggest things about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the two that there are three giant </v>

1629
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.910
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of.</v>

1630
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:51.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is such actually it's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun puzzle because it's like the biggest</v>

1631
01:14:51.491 --> 01:14:56.491
<v Speaker 2>social science puzzle of our age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is happening that's making so many </v>

1632
01:14:56.491 --> 01:14:57.820
<v Speaker 2>of our systems go haywire and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing on the university.</v>

1633
01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.790
<v Speaker 2>The big three I would say are one is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>loss of,</v>

1634
01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:02.810
<v Speaker 2>of free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of unsupervised freeplay.</v>

1635
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Peter Gray has been brilliant on </v>

1636
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.411
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a Boston college showing how even </v>

1637
01:15:10.411 --> 01:15:10.890
<v Speaker 2>among young animals they have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice the skills for adulthood.</v>

1638
01:15:10.891 --> 01:15:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And getting in,</v>

1639
01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.330
<v Speaker 2>showing that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1640
01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:18.600
<v Speaker 2>So getting in conflicts and then dealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it and sometimes losing and you </v>

1641
01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:23.401
<v Speaker 2>come back having game in which there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem but you have to work it out or </v>

1642
01:15:23.401 --> 01:15:23.401
<v Speaker 2>the game stars.</v>

1643
01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what kids always did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only recently in the nine,</v>

1644
01:15:26.171 --> 01:15:31.171
<v Speaker 2>beginning in the nineties that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're always supervised because we're </v>

1645
01:15:31.171 --> 01:15:32.350
<v Speaker 2>afraid if we take our eyes off them </v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be kidnapped and that was never</v>

1646
01:15:32.351 --> 01:15:33.630
<v Speaker 2>a risk was never a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1647
01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:38.640
<v Speaker 2>I've kind of wondered about this gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>flexibility issue as a form of delayed </v>

1648
01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.130
<v Speaker 2>fantasy play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1649
01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:43.420
<v Speaker 2>And let me go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it looks to me like that is,</v>

1650
01:15:43.421 --> 01:15:45.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when kids are little and three and four,</v>

1651
01:15:45.551 --> 01:15:50.551
<v Speaker 2>say three to seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do a tremendous amount of identity </v>

1652
01:15:50.551 --> 01:15:50.551
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1653
01:15:50.551 --> 01:15:52.810
<v Speaker 2>they pretend they're animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pretend they're their parents,</v>

1654
01:15:52.811 --> 01:15:53.240
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1655
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:54.790
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pretend they're girls.</v>

1656
01:15:54.791 --> 01:15:56.260
<v Speaker 2>If they're boys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pretend they're boys.</v>

1657
01:15:56.261 --> 01:15:59.500
<v Speaker 2>If they're girls like they really do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of identity play.</v>

1658
01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:02.440
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that's been really</v>
<v Speaker 2>puzzling me is,</v>

1659
01:16:02.441 --> 01:16:04.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens if that isn't,</v>

1660
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:09.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they never have an opportunity for </v>

1661
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.750
<v Speaker 2>that because they're not engaging in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasy play,</v>

1662
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:10.930
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just delayed till adulthood.</v>

1663
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

1664
01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:17.100
<v Speaker 2>So because plate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible to overstate the </v>

1665
01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:20.071
<v Speaker 2>importance of that rough and tumble play</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the fantasy play that enables </v>

1666
01:16:20.071 --> 01:16:24.391
<v Speaker 2>you to adopt different identities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the negotiated games that you </v>

1667
01:16:24.391 --> 01:16:25.930
<v Speaker 2>talked about that enabled people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>handle both,</v>

1668
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:27.970
<v Speaker 2>both victory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even more importantly,</v>

1669
01:16:27.971 --> 01:16:28.930
<v Speaker 2>last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1670
01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:31.060
<v Speaker 2>So that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could well be.</v>

1671
01:16:31.061 --> 01:16:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I know that I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no opinion on,</v>

1672
01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:35.950
<v Speaker 2>but the big three factors that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>are explaining,</v>

1673
01:16:35.951 --> 01:16:38.500
<v Speaker 2>explaining part of what's happening on </v>
<v Speaker 2>campus are one,</v>

1674
01:16:38.501 --> 01:16:42.280
<v Speaker 2>the loss of the unsupervised place so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the kids have always,</v>

1675
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:47.310
<v Speaker 2>there's always an adult present and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they come to college and they expect </v>

1676
01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:47.310
<v Speaker 2>there to be an adult and dean somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a conflict.</v>

1677
01:16:47.410 --> 01:16:52.410
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two is social media which hit just as </v>

1678
01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:53.020
<v Speaker 2>ign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ign,</v>

1679
01:16:53.050 --> 01:16:55.120
<v Speaker 2>Internet generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Jean twinkies work,</v>

1680
01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to,</v>

1681
01:16:56.230 --> 01:17:01.230
<v Speaker 2>we used to think that I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to think that the millennial </v>

1682
01:17:01.301 --> 01:17:06.301
<v Speaker 2>generation ends in 1998 or 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but gene 20 shows a looking at for large</v>

1683
01:17:07.271 --> 01:17:12.271
<v Speaker 2>data sets that birth year 1995 kids born</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1995 and after are really different.</v>

1684
01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:18.640
<v Speaker 2>They're values are different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have much higher rates of anxiety </v>

1685
01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.700
<v Speaker 2>and depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the girls.</v>

1686
01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Boys have gone up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grows,</v>

1687
01:17:20.531 --> 01:17:22.610
<v Speaker 2>gone way up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1688
01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:26.480
<v Speaker 2>and the reason seems to be that facebook</v>
<v Speaker 2>lowered its age.</v>

1689
01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1690
01:17:27.670 --> 01:17:32.670
<v Speaker 2>so in 2005 you had to be a college </v>
<v Speaker 2>student at a certain number of colleges </v>

1691
01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:37.751
<v Speaker 2>to get facebook in 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be any 11 year old who lies and </v>

1692
01:17:38.001 --> 01:17:40.220
<v Speaker 2>says that she's 13 and you've got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook account,</v>

1693
01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:42.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1694
01:17:42.141 --> 01:17:44.060
<v Speaker 2>but then you're using on your parent's </v>
<v Speaker 2>pc,</v>

1695
01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:49.420
<v Speaker 2>it's in 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The iphone comes out and it saturates </v>

1696
01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.570
<v Speaker 2>the market faster than any consumer </v>
<v Speaker 2>product ever has.</v>

1697
01:17:50.690 --> 01:17:52.490
<v Speaker 2>So by 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 or 11,</v>

1698
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:57.790
<v Speaker 2>a lot of adolescents have have facebook </v>
<v Speaker 2>and other social platforms and this is </v>

1699
01:17:58.881 --> 01:18:02.450
<v Speaker 2>just devastating especially to girls </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not texting.</v>

1700
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.400
<v Speaker 2>Texting is just me to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1701
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:05.990
<v Speaker 2>that's back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine that,</v>

1702
01:18:05.991 --> 01:18:06.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1703
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:07.850
<v Speaker 2>when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you called your friends on the phone,</v>

1704
01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:08.540
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1705
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:10.750
<v Speaker 2>The problem seems to be according to </v>
<v Speaker 2>twinkie,</v>

1706
01:18:10.751 --> 01:18:15.110
<v Speaker 2>it's especially platforms in which he </v>
<v Speaker 2>puts something out and then you wait and</v>

1707
01:18:15.111 --> 01:18:20.111
<v Speaker 2>see what everyone says and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially as damaging to girls who </v>

1708
01:18:20.111 --> 01:18:21.920
<v Speaker 2>already are at risk of eating disorders </v>
<v Speaker 2>and image disorders.</v>

1709
01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:26.210
<v Speaker 2>So girls become more susceptible to </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion when they hit puberty.</v>

1710
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1711
01:18:26.611 --> 01:18:27.680
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1712
01:18:27.681 --> 01:18:28.790
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always been the case.</v>

1713
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Then there's another issue too with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to female aggression.</v>

1714
01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:36.940
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's clearly the case that males are </v>

1715
01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:40.370
<v Speaker 2>more likely to be physically damaging </v>
<v Speaker 2>slash aggressive than females are.</v>

1716
01:18:40.371 --> 01:18:43.280
<v Speaker 2>But what females use his reputation </v>
<v Speaker 2>savaging.</v>

1717
01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:44.130
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's Nikki.</v>

1718
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Nikki crikey passed away a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago showed that if you add it all </v>

1719
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:50.000
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boys and girls equally aggressive,</v>

1720
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:52.040
<v Speaker 2>but the boys aggression is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical.</v>

1721
01:18:52.041 --> 01:18:53.060
<v Speaker 2>The girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more relational.</v>

1722
01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:58.480
<v Speaker 2>So if you imagine a bunch of 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 year olds in their middle schools and</v>

1723
01:18:58.611 --> 01:19:00.830
<v Speaker 2>then you parachute in a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>iphones,</v>

1724
01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.670
<v Speaker 2>everybody's got one of their pots in it </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1725
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:07.870
<v Speaker 2>What are the boys going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to play video games and </v>

1726
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:10.121
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't hurt anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the girls are going to use it to </v>

1727
01:19:10.121 --> 01:19:12.380
<v Speaker 2>amplify the social interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is 20 twinkies explanation.</v>

1728
01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I think it makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>

1729
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:16.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a crisis and we're really hurting,</v>

1730
01:19:16.611 --> 01:19:18.030
<v Speaker 2>especially the girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1731
01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.390
<v Speaker 2>so we've got to change something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that anyway.</v>

1732
01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:25.540
<v Speaker 2>But social media is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is possibly the largest single reason </v>

1733
01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.630
<v Speaker 2>why things are going haywire on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The third big factor in,</v>

1734
01:19:27.631 --> 01:19:30.110
<v Speaker 2>and do you think it's primarily facebook</v>
<v Speaker 2>or can you tell?</v>

1735
01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1736
01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:31.630
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1737
01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.500
<v Speaker 2>the kids use a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>platforms,</v>

1738
01:19:33.501 --> 01:19:35.630
<v Speaker 2>but from what I hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram,</v>

1739
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.030
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snapchat,</v>

1740
01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:38.750
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1741
01:19:38.751 --> 01:19:42.350
<v Speaker 2>the thing is it's one to many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's bad at anything if,</v>

1742
01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:43.340
<v Speaker 2>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's,</v>

1743
01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you put something out there and you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people like it,</v>

1744
01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:47.020
<v Speaker 2>that's what's right.</v>

1745
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:49.730
<v Speaker 2>And there's always the threat that it'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>go viral in a terrible way.</v>

1746
01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:54.731
<v Speaker 2>So that's exactly the sort of damage </v>
<v Speaker 2>limit that's perfectly limited damage.</v>

1747
01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Unlimited downside to saying something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do?</v>

1748
01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1749
01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:01.910
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if I want to like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>post because you know,</v>

1750
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:03.330
<v Speaker 2>I could get in big trouble for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1751
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Well the benefit to liking it as minimal</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the potential catastrophe for this </v>

1752
01:20:08.410 --> 01:20:11.830
<v Speaker 2>unless expected to like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which case you'd better like it </v>

1753
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.830
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't like it you'll get </v>
<v Speaker 2>in trouble.</v>

1754
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:14.550
<v Speaker 2>So it's a much more of a mob mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids are afraid,</v>

1755
01:20:14.551 --> 01:20:15.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not blaming the kids,</v>

1756
01:20:15.751 --> 01:20:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm very sympathetic to them and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1757
01:20:17.041 --> 01:20:19.620
<v Speaker 2>my kids are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kids are 11 and seven,</v>

1758
01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:21.450
<v Speaker 2>they're going to come up into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1759
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:24.330
<v Speaker 2>so the kids have been raised in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a social environment,</v>

1760
01:20:24.331 --> 01:20:29.331
<v Speaker 2>it's much more about mob mob formation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and mob attacks and Bob defend defenses </v>

1761
01:20:29.331 --> 01:20:29.880
<v Speaker 2>against mobs.</v>

1762
01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1763
01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:36.760
<v Speaker 2>so the third factor then is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political polarization and that </v>

1764
01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:39.821
<v Speaker 2>purification or institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you imagine coming up in the </v>

1765
01:20:39.821 --> 01:20:41.010
<v Speaker 2>nineties when political polarization is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going up,</v>

1766
01:20:41.011 --> 01:20:43.290
<v Speaker 2>we're beginning to hate each other more </v>
<v Speaker 2>across party lines,</v>

1767
01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:45.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that,</v>

1768
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:47.220
<v Speaker 2>that nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's been getting much,</v>

1769
01:20:47.221 --> 01:20:49.890
<v Speaker 2>much more hostile so that now if </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

1770
01:20:49.891 --> 01:20:50.560
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone's a,</v>

1771
01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:55.570
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone goes to a campus Republicans </v>

1772
01:20:55.570 --> 01:20:55.620
<v Speaker 2>meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a Democrat who goes to a meeting</v>

1773
01:20:55.621 --> 01:21:00.621
<v Speaker 2>of the campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans has happened at UC Santa </v>

1774
01:21:00.621 --> 01:21:00.621
<v Speaker 2>Cruz a couple weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1775
01:21:00.621 --> 01:21:01.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and someone finds out,</v>

1776
01:21:01.621 --> 01:21:02.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

1777
01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:03.380
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1778
01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:04.650
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hatred,</v>

1779
01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:07.830
<v Speaker 2>the cross-party hatred is so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger now.</v>

1780
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:13.250
<v Speaker 2>And many institutions are much pure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you went to college in the </v>

1781
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:16.911
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might've been a few conservative </v>

1782
01:21:16.911 --> 01:21:16.911
<v Speaker 2>professors around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now there aren't.</v>

1783
01:21:16.911 --> 01:21:21.590
<v Speaker 2>So as you said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like exposure therapy if you've </v>

1784
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.590
<v Speaker 2>never encountered a conservative idea.</v>

1785
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:24.420
<v Speaker 2>And then if conservative like Heather </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald comes to speak on your campus,</v>

1786
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:26.700
<v Speaker 2>well this is like a major immune </v>
<v Speaker 2>response problem.</v>

1787
01:21:26.701 --> 01:21:29.670
<v Speaker 2>We've got to get the tribe together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mob her and you know,</v>

1788
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.680
<v Speaker 2>shut her down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1789
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:34.320
<v Speaker 2>so those are the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are many other reasons,</v>

1790
01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:39.000
<v Speaker 2>but the loss of unsupervised play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social media and rice and polarization,</v>

1791
01:21:39.001 --> 01:21:40.350
<v Speaker 2>those are the three big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1792
01:21:40.351 --> 01:21:45.351
<v Speaker 2>Well those are big problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the loss of unsupervised </v>

1793
01:21:45.351 --> 01:21:45.351
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1794
01:21:45.351 --> 01:21:46.650
<v Speaker 2>it's not obvious at all how that might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be addressed.</v>

1795
01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1796
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:48.390
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1797
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Everyone should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just by Lenore skenazy,</v>

1798
01:21:51.951 --> 01:21:56.951
<v Speaker 2>his book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free range kids and then they should </v>

1799
01:21:56.951 --> 01:21:57.750
<v Speaker 2>loosen up and give their kids more </v>
<v Speaker 2>unsupervised time.</v>

1800
01:21:57.751 --> 01:22:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Now you can't do this alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be arrested.</v>

1801
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I tried to get my son to go out across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the street to,</v>

1802
01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:08.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy groceries when he was nine years </v>

1803
01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:08.940
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

1804
01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:08.940
<v Speaker 2>And he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1805
01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:08.940
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daddy,</v>

1806
01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:10.950
<v Speaker 2>people look at me funny there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are other kids out there.</v>

1807
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so lenore has started a fantastic </v>

1808
01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.761
<v Speaker 2>organization called let grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were to let grow.org,</v>

1809
01:22:19.931 --> 01:22:21.870
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll put all this in the description,</v>

1810
01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:22.820
<v Speaker 2>all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1811
01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:25.350
<v Speaker 2>So I'm on the board of it as an advisor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Gray,</v>

1812
01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expert on,</v>

1813
01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:29.940
<v Speaker 2>on play is on the board and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing these simple things.</v>

1814
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple things like you convinced the </v>

1815
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.941
<v Speaker 2>school to just open up the playground an</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour early or keep it open after school.</v>

1816
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Why should kids always have organized </v>
<v Speaker 2>activities and soccer practice?</v>

1817
01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Just give them a place to play where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a nurse available.</v>

1818
01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:51.561
<v Speaker 2>If someone gets hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is an adult but he's not </v>

1819
01:22:51.561 --> 01:22:51.561
<v Speaker 2>supervising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just over there,</v>

1820
01:22:51.561 --> 01:22:53.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So don't worry parents,</v>

1821
01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:56.190
<v Speaker 2>there is an adult but beyond that can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they want.</v>

1822
01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:59.790
<v Speaker 2>And they just started this a few weeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago and the results are fantastic.</v>

1823
01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:03.300
<v Speaker 2>The kids were having so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are becoming more independent,</v>

1824
01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:05.710
<v Speaker 2>they're more willing to do projects on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own.</v>

1825
01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.450
<v Speaker 2>It's working out great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1826
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.360
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really good,</v>

1827
01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:11.800
<v Speaker 2>do this on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is we all know something's</v>

1828
01:23:11.801 --> 01:23:13.600
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those are very practical,</v>

1829
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 2>very practical piece of advice for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for schools.</v>

1830
01:23:16.511 --> 01:23:20.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like open up the unsupervised play </v>
<v Speaker 2>facilities and,</v>

1831
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:22.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and facilitate their use.</v>

1832
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:23.800
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give,</v>

1833
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:25.900
<v Speaker 2>give everyone a place which is safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by safe,</v>

1834
01:23:25.901 --> 01:23:27.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean physically safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1835
01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Never use the word safety to describe </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions and ideas.</v>

1836
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Safety means physical safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to provide a physically </v>

1837
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:37.810
<v Speaker 2>safe place for the kids to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And beyond that you let them go.</v>

1838
01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Now there will arise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Problems of bullying.</v>

1839
01:23:40.061 --> 01:23:43.100
<v Speaker 2>So if it's repeated harassment or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1840
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:44.740
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a book about God,</v>

1841
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:49.830
<v Speaker 2>which by down always called bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we know and what we can do about </v>

1842
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.830
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1843
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:54.360
<v Speaker 2>And it was written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be 30 years ago and always </v>

1844
01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:54.360
<v Speaker 2>cut the real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1845
01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:54.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1846
01:23:54.581 --> 01:23:55.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1847
01:23:55.900 --> 01:24:00.900
<v Speaker 2>the incidents of bullying in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Scandinavian countries down by 50 </v>

1848
01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:01.300
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he really,</v>

1849
01:24:01.301 --> 01:24:06.301
<v Speaker 2>really targets what bullying means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's not a safe space guy by any </v>

1850
01:24:06.301 --> 01:24:07.270
<v Speaker 2>stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1851
01:24:07.271 --> 01:24:12.271
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the origins of it are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that evaluations of his program </v>

1852
01:24:12.271 --> 01:24:16.021
<v Speaker 2>in America show it anywhere from zero to</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 percent reductions in much smaller in</v>

1853
01:24:16.511 --> 01:24:17.290
<v Speaker 2>the u.</v>
<v Speaker 2>s in the U.</v>

1854
01:24:17.291 --> 01:24:19.630
<v Speaker 2>s yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is whether or not they were</v>

1855
01:24:19.631 --> 01:24:22.240
<v Speaker 2>able to implement them with the rigor he</v>
<v Speaker 2>did in the U.</v>

1856
01:24:22.241 --> 01:24:23.120
<v Speaker 2>S.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1857
01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:28.300
<v Speaker 2>But bullying programs are part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem because bullying clearly is a </v>

1858
01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:28.300
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to do something about it,</v>

1859
01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:30.340
<v Speaker 2>but because we have what's called </v>
<v Speaker 2>concept creep.</v>

1860
01:24:30.850 --> 01:24:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1861
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:33.850
<v Speaker 2>so it's not a bad concept.</v>

1862
01:24:33.850 --> 01:24:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Creep looks like even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1863
01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.670
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1864
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:41.290
<v Speaker 2>so now it's the case that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if kids don't invite,</v>

1865
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:44.680
<v Speaker 2>if some kids want to do something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't invite another kid,</v>

1866
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:46.100
<v Speaker 2>they've excluded that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1867
01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Well that could be bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1868
01:24:47.501 --> 01:24:52.501
<v Speaker 2>I've read of schools in Europe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't allow kids to have best friends </v>

1869
01:24:52.501 --> 01:24:52.930
<v Speaker 2>for exactly that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1870
01:24:52.931 --> 01:24:57.931
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is also something that </v>

1871
01:24:57.931 --> 01:25:00.121
<v Speaker 2>really bothers me about the misuse of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the iat because it's not that easy to </v>

1872
01:25:00.121 --> 01:25:02.560
<v Speaker 2>distinguish in group preference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which no one can.</v>

1873
01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.800
<v Speaker 2>No one went in their right mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would want to eliminate in group </v>

1874
01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.471
<v Speaker 2>preference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that it governs your choice of </v>

1875
01:25:10.471 --> 01:25:10.960
<v Speaker 2>mate and your behavior towards your </v>
<v Speaker 2>family members,</v>

1876
01:25:10.961 --> 01:25:12.030
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1877
01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:14.620
<v Speaker 2>to distinguish that between outgroup </v>
<v Speaker 2>exclusion.</v>

1878
01:25:14.621 --> 01:25:19.621
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no simple matter and to tell kids that </v>

1879
01:25:19.621 --> 01:25:22.771
<v Speaker 2>they can't have a best friend is another</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that interferes with an important </v>

1880
01:25:22.771 --> 01:25:22.771
<v Speaker 2>part of their.</v>

1881
01:25:22.771 --> 01:25:22.771
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1882
01:25:22.771 --> 01:25:26.150
<v Speaker 2>I think both of us have spent a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time looking at ancient wisdom at,</v>

1883
01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.770
<v Speaker 2>at the writings of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1884
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:29.950
<v Speaker 2>of people long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1885
01:25:29.951 --> 01:25:34.951
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I often come back to aristotle's claim </v>

1886
01:25:34.951 --> 01:25:35.500
<v Speaker 2>that any virtue carried to extremes </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes advice.</v>

1887
01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:41.130
<v Speaker 2>So inclusion is a good thing if people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are being excluded because they have a </v>

1888
01:25:41.130 --> 01:25:45.331
<v Speaker 2>physical stigma or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they're overweight or their skin </v>

1889
01:25:45.331 --> 01:25:49.561
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need to be looking at the reasons </v>

1890
01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:53.041
<v Speaker 2>why kids are excluded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you say inclusion is the primary </v>

1891
01:25:53.041 --> 01:25:55.480
<v Speaker 2>virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inclusion over everything else.</v>

1892
01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.450
<v Speaker 2>And so if those two best friends are </v>
<v Speaker 2>excluding others,</v>

1893
01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:00.640
<v Speaker 2>know more best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is madness.</v>

1894
01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:04.430
<v Speaker 2>This is a vice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that again,</v>

1895
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:09.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a virtue unless it's carried to </v>

1896
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.550
<v Speaker 2>extremes.</v>

1897
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably a pretty good place to </v>

1898
01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:14.250
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

1899
01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:14.250
<v Speaker 1>unless you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have,</v>

1900
01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:15.100
<v Speaker 1>you have anything else that you wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about?</v>

1901
01:26:15.101 --> 01:26:18.280
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the role of religion and</v>

1902
01:26:18.281 --> 01:26:20.590
<v Speaker 1>in the fact that people are naturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious thinkers.</v>

1903
01:26:20.770 --> 01:26:25.120
<v Speaker 1>We talked about the Heterodox Academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about your work on disgust and</v>

1904
01:26:25.121 --> 01:26:27.610
<v Speaker 1>your plans for the academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talked about your books.</v>

1905
01:26:28.150 --> 01:26:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything else that that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be of interest that you can think of?</v>

1906
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that,</v>

1907
01:26:34.630 --> 01:26:39.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just say that I'm actually </v>

1908
01:26:39.630 --> 01:26:41.080
<v Speaker 2>optimistic about what's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>on campus.</v>

1909
01:26:41.081 --> 01:26:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I think things might continue to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse this year.</v>

1910
01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's an interesting </v>

1911
01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:52.501
<v Speaker 2>phenomena called preference </v>
<v Speaker 2>falsification when you have people not </v>

1912
01:26:53.021 --> 01:26:57.280
<v Speaker 2>speaking honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you had under communism,</v>

1913
01:26:58.150 --> 01:27:03.150
<v Speaker 2>when you have a whole system where </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost everybody thinks this is </v>

1914
01:27:03.150 --> 01:27:03.150
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate this,</v>

1915
01:27:03.150 --> 01:27:05.440
<v Speaker 2>but I don't dare say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have preference,</v>

1916
01:27:05.441 --> 01:27:07.300
<v Speaker 2>falsification is to work by team or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Koran.</v>

1917
01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody hears everybody else's </v>

1918
01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:12.810
<v Speaker 2>preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they think,</v>

1919
01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:12.810
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what everybody thinks.</v>

1920
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:15.940
<v Speaker 2>When you have an unraveling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can unravel very quickly.</v>

1921
01:27:16.330 --> 01:27:21.330
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>communist countries because everybody </v>

1922
01:27:21.330 --> 01:27:23.440
<v Speaker 2>hated it and it felt amazingly quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the,</v>

1923
01:27:23.441 --> 01:27:23.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1924
01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:27.520
<v Speaker 2>the pushback at read last week or there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was written up last week.</v>

1925
01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:32.760
<v Speaker 2>So I think because most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're starting to see is that a lot </v>

1926
01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.890
<v Speaker 2>of people of color also is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1927
01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:36.160
<v Speaker 2>you're not speaking for me.</v>

1928
01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean every group is diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you have a variety of people</v>

1929
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:44.290
<v Speaker 2>and you have progressive speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have a variety of people,</v>

1930
01:27:44.710 --> 01:27:45.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1931
01:27:45.670 --> 01:27:48.310
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to see more and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>people standing up saying,</v>

1932
01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:50.530
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening is this is not right.</v>

1933
01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:55.830
<v Speaker 2>This is illiberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is opposed to the values of the </v>

1934
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.830
<v Speaker 2>academy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not what I want for myself or my</v>

1935
01:27:55.830 --> 01:28:00.091
<v Speaker 2>kids or my students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do think that we're going to start </v>

1936
01:28:00.091 --> 01:28:01.220
<v Speaker 2>seeing a lot more people standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1937
01:28:01.330 --> 01:28:06.330
<v Speaker 2>and one of our goals of heterodox </v>
<v Speaker 2>academy is to just help put out the </v>

1938
01:28:06.330 --> 01:28:09.451
<v Speaker 2>ideas that people need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what you're doing to just </v>

1939
01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:09.451
<v Speaker 2>put out the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>critique the bad ideas,</v>

1940
01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:14.550
<v Speaker 2>and put out concepts in that that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>contest in this space of ideas and get </v>

1941
01:28:17.861 --> 01:28:20.740
<v Speaker 2>good information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if people go to Heterodoxacademy.org</v>

1942
01:28:20.741 --> 01:28:22.900
<v Speaker 2>on our research pages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have all the information that,</v>

1943
01:28:22.901 --> 01:28:25.110
<v Speaker 2>what all the polls say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the current information about,</v>

1944
01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.910
<v Speaker 2>about students attitudes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the history of this.</v>

1945
01:28:27.911 --> 01:28:30.250
<v Speaker 2>We have a lot of research on who is more</v>
<v Speaker 2>biased,</v>

1946
01:28:30.251 --> 01:28:30.910
<v Speaker 2>left or right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1947
01:28:30.911 --> 01:28:32.800
<v Speaker 2>turns out both sides are about equally </v>
<v Speaker 2>biased.</v>

1948
01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:38.500
<v Speaker 2>So we think that by just doing what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do well as academics,</v>

1949
01:28:38.501 --> 01:28:42.580
<v Speaker 2>that is research making arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being common,</v>

1950
01:28:42.581 --> 01:28:43.940
<v Speaker 2>civil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1951
01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:46.000
<v Speaker 2>we actually think that we can turn this </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1952
01:28:46.150 --> 01:28:48.070
<v Speaker 2>So if anybody watching this as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor,</v>

1953
01:28:48.071 --> 01:28:51.250
<v Speaker 2>I would invite you to join.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to Heterodoxacademy Dot Org,</v>

1954
01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:52.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and science.</v>

1955
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1956
01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:55.020
<v Speaker 1>so let me ask you one more question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1957
01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1958
01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:00.800
<v Speaker 1>that sounds good and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good to hear that you're </v>

1959
01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:00.900
<v Speaker 1>optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1960
01:29:00.901 --> 01:29:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I waiver,</v>

1961
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:05.170
<v Speaker 3>although I wouldn't say I'm pessimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1962
01:29:05.171 --> 01:29:10.171
<v Speaker 3>I just think we're in one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations where things could spiral in </v>

1963
01:29:10.171 --> 01:29:10.860
<v Speaker 3>either direction very rapidly and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>worries me.</v>

1964
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:16.310
<v Speaker 3>What about the disciplines on campus </v>
<v Speaker 3>that seemed to be primarily devoted to </v>

1965
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:19.800
<v Speaker 3>the activist cause?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like because my view is,</v>

1966
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:24.630
<v Speaker 3>or my fear is that we've subsidized the </v>
<v Speaker 3>activist disciplines,</v>

1967
01:29:24.631 --> 01:29:26.460
<v Speaker 3>let's say women's studies as a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

1968
01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:30.270
<v Speaker 3>but we could say social work and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>the faculties of education now as well.</v>

1969
01:29:30.271 --> 01:29:33.270
<v Speaker 3>I think they're in the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the same bin.</v>

1970
01:29:33.271 --> 01:29:33.900
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

1971
01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:38.930
<v Speaker 3>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That women's studies programs in </v>

1972
01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:42.141
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their express goal expressed on their </v>

1973
01:29:42.141 --> 01:29:46.101
<v Speaker 3>websites is to produce social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Radical left leaning activists.</v>

1974
01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:51.560
<v Speaker 3>And so like for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I proposed in Canada </v>

1975
01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:55.221
<v Speaker 3>was that the conservatives in particular</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut the university funding by 25 percent</v>

1976
01:29:56.161 --> 01:29:58.290
<v Speaker 3>so that the universities would have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort themselves out.</v>

1977
01:29:58.710 --> 01:30:01.770
<v Speaker 3>But then that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a provocative claim obviously.</v>

1978
01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:06.771
<v Speaker 3>But then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's not a good idea because it </v>

1979
01:30:06.771 --> 01:30:09.231
<v Speaker 3>opens up the door to political </v>
<v Speaker 3>interference in the academy and that's </v>

1980
01:30:09.231 --> 01:30:09.570
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's left.</v>

1981
01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:10.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1982
01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:15.220
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the academy has done a very bad job </v>

1983
01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:16.320
<v Speaker 3>of policing itself methodologically and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have these disciplines.</v>

1984
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Women's studies I think is a prime </v>
<v Speaker 3>example and that's been very much </v>

1985
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:22.200
<v Speaker 3>criticized in Canada by Janice Flamenco </v>
<v Speaker 3>who used to be.</v>

1986
01:30:22.201 --> 01:30:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1987
01:30:23.161 --> 01:30:24.360
<v Speaker 3>she is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's,</v>

1988
01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.420
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not an unnatural mill.</v>

1989
01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:28.200
<v Speaker 3>You when she's doing such things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1990
01:30:28.201 --> 01:30:30.780
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a brave and tough person and she's</v>

1991
01:30:30.781 --> 01:30:34.800
<v Speaker 3>gone after the women's studies types on </v>
<v Speaker 3>methodological grounds particularly.</v>

1992
01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:40.130
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are people who are working </v>

1993
01:30:40.130 --> 01:30:42.320
<v Speaker 3>full time at doing nothing but producing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kind of polar.</v>

1994
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:44.490
<v Speaker 3>So what do you have any thoughts about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1995
01:30:44.491 --> 01:30:45.420
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

1996
01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:47.090
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>

1997
01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:52.120
<v Speaker 2>I teach in business school here and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach a course called professional </v>

1998
01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.320
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and I teach my students </v>
<v Speaker 2>about their fiduciary duties,</v>

1999
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:57.710
<v Speaker 2>their duties to their employers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the duties that we have to each other.</v>

2000
01:30:58.770 --> 01:31:02.090
<v Speaker 2>And fiduciary duty refers to a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high standard of care.</v>

2001
01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:04.260
<v Speaker 2>If you're managing someone's money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2002
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:06.230
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really have to be committed to doing</v>

2003
01:31:06.231 --> 01:31:08.180
<v Speaker 2>what's in their interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in your interest.</v>

2004
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:10.610
<v Speaker 2>And I think we need that concept in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>academy.</v>

2005
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:16.030
<v Speaker 2>We have a mature project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call it fiduciary duties or just </v>

2006
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:19.240
<v Speaker 2>professional duties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we have two primary </v>

2007
01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.870
<v Speaker 2>professional duties that we must never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never be tray one,</v>

2008
01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:24.620
<v Speaker 2>the most important one in our role as </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholars is our duty to the truth.</v>

2009
01:31:25.130 --> 01:31:30.130
<v Speaker 2>We must never say things that we think </v>
<v Speaker 2>are false or allow people to stay,</v>

2010
01:31:30.291 --> 01:31:33.560
<v Speaker 2>things that we think are false because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're afraid if we challenge them,</v>

2011
01:31:33.561 --> 01:31:34.340
<v Speaker 2>we'll get in trouble.</v>

2012
01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:37.880
<v Speaker 2>So we have a fiduciary duty to the truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and political,</v>

2013
01:31:37.881 --> 01:31:41.930
<v Speaker 2>ideological commitments clearly warp us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make us do things,</v>

2014
01:31:41.931 --> 01:31:42.920
<v Speaker 2>they make us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they push us.</v>

2015
01:31:43.850 --> 01:31:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've got a whole.</v>

2016
01:31:46.050 --> 01:31:49.220
<v Speaker 2>We've got to recognize that if we let </v>
<v Speaker 2>our systems get out of whack,</v>

2017
01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.560
<v Speaker 2>we are betraying the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were systemically,</v>

2018
01:31:51.850 --> 01:31:53.480
<v Speaker 2>or do you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we ever went systemic,</v>

2019
01:31:53.481 --> 01:31:58.481
<v Speaker 2>truth isn't problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are systemically betraying the truth </v>

2020
01:31:58.481 --> 01:32:01.031
<v Speaker 2>in many of our disciplines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we need an awareness of that </v>

2021
01:32:01.031 --> 01:32:04.020
<v Speaker 2>and we need to hold ourselves to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher standard than in our role as </v>

2022
01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:04.020
<v Speaker 2>teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have an here,</v>

2023
01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:07.720
<v Speaker 2>we really can call it a fiduciary duty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are people's children who are sent</v>

2024
01:32:07.721 --> 01:32:11.680
<v Speaker 2>to us to educate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to enlarge their minds,</v>

2025
01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:16.740
<v Speaker 2>to teach them skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we were to use them for our sexual </v>

2026
01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.880
<v Speaker 2>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously a horrific crime,</v>

2027
01:32:19.570 --> 01:32:22.270
<v Speaker 2>but what is it if we use them for </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological purposes,</v>

2028
01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:24.910
<v Speaker 2>if we say you've given me your children </v>
<v Speaker 2>to educate,</v>

2029
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm waging a political battle.</v>

2030
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to get your statements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tools,</v>

2031
01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.490
<v Speaker 2>ms.tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is horrific.</v>

2032
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:33.550
<v Speaker 2>That is unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are violating our duties.</v>

2033
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:35.800
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2034
01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:40.860
<v Speaker 2>But the response to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially from the postmodernist types </v>

2035
01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:43.330
<v Speaker 2>is that that's all the ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only ideologic yeah.</v>

2036
01:32:44.230 --> 01:32:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back to your original question,</v>

2037
01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there problem departments?</v>

2038
01:32:47.890 --> 01:32:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want it to put forth these two </v>

2039
01:32:52.890 --> 01:32:55.501
<v Speaker 2>commitments to truth and to educating </v>
<v Speaker 2>not indoctrinating and universities that</v>

2040
01:32:56.651 --> 01:33:01.651
<v Speaker 2>embrace these highest goals like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Chicago I think is the </v>

2041
01:33:01.651 --> 01:33:04.921
<v Speaker 2>best candidate will probably find that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to do something about </v>

2042
01:33:07.211 --> 01:33:08.770
<v Speaker 2>department that don't live up to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>goals,</v>

2043
01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:15.060
<v Speaker 2>other universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think Brown is leading the way on </v>

2044
01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:15.880
<v Speaker 2>this one so far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the early in 2015,</v>

2045
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:21.030
<v Speaker 2>the president had all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>statements about brown is committed to </v>

2046
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:23.581
<v Speaker 2>social justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fundamental bedrock commitment to </v>

2047
01:33:23.581 --> 01:33:23.581
<v Speaker 2>social justice.</v>

2048
01:33:23.581 --> 01:33:26.470
<v Speaker 2>She said so if some universities choose </v>
<v Speaker 2>to devote themselves to social justice,</v>

2049
01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.050
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just be up front about it.</v>

2050
01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Say So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So students will know if you want social</v>

2051
01:33:32.231 --> 01:33:33.520
<v Speaker 2>justice training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to Brown.</v>

2052
01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:36.880
<v Speaker 2>But if you want to actually be trained </v>
<v Speaker 2>to find the truth to do research,</v>

2053
01:33:36.881 --> 01:33:41.881
<v Speaker 2>you go to Chicago and I think we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to see people flooding to Chicago </v>

2054
01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:45.180
<v Speaker 2>and schools like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm hoping what I'm hoping.</v>

2055
01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:47.140
<v Speaker 2>So that's the mechanism there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they,</v>

2056
01:33:47.141 --> 01:33:52.141
<v Speaker 2>if they make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they make their statements public </v>

2057
01:33:52.141 --> 01:33:55.050
<v Speaker 2>that the choice of the students will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to the universities that hold the </v>

2058
01:33:55.050 --> 01:33:56.340
<v Speaker 2>principles that you just described over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other one.</v>

2059
01:33:56.341 --> 01:33:58.090
<v Speaker 2>So it'll be a marketplace choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2060
01:33:58.210 --> 01:33:59.560
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I said when I talked about</v>

2061
01:33:59.561 --> 01:34:01.720
<v Speaker 2>the emperor's new clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a situation,</v>

2062
01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:06.960
<v Speaker 2>we have a gigantic market failure in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which our top universities are offering </v>

2063
01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:09.430
<v Speaker 2>a product that most consumers don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

2064
01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:15.780
<v Speaker 2>And so my prediction is that Chicago is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to see a huge surge of </v>

2065
01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:17.290
<v Speaker 2>applications this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if that's true,</v>

2066
01:34:17.650 --> 01:34:19.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think other universities are going,</v>

2067
01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:23.650
<v Speaker 2>they're going to take notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm hoping that we'll see a schism in</v>

2068
01:34:23.651 --> 01:34:27.550
<v Speaker 2>the American academy between those </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities that stand up and say,</v>

2069
01:34:27.610 --> 01:34:32.610
<v Speaker 2>this is madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are committed to providing a </v>

2070
01:34:32.610 --> 01:34:32.610
<v Speaker 2>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't discriminate based on viewpoint</v>

2071
01:34:32.610 --> 01:34:34.420
<v Speaker 2>and politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the Chicago way.</v>

2072
01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:39.720
<v Speaker 2>And those that say no whereabouts social</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice come here and we will train you </v>

2073
01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:40.240
<v Speaker 2>to fight for social justice and against </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right.</v>

2074
01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:43.690
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people have clear choices,</v>

2075
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:46.810
<v Speaker 2>then I think we're gonna see a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

2076
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:48.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I'm optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to see that.</v>

2077
01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well thank you very much.</v>

2078
01:34:52.450 --> 01:34:53.620
<v Speaker 2>It was great talking with you.</v>
