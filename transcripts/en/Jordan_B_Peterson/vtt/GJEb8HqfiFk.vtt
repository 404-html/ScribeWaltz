1
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Speaker 1>The good news is that there was some</v>
<v Speaker 1>overlap.</v>

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>So I think that despite all the cue</v>
<v Speaker 1>cards on here,</v>

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>we will be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>answer quite the cross section a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some cases they've been split up</v>

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>between Dr Pearson and Dr Doidge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>in other cases it's just a generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>

7
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:21.350
<v Speaker 1>So Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

8
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>nice way to conclude your remarks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.560
<v Speaker 1>why are the postmodernists doing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to what end?</v>

10
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you should distinguish between</v>

11
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 2>the postmodernists and postmodernism and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense,</v>

12
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 2>because you don't want to be thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

13
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each radical person on the left,</v>

14
00:00:55.651 --> 00:01:00.651
<v Speaker 2>let's say for the time being is a full</v>
<v Speaker 2>fledged Avatar of postmodernism because</v>

15
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

16
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.443
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

17
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.860
<v Speaker 2>60 percent reasonable human being and 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent puppet mouthpiece of a toxic</v>

18
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 2>etiology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

19
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 2>and so it's fragmented across people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes it,</v>

20
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 2>of course much more complicated because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to know someone like that and</v>

21
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:18.751
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

22
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 2>they've got some good intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not nearly as many as they think they</v>

23
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have some good intentions and</v>

24
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:27.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a history of really things not</v>

25
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 2>so good that happened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no wonder they feel kind of angry</v>

26
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:31.284
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

27
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 2>but then that's why you got to get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of things.</v>

28
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the bottom is very far down.</v>

29
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:42.501
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where things get crazy.</v>

30
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.433
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

31
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a battle between two ways of</v>

32
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 2>being in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

33
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:54.290
<v Speaker 2>and I've taken that apart to some degree</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my lectures on Cain and Abel and one</v>

34
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:59.090
<v Speaker 2>way of life is to make the sacrifices</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to and to try to aim</v>

35
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 2>towards the good and hope that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifices that you make please the</v>

36
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

37
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:06.380
<v Speaker 2>It's how you bargain with the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

38
00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:10.880
<v Speaker 2>You make sacrifices in the present</v>
<v Speaker 2>toward something you hope will be good</v>

39
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 2>in the future and you hope that pleases</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality and it's smiles on,</v>

40
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

41
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.950
<v Speaker 2>and then the other way of being is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you noticed that your hard work is often</v>

42
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:24.110
<v Speaker 2>ignored and that you don't get what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

43
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Well less deserving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do and it turns you against life</v>

44
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:30.200
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it turns you against more.</v>

45
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Worse than that.</v>

46
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.980
<v Speaker 2>It turns you against being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how else to put it.</v>

47
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:35.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean because I've studied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:39.170
<v Speaker 2>like why do you go into Connecticut into</v>
<v Speaker 2>a classroom and shoot a bunch of</v>

49
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:43.580
<v Speaker 2>elementary school kids and Ben Yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he shot himself,</v>

50
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.550
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter because usually</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens.</v>

51
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like what stared of state of mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have to be in to do that?</v>

52
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew what sort of state of mind you</v>

53
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:54.560
<v Speaker 2>have to be in to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the only way to describe it,</v>

54
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:58.310
<v Speaker 2>it's sold down there that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

55
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 2>it gets fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

56
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 2>well that's the pathway of cane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like being as something that should</v>

57
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 2>not be despise every bit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take my revenge on it.</v>

58
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find the most innocent</v>
<v Speaker 2>people I possibly can and make them</v>

59
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 2>suffer and then I'm going to do away</v>
<v Speaker 2>with myself.</v>

60
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 2>And that shows you exactly what I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

61
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 2>people are like that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why that's the oldest story,</v>

62
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 2>but it's basically the oldest story we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have about human beings,</v>

63
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a paragraph long that story</v>

64
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 2>and it's just a punch man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I remembered it for God only</v>

65
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:38.521
<v Speaker 2>knows 10,000 years maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why are they doing it?</v>

66
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they aren't doing it.</v>

67
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

68
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just happens to be that there are</v>

69
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 2>sort of more doing it now than you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the radical right is,</v>

70
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could easily be flipped around</v>

71
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 2>and well that brings me back to the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

72
00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:57.791
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

73
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 2>what do you do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

74
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 2>join the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engage in group conflict,</v>

75
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 2>give up all your beliefs so that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't believe anything so that you don't</v>

76
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 2>engage in group conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then you're nihilistic and</v>

77
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 2>hopeless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

78
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 2>so what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are your choices.</v>

79
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:17.351
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

80
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other choice is get yourself</v>

81
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>together and every way like you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight this,</v>

82
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 2>whatever this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to fight it.</v>

83
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to be strong because you're</v>

84
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 2>going to have to make the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions at a moment's notice when,</v>

85
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 2>when the tiny little bits of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest itself in your own life,</v>

86
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're going to stand up at</v>
<v Speaker 2>work when they want to retool your</v>

87
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 2>unconscious biases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

88
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 2>probably not because people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

89
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

90
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:48.400
<v Speaker 2>it's no bloody wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

91
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what happens,</v>

92
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.521
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

93
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not using those words.</v>

94
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:56.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:04:56.731 --> 00:05:00.150
<v Speaker 2>when I didn't do it blindly all the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly never predicted what was</v>

96
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.740
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the hell could have predicted what</v>

97
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:03.750
<v Speaker 2>was going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like certainly not me,</v>

98
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's no wonder that people shut up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

99
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.650
<v Speaker 2>hide like why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the smart thing to do in the short</v>

100
00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:14.040
<v Speaker 2>term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you know how you feel when you</v>

101
00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:17.250
<v Speaker 2>hide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you feel like a pathetic,</v>

102
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:22.251
<v Speaker 2>scared rabbit and that's what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you gotta be more than a pathetic,</v>

103
00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:25.590
<v Speaker 2>scared rabbit and you do that by</v>

104
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.430
<v Speaker 2>you do that by facing the chaos that</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists in your own life and turning it</v>

105
00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:37.860
<v Speaker 2>into order not stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it goes.</v>

106
00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:40.350
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:42.420
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be so easy.</v>

108
00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:46.830
<v Speaker 2>You could just get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's just doesn't work.</v>

109
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Dr Doidge have our young people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been forced to overdevelop their left</v>

110
00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>brains or have their right side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>been underdeveloped.</v>

111
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 3>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we avoid this?</v>

112
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.313
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

113
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.480
<v Speaker 3>Is this better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to defer to or bring you back</v>

114
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 3>to Ian mcgilchrist book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so yeah,</v>

115
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 3>the brain is plastic and arguably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

116
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.870
<v Speaker 3>if you start using a suite of cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 3>skills over and over and they were more</v>

117
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:38.500
<v Speaker 3>left brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could develop more left brained.</v>

118
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm a balance that was more left brained</v>
<v Speaker 3>or right brained.</v>

119
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.600
<v Speaker 3>And in the course of civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to Mcgilchrist,</v>

120
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.960
<v Speaker 3>there were certain times where they hit</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sweet spot and he goes,</v>

121
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.350
<v Speaker 3>he has a whole historical account in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>book of which times and civilization,</v>

122
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually Athens,</v>

123
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 3>500 BC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those incredible playwrights,</v>

124
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:04.890
<v Speaker 3>Euripidean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

125
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.800
<v Speaker 3>these plays like Medea and east Gillis</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sophocles.</v>

126
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 3>It go deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep into emotion in the unconscious.</v>

127
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's being hit.</v>

128
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 3>And that then you have aristotle</v>
<v Speaker 3>describing logic really for the first</v>

129
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there are moments in the</v>

130
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 3>renaissance where there's a nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>balance,</v>

131
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 3>but mcgilchrist himself is very</v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned as am I.</v>

132
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 3>That education has really taken a huge</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn to left brain function.</v>

133
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think part of that has to do with,</v>

134
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

135
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.800
<v Speaker 3>part of it has to do with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophical problem and that is modern</v>

136
00:07:40.801 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 3>science is I think in general a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>good thing.</v>

137
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:47.660
<v Speaker 3>It's not a perfect thing and it has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>number of very materialist assumptions</v>

138
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 3>and many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people</v>

139
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 3>misunderstand the following thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see this in medicine all the time.</v>

140
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.581
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

141
00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:57.510
<v Speaker 3>what are your statistics for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

142
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 3>statistics are a means to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to find out what works for</v>

143
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 3>a particular illness or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can measure it in the current</v>

144
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 3>mindset of modern science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is real.</v>

145
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 3>But there are things of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we were not good at measuring now</v>

146
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 3>with computers and technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's Ha and bureaucracy,</v>

147
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 3>what we're seeing in society is certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>things are easier to measure and those</v>

148
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 3>are the things that are taught that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>privileged.</v>

149
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 3>Your job is often judged and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for many,</v>

150
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 3>many people buy these silly little</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are easy to quantify.</v>

151
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:36.310
<v Speaker 3>And that pushes things more towards a</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of left brain approach if combined</v>

152
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 3>with some of the materialist</v>
<v Speaker 3>underpinnings of modern science and</v>

153
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:43.520
<v Speaker 3>certain aspects of philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

154
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.500
<v Speaker 3>now there's always a kind of a rebellion</v>
<v Speaker 3>against that and a lot of the interest</v>

155
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:50.950
<v Speaker 3>in aspects of the east or meditation</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

156
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.950
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and certain aspects of literature are</v>

157
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

158
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 3>in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often more right brained things.</v>

159
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 3>And because if you live a totally left</v>
<v Speaker 3>brained approach,</v>

160
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:05.520
<v Speaker 3>and I realize I'm speaking with a vast</v>
<v Speaker 3>generalization here,</v>

161
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't really become toxic and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like your soul,</v>

162
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 3>your psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call it,</v>

163
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 3>it's very much left out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

164
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 3>to answer the question now with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>background,</v>

165
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that education is moving very,</v>

166
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 3>very left brained.</v>

167
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean,</v>

168
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the skills that we're</v>

169
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 3>working on are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very left brained.</v>

170
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 3>And so the reason you want to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal education,</v>

171
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.080
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

172
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.070
<v Speaker 3>we talked about mill and the role of</v>
<v Speaker 3>free people have to learn how to govern</v>

173
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

174
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 3>there are</v>
<v Speaker 3>western books that really do hit that</v>

175
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:52.140
<v Speaker 3>balance very beautifully and those are</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that are being dismissed from</v>

176
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.240
<v Speaker 3>the curriculum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

177
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 3>so often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it comes both from the left and from</v>

178
00:09:57.511 --> 00:09:58.344
<v Speaker 3>the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

179
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over,</v>

180
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people go after things like music for</v>

181
00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:04.020
<v Speaker 3>instance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the first things to be</v>

182
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 3>taken out of the curriculum because what</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it deliver that's an immediately</v>

183
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 3>helpful and so on or reading poetry and</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

184
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Those things get cut back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

185
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.470
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

186
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there,</v>

187
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.330
<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the balance is not right now</v>

188
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.360
<v Speaker 2>I have a bit of a comment on that 1</v>
<v Speaker 2>million units and keeping with Norman's</v>

189
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:31.361
<v Speaker 2>reference to John Piaget mean one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things piaget pointed out was that the</v>

190
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.250
<v Speaker 2>precursor to moral behavior is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to play with others,</v>

191
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.950
<v Speaker 2>to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like technically,</v>

192
00:10:39.951 --> 00:10:44.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean children set up a little fantasy</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and then they take their roles in</v>

193
00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:47.090
<v Speaker 2>it and they play and they do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily unless one of the kids</v>

194
00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:49.150
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know how to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

195
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.440
<v Speaker 2>And so the kid that doesn't know how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>play says,</v>

196
00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:56.270
<v Speaker 2>you better play my game or I will play</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you in any sensible kid,</v>

197
00:10:56.271 --> 00:10:58.490
<v Speaker 2>just runs off and finds another play</v>
<v Speaker 2>partner.</v>

198
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.990
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't let this is such a cliche.</v>

199
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.930
<v Speaker 2>We don't let her children play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

200
00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:09.650
<v Speaker 2>and that's a big problem because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just learn how to play in a structured</v>

201
00:11:09.651 --> 00:11:13.790
<v Speaker 2>environment that's not play because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a play is when you have to invent your</v>

202
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:18.530
<v Speaker 2>own game and invent your own rules and</v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiate the rules and know.</v>

203
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.700
<v Speaker 2>And so all these kids is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're hyper protected because</v>

204
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.940
<v Speaker 2>they're born to older mothers and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

205
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.610
<v Speaker 2>there's hardly any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the mother's heart over</v>

206
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.280
<v Speaker 2>protective than the sword,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fathers for that matter,</v>

207
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.280
<v Speaker 2>but they're old and they're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have another kid.</v>

208
00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:37.040
<v Speaker 2>So they hyper value the child and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only one of them.</v>

209
00:11:37.041 --> 00:11:38.870
<v Speaker 2>And so they don't have siblings and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

210
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.320
<v Speaker 2>and then they structure everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the kid has the best of everything,</v>

211
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.080
<v Speaker 2>which they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except they don't have any freedom to be</v>

212
00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:46.900
<v Speaker 2>idiot children and to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

213
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.710
<v Speaker 2>eat dirt and fall on their head and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing that you have to do.</v>

214
00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no wonder of the reason it's a</v>

215
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 2>demographic issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

216
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 2>it's no wonder it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of these kids that are</v>

217
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 2>screaming and squawking about you better</v>
<v Speaker 2>play my game or else they just don't</v>

218
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:04.800
<v Speaker 2>know how to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

219
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 2>they really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's no wonder.</v>

220
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 2>And</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's death to morality because it's</v>

221
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 2>predicated on free play know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a problem.</v>

222
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:20.070
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not something I knew what to do</v>

223
00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:20.960
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

224
00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:21.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

225
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:22.853
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

226
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.793
<v Speaker 2>don't</v>

227
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 2>you try to encourage your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

228
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 2>you try to encourage your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make them courageous,</v>

229
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 2>you don't protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's different,</v>

230
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make them courageous,</v>

231
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.510
<v Speaker 2>you don't protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

232
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:39.880
<v Speaker 2>you just make them weak then.</v>

233
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.693
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

234
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.590
<v Speaker 1>A lot of questions about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

235
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 1>human rights tribunals and human rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>councils.</v>

236
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:49.130
<v Speaker 1>So just to kind of summarize a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them into one.</v>

237
00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there ever a legitimate use for human</v>

238
00:12:51.921 --> 00:12:54.980
<v Speaker 1>rights tribunal or counsel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you could comment also,</v>

239
00:12:55.250 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going forward in the fight over</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender expression,</v>

240
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.850
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

241
00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.420
<v Speaker 1>how do people combat or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

242
00:13:05.421 --> 00:13:07.520
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or win that fight in front of human</v>

243
00:13:07.521 --> 00:13:12.521
<v Speaker 1>rights courts and tribunals and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

244
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.890
<v Speaker 2>we'll leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>

245
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.480
<v Speaker 2>there is no excuse for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're called social justice</v>

246
00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:24.450
<v Speaker 2>tribunals in Ontario like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're called.</v>

247
00:13:24.451 --> 00:13:26.700
<v Speaker 2>And so look it up yourself and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they are.</v>

248
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.880
<v Speaker 2>So we had a court system that works</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly well,</v>

249
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.270
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't mean it worked very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it means it works better than any</v>

250
00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:35.640
<v Speaker 2>alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if anyone has ever be able to think</v>

251
00:13:35.641 --> 00:13:40.180
<v Speaker 2>up and a human rights tribunal can</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspend nor normal jurisprudential</v>

252
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.360
<v Speaker 2>standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They use preponderance of evidence.</v>

253
00:13:42.361 --> 00:13:47.070
<v Speaker 2>They don't assume individual innocence</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can change the rules as they</v>

254
00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:49.470
<v Speaker 2>see fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those bloody things are</v>

255
00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:53.610
<v Speaker 2>pathological to the core and their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their mouthpieces of the postmodernist</v>

256
00:13:53.611 --> 00:13:56.910
<v Speaker 2>neo Marxists as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're setting up a parallel law</v>

257
00:13:56.911 --> 00:13:58.770
<v Speaker 2>system and they're also doing that.</v>

258
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.130
<v Speaker 2>They're also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

259
00:14:05.131 --> 00:14:09.000
<v Speaker 2>this is the wind government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're also forcing the universities to</v>

260
00:14:09.001 --> 00:14:13.350
<v Speaker 2>adopt particular deficiencies of sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>harassment that make every,</v>

261
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it complicated interchange</v>

262
00:14:16.141 --> 00:14:20.130
<v Speaker 2>between human beings into a act of</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>

263
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm trying to justify stupidity</v>
<v Speaker 2>or oppression,</v>

264
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.390
<v Speaker 2>but we're all stupid and we're all</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressors and so the probability that</v>

265
00:14:27.391 --> 00:14:29.810
<v Speaker 2>we'll make some sort of dopey sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>errors,</v>

266
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.360
<v Speaker 2>100 percent and now that's become</v>
<v Speaker 2>grounds for,</v>

267
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accusations of rape and where they're</v>

268
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.850
<v Speaker 2>forcing the universities and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges to become parallel legal</v>

269
00:14:38.851 --> 00:14:41.850
<v Speaker 2>systems as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's already well advanced.</v>

270
00:14:41.851 --> 00:14:45.330
<v Speaker 2>It's already being adopted at the UFT.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as a consequence of direct</v>

271
00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:50.220
<v Speaker 2>legislation and you better look out</v>
<v Speaker 2>because even if the people who are</v>

272
00:14:50.221 --> 00:14:54.290
<v Speaker 2>running those right now are reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they're not,</v>

273
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.700
<v Speaker 2>they will absolutely be replaced by</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who exactly want that kind of</v>

274
00:14:58.701 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 2>power and will absolutely use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

275
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.200
<v Speaker 2>those things should be abolished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a legal system.</v>

276
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.163
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

277
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.460
<v Speaker 2>the law society now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may not have this exactly right,</v>

278
00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 2>but I've got it mostly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The law society in Ontario has already</v>

279
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 2>decided that lawyers are racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to force them to undergo</v>

280
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:22.540
<v Speaker 2>on unconscious bias training and they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to,</v>

281
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.480
<v Speaker 2>and they're agreeing by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

282
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.070
<v Speaker 2>they've already come to the conclusion</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because the legal profession does</v>

283
00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 2>not have the precise representation that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would expect if you did a</v>

284
00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:35.360
<v Speaker 2>demographic analysis of the population</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the terms defined by the</v>

285
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 2>social justice warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's racist and that they're racist</v>

286
00:15:39.201 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Speaker 2>and that they need to be trained</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious first.</v>

287
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:43.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so go ahead.</v>

288
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Lawyers like line up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

289
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 2>admit your guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're done and you deserve that too.</v>

290
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.230
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

291
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Starting to become afraid of the answers</v>
<v Speaker 1>to these questions,</v>

292
00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can left and right wing people ever</v>

293
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.830
<v Speaker 1>meaningfully communicate with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

294
00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:06.230
<v Speaker 1>And I'm wondering if you can comment a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little about temper mentality and the</v>

295
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 1>differences there in</v>

296
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.980
<v Speaker 2>that's what they do in a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

297
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.950
<v Speaker 2>the lefties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're high in openness and low in</v>

298
00:16:13.951 --> 00:16:18.570
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and that means they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like responsibility that much,</v>

299
00:16:18.571 --> 00:16:21.390
<v Speaker 2>but they're pretty damn creative and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not very orderly,</v>

300
00:16:21.391 --> 00:16:24.510
<v Speaker 2>especially they're not very orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of conscientiousness by</v>

301
00:16:24.511 --> 00:16:27.060
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they're good at being artists and</v>

302
00:16:27.061 --> 00:16:29.850
<v Speaker 2>they're good at being entrepreneurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're terrible at running things.</v>

303
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.100
<v Speaker 2>But then the conservatives on the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

304
00:16:32.101 --> 00:16:34.830
<v Speaker 2>there are low in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the treat creativity.</v>

305
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.360
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean they're stupid by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

306
00:16:36.361 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 2>It just means they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

307
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.890
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking isn't as free form,</v>

308
00:16:40.891 --> 00:16:43.140
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's more constrained and they're</v>

309
00:16:43.141 --> 00:16:45.510
<v Speaker 2>high in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially orderliness.</v>

310
00:16:45.511 --> 00:16:48.300
<v Speaker 2>So they're damn good at running things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that already work.</v>

311
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.500
<v Speaker 2>So you need the liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wouldn't be high openness,</v>

312
00:16:52.501 --> 00:16:54.750
<v Speaker 2>low conscientiousness if there wasn't a</v>
<v Speaker 2>niche for it.</v>

313
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.320
<v Speaker 2>And you need the conservatives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the liberals are right,</v>

314
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.200
<v Speaker 2>the border should be more open because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their fundamental claim.</v>

315
00:17:01.201 --> 00:17:02.730
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes the conservatives are</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

316
00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:05.190
<v Speaker 2>The borders between things should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>more closed and,</v>

317
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.220
<v Speaker 2>and because they're both right some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

318
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.800
<v Speaker 2>And because the environment keeps</v>
<v Speaker 2>snaking around,</v>

319
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.280
<v Speaker 2>you have to have dialogue between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>two sources constantly,</v>

320
00:17:14.281 --> 00:17:18.120
<v Speaker 2>constantly so that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Paula de can orient itself as the</v>

321
00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:21.780
<v Speaker 2>snake of the environment moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why you need free speech.</v>

322
00:17:21.781 --> 00:17:24.180
<v Speaker 2>And so the left and the right get along</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly well together,</v>

323
00:17:24.181 --> 00:17:27.390
<v Speaker 2>as long as they can talk to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as they can't talk to each</v>

324
00:17:27.391 --> 00:17:29.010
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the alternative,</v>

325
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.490
<v Speaker 2>there's only one alternate to</v>
<v Speaker 2>alternatives to negotiation.</v>

326
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.390
<v Speaker 2>Simple as that one is slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other risk tyranny.</v>

327
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.640
<v Speaker 2>So those you cannot negotiate with will</v>
<v Speaker 2>either become your slaves or your</v>

328
00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.380
<v Speaker 2>tyrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you wipe outs free speech,</v>

329
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.500
<v Speaker 2>then that's what you're left with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why free speech isn't just</v>

330
00:17:46.501 --> 00:17:48.360
<v Speaker 2>another right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Christ's sake,</v>

331
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 2>it's not another right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dumb can you be to think that you</v>

332
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:56.760
<v Speaker 2>don't know anything if you think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the mechanism by which people have</v>

333
00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Speaker 2>different opinions</v>

334
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.800
<v Speaker 2>talk instead of strangling each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and,</v>

335
00:18:04.101 --> 00:18:05.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want them to strangle each</v>

336
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:08.640
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you might then really,</v>

337
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.960
<v Speaker 2>you might then take away the right to</v>
<v Speaker 2>express their opinion and watched the</v>

338
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:17.580
<v Speaker 2>whole thing go up in flames and go like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this because maybe that's what a big</v>

339
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:19.590
<v Speaker 2>part of you wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

340
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.920
<v Speaker 2>do you see any connection between</v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemitism and postmodernism</v>

341
00:18:25.921 --> 00:18:27.900
<v Speaker 2>specifically on university campuses?</v>

342
00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.110
<v Speaker 3>I had an insight the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

343
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.530
<v Speaker 3>and it actually came through some</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoanalytic reading.</v>

344
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I googled anti Semitic images</v>

345
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 3>and I invite you to all do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And three quarters of those images came</v>

346
00:18:49.031 --> 00:18:54.031
<v Speaker 3>up as an old man with the big nose and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was doing really one of three things.</v>

347
00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 3>He was counting his money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was torturing a child or in an</v>

348
00:19:05.021 --> 00:19:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Israeli guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was stealing territory and it just,</v>

349
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.730
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought of a picture of what Jews</v>

350
00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.880
<v Speaker 3>look like and there's men and women and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all ages and there's lots of</v>

351
00:19:15.881 --> 00:19:19.210
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was interesting.</v>

352
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.920
<v Speaker 3>There was one picture of a woman who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bad Jew.</v>

353
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.670
<v Speaker 3>She was witch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

354
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.640
<v Speaker 3>there are some psychoanalytic concepts</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'll share with you now that I</v>

355
00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:39.110
<v Speaker 3>think relate both to postmodernism and</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti antisemitism.</v>

356
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.690
<v Speaker 3>And it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

357
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.130
<v Speaker 3>analytically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if things go well when we're in her</v>

358
00:19:46.131 --> 00:19:47.150
<v Speaker 3>mother's womb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

359
00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:51.410
<v Speaker 3>there's a sense we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we think of a kind of a paradise that</v>

360
00:19:51.411 --> 00:19:52.520
<v Speaker 3>human beings beginning.</v>

361
00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:58.300
<v Speaker 3>And of course there are many stories</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the expulsion from paradise.</v>

362
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.790
<v Speaker 3>But if our childhoods go well and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>the apple of our parents die and they</v>

363
00:20:03.791 --> 00:20:08.770
<v Speaker 3>hold us and they sued us and we imagined</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want milk and milk arises.</v>

364
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:13.120
<v Speaker 3>There's this early period where there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of narcissistic,</v>

365
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.540
<v Speaker 3>it's not in a negative way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just wonderful thing where everything</v>

366
00:20:16.541 --> 00:20:19.060
<v Speaker 3>works out where we're totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>egocentric,</v>

367
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.290
<v Speaker 3>but it's appropriate and we're in a kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a paradise.</v>

368
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:27.700
<v Speaker 3>And of course in the course of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we move in and out of that now then</v>

369
00:20:27.701 --> 00:20:31.840
<v Speaker 3>reality hits and reality hits in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of discomforts.</v>

370
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.020
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a kind of natural biological thing</v>

371
00:20:35.021 --> 00:20:37.300
<v Speaker 3>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as we get older,</v>

372
00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.890
<v Speaker 3>we learned that to go into society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are limits on us and there are</v>

373
00:20:41.891 --> 00:20:44.890
<v Speaker 3>rules</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

374
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.750
<v Speaker 3>if can't deal with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we develop an image in our minds of that</v>

375
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.250
<v Speaker 3>he or it's usually a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he for mythological reasons.</v>

376
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Rules are often tied into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

377
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.420
<v Speaker 3>the masculine and nature is often tied</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the feminine.</v>

378
00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:06.400
<v Speaker 3>And in many cross cultural mist,</v>

379
00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.550
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the representative or the symbol of the</v>

380
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.050
<v Speaker 3>rule giver that I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I don't detest is often a male.</v>

381
00:21:16.051 --> 00:21:20.970
<v Speaker 3>A father and old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things about Judaism,</v>

382
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.320
<v Speaker 3>everybody who studied it knows is</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of laws and there's a lot</v>

383
00:21:25.321 --> 00:21:30.321
<v Speaker 3>of rules and the picture of God in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Judaism is often depicted as a man who</v>

384
00:21:33.121 --> 00:21:36.630
<v Speaker 3>can be angry or a times punitive and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

385
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:42.140
<v Speaker 3>So I think one of the things that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened is that's caused antisemitism,</v>

386
00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.600
<v Speaker 3>is that the the Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pot onto the Jew is projected,</v>

387
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:53.220
<v Speaker 3>are discontent with the fact that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>life one of the things we have to do is</v>

388
00:21:53.221 --> 00:21:57.450
<v Speaker 3>face limit and rules and even the French</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoanalyst talked about the no of the</v>

389
00:21:57.451 --> 00:22:02.451
<v Speaker 3>father and saw the superego is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative male image and one of the</v>

390
00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:03.480
<v Speaker 3>things about</v>

391
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.470
<v Speaker 3>having had a very protective upbringing</v>
<v Speaker 3>or overprotected upbringing that Jordan</v>

392
00:22:11.771 --> 00:22:16.771
<v Speaker 3>was describing and I was describing</v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier is as I put it earlier,</v>

393
00:22:17.081 --> 00:22:17.860
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've,</v>

394
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.360
<v Speaker 3>if you've had a denatured existence and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you come up against limits and</v>

395
00:22:22.361 --> 00:22:24.820
<v Speaker 3>adult life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels that all the problems are</v>

396
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:27.770
<v Speaker 3>caused by human beings and rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

397
00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry for the long answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

398
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.580
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a serious,</v>

399
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:32.310
<v Speaker 3>serious question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

400
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:37.770
<v Speaker 3>I talked a lot about some of the very</v>
<v Speaker 3>good things in classical liberalism and</v>

401
00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:42.370
<v Speaker 3>classical liberalism can be shared by</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern conservatives and modern</v>

402
00:22:42.371 --> 00:22:44.530
<v Speaker 3>liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are liberal liberals and liberal</v>

403
00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:46.450
<v Speaker 3>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are also a liberal conservatives</v>

404
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:51.460
<v Speaker 3>and liberals and I don't see anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than the classical liberal</v>

405
00:22:51.911 --> 00:22:54.670
<v Speaker 3>arguments to keep us talking to each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

406
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.450
<v Speaker 3>but that's not to say that liberalism is</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>

407
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:04.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm liberalism to some degree because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't take a position on things and</v>

408
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.440
<v Speaker 3>stays open on things in ways that</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain traditional approaches don't.</v>

409
00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.870
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will take a position on things does</v>

410
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.900
<v Speaker 3>slip easily into relativism and</v>
<v Speaker 3>relativism basically says a and</v>

411
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:25.570
<v Speaker 3>relativism is embraced by postmodernism</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're not trying to change the</v>

412
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:27.470
<v Speaker 3>world in a particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

413
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.830
<v Speaker 3>it's on and off again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of relationship.</v>

414
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Relativism says that there is no solid</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophical underpinning for thought</v>

415
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.160
<v Speaker 3>thoughts about right and wrong or good</v>
<v Speaker 3>and evil or how we should act,</v>

416
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.330
<v Speaker 3>and that creates a massive amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety and when ever any of us in our</v>

417
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:52.331
<v Speaker 3>lives come up against the limit or</v>
<v Speaker 3>border or some kind of essential.</v>

418
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:58.220
<v Speaker 3>If we've been raised relativistically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as many young people have today to</v>

419
00:23:58.221 --> 00:23:59.450
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

420
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not really entitled to take your</v>

421
00:24:01.911 --> 00:24:05.600
<v Speaker 3>point of view too seriously at all</v>
<v Speaker 3>because nothing's really right or wrong.</v>

422
00:24:05.601 --> 00:24:08.180
<v Speaker 3>It's just a value judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

423
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:13.360
<v Speaker 3>then you can start to resent or be angry</v>
<v Speaker 3>about rules or limits.</v>

424
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.630
<v Speaker 3>So part of the postmodern attack is on</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

425
00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:18.883
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

426
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.790
<v Speaker 3>certain things in biological which seem</v>
<v Speaker 3>akin to laws.</v>

427
00:24:22.791 --> 00:24:25.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that there are laws of</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature of the way.</v>

428
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:29.480
<v Speaker 3>There are laws of human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are these regularities or</v>

429
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:33.620
<v Speaker 3>patterns in nature that we see and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>often as a short form,</v>

430
00:24:33.621 --> 00:24:38.300
<v Speaker 3>call them laws and postmodernism often</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks those and says no.</v>

431
00:24:38.301 --> 00:24:43.301
<v Speaker 3>They're just socially constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means imagined to in some way or</v>

432
00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:46.430
<v Speaker 3>other appease or please a social,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a social group.</v>

433
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.940
<v Speaker 3>So this is a long roundabout answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that many of us carry within</v>

434
00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:59.411
<v Speaker 3>us a deep resentment in our narcissistic</v>
<v Speaker 3>parts of ourselves that in this life we</v>

435
00:25:02.511 --> 00:25:07.511
<v Speaker 3>have to adapt to limit and law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that can come up as depicting an</v>

436
00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 3>image of an older man who represents</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who's hidebound by law,</v>

437
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and doesn't have a spirit and is</v>

438
00:25:18.051 --> 00:25:20.900
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally greedy and trying to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>something away from you.</v>

439
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:22.723
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

440
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:24.993
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

441
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.790
<v Speaker 3>that shows up in postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

442
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea,</v>

443
00:25:28.811 --> 00:25:30.310
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the Jew is greedy.</v>

444
00:25:30.311 --> 00:25:34.110
<v Speaker 3>I haven't completely figured that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've got an answer for that.</v>

445
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:34.993
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

446
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:37.840
<v Speaker 3>but I just want to say a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very interesting.</v>

447
00:25:37.841 --> 00:25:42.841
<v Speaker 3>The old man is often abusing a child in</v>
<v Speaker 3>those antisemitic images.</v>

448
00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.530
<v Speaker 3>And of course there were stories about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jews kidnapping,</v>

449
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.070
<v Speaker 3>gentel children and sucking their blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>and eating their blood and so on and so</v>

450
00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:54.340
<v Speaker 3>forth is Passover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a hint that this is the</v>

451
00:25:54.341 --> 00:25:59.341
<v Speaker 3>child's view of a terrifying father</v>
<v Speaker 3>image that is trying to take something</v>

452
00:26:01.571 --> 00:26:03.940
<v Speaker 3>away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course</v>

453
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.090
<v Speaker 3>it's about patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

454
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea is this man represents the</v>

455
00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:15.070
<v Speaker 3>tribe or some kind of control and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and postmodernism is very much against</v>

456
00:26:15.071 --> 00:26:16.780
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

457
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.160
<v Speaker 3>today I spoke a lot about rational</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

458
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.880
<v Speaker 3>but Jordan has spoken about mythology</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

459
00:26:24.881 --> 00:26:28.210
<v Speaker 3>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very deep archetypal and mythological</v>

460
00:26:28.211 --> 00:26:32.530
<v Speaker 3>things that are driving a lot of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why it's worth,</v>

461
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google antisemitic images and you'll see</v>

462
00:26:34.901 --> 00:26:38.280
<v Speaker 3>what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're also,</v>

463
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing to consider is if,</v>

464
00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.290
<v Speaker 3>if you're a minority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should at least have the decency be</v>

465
00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 3>unsuccessful,</v>

466
00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.201
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

467
00:26:54.201 --> 00:26:56.090
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you regard the system is corrupt,</v>

468
00:26:56.091 --> 00:26:58.720
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to regard the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are successful say</v>

469
00:26:58.721 --> 00:27:02.020
<v Speaker 2>disproportionately even as ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt.</v>

470
00:27:02.021 --> 00:27:05.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of convenient if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>angry about the fact that you're not</v>

471
00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:06.550
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

472
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the only driving force,</v>

473
00:27:08.891 --> 00:27:10.570
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good part of it,</v>

474
00:27:10.571 --> 00:27:11.140
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

475
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.390
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

476
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.660
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing better than being</v>
<v Speaker 2>punished for your virtues.</v>

477
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.433
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

478
00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.480
<v Speaker 1>but you touched on this briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were quite a few questions</v>

479
00:27:26.481 --> 00:27:28.850
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's worth rehashing and</v>

480
00:27:28.851 --> 00:27:30.080
<v Speaker 1>perhaps expanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

481
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.270
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

482
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.920
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of this strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>bedfellows ship between the politically</v>

483
00:27:33.921 --> 00:27:36.620
<v Speaker 1>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left and Islamic activities?</v>

484
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Is there an element of cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissidence?</v>

485
00:27:39.321 --> 00:27:43.670
<v Speaker 1>And I'm wondering if you could also</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch on bill 59 in Quebec right now.</v>

486
00:27:43.671 --> 00:27:46.490
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of the Sharia compliance</v>
<v Speaker 1>bill that's going on over there.</v>

487
00:27:46.491 --> 00:27:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Basically thought crimes against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>prophet.</v>

488
00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

489
00:27:49.881 --> 00:27:51.680
<v Speaker 1>we'll see you legally reprimanded.</v>

490
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.893
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll start.</v>

491
00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first part.</v>

492
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.600
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just tell him.</v>

493
00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Just tell me the first part of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>question again if you would tell us.</v>

494
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.221
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

495
00:28:06.221 --> 00:28:06.971
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing,</v>

496
00:28:06.971 --> 00:28:09.430
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing contradictory about that</v>

497
00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.910
<v Speaker 2>except you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments have layers,</v>

498
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.020
<v Speaker 2>very many layers and something can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>contradictory at one level and,</v>

499
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.590
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and non contradictory of another.</v>

500
00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.210
<v Speaker 2>It means you're thinking is disorganized</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some profound way,</v>

501
00:28:22.211 --> 00:28:25.420
<v Speaker 2>but it happens all the time because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking is a disorganized in</v>

502
00:28:25.421 --> 00:28:28.600
<v Speaker 2>some profound way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when push comes to shove,</v>

503
00:28:28.601 --> 00:28:30.730
<v Speaker 2>you find out what the basic motivation</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

504
00:28:30.731 --> 00:28:33.430
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I said already the enemy</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your enemy,</v>

505
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:38.670
<v Speaker 2>the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if your fundamental goal is to</v>

506
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:40.900
<v Speaker 2>enhance women's freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

507
00:28:40.901 --> 00:28:44.140
<v Speaker 2>well then it's going to be pretty rough</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be crop climb into bed with,</v>

508
00:28:44.141 --> 00:28:46.600
<v Speaker 2>let's say the Saudis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I already mentioned.</v>

509
00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:51.310
<v Speaker 2>But if your fundamental goal is to recap</v>
<v Speaker 2>havoc with Western civilization,</v>

510
00:28:51.311 --> 00:28:52.001
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

511
00:28:52.001 --> 00:28:53.140
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a problem.</v>

512
00:28:53.141 --> 00:28:54.730
<v Speaker 2>There's still cognitive dissonance</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

513
00:28:54.731 --> 00:28:57.700
<v Speaker 2>That's you can sacrifice the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights thing.</v>

514
00:28:57.701 --> 00:28:59.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you were ready for that to</v>

515
00:28:59.831 --> 00:29:03.100
<v Speaker 2>any great degree anyways at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your nasty little soul.</v>

516
00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:08.460
<v Speaker 2>So there no cognitive dissonance there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just another tactic as far as I can</v>

517
00:29:08.471 --> 00:29:10.600
<v Speaker 2>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know the fact that it also</v>

518
00:29:10.601 --> 00:29:15.601
<v Speaker 2>allows for broad scale attacks on what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might consider this.</v>

519
00:29:16.511 --> 00:29:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe as putting it a bit too bluntly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only country in the Middle East that</v>

520
00:29:20.801 --> 00:29:25.530
<v Speaker 2>has any resemblance of of success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then so much the better because they're</v>

521
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.560
<v Speaker 2>just representations of patriarchal</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppression.</v>

522
00:29:29.561 --> 00:29:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Because how could they be anything else</v>
<v Speaker 2>since there's no such thing as</v>

523
00:29:32.681 --> 00:29:35.320
<v Speaker 2>competence properly defined within the</v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy.</v>

524
00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:40.810
<v Speaker 2>So forget about cognitive dissonance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just watch what people do when</v>

525
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they face a</v>

526
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.910
<v Speaker 1>paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll understand their deeper</v>

527
00:29:44.911 --> 00:29:45.880
<v Speaker 1>motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

528
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.233
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

529
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I've just been told that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually going to be closing the</v>

530
00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:58.060
<v Speaker 1>auditorium momentarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I worried that's going to be the very</v>

531
00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.133
<v Speaker 1>last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

532
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:00.340
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

533
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.640
<v Speaker 1>however I will say that on behalf of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire audience,</v>

534
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.660
<v Speaker 1>thank you so very much to both of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen and scholars for,</v>

535
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:08.321
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

536
00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:10.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing together both nature and</v>

537
00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:14.110
<v Speaker 1>nurture with all of your backgrounds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forming our own opinions,</v>

538
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:16.980
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully acting as role models and</v>

539
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.510
<v Speaker 1>how we should combat political</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness in our own lives.</v>

540
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:20.344
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>

541
00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.900
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
