1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2
00:00:00.991 --> 00:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

3
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>jared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to bring us up to date.</v>

5
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

6
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously a lot's been happening since,</v>

7
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since we,</v>

8
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 2>we last spoke on this issue and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to some extent I guess,</v>

9
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.463
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what surprised me was not the amount of </v>

10
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:21.774
<v Speaker 2>lawyers and paralegals and licensees </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have not only reached out but </v>

11
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 2>apparently written to the law society on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this statement of principles issue,</v>

12
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public.</v>

13
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

14
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 2>outreach from the general public and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>

15
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 2>you can look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

16
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 2>the comments on the youtube video that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we put up.</v>

17
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.793
<v Speaker 2>The general public is concerned and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are very much watching in terms of the </v>

18
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 2>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

19
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actors,</v>

20
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 2>lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paralegals.</v>

21
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

22
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I understand there are a lot that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>written,</v>

23
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the law society.</v>

24
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.503
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the types of people that are reaching </v>

25
00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 2>out to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

26
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 2>are a broad cross section of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>

27
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 2>a very experienced lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>

28
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well established lawyers.</v>

29
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Constitutional scholars are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

30
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.413
<v Speaker 2>are doing their thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also getting paralegals who a </v>

31
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 2>sense that there's a problem and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>also writing.</v>

32
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.823
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I think has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting through all of this is that </v>

33
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 2>the tone of the comments that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the feedback I'm getting has migrated</v>

34
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 2>in first instance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

35
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an issue with,</v>

36
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

37
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.151
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

38
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 2>this compelled speech idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

39
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:33.354
<v Speaker 2>it sounds objectionable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those same people and some new people </v>

40
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:38.124
<v Speaker 2>are beginning to reach out and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the commentary is changing to some </v>

41
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:41.754
<v Speaker 2>extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is now that they're beginning to </v>

42
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:43.584
<v Speaker 2>examine the underlying report itself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're coming to me with questions </v>

43
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

44
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

45
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 2>that there is systemic discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 2>and racism within the legal industry.</v>

46
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting is I've actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>got racialized licensees that are big,</v>

47
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.473
<v Speaker 2>that are beginning to not only reach out</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also publicizing their opinions on </v>

48
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

49
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 2>and they're starting to grapple with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that larger question of,</v>

50
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.743
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean when our industry is </v>

51
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:16.401
<v Speaker 2>systemically a discriminatory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people are becoming aware.</v>

52
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 2>There's an awareness that's coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

53
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of that has to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

54
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 2>with the media that's been coming out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>tandem with,</v>

55
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 2>with what we did on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube.</v>

56
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

57
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.110
<v Speaker 1>well in the problem with the systemic </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism charges that while it's vague and</v>

58
00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:32.944
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it targets everyone equally in </v>

59
00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 1>some sense within the profession and </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires systemic adjustment.</v>

60
00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:40.954
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously has to be supported with </v>

61
00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:43.894
<v Speaker 1>hard data and it isn't self evident that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the data to support that claim is valid </v>

62
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.990
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

63
00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:52.810
<v Speaker 1>by any stretch of the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

64
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.940
<v Speaker 1>So I've had a great deal of feedback as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well from,</v>

65
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>from both lawyers and the</v>

66
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 3>general public and they are of a mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

67
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:05.374
<v Speaker 3>I think as a jared described about their</v>
<v Speaker 3>concerns over the forced speech aspects </v>

68
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.813
<v Speaker 3>of this requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we should make note of the kind </v>

69
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.600
<v Speaker 3>of response that has been generated from</v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters of this policy in response to</v>

70
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 3>the kinds of concerns that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>raised.</v>

71
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.833
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of those people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>insisting that this is a legitimate </v>

72
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 3>requirement are saying that although </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called a statement,</v>

73
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 3>it is not forced speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's simply governance conduct.</v>

74
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 3>And if I might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just read out a quote attributed to</v>

75
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 3>the treasurer on this question that </v>
<v Speaker 3>appeared in the La Times.</v>

76
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.253
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the treasurer was quoted as saying with </v>

77
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:50.974
<v Speaker 3>respect to the statement of values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a conduct obligation to </v>

78
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:57.214
<v Speaker 3>recognize that we have to commit to </v>
<v Speaker 3>these values and it's not a speech </v>

79
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 3>obligation or a thought obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

80
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:08.284
<v Speaker 3>just on the face of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that statement seems strange to say the </v>

81
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 3>least to say that when we have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>to commit.</v>

82
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.870
<v Speaker 3>And yet that's not either a thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>proposition or a speech proposition even</v>

83
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 3>have to commit in a statement that </v>
<v Speaker 3>indicates that you have.</v>

84
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.593
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it begs the question of what's the </v>

85
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:30.060
<v Speaker 1>definition of commit?</v>

86
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.420
<v Speaker 3>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

87
00:04:32.421 --> 00:04:37.070
<v Speaker 3>And the way that they're portraying it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that this is simply a,</v>

88
00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

89
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.123
<v Speaker 3>an articulation of the obligations that </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyers already have in both the rules </v>

90
00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:45.830
<v Speaker 3>of professional conduct and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the human rights code,</v>

91
00:04:45.831 --> 00:04:48.020
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is clearly not the case,</v>

92
00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:51.980
<v Speaker 3>nowhere in the rules of professional </v>
<v Speaker 3>conduct or in the human rights code.</v>

93
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.400
<v Speaker 3>Is there any obligation upon anyone to </v>
<v Speaker 3>promote anything?</v>

94
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also it's,</v>

95
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.870
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>

96
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.713
<v Speaker 1>if you already have that obligation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it necessary to add this </v>

97
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 1>additional layer of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

98
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 1>let's call it obedience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

99
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.113
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just,</v>

100
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.370
<v Speaker 3>let's just note the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

101
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.600
<v Speaker 3>the two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two</v>

102
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.860
<v Speaker 3>contradictions in the portrayal of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the one hand,</v>

103
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 3>it is described as not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

104
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 3>there are no immediate sanctions to </v>
<v Speaker 3>follow.</v>

105
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.320
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to send the statement in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just have to write it.</v>

106
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.910
<v Speaker 3>You just have to put it in your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>file.</v>

107
00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:30.410
<v Speaker 3>So we're not worried about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

108
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.453
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

109
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.190
<v Speaker 3>it's no big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you so concerned about it?</v>

110
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.880
<v Speaker 3>And on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are emphasizing how central this is</v>

111
00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 3>to the project that they had set out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

112
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.500
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

113
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.333
<v Speaker 3>and there are many people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggested essentially that if you are </v>

114
00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:45.644
<v Speaker 3>not willing to do this statement and </v>
<v Speaker 3>indicate your agreement with a certain </v>

115
00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:50.984
<v Speaker 3>set of values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you should not be allowed to be a </v>

116
00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:55.220
<v Speaker 3>lawyer and practice in Ontario.</v>

117
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.901
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>that certainly seems to be the end game </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my sense has been watching this,</v>

119
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:00.644
<v Speaker 1>that because of the public pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're backing off to some degree in </v>

120
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:05.024
<v Speaker 1>their public statements by moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward into the future at some </v>

121
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.304
<v Speaker 1>indeterminate date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual sanctions that will be </v>

122
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:12.884
<v Speaker 1>applied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that right now from a public </v>

123
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 1>relations perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like this isn't a direct Konijn</v>

124
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>a measure and we might as well also </v>
<v Speaker 1>remind people that,</v>

125
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.420
<v Speaker 1>and they might wonder why I am here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

126
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 1>my concern when I first encountered this</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that I know</v>

127
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:31.803
<v Speaker 1>I know what that sinking feeling you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can predict the future </v>

128
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:35.174
<v Speaker 1>accurately and you don't like your </v>
<v Speaker 1>prediction that if the law society </v>

129
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:40.783
<v Speaker 1>prevails with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the rest of the professional </v>

130
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 1>organizations in Canada will follow in </v>
<v Speaker 1>lockstep very,</v>

131
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:47.414
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly and will end up in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where every professional in </v>

132
00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:50.804
<v Speaker 1>Canada is required to panda statement of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Principles that are essentially I'm </v>

133
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.240
<v Speaker 1>required by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by their colleges espousing a particular</v>

134
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:02.744
<v Speaker 1>political and not only political but </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical and worldview philosophy </v>

135
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.810
<v Speaker 1>or risk losing their licenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

136
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I know in the legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the law society already,</v>

137
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:13.994
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a requirement that you have to </v>

138
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.010
<v Speaker 1>undertake training in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>equity,</v>

139
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.780
<v Speaker 1>diversity and inclusivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

140
00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:22.370
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what they're requiring.</v>

141
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just read that out.</v>

142
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.843
<v Speaker 3>In this roster of recommendations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that complication has passed his </v>

143
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:34.811
<v Speaker 3>recommendation and the third party </v>
<v Speaker 3>recommendation nine reads as follows,</v>

144
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.553
<v Speaker 3>the law society will require each </v>
<v Speaker 3>licensee to complete three hours of an </v>

145
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:43.004
<v Speaker 3>accredited program focused on equality </v>
<v Speaker 3>and inclusion with within the first </v>

146
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:47.594
<v Speaker 3>three years following the adoption of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the recommendations and one hour per </v>

147
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're every year thereafter,</v>

148
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 3>which will count towards professionalism</v>
<v Speaker 3>hours for that year.</v>

149
00:07:56.271 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 3>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is exactly as you've described,</v>

150
00:07:59.240 --> 00:07:59.901
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

151
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:00.734
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there will be training now so that you </v>

152
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 3>have the right attitude about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>matters.</v>

153
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.033
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can just imagine what that </v>

154
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 1>training will be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

155
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:10.743
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some commentary in the </v>

156
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.370
<v Speaker 2>underlying report about unconscious bias</v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

157
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.421
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

158
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:17.161
<v Speaker 2>and I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>

159
00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:17.994
<v Speaker 2>that you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've had some discussions about that </v>

160
00:08:19.121 --> 00:08:20.080
<v Speaker 2>and some of your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

161
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.460
<v Speaker 2>your public works.</v>

162
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

163
00:08:22.441 --> 00:08:23.274
<v Speaker 1>there is absolutely no evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever that unconscious bias </v>

164
00:08:25.441 --> 00:08:27.990
<v Speaker 1>training produces the results intended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

165
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.720
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>bias,</v>

166
00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:33.480
<v Speaker 1>say as assessed by the implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>association test,</v>

167
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.810
<v Speaker 1>which is a pathological misuse of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological instrument.</v>

168
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:37.733
<v Speaker 1>Even the people who designed it have </v>
<v Speaker 1>grudgingly admitted that there's a </v>

169
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.790
<v Speaker 1>relationship between those implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice is so to speak,</v>

170
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.530
<v Speaker 1>which aren't even recognized universally</v>
<v Speaker 1>by psychologist as implicit prejudices.</v>

171
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.470
<v Speaker 1>The relationship between them in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>case in behavior is very,</v>

172
00:08:52.471 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 1>very small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It accounts for very overt behavior</v>

173
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.563
<v Speaker 4>and then the evidence that you can train</v>
<v Speaker 4>people out of those unconscious biases </v>

174
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 4>is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is,</v>

175
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.370
<v Speaker 4>this is a misuse of science and </v>
<v Speaker 4>education at,</v>

176
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 4>at every level from a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>

177
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:12.774
<v Speaker 4>It's the inappropriate politicization of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very new line of inquiry in social </v>

178
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 4>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if the people who designed the IAT,</v>

179
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.230
<v Speaker 4>in my estimation had an ounce of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

180
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

181
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 4>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Intellectual Integrity,</v>

182
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:27.864
<v Speaker 4>they would denounce the misuse of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>test because it doesn't fit the </v>

183
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 4>requirements that psychologists have </v>
<v Speaker 4>laid down for validity or reliability.</v>

184
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 4>And that's partly why it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>admissible in court,</v>

185
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:38.334
<v Speaker 4>for example.</v>

186
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.523
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the committees that are selecting our </v>

187
00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:45.710
<v Speaker 2>judges currently are being put through </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious bias training.</v>

188
00:09:45.711 --> 00:09:46.544
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

189
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

190
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not the law society will,</v>

191
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.340
<v Speaker 2>will heed the warning that you just put </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

192
00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:52.720
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

193
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.330
<v Speaker 4>it's very unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you know,</v>

194
00:09:55.331 --> 00:09:58.360
<v Speaker 4>I've already decided that with regards </v>
<v Speaker 4>to my clinical license,</v>

195
00:09:58.361 --> 00:09:59.194
<v Speaker 4>if I was required to undertake this kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of reeducation program and to pen a </v>

196
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:06.400
<v Speaker 4>statement of principles of that sort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I just give up my license.</v>

197
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.590
<v Speaker 4>So the way I'm doing that.</v>

198
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.100
<v Speaker 2>So the public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one thing I wanted to let you</v>

199
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:12.750
<v Speaker 2>know is that you're not alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan.</v>

200
00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

201
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the groundswell of public feedback that,</v>

202
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 2>that I'm seeing and receiving directly </v>
<v Speaker 2>into my office has been significant.</v>

203
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.110
<v Speaker 2>People recognize exactly what we talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about on the last video that,</v>

204
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.233
<v Speaker 2>that the legal industry and lawyers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular are supposed to be that bull </v>

205
00:10:28.271 --> 00:10:33.271
<v Speaker 2>work against this type of overreach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they really very much.</v>

206
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.583
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a large segment of the </v>

207
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:37.860
<v Speaker 2>population that are worried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see that if the lawyers fall down,</v>

208
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.940
<v Speaker 2>then the rest will follow.</v>

209
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.573
<v Speaker 3>Can we just make a note of one argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has been made in favor of the </v>

210
00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:45.974
<v Speaker 3>statement with kids that lawyers are </v>
<v Speaker 3>already subject to a set of ethical </v>

211
00:10:51.321 --> 00:10:56.321
<v Speaker 3>obligations and this is just a one more </v>
<v Speaker 3>an extension of the same kind of idea,</v>

212
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.183
<v Speaker 3>but there is a significant difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the kind of ethical obligations </v>

213
00:11:01.491 --> 00:11:02.324
<v Speaker 3>that exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are essentially neutral non </v>

214
00:11:04.301 --> 00:11:05.134
<v Speaker 3>political obligations that relate to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that our adversarial adjudication </v>

215
00:11:10.701 --> 00:11:12.290
<v Speaker 3>system is supposed to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it just,</v>

216
00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:13.124
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every lawyer has an ethical obligation </v>

217
00:11:15.891 --> 00:11:16.724
<v Speaker 3>to avoid a conflict of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't represent both sides in a </v>

218
00:11:20.631 --> 00:11:21.464
<v Speaker 3>dispute because that would be contrary </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the way our adversarial system that </v>

219
00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:26.060
<v Speaker 3>is supposed to function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't.</v>

220
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:26.923
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't represent both sides in the </v>

221
00:11:28.461 --> 00:11:31.880
<v Speaker 3>dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that ethical obligation doesn't have</v>

222
00:11:31.881 --> 00:11:32.714
<v Speaker 3>political content.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter whether you are a </v>

223
00:11:35.631 --> 00:11:36.464
<v Speaker 3>socialist or a conservative or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>classical liberal or anywhere on the </v>

224
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.040
<v Speaker 3>political spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The the.</v>

225
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.580
<v Speaker 3>If you are functioning in this legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

226
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.890
<v Speaker 3>it only makes logical sense that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>must proceed without in the absence of a</v>

227
00:11:51.891 --> 00:11:52.724
<v Speaker 3>conflict of interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is substantially different </v>

228
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 3>proposition than the proposition that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these requirements are based on,</v>

229
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 3>which are as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as Jordan that you mentioned earlier,</v>

230
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.273
<v Speaker 3>these are politically charged and had </v>
<v Speaker 3>substantive political content in them </v>

231
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.483
<v Speaker 3>that they'd lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Society is essentially saying that </v>

232
00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:14.731
<v Speaker 3>unless you adhere to a certain ideology </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you are not fit to practice law.</v>

233
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.420
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also an admission that this is,</v>

234
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:20.680
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the more,</v>

235
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.753
<v Speaker 4>perhaps even more dangerous element of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is that to undertake reeducation </v>

236
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:27.694
<v Speaker 4>with regards to your political beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 4>surrounding or even factual beliefs </v>

237
00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:32.764
<v Speaker 4>surrounding equity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>diversity and inclusivity is to act out </v>

238
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.473
<v Speaker 4>by implication the fact that you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>that reeducation because you're part of </v>

239
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 4>the problem of systemic racism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

240
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:49.570
<v Speaker 4>it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very psychologically significant to</v>

241
00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:50.404
<v Speaker 4>act out in admission of your guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because what happens is generally </v>

242
00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:54.934
<v Speaker 4>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that people then retroactively alter </v>

243
00:12:57.041 --> 00:13:01.720
<v Speaker 4>their self images and start to wonder </v>
<v Speaker 4>about such things.</v>

244
00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:04.480
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're either powereds for,</v>

245
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.600
<v Speaker 4>for going along with the um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

246
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.513
<v Speaker 4>with the requirements are liars for </v>
<v Speaker 4>producing a statement of principle that </v>

247
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:13.534
<v Speaker 4>they don't actually agree in or they </v>
<v Speaker 4>start to tilt their beliefs in the </v>

248
00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 4>direction that's required by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>demands.</v>

249
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:20.620
<v Speaker 4>And that's usually what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

250
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.490
<v Speaker 4>and I'm quite convinced that the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who do this sort of thing who make these</v>

251
00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:25.324
<v Speaker 4>requirements know that and that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a manipulation on their part to </v>

252
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:34.230
<v Speaker 4>tell political belief overtly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it,</v>

253
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.650
<v Speaker 4>you can't act these things out without </v>
<v Speaker 4>it having psychological consequences and</v>

254
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.600
<v Speaker 4>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Moral consequences,</v>

255
00:13:40.601 --> 00:13:44.110
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's very intrusive.</v>

256
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.660
<v Speaker 2>The other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bruce,</v>

257
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:50.050
<v Speaker 2>it's important to remember is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the dichotomy between belief,</v>

258
00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 2>thought and conduct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Currently lawyers in Ontario are subject</v>

259
00:13:53.921 --> 00:13:56.380
<v Speaker 2>to the rules of professional conduct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

260
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.490
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

261
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.623
<v Speaker 2>right now we have an obligation to act </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a certain way and to refrain from </v>

262
00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:03.214
<v Speaker 2>acting in other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the rules of professional </v>

263
00:14:05.951 --> 00:14:06.784
<v Speaker 2>conduct is thou shall not discriminate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think anybody would argue </v>

264
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:12.250
<v Speaker 2>with that and that thou shall act in </v>
<v Speaker 2>accordance with the,</v>

265
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.340
<v Speaker 2>with the human rights regime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

266
00:14:14.341 --> 00:14:16.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and associated codes across Canada.</v>

267
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.913
<v Speaker 2>Nobody could argue with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this statement of principles is </v>

268
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.270
<v Speaker 2>crossing the line into thought and </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>

269
00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:23.104
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the recommendations I would </v>

270
00:14:24.971 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 2>note in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the report,</v>

271
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.970
<v Speaker 2>recommendation number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually proposing to review and</v>

272
00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:33.610
<v Speaker 2>amend where appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules of professional conduct,</v>

273
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.653
<v Speaker 2>the paralegal rules of conduct and </v>
<v Speaker 2>commentaries to reinforce the </v>

274
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:40.240
<v Speaker 2>professional obligations of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>licensees to recognize,</v>

275
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.120
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge and promote principles of </v>
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>

276
00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:43.954
<v Speaker 2>diversity and inclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I find that fascinating because </v>

277
00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:46.984
<v Speaker 2>you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to amend a rule of conduct </v>

278
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.050
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to include of a sudden a,</v>

279
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:52.883
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an affirmation of thought while end and </v>

280
00:14:56.191 --> 00:14:59.130
<v Speaker 4>to insist upon promotion as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

281
00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:00.840
<v Speaker 4>why do you say very ill defined?</v>

282
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.210
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

283
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.043
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just go back to the words just to </v>

284
00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:05.880
<v Speaker 3>make this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

285
00:15:05.881 --> 00:15:07.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm going back through a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

286
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.240
<v Speaker 3>a quote attributed to the treasurer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the La Times piece.</v>

287
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.620
<v Speaker 3>He says this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

288
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.780
<v Speaker 3>the statement of values is an obligation</v>
<v Speaker 3>to promote equality,</v>

289
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.060
<v Speaker 3>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and inclusion generally,</v>

290
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:22.290
<v Speaker 3>which is nothing more than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>obligation lawyers have already,</v>

291
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.770
<v Speaker 3>but when you go to the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional conduct,</v>

292
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.233
<v Speaker 3>it says a lawyer has a special </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to respect the </v>

293
00:15:29.911 --> 00:15:30.744
<v Speaker 3>requirements of human rights laws in </v>
<v Speaker 3>force in Ontario and to honor the </v>

294
00:15:34.681 --> 00:15:39.390
<v Speaker 3>obligation not to discriminate on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grounds of race as a place of origin,</v>

295
00:15:39.391 --> 00:15:40.500
<v Speaker 3>color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc. Etc.</v>

296
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.630
<v Speaker 3>That's Exactly as you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jared.</v>

297
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.493
<v Speaker 3>This describes an obligation to observe </v>
<v Speaker 3>the law and this law consists of </v>

298
00:15:49.591 --> 00:15:50.424
<v Speaker 3>prohibitions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the obligation that lawyers are </v>

299
00:15:52.411 --> 00:15:55.230
<v Speaker 3>under no doubt about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they must do so,</v>

300
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.303
<v Speaker 3>but that does not include an obligation </v>
<v Speaker 3>to endorse and it does not include an </v>

301
00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:01.230
<v Speaker 3>obligation to promote.</v>

302
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:02.563
<v Speaker 4>RighT,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we should also point out just in </v>

303
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:05.264
<v Speaker 4>case it needs to be sad that none of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>three of us disagree with the idea that </v>

304
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.650
<v Speaker 4>people shouldn't be discriminated </v>
<v Speaker 4>against for reasons that have nothing to</v>

305
00:16:12.651 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 4>do with their competence.</v>

306
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 3>Agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Agreed.</v>

307
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:17.383
<v Speaker 3>This is about is not what this was about</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it might also be useful to talk for </v>

308
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:25.860
<v Speaker 3>a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also about the word equality is equality</v>

309
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.713
<v Speaker 3>has two competing legal meanings and and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law society has not defined which </v>

310
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:33.074
<v Speaker 3>one of them they mean explicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's clear by implication which one </v>

311
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:36.464
<v Speaker 3>they mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the two choices are formal equality </v>

312
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.380
<v Speaker 3>or substandard quality or quality of </v>
<v Speaker 3>results,</v>

313
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.393
<v Speaker 3>and the two things are quite different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Formal equality simply means that the </v>

314
00:16:46.221 --> 00:16:51.221
<v Speaker 3>same rules of conduct apply to everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of background of of wealth,</v>

315
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.640
<v Speaker 3>of lineage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of heritage,</v>

316
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:56.683
<v Speaker 3>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same rules apply to everybody in the </v>

317
00:16:58.941 --> 00:16:59.774
<v Speaker 3>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Equality of result means that everybody </v>

318
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:05.054
<v Speaker 3>ends up in the same place and and note </v>
<v Speaker 3>that these two ideas of equality are </v>

319
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:10.424
<v Speaker 3>diametrically opposed and inconsistent </v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other because if you have </v>

320
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.773
<v Speaker 3>formal equality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>applying the same rules to everybody </v>

321
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.133
<v Speaker 3>because everybody is different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have different results </v>

322
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:21.403
<v Speaker 3>for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you insist upon the same results for </v>

323
00:17:23.631 --> 00:17:24.464
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means you need different rules for </v>

324
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:28.520
<v Speaker 3>everybody for them to end up in the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

325
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.230
<v Speaker 3>so you cannot have both formally quality</v>
<v Speaker 3>and substandard quality together.</v>

326
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.500
<v Speaker 3>And traditionally the rule of law has </v>
<v Speaker 3>included the notion of formal equality.</v>

327
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.120
<v Speaker 3>If you have a properly functioning rule </v>
<v Speaker 3>of law,</v>

328
00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:41.954
<v Speaker 3>that means you have the same rules </v>
<v Speaker 3>applying to everybody without regard to </v>

329
00:17:45.141 --> 00:17:45.974
<v Speaker 3>who they are</v>

330
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.880
<v Speaker 4>with equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is now often termed equity,</v>

331
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.043
<v Speaker 4>is you can group people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>each individual in a multitude of </v>

332
00:17:55.981 --> 00:17:56.814
<v Speaker 4>different ways and it's impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 4>produce equality of outcome across all </v>

333
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:02.550
<v Speaker 4>those different dimensions of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>comparison,</v>

334
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 4>so it's a never ending struggle to </v>
<v Speaker 4>produce equality of outcome.</v>

335
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.073
<v Speaker 4>It's technically impossible and and </v>
<v Speaker 4>societies that have tried that have had </v>

336
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.333
<v Speaker 4>a well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been absolutely catastrophic and </v>

337
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.230
<v Speaker 4>terribly divisive.</v>

338
00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:21.580
<v Speaker 3>It is also contrary to that fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>legal proposition that justice is blind.</v>

339
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.963
<v Speaker 3>Justice is supposed to be blind to all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those personal certain </v>

340
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.633
<v Speaker 3>characteristics that one has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's race or color or gender or </v>

341
00:18:32.451 --> 00:18:35.680
<v Speaker 3>wealth or background or lineage or or </v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

342
00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:38.000
<v Speaker 3>or political connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it happens to be,</v>

343
00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:43.060
<v Speaker 3>a properly functioning judicial system </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't take account of who you are.</v>

344
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.533
<v Speaker 3>It simply takes account of the rules </v>
<v Speaker 3>that exist and tries to ensure that the </v>

345
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.220
<v Speaker 3>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those rules are,</v>

346
00:18:49.221 --> 00:18:50.054
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are enforced equally in the same way </v>

347
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:54.140
<v Speaker 3>with an even hand against everybody.</v>

348
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.210
<v Speaker 4>And The so called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

349
00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.840
<v Speaker 4>the data that has been generated is also</v>
<v Speaker 4>predicated on the implicit acceptance of</v>

350
00:19:00.841 --> 00:19:03.660
<v Speaker 4>inequality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a doctrine,</v>

351
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:04.523
<v Speaker 4>because the fact that every group isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>equally represented at outcome is the </v>

352
00:19:10.531 --> 00:19:13.830
<v Speaker 4>data point that's being used to indicate</v>
<v Speaker 4>systemic racism.</v>

353
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:15.900
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

354
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.430
<v Speaker 4>so then you also think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

355
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 4>what if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if you're in a situation where as a</v>

356
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 4>professional and an informed </v>
<v Speaker 4>professional,</v>

357
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.750
<v Speaker 4>you don't agree with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the conclusions drawn from the data</v>

358
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:28.584
<v Speaker 4>set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there is indication of systemic </v>

359
00:19:30.391 --> 00:19:33.990
<v Speaker 4>racism means is that now a belief that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get to have?</v>

360
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:34.853
<v Speaker 4>Because if you are forced to write this </v>
<v Speaker 4>statement of principles and alter your </v>

361
00:19:38.281 --> 00:19:39.114
<v Speaker 4>conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're acting out the proposition </v>

362
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:41.874
<v Speaker 4>that you accept the conclusion that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason there are some differences in </v>

363
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:45.894
<v Speaker 4>representation across groups is because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the enterprise is the whole legal </v>

364
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:52.710
<v Speaker 4>enterprise is systemically racist and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're buying.</v>

365
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.573
<v Speaker 4>You're also there by admitting your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>culpability in relationship to that and </v>

366
00:19:57.961 --> 00:20:00.030
<v Speaker 4>the corruption of the entire legal </v>
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

367
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.283
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me that you shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>required to admit to that if you don't </v>

368
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:05.933
<v Speaker 4>agree with it.</v>

369
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.870
<v Speaker 2>And that's the arc of the commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned at the outset,</v>

370
00:20:09.871 --> 00:20:14.250
<v Speaker 2>is that it started in one place and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>feedback I'm getting now is very much in</v>

371
00:20:14.251 --> 00:20:17.040
<v Speaker 2>that place that people are beginning to </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

372
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:18.630
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean,</v>

373
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.913
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the findings of this report for me </v>

374
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:23.810
<v Speaker 2>personally and for my industry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

375
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.760
<v Speaker 2>and what does the data say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people are digging down on it.</v>

376
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:27.594
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just read an article the other day </v>

377
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.833
<v Speaker 2>that said that there's actually been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>doubling in the representation of </v>

378
00:20:32.911 --> 00:20:35.010
<v Speaker 2>racialized licensees within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>

379
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between 2011 and 2014.</v>

380
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

381
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.790
<v Speaker 2>that's not something I think a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people recognize is that,</v>

382
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.470
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

383
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.980
<v Speaker 2>the report may may have touched on </v>
<v Speaker 2>something in terms of findings.</v>

384
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also,</v>

385
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some things to celebrate.</v>

386
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:54.160
<v Speaker 4>The other thing too is that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>specify it in a report like that.</v>

387
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:54.994
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to consider this </v>
<v Speaker 4>something approximating a scientific </v>

388
00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:58.803
<v Speaker 4>investigation which you and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>conducted in a manner that would meet </v>

389
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:03.160
<v Speaker 4>those requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my estimation,</v>

390
00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:03.994
<v Speaker 4>that there's going to be a lag in ethnic</v>
<v Speaker 4>representation as the population </v>

391
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:08.374
<v Speaker 4>demographics change because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>demographics of the population from </v>

392
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:12.214
<v Speaker 4>immigration are going to change more </v>
<v Speaker 4>rapidly than the the than a than a </v>

393
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.343
<v Speaker 4>representation of people in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>professions just because of the </v>

394
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:26.050
<v Speaker 4>necessity for the new immigrants to take</v>
<v Speaker 4>time to be incorporated into the culture</v>

395
00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:26.884
<v Speaker 4>and so the real point of data should </v>
<v Speaker 4>have been the rate at which new comers </v>

396
00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:32.624
<v Speaker 4>are being integrated into the profession</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather than the absolute numbers of </v>

397
00:21:36.281 --> 00:21:37.114
<v Speaker 4>people who are there already and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>self evident and so the fact that that </v>

398
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:41.944
<v Speaker 4>isn't being considered deeply in the in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the data is also indicative in my </v>

399
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:46.534
<v Speaker 4>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the political slapped of the </v>

400
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 4>interpretative framework through which </v>
<v Speaker 4>the data was analyzed.</v>

401
00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.013
<v Speaker 3>We'll make noTe of the irony of the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the word diversity is being used </v>

402
00:22:00.571 --> 00:22:05.250
<v Speaker 3>and the means by which are being used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>promote diversity.</v>

403
00:22:05.251 --> 00:22:06.084
<v Speaker 3>because in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the objectives of these </v>

404
00:22:09.301 --> 00:22:11.700
<v Speaker 3>recommendations is the opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity,</v>

405
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.180
<v Speaker 3>real diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genuine deep diversity is diverse,</v>

406
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.000
<v Speaker 3>includes diversity of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity of opinion,</v>

407
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.240
<v Speaker 3>diversity of worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity of ideology,</v>

408
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.410
<v Speaker 3>including all the other issues of </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity and diversity is a very,</v>

409
00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:28.080
<v Speaker 3>very important thing for a pluralistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

410
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.070
<v Speaker 3>You don't have diversity in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pluralistic society,</v>

411
00:22:32.071 --> 00:22:32.904
<v Speaker 3>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must be living under some kind of </v>

412
00:22:34.681 --> 00:22:35.514
<v Speaker 3>tyranny because everybody is different </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody deserves to be allowed to </v>

413
00:22:39.751 --> 00:22:40.584
<v Speaker 3>be different than to think different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and to behave in different ways </v>

414
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.390
<v Speaker 3>as long as they don't encroach upon the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights of other people.</v>

415
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.620
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

416
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.010
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vision that seems to ally underneath</v>

417
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:55.040
<v Speaker 3>these provisions is a very singular one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a vision that everybody will think and,</v>

418
00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.133
<v Speaker 3>and adopt progressive values that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>proper law firm consists of a group of </v>

419
00:23:02.401 --> 00:23:04.930
<v Speaker 3>progressively thinking lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

420
00:23:04.931 --> 00:23:06.360
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looked like a rainbow,</v>

421
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as opposed to.</v>

422
00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:09.140
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

423
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Speaker 4>there's an appalling proposition </v>
<v Speaker 4>underneath that tooth.</v>

424
00:23:11.771 --> 00:23:16.190
<v Speaker 4>It's actually factually incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the fundamental racist proposition is</v>

425
00:23:16.191 --> 00:23:17.024
<v Speaker 4>that racial groups differ sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 4>so that you can identify them as </v>

426
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.840
<v Speaker 4>separate entities and that they should </v>
<v Speaker 4>be treated in that manner,</v>

427
00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.320
<v Speaker 4>but the data suggests very strongly that</v>
<v Speaker 4>even in situations where men and women,</v>

428
00:23:29.661 --> 00:23:31.210
<v Speaker 4>different temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

429
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.113
<v Speaker 4>on average,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the overlap between men and women </v>

430
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:38.180
<v Speaker 4>is larger than the differences and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences within the groups.</v>

431
00:23:38.181 --> 00:23:42.320
<v Speaker 4>So the differences between women and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>differences between men within their own</v>

432
00:23:42.321 --> 00:23:45.620
<v Speaker 4>groups are larger than the differences </v>
<v Speaker 4>between and women.</v>

433
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:47.083
<v Speaker 4>So you don't get true diversity by </v>
<v Speaker 4>selecting across groups that isn't how </v>

434
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:51.440
<v Speaker 4>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

435
00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:56.441
<v Speaker 4>that's actually a fundamentally racist </v>
<v Speaker 4>or sexist claim right down to the core.</v>

436
00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:02.170
<v Speaker 4>And to predicate to assume that what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>get is diversity of opinion by selecting</v>

437
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:03.920
<v Speaker 4>for diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

438
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:04.820
<v Speaker 4>of race is.</v>

439
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all it's wrong.</v>

440
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.680
<v Speaker 4>It's just technically incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And second,</v>

441
00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:13.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't see how that's distinguishable </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the claims of the jim crow type.</v>

442
00:24:13.231 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 4>So the 19 fifties who said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

443
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:16.123
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black people and white people are so </v>

444
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:19.220
<v Speaker 4>different that they should remain </v>
<v Speaker 4>segregated.</v>

445
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:22.160
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're not that different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

446
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but within the groups,</v>

447
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:26.450
<v Speaker 4>they're very different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but between the groups,</v>

448
00:24:26.451 --> 00:24:28.850
<v Speaker 4>they're not that much different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The differences aren't,</v>

449
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:33.440
<v Speaker 4>aren't like the differences between men </v>
<v Speaker 4>and women aren't nonexistent,</v>

450
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.513
<v Speaker 4>but even then you wouldn't select on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>basis of those differences to produce </v>

451
00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:39.930
<v Speaker 4>diversity of opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

452
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the diversity of thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>model that,</v>

453
00:24:42.991 --> 00:24:47.600
<v Speaker 2>that organizations are including our own</v>
<v Speaker 2>governments are pursuing at this point,</v>

454
00:24:47.601 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 2>the philosophy side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not alone in that,</v>

455
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.480
<v Speaker 2>in assuming that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people who all think alike but that</v>

456
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:56.000
<v Speaker 2>have different racial or gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds,</v>

457
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in fact diversity.</v>

458
00:24:58.581 --> 00:24:59.414
<v Speaker 2>I mean the ontario securities commission</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been mandating that type of </v>

459
00:25:02.511 --> 00:25:03.344
<v Speaker 2>diversity on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on boards of directors for publicly </v>

460
00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:07.110
<v Speaker 2>traded companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

461
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

462
00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:08.464
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the federal government in its cabinet </v>

463
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.203
<v Speaker 2>appointments is pursuing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that type of diversity that really is </v>

464
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.970
<v Speaker 2>not a diversity of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak or opinion.</v>

465
00:25:16.971 --> 00:25:18.230
<v Speaker 2>But a diversity of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

466
00:25:18.231 --> 00:25:19.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well in,</v>

467
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.930
<v Speaker 2>in the federal government's case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gendered.</v>

468
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:22.121
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

469
00:25:22.121 --> 00:25:24.880
<v Speaker 4>the other thing that's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that if we,</v>

470
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.063
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who hold the political views </v>

471
00:25:28.451 --> 00:25:32.230
<v Speaker 4>that are pushing these ideas forward are</v>
<v Speaker 4>convinced beyond,</v>

472
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:33.463
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beyond argument that what they're going </v>

473
00:25:35.981 --> 00:25:36.814
<v Speaker 4>to do is to what the instantiation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these policies is going to result in is </v>

474
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:44.140
<v Speaker 4>increased racial harmony and let's say </v>
<v Speaker 4>harmony between the sexes,</v>

475
00:25:44.141 --> 00:25:48.280
<v Speaker 4>but I think you could make a very strong</v>
<v Speaker 4>case for exactly the opposite,</v>

476
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.370
<v Speaker 4>which is the more that we define people </v>
<v Speaker 4>by race and gender,</v>

477
00:25:51.371 --> 00:25:54.160
<v Speaker 4>the more that people are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>defined by race and gender.</v>

478
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.173
<v Speaker 4>And I don't see that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Really don't see that as a recipe for </v>

479
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.033
<v Speaker 4>social harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's worked in the United </v>

480
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.340
<v Speaker 4>States at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quite the contrary.</v>

481
00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:07.120
<v Speaker 4>And we actually have a pretty harmonious</v>
<v Speaker 4>society already by,</v>

482
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.660
<v Speaker 4>by any reasonable standard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any reasonable world standard.</v>

483
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:15.880
<v Speaker 4>And I think that this will inflame </v>
<v Speaker 4>tensions between groups unnecessarily.</v>

484
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually had a,</v>

485
00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:18.873
<v Speaker 2>a lawyer reach out to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a racialized licensee and say exactly </v>

486
00:26:22.091 --> 00:26:22.924
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that their main concern with what they </v>

487
00:26:24.221 --> 00:26:25.054
<v Speaker 2>were seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only in the compelled speech </v>

488
00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:27.484
<v Speaker 2>component on the statement of values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the underlying recommendations </v>

489
00:26:30.311 --> 00:26:31.144
<v Speaker 2>of the report is he thought that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to inflame tensions or </v>

490
00:26:34.721 --> 00:26:39.040
<v Speaker 2>animosity towards people in his group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

491
00:26:39.041 --> 00:26:40.750
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never thought of it that way,</v>

492
00:26:40.751 --> 00:26:43.660
<v Speaker 2>but he was quite concerned that this was</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually to,</v>

493
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:47.820
<v Speaker 2>to generate anamis against those that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually sought to protect.</v>

494
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.040
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one viewpoint that I hadn't,</v>

495
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.173
<v Speaker 2>hadn't expected.</v>

496
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:52.613
<v Speaker 3>So should we are discussed for a moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the emotion that is being brought to </v>

497
00:26:57.421 --> 00:26:58.254
<v Speaker 3>complication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A joe [inaudible] who is a lawyer in an </v>

498
00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.180
<v Speaker 3>adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

499
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:03.060
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

500
00:27:03.061 --> 00:27:03.894
<v Speaker 3>put together a motion to change the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature of the statement of values </v>

501
00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:08.784
<v Speaker 3>requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And perhaps I'll just read out the key </v>

502
00:27:10.231 --> 00:27:14.010
<v Speaker 3>provision of this motion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moved that convocation,</v>

503
00:27:14.011 --> 00:27:14.844
<v Speaker 3>approve that no licensee who has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientious objection to the adoption </v>

504
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:25.370
<v Speaker 3>of a statement of principles shall be </v>
<v Speaker 3>required to comply with recommendations.</v>

505
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Speaker 3>And they shall be exempted from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>requirements of recommendation three,</v>

506
00:27:30.061 --> 00:27:33.540
<v Speaker 3>one to adopt and abide by a statement of</v>
<v Speaker 3>principles.</v>

507
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm joe is a fellow that has my </v>
<v Speaker 3>utmost respect.</v>

508
00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

509
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

510
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.400
<v Speaker 3>he's done a great deal of good inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>complication,</v>

511
00:27:44.401 --> 00:27:46.020
<v Speaker 3>I think as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a venture.</v>

512
00:27:46.021 --> 00:27:51.000
<v Speaker 3>And I admire his willingness to put </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward this motion,</v>

513
00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:55.800
<v Speaker 3>which means he's sticking his head up </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a crowd that doesn't really want to</v>

514
00:27:55.801 --> 00:27:57.750
<v Speaker 3>stick their heads up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

515
00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.840
<v Speaker 3>But nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

516
00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.430
<v Speaker 3>There are some difficulties with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion.</v>

517
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Jared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to speak to that first?</v>

518
00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:05.931
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

519
00:28:05.931 --> 00:28:06.580
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

520
00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.413
<v Speaker 2>the motion itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody was talking to me about it and </v>

521
00:28:10.281 --> 00:28:11.990
<v Speaker 2>they said the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

522
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.373
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes it appear that if one elects </v>

523
00:28:15.711 --> 00:28:18.110
<v Speaker 2>not to file the statement of values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

524
00:28:18.111 --> 00:28:18.944
<v Speaker 2>if the motion is passed and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they then decide I'm not going to file </v>

525
00:28:21.321 --> 00:28:22.154
<v Speaker 2>the statement of values on that basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would be seen or it would be </v>

526
00:28:25.191 --> 00:28:26.024
<v Speaker 2>interpreted as you being a conscientious</v>
<v Speaker 2>objector to the values that the law </v>

527
00:28:29.661 --> 00:28:32.870
<v Speaker 2>society statement of values is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is asking us to affirm.</v>

528
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.093
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it rather than an objection to this </v>

529
00:28:36.651 --> 00:28:37.484
<v Speaker 2>idea of compelled speech or being forced</v>
<v Speaker 2>to disclose or divulge what may be in </v>

530
00:28:41.601 --> 00:28:43.760
<v Speaker 2>your head or what your thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions may be,</v>

531
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.320
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hadn't thought of it that way,</v>

532
00:28:45.321 --> 00:28:46.730
<v Speaker 2>but when you look at the motion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

533
00:28:46.731 --> 00:28:48.320
<v Speaker 2>it very much can be interpreted that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

534
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.520
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so in essence,</v>

535
00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.410
<v Speaker 3>it does not save you from having to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

536
00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:55.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

537
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:56.343
<v Speaker 3>to perform the forced speech obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just use you another thing to indicate </v>

538
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.253
<v Speaker 3>which essentially requires you to stick </v>
<v Speaker 3>your head up and be counted one way or </v>

539
00:29:05.561 --> 00:29:07.060
<v Speaker 3>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

540
00:29:07.061 --> 00:29:10.780
<v Speaker 3>the law society is still succeeding at </v>
<v Speaker 3>dividing people between those people who</v>

541
00:29:10.781 --> 00:29:14.560
<v Speaker 3>are willing to do the statement and </v>
<v Speaker 3>those people who refuse to do it,</v>

542
00:29:14.561 --> 00:29:16.090
<v Speaker 3>but have to say that they refused to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

543
00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:21.420
<v Speaker 3>So there is still forced speech in here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if the motion passes.</v>

544
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it gets us to where we </v>

545
00:29:28.261 --> 00:29:29.470
<v Speaker 2>need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

546
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as you said,</v>

547
00:29:30.631 --> 00:29:31.840
<v Speaker 2>I think joe's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

548
00:29:31.841 --> 00:29:34.770
<v Speaker 2>joe's a tremendous person deserves a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of respect.</v>

549
00:29:34.771 --> 00:29:37.280
<v Speaker 2>He's fighting his own free speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>battles before,</v>

550
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.660
<v Speaker 2>before the supreme court of Canada in </v>
<v Speaker 2>early november.</v>

551
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you may know,</v>

552
00:29:41.411 --> 00:29:42.131
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

553
00:29:42.131 --> 00:29:42.964
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accused of crossing some imaginary line </v>

554
00:29:45.161 --> 00:29:50.161
<v Speaker 2>about the conduct of his defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a of an individual before the courts</v>

555
00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:54.550
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is a very novel idea.</v>

556
00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

557
00:29:55.931 --> 00:29:56.764
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the industry is watching with some </v>

558
00:29:57.821 --> 00:29:58.654
<v Speaker 2>interest to see what the supreme court </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Canada says about whether or not </v>

559
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:03.940
<v Speaker 2>there is a line in the sand as to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>type of advocacy can pursue.</v>

560
00:30:03.941 --> 00:30:04.774
<v Speaker 2>So he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

561
00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.893
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe is somebody to watch and someone </v>

562
00:30:06.851 --> 00:30:07.684
<v Speaker 2>respected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think the emotion comes up </v>

563
00:30:08.741 --> 00:30:09.574
<v Speaker 2>slightly short of where it needs to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it gets us to the plAce </v>

564
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:15.130
<v Speaker 2>that I think we need to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that the law society should not</v>

565
00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:18.330
<v Speaker 2>be mad meddling or even asking what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

566
00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.090
<v Speaker 2>what the thoughts in and conscience is </v>
<v Speaker 2>of its members.</v>

567
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So As of right now,</v>

568
00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:28.721
<v Speaker 3>there is nothing on the table that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>far as we are,</v>

569
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.830
<v Speaker 3>we're concerned that vex offers the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of,</v>

570
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:34.803
<v Speaker 3>of eliminating the objectionable aspect </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this forced speech obligation on </v>

571
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.113
<v Speaker 3>flooding.</v>

572
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Know iT's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead Jordan.</v>

573
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.843
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

574
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.310
<v Speaker 1>we'd also talked a little bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that,</v>

575
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had concentrated specifically on the </v>

576
00:30:49.111 --> 00:30:49.944
<v Speaker 1>statement of principles as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>objectionable element of the </v>

577
00:30:52.761 --> 00:30:53.594
<v Speaker 1>recommendations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the recommendations as a package or </v>

578
00:30:56.031 --> 00:30:56.864
<v Speaker 1>also objectionable because they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>fed by the same underlying philosophy </v>

579
00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:04.070
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of well systemic racism,</v>

580
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:05.280
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

581
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.820
<v Speaker 1>and the promotion of equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>

582
00:31:07.821 --> 00:31:09.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and equality as the highest of,</v>

583
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:11.630
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of moral values.</v>

584
00:31:11.631 --> 00:31:15.590
<v Speaker 1>So do we want to talk a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the recommendation?</v>

585
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:17.050
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

586
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:17.441
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

587
00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:18.200
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

588
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:18.861
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

589
00:31:18.861 --> 00:31:22.280
<v Speaker 3>I'll read out the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps the first one,</v>

590
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.310
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gives a flavor for the whole,</v>

591
00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:27.500
<v Speaker 3>the whole host of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first one goes like this.</v>

592
00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.813
<v Speaker 3>The law society will review and amend </v>
<v Speaker 3>where appropriate the rules of </v>

593
00:31:32.181 --> 00:31:33.014
<v Speaker 3>professional conduct and the paralegal </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules of conduct and commentaries to </v>

594
00:31:37.071 --> 00:31:41.540
<v Speaker 3>reinforce the professional obligations </v>
<v Speaker 3>of all licensees to recognize,</v>

595
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:45.710
<v Speaker 3>acknowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and promote principles of equality,</v>

596
00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:46.573
<v Speaker 3>diversity and inclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent with the requirements under </v>

597
00:31:49.521 --> 00:31:53.690
<v Speaker 3>human rights legislation and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>special responsibilities of licensees in</v>

598
00:31:53.691 --> 00:31:56.480
<v Speaker 3>the legal imperiled legal profession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

599
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

600
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:58.880
<v Speaker 3>there are those words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

601
00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:01.300
<v Speaker 1>we talked on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also mean if you abide by that,</v>

602
00:32:01.301 --> 00:32:02.134
<v Speaker 1>that you have to accept the definition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of diversity as essentially predicated </v>

603
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:06.790
<v Speaker 1>both on race and sex.</v>

604
00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

605
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

606
00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:09.913
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course they haven't defined </v>

607
00:32:10.191 --> 00:32:11.024
<v Speaker 3>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but consistent with the rest of the </v>

608
00:32:12.381 --> 00:32:13.460
<v Speaker 3>regime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

609
00:32:13.461 --> 00:32:14.070
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

610
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.903
<v Speaker 3>that in the way that we have previously </v>
<v Speaker 3>described that that is the meaning of </v>

611
00:32:19.071 --> 00:32:19.904
<v Speaker 3>diversity that they're going for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also the meaning of equality as I </v>

612
00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.090
<v Speaker 3>suggested earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

613
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.760
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

614
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:28.223
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course there's their internal </v>

615
00:32:29.271 --> 00:32:30.104
<v Speaker 3>contradictions in the statement because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to amend the rules of </v>

616
00:32:33.111 --> 00:32:33.944
<v Speaker 3>professional conduct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as to reinforce obligations that </v>

617
00:32:37.761 --> 00:32:38.594
<v Speaker 3>don't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would they really mean to say is we're </v>

618
00:32:41.451 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 3>going to change them so as to create new</v>
<v Speaker 3>obligations.</v>

619
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.793
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

620
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:46.873
<v Speaker 3>requirements under human rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislation that this recommendation </v>

621
00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:50.414
<v Speaker 3>refers to act again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do not include the obligation to </v>

622
00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.200
<v Speaker 3>acknowledge and promote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>

623
00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.410
<v Speaker 3>they are conduct laws that everybody is </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject to,</v>

624
00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:02.480
<v Speaker 3>but they prohibit certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

625
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like the statement,</v>

626
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this first recommendation that gives the</v>

627
00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:09.430
<v Speaker 3>flavor of all the rest of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

628
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.340
<v Speaker 3>suggests that the law society is </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially moving into a new area,</v>

629
00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:18.550
<v Speaker 3>an area of regulating competence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if I can put it this way,</v>

630
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:23.600
<v Speaker 3>instead of being a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a neutral regulator of competence in the</v>

631
00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:24.990
<v Speaker 3>political sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

632
00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:30.260
<v Speaker 3>they have now more or less taken on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mandate of regulating competence in,</v>

633
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:32.750
<v Speaker 3>in the political sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the ideological sense.</v>

634
00:33:32.751 --> 00:33:33.584
<v Speaker 3>They are essentially saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here are some values that regulator is </v>

635
00:33:37.521 --> 00:33:41.090
<v Speaker 3>going to require you to comply with </v>
<v Speaker 3>these values.</v>

636
00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:41.983
<v Speaker 3>Essentially our progressive values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the digital or not a progressive </v>

637
00:33:44.991 --> 00:33:45.824
<v Speaker 3>lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do not think that you have the right </v>

638
00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:49.460
<v Speaker 3>to practice law in this province</v>

639
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:55.250
<v Speaker 2>and as the only values that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the subject of a statement of values.</v>

640
00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.860
<v Speaker 2>they are elevating those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

641
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.830
<v Speaker 2>to a position of prominence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

642
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 2>and I would suggest beyond all others,</v>

643
00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:04.630
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

644
00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.290
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

645
00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:08.110
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these values because of their,</v>

646
00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.153
<v Speaker 3>of their listed in a special way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemed to be put above other more </v>

647
00:34:14.931 --> 00:34:18.300
<v Speaker 3>fundamental values like the rule of law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like formal equality,</v>

648
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.560
<v Speaker 3>like competence or like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

649
00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:23.513
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>competence you would think would be the </v>

650
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:27.620
<v Speaker 3>core mandate of the law society itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my competence,</v>

651
00:34:27.621 --> 00:34:32.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean skills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge and compliance with ethics,</v>

652
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.760
<v Speaker 3>professionalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>professional.</v>

653
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:35.103
<v Speaker 3>This also seems to be to be reflective </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a constant push on the part of </v>

654
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.010
<v Speaker 3>political ideologues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the progressive type</v>

655
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:44.503
<v Speaker 4>to mandate that have all the rights that</v>
<v Speaker 4>canadians enjoy or perhaps the </v>

656
00:34:48.741 --> 00:34:49.574
<v Speaker 4>obligations they have to undertake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the rights of the rights that are </v>

657
00:34:55.761 --> 00:34:56.594
<v Speaker 4>associated with equality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>diversity and inclusivity are going to </v>

658
00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:02.150
<v Speaker 4>be made paramount in relationship to all</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the other rights.</v>

659
00:35:02.151 --> 00:35:04.850
<v Speaker 4>And that seems to me to be an utter </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe.</v>

660
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.190
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

661
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:07.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the proponents of the,</v>

662
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the statement of values,</v>

663
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:11.650
<v Speaker 2>the people that I've seen writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>commentary pieces,</v>

664
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:16.930
<v Speaker 2>none of them seem to disagree that there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a compelled speech component inherent</v>

665
00:35:16.931 --> 00:35:20.440
<v Speaker 2>in the statement of values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they do is they say,</v>

666
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but under section one of the charter and</v>

667
00:35:23.081 --> 00:35:27.610
<v Speaker 2>an oaks test analysis that infringement </v>
<v Speaker 2>on freedom of conscience,</v>

668
00:35:27.611 --> 00:35:28.444
<v Speaker 2>freedom of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of expression is reasonable to </v>

669
00:35:31.541 --> 00:35:32.374
<v Speaker 2>attain the objective of equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also a competing right under </v>

670
00:35:36.581 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 2>the charter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And inevitably,</v>

671
00:35:38.191 --> 00:35:40.050
<v Speaker 2>and I think they have a point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

672
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.093
<v Speaker 2>anytime the supreme court of Canada has </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged in a section one analysis on </v>

673
00:35:43.711 --> 00:35:45.660
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

674
00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.533
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that butts up against the competing </v>

675
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.140
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

676
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.003
<v Speaker 2>They tend to find that save and except </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most egregious infringements </v>

677
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.130
<v Speaker 2>that the equality rights shall prevail </v>
<v Speaker 2>or be the,</v>

678
00:35:57.131 --> 00:36:00.210
<v Speaker 2>the tipping factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like I said,</v>

679
00:36:00.211 --> 00:36:02.970
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting that the proponents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't disagree.</v>

680
00:36:02.971 --> 00:36:03.804
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're putting a compelled speech </v>

681
00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:07.610
<v Speaker 2>component on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a very effective.</v>

682
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Also note this though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the first part of section 15 it,</v>

683
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.920
<v Speaker 3>is it really a section about formal </v>
<v Speaker 3>equality vii,</v>

684
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.340
<v Speaker 3>the equal application of laws to </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

685
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:22.590
<v Speaker 3>What does not the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quality of their talking about.</v>

686
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.790
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>

687
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 3>they aren't shifting the ground on what </v>
<v Speaker 3>equality means and then staying and that</v>

688
00:36:28.471 --> 00:36:31.860
<v Speaker 3>content kind of equality justified the </v>
<v Speaker 3>infringement of these,</v>

689
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:34.540
<v Speaker 3>of these other rights under section one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say.</v>

690
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.050
<v Speaker 3>So do you want to continue bruce?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With.</v>

691
00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.190
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let me,</v>

692
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.850
<v Speaker 3>let me read</v>
<v Speaker 3>another one.</v>

693
00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just find it here.</v>

694
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.310
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to read the one.</v>

695
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is recommendation 10.</v>

696
00:36:49.171 --> 00:36:50.004
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to read this one because it just </v>

697
00:36:51.721 --> 00:36:55.800
<v Speaker 3>reinforces the proposition that we spoke</v>
<v Speaker 3>about which is at the law society is,</v>

698
00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.053
<v Speaker 3>is changing the nature of competence to </v>
<v Speaker 3>encompass a certain set of political </v>

699
00:37:01.411 --> 00:37:03.450
<v Speaker 3>values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're doing this explicitly.</v>

700
00:37:03.451 --> 00:37:04.284
<v Speaker 3>Recommendation 10 says as follows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law society will include the topics </v>

701
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:09.503
<v Speaker 3>of cultural competency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>equality and inclusion in the </v>

702
00:37:13.501 --> 00:37:17.100
<v Speaker 3>professions as competencies to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>acquired in the license,</v>

703
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.860
<v Speaker 3>the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you are along a young lawyer,</v>

704
00:37:19.861 --> 00:37:22.440
<v Speaker 3>a young law school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>graduate,</v>

705
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.130
<v Speaker 3>and you were applying to be licensed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the law society,</v>

706
00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.780
<v Speaker 3>these are among the things that you must</v>
<v Speaker 3>show to them that you are competent in,</v>

707
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:31.600
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

708
00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.400
<v Speaker 3>you believe and agree and follow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These particular values,</v>

709
00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:37.430
<v Speaker 2>it'll be on the bar exam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

710
00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shelly,</v>

711
00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.200
<v Speaker 3>continue on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the uh,</v>

712
00:37:45.201 --> 00:37:47.000
<v Speaker 3>there's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

713
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I believe I read out already is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>requirement for the continuing education</v>

714
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.670
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let,</v>

715
00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:00.140
<v Speaker 3>let's move to one of the recommendations</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are being put in place this year.</v>

716
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:01.303
<v Speaker 3>The statement of values is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is one on the and the other one that is </v>

717
00:38:03.471 --> 00:38:08.471
<v Speaker 3>mandatory for work legal workplaces have</v>
<v Speaker 3>over a 10 lawyers goes like this.</v>

718
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:10.543
<v Speaker 3>The law society will require a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a licensee representative of each legal </v>

719
00:38:14.961 --> 00:38:19.730
<v Speaker 3>workplace of at least 10 licensees in </v>
<v Speaker 3>ontario to develop,</v>

720
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:21.103
<v Speaker 3>implement and maintain a human rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity policy or their legal </v>

721
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:30.590
<v Speaker 3>workforce addressing at the very least </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair recruitment,</v>

722
00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:31.453
<v Speaker 3>retention and advancement which will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>available to members of the profession </v>

723
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.880
<v Speaker 3>and the public upon request.</v>

724
00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.830
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there,</v>

725
00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.930
<v Speaker 4>there's a measurement issue because </v>
<v Speaker 4>measurement,</v>

726
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.130
<v Speaker 4>an enforcement issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the measurement issue is well what is</v>

727
00:38:45.131 --> 00:38:50.131
<v Speaker 4>fair and how is it defined?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So is it defined by the racial makeup of</v>

728
00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:51.184
<v Speaker 4>the firm over the next 10 years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if it doesn't shift in the required </v>

729
00:38:54.161 --> 00:38:55.060
<v Speaker 4>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

730
00:38:55.061 --> 00:38:55.894
<v Speaker 4>or the gender makeup of the firm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't shift in the required </v>

731
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean you're out of compliance,</v>

732
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.413
<v Speaker 4>like the details in this sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>measurement details and this sort of </v>

733
00:39:03.971 --> 00:39:04.804
<v Speaker 4>thing really matter who defines fair and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then what's enforced and who's going to </v>

734
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:12.430
<v Speaker 4>like it are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are the firm's going to be subject to an</v>

735
00:39:12.431 --> 00:39:13.264
<v Speaker 4>external analysis that examines their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their diversity makeup over some period </v>

736
00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:19.690
<v Speaker 4>of time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is there,</v>

737
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.990
<v Speaker 4>is there going to be provisions about </v>
<v Speaker 4>how rapidly the,</v>

738
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.003
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

739
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.810
<v Speaker 4>the ethnic and sex makeup of the firm </v>
<v Speaker 4>has to transform across time?</v>

740
00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:31.480
<v Speaker 4>Like the devil's in the details in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of thing.</v>

741
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:36.070
<v Speaker 2>They're proposing actually that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a member of the workplace conduct,</v>

742
00:39:36.071 --> 00:39:38.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an inclusion self-assessment every,</v>

743
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:42.580
<v Speaker 2>every two years to get at the measuring </v>
<v Speaker 2>component.</v>

744
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.860
<v Speaker 4>And so what's an inclusion </v>
<v Speaker 4>self-assessment mean?</v>

745
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.940
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think that means?</v>

746
00:39:48.941 --> 00:39:49.774
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you lift list your race mean or do </v>

747
00:39:53.801 --> 00:39:54.634
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you,</v>

748
00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:58.690
<v Speaker 4>do you examine your soul to determine </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you're,</v>

749
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:00.003
<v Speaker 4>you're oriented in the proper inclusive </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this direction in relationship to </v>

750
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:07.050
<v Speaker 4>race and gender?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't understand.</v>

751
00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't because I'm a measurement guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fundamentally,</v>

752
00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:10.893
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand how these things are </v>

753
00:40:12.011 --> 00:40:14.800
<v Speaker 4>going to be assessed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are not easy to assess.</v>

754
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.600
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the enforcement </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

755
00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:18.773
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't know what the word </v>

756
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:21.874
<v Speaker 3>inclusion means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have ideas about what a quality can </v>

757
00:40:24.731 --> 00:40:25.564
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have ideas about what diversity can </v>

758
00:40:27.221 --> 00:40:29.260
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what inclusion means.</v>

759
00:40:29.261 --> 00:40:31.720
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really just don't understand the word.</v>

760
00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you mean by that.</v>

761
00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.510
<v Speaker 2>The law society has been collecting data</v>
<v Speaker 2>for four years.</v>

762
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.433
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on these types of demographics on </v>

763
00:40:42.141 --> 00:40:45.620
<v Speaker 2>the basis of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a voluntary survey basis.</v>

764
00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what they've,</v>

765
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.043
<v Speaker 2>they're actually proposing to go further</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that within these legal workplaces </v>

766
00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.710
<v Speaker 2>that these workplaces conduct inclusion </v>
<v Speaker 2>surveys now,</v>

767
00:40:54.711 --> 00:40:55.544
<v Speaker 2>there was a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation at the convocation meeting </v>

768
00:40:58.491 --> 00:40:59.324
<v Speaker 2>that adopted these recommendations about</v>
<v Speaker 2>compelling people to self identify </v>

769
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:07.520
<v Speaker 2>within some sort of demographic group or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other and that there would be some,</v>

770
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.620
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be some risk resistance,</v>

771
00:41:09.621 --> 00:41:13.790
<v Speaker 2>particularly among racialized licensees </v>
<v Speaker 2>of doing so,</v>

772
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:14.773
<v Speaker 2>so they're going to make it voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that then goes to the issue of </v>

773
00:41:18.921 --> 00:41:20.720
<v Speaker 2>what's the quality of the data that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting,</v>

774
00:41:20.721 --> 00:41:21.554
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a voluntary self reporting </v>

775
00:41:24.621 --> 00:41:28.820
<v Speaker 2>exercise and not everybody's reporting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as they said at convocation,</v>

776
00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.970
<v Speaker 2>some groups may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

777
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:31.873
<v Speaker 2>disinclined or fearful of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of identifying themselves for whatever </v>

778
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:35.924
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the quality of the data they're </v>

779
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:37.994
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then how are they going to act on </v>

780
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:39.524
<v Speaker 2>that data?</v>

781
00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:40.403
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe even unwilling to identify </v>

782
00:41:41.791 --> 00:41:42.660
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

783
00:41:42.661 --> 00:41:44.140
<v Speaker 4>that's what I told you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see why,</v>

784
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.233
<v Speaker 4>why it's free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should be required of me that I </v>

785
00:41:46.921 --> 00:41:48.990
<v Speaker 4>reveal my what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

786
00:41:48.991 --> 00:41:52.110
<v Speaker 4>which aspects of my identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I going to reveal?</v>

787
00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.280
<v Speaker 4>So I mean obviously I'm white,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the hell that means,</v>

788
00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.473
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's all sorts of other aspects </v>

789
00:41:59.281 --> 00:42:01.200
<v Speaker 4>of my identity that for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

790
00:42:01.201 --> 00:42:02.490
<v Speaker 4>I might want to keep private</v>

791
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.860
<v Speaker 2>even the existing data on which they </v>
<v Speaker 2>founded a,</v>

792
00:42:05.861 --> 00:42:06.694
<v Speaker 2>the finding of systemic discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The empirical data was based on </v>

793
00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.433
<v Speaker 2>voluntary survey data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're not even certain that we're </v>

794
00:42:14.201 --> 00:42:15.034
<v Speaker 2>getting what I would say is his </v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence send census type quality </v>

795
00:42:18.431 --> 00:42:19.264
<v Speaker 2>data.</v>

796
00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:23.020
<v Speaker 3>So I read you another one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>recommendations,</v>

797
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:24.570
<v Speaker 3>a recommendation 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

798
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:25.893
<v Speaker 3>it says that the law society will revise</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rules of professional conduct and </v>

799
00:42:30.161 --> 00:42:30.994
<v Speaker 3>the paralegal rules of conduct where </v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate so that the discrimination </v>

800
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:41.430
<v Speaker 3>is clearly identified as a breach of </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional conduct requirements.</v>

801
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.600
<v Speaker 4>So say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say that again.</v>

802
00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

803
00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:50.850
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The law society will revise the rules of</v>

804
00:42:50.851 --> 00:42:51.684
<v Speaker 3>professional conduct where appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that systemic discrimination is </v>

805
00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:01.830
<v Speaker 3>clearly identified as a breach of </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional conduct requirements.</v>

806
00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:02.903
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that means that at some point in the </v>

807
00:43:04.171 --> 00:43:09.171
<v Speaker 4>future could be assessed for its </v>
<v Speaker 4>compliance with equality.</v>

808
00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:10.163
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's defined perhaps as equality of </v>

809
00:43:11.941 --> 00:43:13.740
<v Speaker 4>outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't know.</v>

810
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.353
<v Speaker 4>Or with regards to rate of </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformation of demographic </v>

811
00:43:18.391 --> 00:43:19.224
<v Speaker 4>membership,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you're found not to be in </v>

812
00:43:20.911 --> 00:43:22.890
<v Speaker 4>compliance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever that means,</v>

813
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:23.963
<v Speaker 4>then that means that you've.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've engaged in proFessional </v>

814
00:43:26.731 --> 00:43:27.564
<v Speaker 4>misconduct.</v>

815
00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.133
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's interesting that they used the </v>

816
00:43:30.221 --> 00:43:34.270
<v Speaker 3>word systemic discrimination because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that meant we're talking,</v>

817
00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.433
<v Speaker 3>we've used that term in the past to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the profession and that's the way </v>

818
00:43:38.441 --> 00:43:42.370
<v Speaker 3>they use that term in the report that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the profession has a problem of systemic</v>

819
00:43:42.371 --> 00:43:43.204
<v Speaker 3>discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm just puzzling over the use of </v>

820
00:43:47.621 --> 00:43:48.454
<v Speaker 3>that term in this particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>recommendation because it suggests that </v>

821
00:43:50.831 --> 00:43:55.831
<v Speaker 3>if you are or your firm is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is guilty of systemic discrimination,</v>

822
00:43:55.941 --> 00:43:58.690
<v Speaker 3>then that is a matter of reaching your </v>
<v Speaker 3>conduct obligation.</v>

823
00:43:59.000 --> 00:43:59.833
<v Speaker 4>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that mean that every single lawyer </v>

824
00:44:01.591 --> 00:44:06.150
<v Speaker 4>in the firm is guilty of that because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what systemic would imply.</v>

825
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.133
<v Speaker 4>It also begs the question of how many </v>
<v Speaker 4>people you need to be systemically </v>

826
00:44:11.311 --> 00:44:13.740
<v Speaker 4>racist before you actually have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>system?</v>

827
00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be doing a benchmarking</v>

828
00:44:15.641 --> 00:44:16.391
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

829
00:44:16.391 --> 00:44:17.224
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it is that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have to submit these inclusion </v>

830
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:23.320
<v Speaker 2>assessments to the law society and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually going to review that as</v>

831
00:44:23.321 --> 00:44:24.910
<v Speaker 2>against the industry as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

832
00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:28.960
<v Speaker 2>in terms of finding out where you're at </v>
<v Speaker 2>on your inclusivity.</v>

833
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.063
<v Speaker 2>And so my concern would that they find </v>
<v Speaker 2>systemic discrimination within an </v>

834
00:44:33.481 --> 00:44:34.314
<v Speaker 2>organization because it falls short of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what the industry writes wide </v>

835
00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:40.980
<v Speaker 2>standard is in terms of it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

836
00:44:40.981 --> 00:44:43.080
<v Speaker 2>it's diversity a layup</v>

837
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:45.020
<v Speaker 4>date.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

838
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:46.950
<v Speaker 4>And so what that'll mean fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

839
00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:50.760
<v Speaker 4>let's say that you have a firm that has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's a small firm,</v>

840
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:55.710
<v Speaker 4>say 10 people and all of the people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>it happened to be caucasian just for the</v>

841
00:44:55.711 --> 00:44:56.544
<v Speaker 4>sake of argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that mean that you'll be mandated to </v>

842
00:44:58.531 --> 00:45:00.480
<v Speaker 4>hire by race for the next while.</v>

843
00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:01.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your systemics,</v>

844
00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:02.663
<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're systemically discriminatory </v>

845
00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.550
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

846
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.320
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you mandated to do that?</v>

847
00:45:09.321 --> 00:45:10.154
<v Speaker 4>How is that legal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is that possibly illegal to be </v>

848
00:45:12.231 --> 00:45:14.480
<v Speaker 4>mandated to hire by race</v>

849
00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:16.573
<v Speaker 3>only by virtue of the mandate that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>law society has from the government to </v>

850
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:22.240
<v Speaker 3>regulate the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the legal professional.</v>

851
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:22.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

852
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.780
<v Speaker 3>that what it has to rest on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

853
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:29.810
<v Speaker 3>if you read the statutory mandate of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>law society,</v>

854
00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:31.633
<v Speaker 3>it would seem to fall outside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>marching orders and the law society has </v>

855
00:45:34.821 --> 00:45:38.270
<v Speaker 3>at least as it is simply worded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The prompts I can read you that this is,</v>

856
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.690
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a section 41 of the law society act.</v>

857
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

858
00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Let me read first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>section four,</v>

859
00:45:45.621 --> 00:45:46.454
<v Speaker 3>point one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the function of the law society </v>

860
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:49.963
<v Speaker 3>is to ensure that all persons who </v>
<v Speaker 3>practiced law in ontario or provide </v>

861
00:45:53.931 --> 00:45:54.764
<v Speaker 3>legal services in ontario meet standards</v>
<v Speaker 3>of learning professional competence and </v>

862
00:45:59.301 --> 00:46:00.134
<v Speaker 3>professional conduct that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate for the legal services they </v>

863
00:46:03.021 --> 00:46:03.854
<v Speaker 3>provide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So unless you can fit this into the </v>

864
00:46:05.931 --> 00:46:06.764
<v Speaker 3>phrase professional conduct then then </v>
<v Speaker 3>under this section there is no mandate </v>

865
00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:12.980
<v Speaker 3>to do these kinds of things.</v>

866
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.513
<v Speaker 3>I was going to read section 41 which </v>
<v Speaker 3>lists a the standards of professional </v>

867
00:46:18.591 --> 00:46:20.960
<v Speaker 3>competence that the law society supposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to ensure.</v>

868
00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.393
<v Speaker 3>And section 41 says a licensee fails to </v>
<v Speaker 3>meet standards of professional </v>

869
00:46:26.901 --> 00:46:30.140
<v Speaker 3>competence for the purpose of this act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

870
00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.453
<v Speaker 3>and there are a number of things listed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ones that are relevant here are </v>

871
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:34.993
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there are deficiencies in the </v>

872
00:46:36.531 --> 00:46:37.364
<v Speaker 3>licensees knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>skill or judgment or the licensees </v>

873
00:46:42.681 --> 00:46:43.514
<v Speaker 3>attention to the interests of clients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those are the only two bits of that </v>

874
00:46:47.061 --> 00:46:49.790
<v Speaker 3>section that applied to this question </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they don't apply.</v>

875
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:51.103
<v Speaker 3>They don't destroy drive the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these obligations that are being </v>

876
00:46:54.321 --> 00:46:55.154
<v Speaker 3>contemplated.</v>

877
00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:56.423
<v Speaker 4>Can you zoom?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I was applying for a job at a law </v>

878
00:46:58.591 --> 00:47:03.030
<v Speaker 4>firm that was a compelled by this </v>
<v Speaker 4>mandate to diverse itself,</v>

879
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.013
<v Speaker 4>diversify itself racially and I was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>qualified candidate and I got wind of </v>

880
00:47:08.401 --> 00:47:10.890
<v Speaker 4>the fact that that requirement had been </v>
<v Speaker 4>put in place,</v>

881
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:15.410
<v Speaker 4>couldn't I go after the firm for </v>
<v Speaker 4>discrimination because they made race a,</v>

882
00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:16.403
<v Speaker 4>one of the basis of hiring that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were compelled to make race one of the </v>

883
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:19.650
<v Speaker 4>basis of hiring</v>

884
00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:20.451
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

885
00:47:20.451 --> 00:47:21.284
<v Speaker 2>the human rights code and the charter of</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights and freedoms allow for certain </v>

886
00:47:23.751 --> 00:47:25.960
<v Speaker 2>forms of discrimination when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

887
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:30.800
<v Speaker 2>when it's for the purposes of an amelia </v>
<v Speaker 2>amelia exercise.</v>

888
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

889
00:47:32.441 --> 00:47:35.020
<v Speaker 2>if there is systemic discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 2>identified,</v>

890
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:36.123
<v Speaker 2>the charter will permit discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 2>against a group in order to remedy what </v>

891
00:47:40.311 --> 00:47:43.540
<v Speaker 2>it may be perceived as a systemic </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination issue.</v>

892
00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:44.374
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean specifically addresses and </v>

893
00:47:46.221 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 2>exempts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

894
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:48.154
<v Speaker 2>affirmative action type programs as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as being found to be discriminatory and </v>

895
00:47:50.891 --> 00:47:52.180
<v Speaker 2>allows them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it permits them.</v>

896
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:54.700
<v Speaker 2>So the answer would be yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could raise that,</v>

897
00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:55.883
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the but the law firm and the law </v>

898
00:47:58.391 --> 00:48:01.000
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they would have to then bring forward</v>

899
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.180
<v Speaker 2>evidence that this is part of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

900
00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:04.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an affirmative action type program that </v>

901
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:06.364
<v Speaker 2>is exempted and I'll let you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to discriminate on that </v>

902
00:48:08.861 --> 00:48:09.694
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>

903
00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:11.923
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a moment just turned to one of the </v>

904
00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:19.830
<v Speaker 3>justifications that have been given for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole slate of recommendations.</v>

905
00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:20.903
<v Speaker 3>This whole program which is that your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your membership in the law society is a </v>

906
00:48:27.631 --> 00:48:28.464
<v Speaker 3>voluntary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to belong to the law </v>

907
00:48:30.721 --> 00:48:31.554
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not the state coming down and </v>

908
00:48:32.731 --> 00:48:34.860
<v Speaker 3>requiring all its citizens to do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain thing.</v>

909
00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:36.083
<v Speaker 3>You have chosen to be a member of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>law society and therefore you must take </v>

910
00:48:39.631 --> 00:48:44.631
<v Speaker 3>these obligations on voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which of course is a ridiculous thing to</v>

911
00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:49.560
<v Speaker 3>say because the law society takes its </v>
<v Speaker 3>mandate from the government.</v>

912
00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.500
<v Speaker 3>The government has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has given the law society of the job,</v>

913
00:48:52.501 --> 00:48:54.720
<v Speaker 3>of being the gatekeeper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

914
00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:55.950
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

915
00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:56.903
<v Speaker 3>of the rights to practice law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you are to practice law in this </v>

916
00:48:59.401 --> 00:49:00.470
<v Speaker 3>province,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

917
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:04.950
<v Speaker 3>you must be a member and you must adhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the rules of conduct that they,</v>

918
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000
<v Speaker 3>that they require you to suggest that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your at your,</v>

919
00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:12.773
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your engagement with the law society is </v>

920
00:49:14.821 --> 00:49:19.230
<v Speaker 3>something that you do a voluntarily just</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you wish to do so.</v>

921
00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:21.360
<v Speaker 3>And that makeS it a voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization.</v>

922
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:23.520
<v Speaker 3>It is in a.</v>

923
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:24.783
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the voluntary aspect is that you can </v>

924
00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:31.381
<v Speaker 4>give up your heart one livelihood if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to be subject to these rules.</v>

925
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:32.793
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I suppose you could make a case that </v>

926
00:49:33.941 --> 00:49:34.774
<v Speaker 4>that's voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean it's certainly the case that </v>

927
00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:42.460
<v Speaker 4>it stretches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It certainly stretches the definition of</v>

928
00:49:42.461 --> 00:49:45.040
<v Speaker 4>what normal people would consider </v>
<v Speaker 4>volunteering.</v>

929
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:45.571
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

930
00:49:45.571 --> 00:49:45.931
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

931
00:49:45.931 --> 00:49:50.931
<v Speaker 3>it turns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns the idea that you would have a,</v>

932
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:52.363
<v Speaker 3>you would have a right to practice in </v>
<v Speaker 3>any profession if you have the proper </v>

933
00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.960
<v Speaker 3>skill and training and competence to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

934
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:02.903
<v Speaker 3>That question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is up for grabs now because they're </v>

935
00:50:06.271 --> 00:50:07.104
<v Speaker 3>essentially saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually what you also have to do </v>

936
00:50:09.811 --> 00:50:10.644
<v Speaker 3>is go along with our vision the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>things are supposed to be and the way </v>

937
00:50:14.071 --> 00:50:17.070
<v Speaker 3>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't choose to go along with</v>

938
00:50:17.071 --> 00:50:17.904
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then you're free to go off and do </v>

939
00:50:18.931 --> 00:50:19.660
<v Speaker 3>something else</v>

940
00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:21.820
<v Speaker 2>and what other people's values migrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>over time.</v>

941
00:50:21.821 --> 00:50:23.480
<v Speaker 2>So it is right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

942
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.333
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these values that we're looking at in </v>

943
00:50:25.271 --> 00:50:28.640
<v Speaker 2>the statement of principles here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what if they migrate over time,</v>

944
00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:30.020
<v Speaker 2>what could they become?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

945
00:50:30.021 --> 00:50:33.890
<v Speaker 2>and I think it sets a precedent that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we might want to push back against</v>

946
00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:34.803
<v Speaker 4>swelled it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's worrisome because the values are </v>

947
00:50:38.771 --> 00:50:39.604
<v Speaker 4>very ill defined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so an ill dEfined like a box that </v>

948
00:50:43.481 --> 00:50:44.314
<v Speaker 4>could contain anything ends up </v>
<v Speaker 4>containing a very strange number of </v>

949
00:50:46.721 --> 00:50:47.960
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

950
00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:48.813
<v Speaker 4>bruce pointed that out very clearly when</v>
<v Speaker 4>he talked about his inability to </v>

951
00:50:51.941 --> 00:50:55.090
<v Speaker 4>understand what constitutes inclusivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

952
00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:57.220
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's say that we could,</v>

953
00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.113
<v Speaker 4>we could define equality and diversity </v>
<v Speaker 4>if we were willing to even using racial </v>

954
00:51:02.441 --> 00:51:03.274
<v Speaker 4>and gender categories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a unbelievably </v>

955
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:08.650
<v Speaker 4>catastrophic error.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But okay.</v>

956
00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:13.210
<v Speaker 4>Inclusivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well if that's definition list,</v>

957
00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:17.410
<v Speaker 4>then it's a place to put any other </v>
<v Speaker 4>requirements that might come along.</v>

958
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really can't say what it.</v>

959
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:23.140
<v Speaker 4>What does inclusivity mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that more like the nonverbal behavior</v>

960
00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:25.000
<v Speaker 4>that you might manifest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

961
00:51:25.001 --> 00:51:26.030
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

962
00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:26.883
<v Speaker 4>or is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it refer to more subtle </v>

963
00:51:28.091 --> 00:51:31.420
<v Speaker 4>interactions within the firm?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's kinda what it sounds like.</v>

964
00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.333
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at least it might be worthwhile </v>

965
00:51:37.571 --> 00:51:40.150
<v Speaker 4>trying to find out what they mean by </v>
<v Speaker 4>inclusivity.</v>

966
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:41.860
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they really want to be inclusive,</v>

967
00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:45.040
<v Speaker 2>they would get rid of the bar admission </v>
<v Speaker 2>exams.</v>

968
00:51:45.041 --> 00:51:48.790
<v Speaker 2>They would get rid of the loss of law </v>
<v Speaker 2>school record underlying requirements.</v>

969
00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's essentially makes your </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization inclusive,</v>

970
00:51:52.181 --> 00:51:53.014
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get rid of the barriers to </v>

971
00:51:54.171 --> 00:51:54.500
<v Speaker 2>entry</v>

972
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:57.530
<v Speaker 4>fish and too is that if you went and </v>
<v Speaker 4>analyzed the uh,</v>

973
00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.310
<v Speaker 4>the success rate at with regards to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bar exam,</v>

974
00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:02.413
<v Speaker 4>that you'd find that it produced </v>
<v Speaker 4>systemic discrimination as well because </v>

975
00:52:06.171 --> 00:52:07.004
<v Speaker 4>the probability that that an objective </v>
<v Speaker 4>test produces exactly the same results </v>

976
00:52:12.171 --> 00:52:16.310
<v Speaker 4>across all conceivable groups is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

977
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.233
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see this sort of thing happening in </v>

978
00:52:18.321 --> 00:52:19.154
<v Speaker 4>the United States already where </v>
<v Speaker 4>competency requirements produce group </v>

979
00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:23.354
<v Speaker 4>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you analyze enough group </v>

980
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:26.174
<v Speaker 4>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so what happens then is the </v>

981
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:28.364
<v Speaker 4>competency requirements are </v>
<v Speaker 4>gerrymandered to eliminate the group </v>

982
00:52:30.651 --> 00:52:32.600
<v Speaker 4>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

983
00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.673
<v Speaker 4>and that's all part of an assault,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say on the idea of objective </v>

984
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:38.570
<v Speaker 4>competence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

985
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:42.760
<v Speaker 4>book are there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are there more,</v>

986
00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:46.090
<v Speaker 4>are there more statements that are worth</v>
<v Speaker 4>analyzing?</v>

987
00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:47.180
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just have a look here.</v>

988
00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:51.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a whole a whole roster of them,</v>

989
00:52:51.101 --> 00:52:54.880
<v Speaker 5>but I think those are the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>most pressing.</v>

990
00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:55.760
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

991
00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.380
<v Speaker 5>well I thought there was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was</v>

992
00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.520
<v Speaker 2>an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

993
00:52:57.521 --> 00:53:02.440
<v Speaker 2>it was recommendation 12 sub for they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

994
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:03.333
<v Speaker 2>they want to create a specialized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trained team to address complaints of </v>

995
00:53:05.921 --> 00:53:07.240
<v Speaker 2>discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

996
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:09.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't argue that,</v>

997
00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:10.313
<v Speaker 2>I mean discrimination in any act of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination that is a contravention </v>

998
00:53:14.561 --> 00:53:15.394
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of human rights legislation should be </v>

999
00:53:16.271 --> 00:53:17.320
<v Speaker 2>stamped out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be,</v>

1000
00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.513
<v Speaker 2>it should be identified and dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my understanding is that we've got </v>

1001
00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:26.840
<v Speaker 2>the bodies that are responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>already not only the spirit court,</v>

1002
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:27.990
<v Speaker 2>but also the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1003
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.420
<v Speaker 2>the human rights tribunals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1004
00:53:30.421 --> 00:53:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I read that and I say that that's</v>

1005
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:34.524
<v Speaker 2>a swat team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a swat team that's going to </v>

1006
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:36.474
<v Speaker 2>swoop in on the noncompliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>systemically discriminatory </v>

1007
00:53:39.451 --> 00:53:43.620
<v Speaker 2>organizations and sort them out that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that concerns me to some extent,</v>

1008
00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:44.730
<v Speaker 2>particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1009
00:53:44.731 --> 00:53:45.564
<v Speaker 2>because we have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have these bodies already in place </v>

1010
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:49.410
<v Speaker 2>that are supposed to deal with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>types of things.</v>

1011
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:50.120
<v Speaker 2>They're doing</v>

1012
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:50.953
<v Speaker 4>get bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have the classic court system </v>

1013
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:57.450
<v Speaker 4>plus the ontario human rights tribunals </v>
<v Speaker 4>which already have their own problems.</v>

1014
00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:58.723
<v Speaker 3>So the word in that recommendation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that consciously real concern is the </v>

1015
00:54:01.791 --> 00:54:03.560
<v Speaker 3>word address.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

1016
00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.280
<v Speaker 3>this team will address complaints of </v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination.</v>

1017
00:54:07.281 --> 00:54:11.600
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't say whether or not they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the investigator or whether they are</v>

1018
00:54:11.601 --> 00:54:15.290
<v Speaker 3>the adjudicator or whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're a combination of the two,</v>

1019
00:54:15.291 --> 00:54:16.124
<v Speaker 3>whether or not they are judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jury and executioner all rolled into </v>

1020
00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.870
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be much more comfortable if they</v>

1021
00:54:20.871 --> 00:54:25.430
<v Speaker 3>were procedurally precise to say exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the function of this so called team</v>

1022
00:54:25.431 --> 00:54:26.264
<v Speaker 3>was supposed to be.</v>

1023
00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.221
<v Speaker 2>But what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1024
00:54:27.221 --> 00:54:29.260
<v Speaker 2>what's it for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got a human rights commission that</v>

1025
00:54:29.261 --> 00:54:33.130
<v Speaker 2>can come into any organization and </v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace in ontario without a warrant,</v>

1026
00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:34.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do this,</v>

1027
00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:36.200
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1028
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:37.700
<v Speaker 2>this group wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1029
00:54:37.701 --> 00:54:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I questioned creating another layer of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracy.</v>

1030
00:54:39.941 --> 00:54:40.590
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

1031
00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:41.161
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree,</v>

1032
00:54:41.161 --> 00:54:42.660
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I mean,</v>

1033
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.553
<v Speaker 3>one of the needs for this might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the point that we made </v>

1034
00:54:46.831 --> 00:54:47.664
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that the requirements of the </v>

1035
00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:49.944
<v Speaker 3>law society is now creating our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not the same as they are under the </v>

1036
00:54:54.181 --> 00:54:55.620
<v Speaker 3>human rights code.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1037
00:54:55.621 --> 00:54:56.454
<v Speaker 3>So the human rights commission and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribunal might not have jurisdiction </v>

1038
00:55:00.511 --> 00:55:03.010
<v Speaker 3>because that's not what the access.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>

1039
00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:03.873
<v Speaker 3>if these do we create extra and </v>
<v Speaker 3>additional requirements that are not </v>

1040
00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:08.500
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1041
00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:12.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doe now apply to lawyers,</v>

1042
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.900
<v Speaker 3>then you do need an extra bureaucracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1043
00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.880
<v Speaker 3>to enforce them because nobody else has </v>
<v Speaker 3>the jurisdiction to do so.</v>

1044
00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:20.090
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you can pursue,</v>

1045
00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:21.163
<v Speaker 4>I think without any fearing error that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who would constitute such a </v>

1046
00:55:26.181 --> 00:55:27.014
<v Speaker 4>team would be the ones who would be most</v>
<v Speaker 4>zealously in favor of precisely this </v>

1047
00:55:30.801 --> 00:55:33.350
<v Speaker 4>kind of progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's call it.</v>

1048
00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:35.210
<v Speaker 4>You would expect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes,</v>

1049
00:55:35.211 --> 00:55:36.220
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

1050
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:37.250
<v Speaker 4>that's how it works.</v>

1051
00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:39.483
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're in favor of compelled speech </v>

1052
00:55:40.631 --> 00:55:41.464
<v Speaker 2>and think that that's justified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I would question what other </v>

1053
00:55:43.691 --> 00:55:48.640
<v Speaker 2>fundamental rights and freedoms they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might a dean to stamp stamp upon.</v>

1054
00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:52.570
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe we should move from dance.</v>

1055
00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:53.443
<v Speaker 4>one of the things we discussed was </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps asking for more public </v>

1056
00:55:56.691 --> 00:55:59.240
<v Speaker 4>involvement in our campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

1057
00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:00.783
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I believe that we're going to </v>

1058
00:56:02.871 --> 00:56:05.750
<v Speaker 4>provide contact information for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>benchers,</v>

1059
00:56:05.751 --> 00:56:06.584
<v Speaker 4>is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And asked members of the public to </v>

1060
00:56:09.681 --> 00:56:10.514
<v Speaker 4>listen very carefully to the discussions</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we've had and to indicate to the </v>

1061
00:56:14.271 --> 00:56:19.271
<v Speaker 4>benchers their concern about this in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of its relationship to the broader</v>

1062
00:56:20.271 --> 00:56:23.650
<v Speaker 4>public potential relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>broader public sat,</v>

1063
00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.540
<v Speaker 2>the law society is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is his mandate is to,</v>

1064
00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.510
<v Speaker 2>is to govern the profession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but within the,</v>

1065
00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:32.210
<v Speaker 2>I guess the best interest of the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect the public.</v>

1066
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.393
<v Speaker 2>And so the public very much as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stakeholder in what's happening right </v>

1067
00:56:35.751 --> 00:56:38.270
<v Speaker 2>now within the legal industry and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>law society.</v>

1068
00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:41.400
<v Speaker 2>And so absolutely I would encourage the </v>
<v Speaker 2>public to,</v>

1069
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:43.730
<v Speaker 2>to make any concerns that they may have </v>
<v Speaker 2>known,</v>

1070
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:44.863
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and right to the people that make these </v>

1071
00:56:45.801 --> 00:56:50.030
<v Speaker 2>decisions and let them know their </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts because this is,</v>

1072
00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:50.873
<v Speaker 2>this is something like this was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a public trust in this industry to some </v>

1073
00:56:53.961 --> 00:56:55.070
<v Speaker 2>extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the public,</v>

1074
00:56:55.071 --> 00:56:57.800
<v Speaker 2>very much it hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be vested in what's happening.</v>

1075
00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:58.581
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1076
00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:00.870
<v Speaker 4>it's a fundamental public trust because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1077
00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:01.763
<v Speaker 4>it deals with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the underlying structure of the legal </v>

1078
00:57:04.191 --> 00:57:05.720
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it,</v>

1079
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:09.920
<v Speaker 4>this is partly why this is so worrisome </v>
<v Speaker 4>to me because I know perfectly well that</v>

1080
00:57:09.921 --> 00:57:10.754
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the lawyers fold on this and the law </v>

1081
00:57:14.221 --> 00:57:18.790
<v Speaker 4>society succeeds in pushing forward </v>
<v Speaker 4>these requirements and then,</v>

1082
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:19.783
<v Speaker 4>and then enforcing them across time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that every professional organization in </v>

1083
00:57:22.311 --> 00:57:24.830
<v Speaker 4>Canada is going to follow suit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And after that,</v>

1084
00:57:24.831 --> 00:57:25.664
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once the professional organizations </v>

1085
00:57:27.141 --> 00:57:29.090
<v Speaker 4>follow suit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's no,</v>

1086
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:32.930
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason to assume that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't going to spread more widely.</v>

1087
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:34.900
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1088
00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:35.763
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1089
00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:36.623
<v Speaker 3>the main justification underlying all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this that the law society is relying on </v>

1090
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:45.220
<v Speaker 3>is the public interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>

1091
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:49.240
<v Speaker 3>if the public doesn't think this </v>
<v Speaker 3>reflects their interest,</v>

1092
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:51.040
<v Speaker 3>they had better say so.</v>

1093
00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:58.010
<v Speaker 2>And the licensees obviously a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything they can do to reach out,</v>

1094
00:57:58.011 --> 00:57:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1095
00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:01.610
<v Speaker 2>is some assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the current motion that's before</v>

1096
00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:02.444
<v Speaker 2>the law society is to a great extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a byproduct of that groundswell of </v>

1097
00:58:05.811 --> 00:58:08.240
<v Speaker 2>support or opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you'd say.</v>

1098
00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:13.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm from lawyers and paralegals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they can direct those efforts and</v>

1099
00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:16.100
<v Speaker 2>continue them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it can be of some assistance.</v>

1100
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:17.333
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

1101
00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:19.453
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we broadened the scope of what we </v>

1102
00:58:22.911 --> 00:58:27.911
<v Speaker 4>regard as worthy of opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>partly because the attempts,</v>

1103
00:58:28.971 --> 00:58:29.804
<v Speaker 4>let's say so far to ameliorate the worst</v>
<v Speaker 4>elements of the policies that are being </v>

1104
00:58:34.881 --> 00:58:35.714
<v Speaker 4>promoted are insufficient for the task </v>
<v Speaker 4>and even if they were put into place </v>

1105
00:58:39.621 --> 00:58:40.454
<v Speaker 4>like the motion that you described it </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be a victory at 10 percent or </v>

1106
00:58:45.051 --> 00:58:46.280
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1107
00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:48.710
<v Speaker 4>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not move the underlying,</v>

1108
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:52.940
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pathological principals in my estimation</v>

1109
00:58:52.941 --> 00:58:54.590
<v Speaker 4>far enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>

1110
00:58:54.591 --> 00:58:57.800
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't eradicate the threat that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've been trying to warn people about.</v>

1111
00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.620
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right there.</v>

1112
00:59:00.621 --> 00:59:05.621
<v Speaker 3>There is no immediate prospect right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1113
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.823
<v Speaker 3>of getting rid of the forced speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>element of this policy and the other </v>

1114
00:59:10.651 --> 00:59:11.484
<v Speaker 3>elements are consistent with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that requirement and are being carried </v>

1115
00:59:16.381 --> 00:59:17.214
<v Speaker 3>along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1116
00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.233
<v Speaker 3>and although only three of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>recommendations are being put in place </v>

1117
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:21.883
<v Speaker 3>immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest will follow into a course and </v>

1118
00:59:24.081 --> 00:59:26.390
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason to think that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't be done aggressively.</v>

1119
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:27.920
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and was forced.</v>

1120
00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:34.330
<v Speaker 4>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I guess,</v>

1121
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:37.450
<v Speaker 4>do you guys have anything else to say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1122
00:59:37.451 --> 00:59:42.010
<v Speaker 4>maybe thank you to the people who've </v>
<v Speaker 4>already been paying attention and</v>

1123
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:42.581
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

1124
00:59:42.581 --> 00:59:46.510
<v Speaker 3>let's just thank the people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone ahead already and,</v>

1125
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.530
<v Speaker 3>and contacted their benchers contact </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the law society to,</v>

1126
00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:53.360
<v Speaker 3>to register their objection to ask </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

1127
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:57.230
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have done a very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>things on and,</v>

1128
00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:59.850
<v Speaker 3>and our thinking well about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1129
00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.900
<v Speaker 3>they're thinking intelligently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're thinking broadly.</v>

1130
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.720
<v Speaker 3>They the lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My hat's off to them.</v>

1131
01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:06.613
<v Speaker 3>There are a great number of people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are very clear about this and some </v>

1132
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:13.183
<v Speaker 3>are reticent to make too much of a fuss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some are quite happy to say what they </v>

1133
01:00:18.231 --> 01:00:20.690
<v Speaker 3>think and I respect both of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>positions.</v>

1134
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:21.831
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1135
01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:22.664
<v Speaker 3>but I guess the message overall is there</v>
<v Speaker 3>are a great many people who think this </v>

1136
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:27.103
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the worst outcome would be that </v>

1137
01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:34.190
<v Speaker 3>nobody acts upon what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this just sort of happens without us</v>

1138
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:34.980
<v Speaker 3>noticing.</v>

1139
01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:35.813
<v Speaker 2>I've been heartened by the but by what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>see to be singular acts of courage in </v>

1140
01:00:39.331 --> 01:00:43.320
<v Speaker 2>the people that have taken action </v>
<v Speaker 2>written to the law society and even just</v>

1141
01:00:43.321 --> 01:00:45.930
<v Speaker 2>reaching out to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to my office and to others.</v>

1142
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:48.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1143
01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:48.931
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1144
01:00:48.931 --> 01:00:51.720
<v Speaker 2>I support and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and commend those that are doing that</v>

1145
01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:53.903
<v Speaker 3>and people have written,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have written articles and blog </v>

1146
01:00:57.211 --> 01:00:58.044
<v Speaker 3>posts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are some really excellent pieces </v>

1147
01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:03.120
<v Speaker 3>of work on this topic and perhaps we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could even refer,</v>

1148
01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:04.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1149
01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.550
<v Speaker 3>provide links to some of those sources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1150
01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:08.250
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1151
01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:11.790
<v Speaker 3>they're really worth a read a reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very well done,</v>

1152
01:01:11.791 --> 01:01:14.370
<v Speaker 3>very thoughtful pieces and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ring of truth to them</v>

1153
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:15.793
<v Speaker 2>from all over to them from outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen things from outside the </v>

1154
01:01:17.961 --> 01:01:18.880
<v Speaker 2>jurisdiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

1155
01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.900
<v Speaker 2>I think New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great,</v>

1156
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:25.500
<v Speaker 3>great blog by a professor at university </v>
<v Speaker 3>of auckland in New Zealand who's written</v>

1157
01:01:25.501 --> 01:01:26.150
<v Speaker 3>on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1158
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:27.360
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's well worth the read.</v>

1159
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:28.091
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1160
01:01:28.091 --> 01:01:28.924
<v Speaker 4>these things do have international </v>
<v Speaker 4>significance because my observation has </v>

1161
01:01:31.931 --> 01:01:32.764
<v Speaker 4>been that if one major jurisdiction or </v>
<v Speaker 4>organization in the west moves forward </v>

1162
01:01:38.801 --> 01:01:41.260
<v Speaker 4>in this hypothetically progressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction,</v>

1163
01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:42.483
<v Speaker 4>the probability that it will spread </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of rapid electronic </v>

1164
01:01:45.791 --> 01:01:46.624
<v Speaker 4>communication and pretty decent </v>
<v Speaker 4>organization on the part of the people </v>

1165
01:01:49.181 --> 01:01:51.010
<v Speaker 4>who do push these things forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it,</v>

1166
01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.760
<v Speaker 4>that it emerges everywhere with </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary,</v>

1167
01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:59.820
<v Speaker 4>extraordinary rapidity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyone who shares the basIc axioms of</v>

1168
01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:05.160
<v Speaker 4>our legal system is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is involved in this whether they like it</v>

1169
01:02:05.161 --> 01:02:05.994
<v Speaker 4>or not.</v>

1170
01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:08.253
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1171
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:13.040
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I guess we'll see what happens</v>

1172
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:17.870
<v Speaker 4>and maybe will provide an update again </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a couple of weeks.</v>
