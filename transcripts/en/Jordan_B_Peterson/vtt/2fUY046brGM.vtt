1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've started to talk about</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.140
<v Speaker 1>existentialism from the perspective of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual,</v>

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.383
<v Speaker 1>but it's necessary to also understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual in relationship to the </v>

4
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:18.654
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're speaking about </v>

5
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>existential</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality theory,</v>

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.300
<v Speaker 1>it's even more important to place the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual in a broader context.</v>

7
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part is because</v>

8
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.683
<v Speaker 1>it's while it's for two reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's that the initial existential </v>

9
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:43.344
<v Speaker 1>theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most particularly Nietzsche and </v>

10
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:47.034
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very interested in the political </v>

11
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.650
<v Speaker 1>consequences of inauthenticity now need </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to believe that it was the drive for</v>

12
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>truth that had been hyper developed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

13
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.653
<v Speaker 1>at least from a technical perspective by</v>
<v Speaker 1>European submission to Cath Wallace for </v>

14
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years that eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>overthrew</v>

15
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.173
<v Speaker 1>Christianity in its dogmatic form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he also believed that the </v>

16
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that would be</v>

17
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.650
<v Speaker 1>the weakening of the individual human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

18
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.310
<v Speaker 1>at least initially who was then more or </v>
<v Speaker 1>less cast adrift,</v>

19
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.803
<v Speaker 1>but even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there would be dire political </v>

20
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:37.664
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was particularly concerned about </v>

21
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:43.004
<v Speaker 1>the potential for collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectivist thinking to exert a </v>

22
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>murderous hold over the modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

23
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.210
<v Speaker 1>interestingly at exactly the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so remarkable how much niches,</v>

24
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.300
<v Speaker 1>life and Dostoyevsky's life parallel one</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

25
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:03.134
<v Speaker 1>It's really as if they were two sides of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same person because Nisha was </v>

26
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:14.201
<v Speaker 1>philosophizing more or less explicitly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Dostoyevsky who's exploring exactly</v>

27
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:16.214
<v Speaker 1>the same themes in his writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's multiple forms of this </v>

28
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:24.440
<v Speaker 1>parallelism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

29
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.113
<v Speaker 1>when Nisha was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that nature was working out </v>

30
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:29.024
<v Speaker 1>and beyond good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the same ideas that possessed in </v>

31
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:34.664
<v Speaker 1>many ways that possessed Dostoyevsky's </v>
<v Speaker 1>character ruskell called Nikolaihov in </v>

32
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 1>crime and punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a pretty nice parallel title to</v>

33
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:44.840
<v Speaker 1>go beyond good and evil.</v>

34
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.113
<v Speaker 1>And then even more interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dusty minsky wrote a novel called the </v>

35
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:55.910
<v Speaker 1>possessed or the devils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is the least accessible of</v>

36
00:02:55.911 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>his great novels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.270
<v Speaker 1>it about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky's great novels are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

39
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:03.424
<v Speaker 1>like great Russian novels tend to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have a very large cast of </v>

40
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>characters and all of the characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>have three names,</v>

41
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.613
<v Speaker 1>plus they have nicknames.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's quite difficult to keep </v>

42
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>track of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it takes quite a long time.</v>

43
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I think for a modern reader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially one who's not familiar with,</v>

44
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>with with Russia or Russian literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

45
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>to have it all come together in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coherent narrative hole.</v>

46
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's most pronounced I think in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his book the devils.</v>

47
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.263
<v Speaker 1>But the devil's is an unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting book because it describes </v>

48
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:43.384
<v Speaker 1>individual psychopathology and in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways the same way that dusty Husky does </v>

49
00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:47.604
<v Speaker 1>it notes from underground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it links it to this susceptibility </v>

50
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:54.240
<v Speaker 1>to a certain kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.120
<v Speaker 1>political extremism and utopianism in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very direct way.</v>

52
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And so in nodes for underground for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

53
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>the main character is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically week,</v>

54
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>partly because he doesn't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

55
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>And so because he doesn't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

56
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 1>even if he's offended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if he finds something,</v>

57
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unacceptable,</v>

58
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:21.574
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finds it very difficult to stand up </v>

59
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:24.364
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in opposition to it or even to stand </v>

60
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 1>up for himself because he's so full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt that he questions everything he,</v>

61
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.053
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dostoyevsky presents the main </v>

62
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:39.091
<v Speaker 1>character in notes from underground as </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's fragmented to the point of</v>

63
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:40.054
<v Speaker 1>radical uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now his characters in the devils have </v>

64
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>the same underlying problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in some sense the demolition of</v>

65
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:51.064
<v Speaker 1>the integrity of their personalities by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the collapse of their formal individual </v>

66
00:04:57.701 --> 00:04:58.534
<v Speaker 1>and collective belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But instead of becoming riven by </v>

67
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty,</v>

68
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>and doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become possessed by certainty.</v>

69
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 1>And hence the name the devils are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed.</v>

70
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.673
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned to you at one point that </v>
<v Speaker 1>young famously claimed that people </v>

71
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>didn't have ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ideas had people,</v>

72
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>which I think is one of the loveliest </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines I've ever come across.</v>

73
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:23.331
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

74
00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:26.560
<v Speaker 1>it's so brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Dostoyevsky's novel,</v>

75
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 1>the possessed is about how ideas have </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

76
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.840
<v Speaker 1>And his main character in that novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I recollect properly,</v>

77
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:42.001
<v Speaker 1>is named Stavenhagen and staff Oregon is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of nihilistic thinker who turns</v>

78
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:44.284
<v Speaker 1>to totalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically what happens in the </v>

79
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.703
<v Speaker 1>devil's is that he turns to precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas that also manifested </v>

80
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 1>themselves in radical Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then later,</v>

81
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.583
<v Speaker 1>because the possessed was written quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit before the death of the czar and </v>

82
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>the Russian revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.673
<v Speaker 1>several decades before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Dostoyevsky felt that these ideas </v>

84
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:08.264
<v Speaker 1>were in the air in some sense as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative to classical European </v>

85
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:14.084
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including not only classical religious </v>

86
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:18.374
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also classical enlightenment </v>

87
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:20.294
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

88
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolstoy wrote a book called confessions,</v>

89
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>which I would very much recommend </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>

90
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a very short book and hidden </v>
<v Speaker 1>confessions.</v>

91
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.623
<v Speaker 1>What happens to tolstoy as he talks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about his experience in Russia when the </v>

92
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 1>news of the death of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense swept across Russia in,</v>

93
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:40.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in us,</v>

94
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden storm.</v>

95
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.973
<v Speaker 1>The Russians had been futile for a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time and they were </v>

96
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 1>backwards in many ways compared to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of Europe.</v>

97
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.413
<v Speaker 1>And they had stuck in their mid evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural form far longer than most </v>

98
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 1>European states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when that collapsed,</v>

99
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 1>it collapsed with amazing sudden with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with amazing instant tenacity.</v>

100
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:05.174
<v Speaker 1>And tolstoy writes in the confessions </v>
<v Speaker 1>about remembering when the idea first </v>

101
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 1>dawned on him and many other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously,</v>

102
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:19.331
<v Speaker 1>that the entire edifice of Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity was no longer tenable.</v>

103
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:20.444
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens with tolstoy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>confession is that he describes his </v>

104
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.313
<v Speaker 1>absolute collapse as a integrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological being in his descent into </v>

105
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:29.444
<v Speaker 1>the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking tolstoy at the height </v>

106
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:32.870
<v Speaker 1>of his success.</v>

107
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 1>And he was the most successful author in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world at one point.</v>

108
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps,</v>

109
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people still argue that maybe he was the</v>

110
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 1>greatest author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever lived,</v>

111
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:44.060
<v Speaker 1>although I think Dostoyevsky deserves </v>
<v Speaker 1>that title,</v>

112
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.223
<v Speaker 1>but I'm more of a psychologist and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociologist and tolstoy who was a </v>

113
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:48.404
<v Speaker 1>sociologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tolstoy was unwilling to wander around </v>

114
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:53.174
<v Speaker 1>his estates with either a gun or with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rope nearby because he was afraid that </v>

115
00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>he would either shoot or hang himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's because he,</v>

116
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.110
<v Speaker 1>despite his fame and his greatest states</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his political,</v>

117
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his political work,</v>

118
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:11.750
<v Speaker 1>he was very interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emancipation of the serfs.</v>

119
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:16.751
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he concluded in some sense that life was</v>

120
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:19.670
<v Speaker 1>an evil joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was as if life was an evil joke,</v>

121
00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:20.504
<v Speaker 1>being played on mankind by a cruel </v>
<v Speaker 1>creator and that everything was </v>

122
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>ultimately meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but finite.</v>

123
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible and,</v>

124
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.193
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and generating nothing but pointless </v>

125
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:35.180
<v Speaker 1>suffering and tolstoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said very,</v>

126
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>very clearly that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

127
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:39.803
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man with conviction who came to that </v>

128
00:08:42.741 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 1>conclusion could only continue to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>by diluting himself.</v>

129
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.393
<v Speaker 1>And he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought he couldn't think him self </v>

130
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:54.044
<v Speaker 1>out of the proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that his unwillingness to kill himself </v>

131
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 1>was a form of cowardice once he had come</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that realization.</v>

132
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.400
<v Speaker 1>And so confession is about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

133
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 1>he tries to turn to the kind of religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>that characterize the Russian peasantry,</v>

134
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 1>which would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.420
<v Speaker 1>in some sense an ignorant immersion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs that intellect had superseded.</v>

136
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Speaker 1>But of course that wasn't available to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

137
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.383
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of confession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happens to Tolstoy to redeem </v>

138
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:23.860
<v Speaker 1>him in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all it is,</v>

139
00:09:23.861 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 1>is his dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he dreams of this.</v>

140
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:32.060
<v Speaker 1>He dreams that he's suspended over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great abyss by a rope and as far down as</v>

141
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 1>he can look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing but empty space.</v>

142
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:35.184
<v Speaker 1>But then he turns to look up and he can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the same rope above him stretching </v>

143
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 1>up into the sky as far as it can reach.</v>

144
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically how the book ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

145
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:44.993
<v Speaker 1>the inference is something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolstoy's dream revealed to him the </v>

146
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:53.961
<v Speaker 1>proposition that although there were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bismal depths beneath mankind,</v>

147
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a psychological perspective,</v>

148
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>that we were also supported by something</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite.</v>

149
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.680
<v Speaker 1>But it's not articulated like the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>book just ends with the dream so well.</v>

150
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:10.881
<v Speaker 1>So Dostoyevsky lays out the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the underground political movements that</v>

151
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:13.464
<v Speaker 1>were characteristic of late</v>
<v Speaker 1>the late 19 or the late 18 hundreds in </v>

152
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:19.643
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he describes the emergence of the </v>

153
00:10:23.131 --> 00:10:28.131
<v Speaker 1>type of person who ends up after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian revolution,</v>

154
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:33.950
<v Speaker 1>after the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a committed and involved in the</v>

155
00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:36.924
<v Speaker 1>collectivization process in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's virtually impossible to </v>

156
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:41.874
<v Speaker 1>overstate how terrible the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectivization process was right from </v>

157
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:48.840
<v Speaker 1>its onset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

158
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.580
<v Speaker 1>you'll still hear apologists for Marxism</v>
<v Speaker 1>and communism.</v>

159
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.473
<v Speaker 1>Talk about the fact that the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union was captured by a cult of </v>

160
00:10:57.601 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 1>personality under Stalin.</v>

161
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.200
<v Speaker 1>And that that's why the ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions of,</v>

162
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.213
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Marxism transformed into political </v>

163
00:11:07.881 --> 00:11:12.881
<v Speaker 1>action became so corrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's absolute nonsense and</v>

164
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I think it's nonsense of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and reprehensible type.</v>

165
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:22.941
<v Speaker 1>And I think that for two reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first reason was stolen was uh,</v>

166
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.020
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably murderous thug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pretty much killed everyone he knew,</v>

167
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.930
<v Speaker 1>including almost all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call them.</v>

168
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 1>What were they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that the term.</v>

169
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.650
<v Speaker 1>They were old revolutionaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the</v>

170
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.073
<v Speaker 1>Bolsheviks who ran the revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who didn't die during the revolution or </v>

171
00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>of natural causes afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all killed by Stalin.</v>

172
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.440
<v Speaker 1>He probably killed his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He killed pretty much everybody he knew.</v>

173
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

174
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.043
<v Speaker 1>and he was a like an underground </v>
<v Speaker 1>operative for Lenin during the </v>

175
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 1>revolution itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he learned to be committed from an</v>

176
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.813
<v Speaker 1>ideological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd come from quite an intensely </v>

177
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:06.754
<v Speaker 1>religious background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed from an ideological </v>

178
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:09.244
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then basically as acting as a </v>

179
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 1>gorilla assassin during the revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

180
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.483
<v Speaker 1>And then later he rose to power it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He certainly used Lennon's political </v>

181
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 1>machinations as a machinations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

182
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a template for his later activity.</v>

183
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:31.210
<v Speaker 1>But Lennon was no piker when it came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily</v>

184
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:37.710
<v Speaker 1>brutal activity motivated by Utopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

185
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:39.903
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what seemed to happen in some sense is </v>

186
00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:47.221
<v Speaker 1>that you can imagine we're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the political structure,</v>

187
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:49.180
<v Speaker 1>the political movements of whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>

188
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.043
<v Speaker 1>We're going down to the bottom to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it from a psychological perspective </v>

189
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.673
<v Speaker 1>instead of thinking it of it from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic perspective or a power </v>

190
00:12:56.531 --> 00:12:58.750
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense it's a,</v>

191
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:04.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a union analysis of the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political movements in,</v>

192
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.370
<v Speaker 1>in Europe and across the world with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential spin.</v>

193
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:12.903
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine that what classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity had set up for people was </v>

194
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.190
<v Speaker 1>not only a belief in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

195
00:13:18.191 --> 00:13:18.761
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

196
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:19.594
<v Speaker 1>shared moral reality that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone was supposed to be </v>

197
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 1>participating in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also some meaning for,</v>

198
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:30.310
<v Speaker 1>for some meaning for each individual's </v>
<v Speaker 1>life to some degree,</v>

199
00:13:30.311 --> 00:13:31.144
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much they were suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the promise of a kind of </v>

200
00:13:33.701 --> 00:13:34.534
<v Speaker 1>perfection after death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course people like Freud and </v>

201
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:41.210
<v Speaker 1>people like Marx considered that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

202
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.000
<v Speaker 1>an illusion designed either to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>the population from fear of death.</v>

203
00:13:46.001 --> 00:13:48.510
<v Speaker 1>So that would be Freud's argument or </v>
<v Speaker 1>marks.</v>

204
00:13:48.511 --> 00:13:49.630
<v Speaker 1>His argument would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

205
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:50.464
<v Speaker 1>that that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

206
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.653
<v Speaker 1>a conspiracy in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promoted by the political and religious </v>

207
00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:59.440
<v Speaker 1>elite to keep the people who are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed in their place.</v>

208
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course there's some truth to both of </v>

209
00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:04.054
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a difference between some </v>

210
00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:06.394
<v Speaker 1>truth and that truth and any </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily complex phenomena has </v>

211
00:14:10.241 --> 00:14:11.800
<v Speaker 1>multiple causal elements.</v>

212
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.633
<v Speaker 1>And those are two important ones because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course an anxiety about death and </v>

213
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>power are two very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological phenomena.</v>

214
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:22.863
<v Speaker 1>And they play their role in determining </v>
<v Speaker 1>any important collective or individual </v>

215
00:14:27.251 --> 00:14:28.084
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't forget about the rest of </v>

216
00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:30.960
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

217
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:31.893
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the story now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this collapses and that leaves a </v>

218
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:35.794
<v Speaker 1>void.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that void is a void in people's </v>

219
00:14:38.201 --> 00:14:39.460
<v Speaker 1>souls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

220
00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:41.410
<v Speaker 1>It makes them nihilistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

221
00:14:41.411 --> 00:14:42.244
<v Speaker 1>because they don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't see any ultimate meaning in </v>

222
00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:44.764
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it also simultaneously makes them </v>

223
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:52.770
<v Speaker 1>more susceptible to utopian mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements of a rational type.</v>

224
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:54.494
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what happened with </v>

225
00:14:55.851 --> 00:14:58.700
<v Speaker 1>regards to the Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with regards to the fascist.</v>

226
00:14:58.701 --> 00:14:59.534
<v Speaker 1>So what Hitler offered his followers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>collaboration with them because it </v>

227
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:08.351
<v Speaker 1>wasn't so much that Hitler told people </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he wanted them to think as it was,</v>

228
00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:10.694
<v Speaker 1>that Hitler listened to what the crowd's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted and then told it back to them in </v>

229
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:16.544
<v Speaker 1>our collaboration that extended across </v>
<v Speaker 1>his entire rule because Hitler was a </v>

230
00:15:19.911 --> 00:15:24.320
<v Speaker 1>great populist and he was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good at receiving messages from the</v>

231
00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:25.154
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

232
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.280
<v Speaker 1>But Hitler basically offered his pr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his population,</v>

233
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.540
<v Speaker 1>the dream of racial superiority and </v>
<v Speaker 1>world domination,</v>

234
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as many,</v>

235
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 1>many other things that went along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

236
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course,</v>

237
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.103
<v Speaker 1>Mark's offered his followers the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the oppressed could shed their </v>

238
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:47.500
<v Speaker 1>chains and that everyone could unite </v>
<v Speaker 1>workers at intellectuals alike.</v>

239
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.950
<v Speaker 1>In particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the,</v>

240
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 1>it was more the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the owner,</v>

241
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:56.060
<v Speaker 1>the owning class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bourgeois as they're still called by</v>

242
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:56.894
<v Speaker 1>some people who were the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil oppressors and the Union of </v>

243
00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:01.574
<v Speaker 1>worker and intellectual would eventually</v>
<v Speaker 1>shepherd in a golden age where everyone </v>

244
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.293
<v Speaker 1>offered to society as much as they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>offer and took from society as much as </v>

245
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:12.801
<v Speaker 1>they need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

246
00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:13.634
<v Speaker 1>And that's the famous phrase from each </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to his ability to each </v>

247
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.320
<v Speaker 1>according to his need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sounds wonderful.</v>

248
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.193
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand why that would be an </v>

249
00:16:23.631 --> 00:16:26.390
<v Speaker 1>attractive slogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you start to think about how that</v>

250
00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:30.950
<v Speaker 1>would be administered in practice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you really start to think it through,</v>

251
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.023
<v Speaker 1>you realize very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly that it's a re it's a </v>

252
00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:37.520
<v Speaker 1>recipe for absolute disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because,</v>

253
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.133
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you tell the difference between </v>

254
00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:41.450
<v Speaker 1>your need and your need?</v>

255
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:42.283
<v Speaker 1>If your mother needs cancer surgery and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your genius brother needs to do go do </v>

256
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:49.970
<v Speaker 1>his phd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's need trump's while.</v>

257
00:16:49.971 --> 00:16:50.804
<v Speaker 1>And that's just a trivial problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all of you have those competing </v>

258
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:59.530
<v Speaker 1>needs and how anybody is ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjudicate between the value of needs is</v>

259
00:17:01.971 --> 00:17:06.971
<v Speaker 1>beyond cognitive comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just can't be done.</v>

260
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.263
<v Speaker 1>Not without brutality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because you know there's </v>

261
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:13.010
<v Speaker 1>limited resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next question is,</v>

262
00:17:13.011 --> 00:17:13.491
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

263
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:15.800
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to contribute according </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your ability.</v>

264
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.380
<v Speaker 1>How much ability do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what that meant in practice?</v>

265
00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:22.214
<v Speaker 1>That was that people were frequently </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked to death because the ability </v>

266
00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:27.710
<v Speaker 1>isn't a definable entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

267
00:17:27.711 --> 00:17:32.360
<v Speaker 1>and unless you have some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated</v>

268
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:34.723
<v Speaker 1>and functional system to negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to allow people to negotiate amongst </v>

269
00:17:39.411 --> 00:17:43.580
<v Speaker 1>themselves peaceably about what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to offer and what they're going to</v>

270
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:44.414
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to turn it over to something </v>

271
00:17:46.461 --> 00:17:47.900
<v Speaker 1>like a centralized authority.</v>

272
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.710
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

273
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.903
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need much imagination to </v>

274
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:54.090
<v Speaker 1>understand that that would be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute catastrophe.</v>

275
00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:57.750
<v Speaker 1>And it was an absolute catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

276
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.990
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about Dostoyevsky's book,</v>

277
00:18:00.991 --> 00:18:01.824
<v Speaker 1>the Devil's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's segues almost perfectly </v>

278
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:05.874
<v Speaker 1>into Alexandria soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nixon's description of the emergence of </v>

279
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:10.404
<v Speaker 1>the Russian prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so Soviet prison camps after the </v>

280
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what happened,</v>

281
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:16.404
<v Speaker 1>and this was what Solzhenitsyn revealed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 1970s was that because the </v>

282
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:23.520
<v Speaker 1>communist system was so financially </v>
<v Speaker 1>untenable,</v>

283
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.760
<v Speaker 1>the principals just didn't work for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of reasons.</v>

284
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.970
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system ended up running basically on</v>

285
00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:34.740
<v Speaker 1>a system of work camps and so much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Russians produced,</v>

286
00:18:34.741 --> 00:18:37.110
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets produced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't very much by the way,</v>

287
00:18:37.111 --> 00:18:39.330
<v Speaker 1>although they got industrialized very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly,</v>

288
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 1>was produced by people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically enslaved,</v>

289
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.290
<v Speaker 1>and that's the only way the system could</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to function.</v>

290
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.153
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldier Nixon estimated that between 19 </v>

291
00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:56.181
<v Speaker 1>and nine 1919 which is basically the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the first world war and 1959 which is</v>

292
00:18:57.331 --> 00:19:00.090
<v Speaker 1>basically when the Stalinist era came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>an end.</v>

293
00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:00.924
<v Speaker 1>So that's only 40 years that 60 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were killed in the Soviet Union </v>

294
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.990
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of internal repression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't count the Second World War.</v>

295
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Now people debate these figures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldier Nansen is surprisingly to me,</v>

296
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.140
<v Speaker 1>a controversial figure because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see where the controversy is.</v>

297
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:23.243
<v Speaker 1>People complain about his numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>claiming that our death count of 60 </v>

298
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:32.970
<v Speaker 1>million people over that period of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>is mathematically untenable,</v>

299
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.350
<v Speaker 1>but reason more reasonable estimates if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to put it that way,</v>

300
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 1>put it up to 20 or 30 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that the truth of the matter is that</v>

301
00:19:42.091 --> 00:19:44.370
<v Speaker 1>no one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that even makes it worse.</v>

302
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:45.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do know,</v>

303
00:19:45.181 --> 00:19:47.430
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

304
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.733
<v Speaker 1>the a sat collectivization in the 1920s </v>
<v Speaker 1>led to the creation of a agricultural </v>

305
00:19:56.461 --> 00:20:01.461
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe</v>
<v Speaker 1>made worse by Stalin's peculiar economic</v>

306
00:20:03.281 --> 00:20:06.970
<v Speaker 1>policies that killed 6 million people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

307
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.450
<v Speaker 1>in the Ukraine in the 1930s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

308
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:16.110
<v Speaker 1>how many of you knew that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you know about the Ukrainian</v>

309
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.040
<v Speaker 1>famine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many didn't know?</v>

310
00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing you might want to ask yourself</v>

311
00:20:22.841 --> 00:20:24.580
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the hell don't you know</v>

312
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.031
<v Speaker 1>it all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

313
00:20:27.031 --> 00:20:30.960
<v Speaker 1>lots of things about the mass death sin </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 20th century,</v>

314
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.093
<v Speaker 1>but my experience has been that students</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the West know almost nothing about </v>

315
00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:37.284
<v Speaker 1>what happened as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imposition of radical left wing </v>

316
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.190
<v Speaker 1>dictatorships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not trivial.</v>

317
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.833
<v Speaker 1>30 million in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's 6 million in Cambodia under Pol </v>

318
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pol Pot was trained at the sore bomb and</v>

319
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:54.874
<v Speaker 1>he took what he learned at the Sorbonne </v>
<v Speaker 1>from his radical left wing professors </v>

320
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.463
<v Speaker 1>and put it into practice in Cambodia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emptied out the cities because he had </v>

321
00:21:03.311 --> 00:21:04.144
<v Speaker 1>learned that under Standard Marxists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dogma city people who are mostly </v>

322
00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:08.794
<v Speaker 1>bourgeois were parasites on the workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He emptied the cities and killed 6 </v>

323
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.350
<v Speaker 1>million people and then in China during </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mao's cultural revolution,</v>

324
00:21:17.351 --> 00:21:18.184
<v Speaker 1>while no one really knows soldier nest </v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn's estimates were 100 </v>

325
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can take half that if you want.</v>

326
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.103
<v Speaker 1>These are massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive numbers of people and part of </v>

327
00:21:30.491 --> 00:21:31.324
<v Speaker 1>the reason that I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible to pin the absolute </v>

328
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:37.503
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes of the Soviet state on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>style in this cult of personality was </v>

329
00:21:43.181 --> 00:21:45.820
<v Speaker 1>that it didn't only happen in the Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

330
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:47.643
<v Speaker 1>It happened with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with catastrophic results in all sorts </v>

331
00:21:52.121 --> 00:21:56.530
<v Speaker 1>of places where these economic policies </v>
<v Speaker 1>were implemented.</v>

332
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.140
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>western students,</v>

333
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.870
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know about these things,</v>

334
00:22:04.871 --> 00:22:05.704
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

335
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

336
00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.640
<v Speaker 1>the intelligentsia of the West Europe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and North America,</v>

337
00:22:13.641 --> 00:22:14.474
<v Speaker 1>we're going to save for the time being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so heavily influenced by radical </v>

338
00:22:19.281 --> 00:22:24.281
<v Speaker 1>left wing ideas from the 1920s well to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the present day that</v>

339
00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.830
<v Speaker 1>these facts have never been made as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

340
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:35.890
<v Speaker 1>have never been disseminated in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>thorough manner as is only appropriate.</v>

341
00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.900
<v Speaker 1>So the French intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

342
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.920
<v Speaker 1>from whom postmodernism derived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

343
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:43.783
<v Speaker 1>people like John Paul Sartre and food co</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a very large group of French </v>

344
00:22:47.961 --> 00:22:48.794
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals who were involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>student radical left student movements </v>

345
00:22:52.731 --> 00:22:53.564
<v Speaker 1>in the late 1960s and who ended up </v>
<v Speaker 1>barricading the streets of Paris in </v>

346
00:22:57.471 --> 00:22:58.304
<v Speaker 1>1968,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is when the student movement sort </v>

347
00:23:00.291 --> 00:23:02.570
<v Speaker 1>of peaked and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then fell away.</v>

348
00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.093
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never apologized in any real sense </v>

349
00:23:07.581 --> 00:23:11.330
<v Speaker 1>for there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact of being enamored of,</v>

350
00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:16.780
<v Speaker 1>well at least in part the policies of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stalin and also the policies of Mau.</v>

351
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:23.470
<v Speaker 1>And there's no excuse for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the problem is of course,</v>

352
00:23:24.051 --> 00:23:24.884
<v Speaker 1>is that left wing radical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left wing political and economic ideas </v>

353
00:23:28.761 --> 00:23:29.594
<v Speaker 1>are intellectually quite coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they make sense once you accept a </v>

354
00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:35.204
<v Speaker 1>certain set of axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from each according to his ability </v>

355
00:23:38.151 --> 00:23:41.450
<v Speaker 1>to each according to his need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You accept that axiom,</v>

356
00:23:41.451 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 1>you accept the idea that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the capital class,</v>

357
00:23:46.311 --> 00:23:47.144
<v Speaker 1>the capitalist class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is roughly anyone who owns </v>

358
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:50.054
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only owns what they owned because </v>

359
00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:52.904
<v Speaker 1>they've stolen it from someone else so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's labor is productive but </v>

360
00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.453
<v Speaker 1>nothing else is productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything else is a secondary </v>

361
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:02.510
<v Speaker 1>derivation of labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

362
00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:03.344
<v Speaker 1>that's an absolutely moronic economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory because obviously there's work </v>

363
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:10.970
<v Speaker 1>that has value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's work that has no value.</v>

364
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:14.930
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it's difficult has almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>no relationship to whether or not it has</v>

365
00:24:14.931 --> 00:24:16.460
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

366
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the political system or </v>

367
00:24:18.921 --> 00:24:22.460
<v Speaker 1>the economic system is a perfect mirror </v>
<v Speaker 1>of effort.</v>

368
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

369
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.320
<v Speaker 1>you might say that.</v>

370
00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.413
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

371
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.513
<v Speaker 1>well I would say really what happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century is once people stopped </v>

372
00:24:44.291 --> 00:24:49.291
<v Speaker 1>worshiping an externalized Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started to worship.</v>

373
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.580
<v Speaker 1>If they were intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started to worship rational utopian</v>

374
00:24:54.581 --> 00:24:57.610
<v Speaker 1>ideas and if they weren't as </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

375
00:24:57.611 --> 00:25:01.690
<v Speaker 1>they turned to the state like </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification with the state,</v>

376
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:02.883
<v Speaker 1>like the Nazis for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identification with the state as an </v>

377
00:25:05.861 --> 00:25:10.861
<v Speaker 1>alternative source of collective power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and both of those were</v>

378
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:18.370
<v Speaker 1>in comprehensively devastated and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not done with it yet.</v>

379
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.353
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

380
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.320
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union and soldier Hinson,</v>

381
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:29.960
<v Speaker 1>one of whose I have you read one of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chapters of the Gulag archipelago,</v>

382
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:30.794
<v Speaker 1>which is an amazing piece of writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the things that Solzhenitsyn's </v>

383
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.630
<v Speaker 1>soldier knits and points out is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was this extensive prison camp system in</v>

384
00:25:38.631 --> 00:25:41.150
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union that he called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago.</v>

385
00:25:41.151 --> 00:25:41.984
<v Speaker 1>It was this chain of camps all across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union and if you were thrown </v>

386
00:25:45.531 --> 00:25:47.420
<v Speaker 1>in there because you were a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoner,</v>

387
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:48.403
<v Speaker 1>you are the worst kind of prisoner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be thrown in there as a </v>

388
00:25:52.041 --> 00:25:52.874
<v Speaker 1>political prisoner pretty much for </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing any opinion whatsoever about </v>

389
00:25:55.881 --> 00:25:58.370
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is we're going to get back to that</v>

390
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.010
<v Speaker 1>as we tie this together with </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialism.</v>

391
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:02.383
<v Speaker 1>Now the communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we regarded the murderers and the </v>

392
00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:09.560
<v Speaker 1>rapists and the thieves as socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly elements because it was a,</v>

393
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:10.923
<v Speaker 1>it was part of Marxist doctrine that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only reason that you would become a </v>

394
00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:14.774
<v Speaker 1>murderer or a thief or a rapist was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you were part of the no press </v>

395
00:26:18.261 --> 00:26:22.040
<v Speaker 1>class and your poverty was what </v>
<v Speaker 1>generated your crime.</v>

396
00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.850
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense you couldn't be held </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally responsible for it.</v>

397
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:26.983
<v Speaker 1>And the upshot of that was that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thieves and the rapists and murderers </v>

398
00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:31.040
<v Speaker 1>ran the prisons.</v>

399
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia right now is a mafia state.</v>

400
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.450
<v Speaker 1>There's evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

401
00:26:38.451 --> 00:26:42.290
<v Speaker 1>that Putin is the richest man in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and he has</v>

402
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.780
<v Speaker 1>almost singular power over this or over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the affairs of the Soviet Union,</v>

403
00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:51.930
<v Speaker 1>the former Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians,</v>

404
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:52.764
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets killed anybody that had any </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity for independent thought and </v>

405
00:26:56.731 --> 00:27:00.480
<v Speaker 1>they raised the thugs to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the highest positions of authority.</v>

406
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.230
<v Speaker 1>And you guys are going to be dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that for the rest of your life.</v>

407
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.550
<v Speaker 1>So if you think that that's changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

408
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.473
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't changed at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia has just transformed from a </v>

409
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.570
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian communist state into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mafia state.</v>

410
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem.</v>

411
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

412
00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.110
<v Speaker 1>So we're not done with this yet.</v>

413
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.940
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that soldier </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nixon,</v>

414
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:30.620
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why I use him as a psychological</v>

415
00:27:30.621 --> 00:27:32.120
<v Speaker 1>thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

416
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:36.420
<v Speaker 1>people generally consider Viktor Frankl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

417
00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:38.223
<v Speaker 1>that the primary</v>
<v Speaker 1>existential psychologist or </v>

418
00:27:43.101 --> 00:27:45.950
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now Victor Frankel came through the Nazi</v>

419
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:50.900
<v Speaker 1>prison counts and he developed logo </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy as a consequence of that.</v>

420
00:27:50.901 --> 00:27:51.734
<v Speaker 1>And logotherapy what part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles of logotherapy were laid </v>

421
00:27:55.311 --> 00:27:57.710
<v Speaker 1>forth in his book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man's search for meaning.</v>

422
00:27:57.711 --> 00:27:58.544
<v Speaker 1>And one of Frankel's propositions was </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially that because life is </v>

423
00:28:02.691 --> 00:28:03.524
<v Speaker 1>suffering and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can be unbearable suffering that </v>

424
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.793
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary for people to have are </v>
<v Speaker 1>countervailing meaning to buttress </v>

425
00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:15.110
<v Speaker 1>themselves against the tragedy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

426
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:20.240
<v Speaker 1>And Frankl basically claimed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is an existential claim that if</v>

427
00:28:20.241 --> 00:28:21.074
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could find that meaning and </v>

428
00:28:23.541 --> 00:28:24.374
<v Speaker 1>collective belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that there were terrible dangers </v>

429
00:28:27.261 --> 00:28:31.340
<v Speaker 1>associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your moral obligation was to find</v>

430
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.720
<v Speaker 1>that meaning within the confines of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own authentic individual life.</v>

431
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.553
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that sort of idea also </v>
<v Speaker 1>arising in the thought of Carl Rogers </v>

432
00:28:41.091 --> 00:28:42.060
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the end,</v>

433
00:28:42.061 --> 00:28:42.894
<v Speaker 1>it's also there in noon because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course you don't believe that there was </v>

434
00:28:45.921 --> 00:28:46.754
<v Speaker 1>this path he called individuation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the flowering and </v>

435
00:28:49.581 --> 00:28:52.880
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of the healthy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated,</v>

436
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.600
<v Speaker 1>the deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy and integrated fundamental human</v>

437
00:28:56.601 --> 00:28:57.560
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

438
00:28:57.561 --> 00:28:58.394
<v Speaker 1>piaget believed something similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although more collective because for </v>

439
00:29:03.231 --> 00:29:04.064
<v Speaker 1>piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hammering of your psyche into </v>

440
00:29:06.921 --> 00:29:07.754
<v Speaker 1>something resembling an integrated state</v>
<v Speaker 1>also had to be done in active concert </v>

441
00:29:12.201 --> 00:29:14.000
<v Speaker 1>with all of the people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

442
00:29:14.001 --> 00:29:14.834
<v Speaker 1>because you are organizing yourself into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a coherent internal game where all your </v>

443
00:29:19.191 --> 00:29:22.040
<v Speaker 1>little subpersonalities could find their</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

444
00:29:22.041 --> 00:29:27.041
<v Speaker 1>Well simultaneously doing that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people over long spans of time.</v>

445
00:29:27.051 --> 00:29:28.700
<v Speaker 1>But you can see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theme,</v>

446
00:29:28.701 --> 00:29:31.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a theme that emerges in all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those thinkers.</v>

447
00:29:31.101 --> 00:29:31.934
<v Speaker 1>And one of the themes is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are healthy pathways to </v>

448
00:29:34.581 --> 00:29:39.320
<v Speaker 1>psychological development and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialists in particular,</v>

449
00:29:39.321 --> 00:29:41.680
<v Speaker 1>although this was also the case with </v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

450
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.693
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked as a secret agent for the </v>

451
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:44.674
<v Speaker 1>American government and provided the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president of the United States with </v>

452
00:29:47.501 --> 00:29:50.050
<v Speaker 1>psychological reports on Hitler's state </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mind.</v>

453
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.343
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even discovered until about </v>

454
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:53.224
<v Speaker 1>three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of these thinkers were concerned </v>

455
00:29:57.191 --> 00:29:58.024
<v Speaker 1>about collective pathology and at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time concerned about individual </v>

456
00:30:01.961 --> 00:30:02.794
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think you can really </v>

457
00:30:03.641 --> 00:30:07.530
<v Speaker 1>separate those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that I use soldier Nissen</v>

458
00:30:07.531 --> 00:30:12.531
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he basically takes the same tack</v>

459
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:17.110
<v Speaker 1>as Viktor Frankl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the Gulag archipelago,</v>

460
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's a much more thoroughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed body of thought.</v>

461
00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm an admirer of Frankel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think man,</v>

462
00:30:22.581 --> 00:30:27.160
<v Speaker 1>search for meaning is amazing book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good book.</v>

463
00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Gulag archipelago is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastatingly profound book.</v>

464
00:30:31.511 --> 00:30:34.420
<v Speaker 1>They're not in the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not in the same league.</v>

465
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

466
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:40.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn is to Viktor Frankl.</v>

467
00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:44.830
<v Speaker 1>What dusty Esky is to virtually any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other author.</v>

468
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:45.743
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

469
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is about the Damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians.</v>

470
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:49.323
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're suffering has done </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to them over the hundreds of </v>

471
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:55.330
<v Speaker 1>years that it's been in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can produce,</v>

472
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 1>people have unbelievable profundity as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as,</v>

473
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crooks who are crooked and,</v>

474
00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.400
<v Speaker 1>and murderous beyond comprehension.</v>

475
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

476
00:31:06.071 --> 00:31:06.904
<v Speaker 1>a soldier Nixon was very interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand what happened to </v>

477
00:31:11.201 --> 00:31:12.034
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union was how that it could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could it transform itself into a </v>

478
00:31:15.251 --> 00:31:16.084
<v Speaker 1>state that devoured the majority or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vast minority of its citizens and often </v>

479
00:31:21.461 --> 00:31:22.294
<v Speaker 1>the best of the citizenry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was very common in the Soviet </v>

480
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Union and this is through the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet block.</v>

481
00:31:28.151 --> 00:31:30.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean you were required to be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>informer,</v>

482
00:31:30.821 --> 00:31:31.654
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were certainly taught to be an </v>

483
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:35.440
<v Speaker 1>informer at school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

484
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:36.303
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets made much of children who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were patriotic enough to turn in their </v>

485
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 1>own parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

486
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:45.520
<v Speaker 1>they were held up as models of behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was very frequently the case that</v>

487
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:46.563
<v Speaker 1>if you denounced the neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a really good waste way for </v>

488
00:31:49.451 --> 00:31:50.284
<v Speaker 1>your family to get their apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course apartments were an </v>

489
00:31:52.601 --> 00:31:53.434
<v Speaker 1>incredibly scarce supply and far too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people generally lived in the same </v>

490
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:59.320
<v Speaker 1>locale.</v>

491
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.153
<v Speaker 1>And so if you were a three generation </v>
<v Speaker 1>family living in a one bedroom </v>

492
00:32:03.551 --> 00:32:04.384
<v Speaker 1>apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most effective ways to get </v>

493
00:32:06.071 --> 00:32:09.970
<v Speaker 1>your children a new apartment was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>denounce the neighbor down the hallway.</v>

494
00:32:09.971 --> 00:32:12.580
<v Speaker 1>And as a reward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be given the apartment.</v>

495
00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 1>While you can imagine who would take </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of that kind of offer.</v>

496
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.003
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in the 1920s during the </v>

497
00:32:19.391 --> 00:32:20.890
<v Speaker 1>collectivization?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

498
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:21.873
<v Speaker 1>here's the idea of the serfs had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>emancipated in the late 18 hundreds and </v>

499
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:31.321
<v Speaker 1>they were basically feudal inhabitants </v>
<v Speaker 1>of parcels of land who were more or less</v>

500
00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:36.490
<v Speaker 1>old by the no nobility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't exactly slavery,</v>

501
00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:38.920
<v Speaker 1>but because the serves has certain sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>of rights,</v>

502
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.363
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was closer to slavery than to </v>

503
00:32:42.841 --> 00:32:46.460
<v Speaker 1>anything else that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize from a modern perspective.</v>

504
00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 1>The serfs were emancipated in the late </v>
<v Speaker 1>18 hundreds.</v>

505
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:50.503
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually at about the same time that </v>

506
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:54.290
<v Speaker 1>slavery was abolished in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

507
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.240
<v Speaker 1>approximately the same period of time.</v>

508
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

509
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.013
<v Speaker 1>and so there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course that Russia had a very </v>

510
00:33:02.451 --> 00:33:05.930
<v Speaker 1>rich aristocracy and it had a monarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that,</v>

511
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.940
<v Speaker 1>and then it went through the first world</v>
<v Speaker 1>war and,</v>

512
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.813
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was viciously demolish during the </v>

513
00:33:10.731 --> 00:33:14.480
<v Speaker 1>first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there was an underclass of</v>

514
00:33:14.481 --> 00:33:19.481
<v Speaker 1>po of impoverished people and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>overclass of Eris to Craddick,</v>

515
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:24.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parasites was a compelling idea.</v>

516
00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:27.860
<v Speaker 1>And it was a compelling idea in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>places other than Russia,</v>

517
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at the turn of the century.</v>

518
00:33:30.471 --> 00:33:31.304
<v Speaker 1>And that was partly because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial revolution was brutal and </v>

519
00:33:33.831 --> 00:33:38.120
<v Speaker 1>farm life was very difficult and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a massive gap between rich and poor.</v>

520
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:39.380
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

521
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.370
<v Speaker 1>that was an attractive political </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>

522
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:44.204
<v Speaker 1>And it had partial truth because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course people are exploited and often </v>

523
00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.630
<v Speaker 1>poor people are poor because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploited.</v>

524
00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.790
<v Speaker 1>But there's lots of other reasons to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor.</v>

525
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.180
<v Speaker 1>And rich people are sometimes rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they exploit.</v>

526
00:33:56.181 --> 00:33:59.150
<v Speaker 1>But of course there's lots of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons to be rich as well.</v>

527
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

528
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:08.530
<v Speaker 1>these ideas were put into practice by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bolshevik revolutionaries and one of</v>

529
00:34:11.361 --> 00:34:12.194
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most comprehensive </v>

530
00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:16.994
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took place in the 1920s when the </v>

531
00:34:21.561 --> 00:34:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Soviets underwent a process that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>call d Kulak ization.</v>

532
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine this.</v>

533
00:34:27.101 --> 00:34:27.934
<v Speaker 1>So in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the late 18 hundreds of the serfs </v>

534
00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:33.830
<v Speaker 1>were emancipated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that meant was that some people</v>

535
00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:35.870
<v Speaker 1>started to own their own land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

536
00:34:35.871 --> 00:34:38.150
<v Speaker 1>they weren't nobles that owned it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>owned the states.</v>

537
00:34:38.151 --> 00:34:42.230
<v Speaker 1>They were more like what we would </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider sort of middleclass farmers.</v>

538
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.080
<v Speaker 1>So they owned some land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they own some animals.</v>

539
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:50.230
<v Speaker 1>They might own a half decent house in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the town and they might have done enough</v>

540
00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.213
<v Speaker 1>or being fortunate enough to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>collected enough money and enough </v>

541
00:34:55.971 --> 00:34:56.804
<v Speaker 1>property and enough stability so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could hire one or two people to </v>

542
00:34:59.481 --> 00:35:01.340
<v Speaker 1>help them with their crops.</v>

543
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.340
<v Speaker 1>So they were by no means rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were,</v>

544
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:09.230
<v Speaker 1>they were the successful farming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

545
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:12.620
<v Speaker 1>class of the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

546
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Now the communists put forward the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is no way that you could have</v>

547
00:35:19.101 --> 00:35:19.934
<v Speaker 1>a brick house in town and own more cows </v>
<v Speaker 1>than your neighbor and have some </v>

548
00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:27.050
<v Speaker 1>productive land put aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And worst of all,</v>

549
00:35:27.051 --> 00:35:27.884
<v Speaker 1>hire someone to work for you unless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had essentially stolen that from your </v>

550
00:35:32.271 --> 00:35:33.104
<v Speaker 1>neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the communists would send out </v>

551
00:35:35.631 --> 00:35:36.464
<v Speaker 1>activists from the cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would go to these towns and start </v>

552
00:35:39.481 --> 00:35:41.670
<v Speaker 1>spreading this doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

553
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:42.504
<v Speaker 1>now you gotta think this through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now who is going to be most responsive </v>

554
00:35:48.091 --> 00:35:50.940
<v Speaker 1>to that doctrine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

555
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.570
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be the most jealous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless,</v>

556
00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:56.970
<v Speaker 1>jealous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and resentful people in town.</v>

557
00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.240
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be the guys that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging around in the local bar,</v>

558
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:02.610
<v Speaker 1>drinking themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to death every day,</v>

559
00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:05.760
<v Speaker 1>who feel that they've been totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>screwed over by life,</v>

560
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.680
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hate.</v>

561
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.190
<v Speaker 1>The people who have come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>modicum of prosperity.</v>

562
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.740
<v Speaker 1>And then someone comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

563
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.790
<v Speaker 1>as far as our doctrine goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people you hate,</v>

564
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.653
<v Speaker 1>there nothing better than thieves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your moral and patriotic duty to </v>

565
00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:26.550
<v Speaker 1>rise up and take everything they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happened.</v>

566
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:32.330
<v Speaker 1>So during the D Kula causation process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're basically be mobs of jealous and</v>

567
00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:33.624
<v Speaker 1>resentful thugs who would go into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>houses of these moderately prosperous </v>

568
00:36:38.671 --> 00:36:39.504
<v Speaker 1>people who were actually the only people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union who knew how to </v>

569
00:36:43.111 --> 00:36:45.210
<v Speaker 1>farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they took everything,</v>

570
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:46.583
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go into their houses and strip </v>

571
00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:50.100
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baron take all the animals.</v>

572
00:36:50.101 --> 00:36:50.934
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what the Communists did with </v>

573
00:36:53.701 --> 00:36:56.400
<v Speaker 1>the Kulaks was they allowed them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>

574
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:57.263
<v Speaker 1>they going to resettle them up mostly in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Siberia while there was no settlements </v>

575
00:37:00.391 --> 00:37:02.490
<v Speaker 1>in Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what they meant,</v>

576
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.810
<v Speaker 1>what that meant was hastily built rail </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines would take them in,</v>

577
00:37:06.811 --> 00:37:07.644
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the winter with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>families and dump them on the frozen </v>

578
00:37:11.011 --> 00:37:15.510
<v Speaker 1>prairie where well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the children would die and everybody</v>

579
00:37:15.511 --> 00:37:17.190
<v Speaker 1>more or less would freeze to death.</v>

580
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.620
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

581
00:37:19.621 --> 00:37:20.730
<v Speaker 1>the Communists said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

582
00:37:20.731 --> 00:37:23.370
<v Speaker 1>you could take two months worth of food </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>

583
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.330
<v Speaker 1>but of course they didn't make any </v>
<v Speaker 1>provisions for having that two months of</v>

584
00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:28.164
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after you had gone through the </v>

585
00:37:29.251 --> 00:37:31.080
<v Speaker 1>process of Dq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ization,</v>

586
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:34.830
<v Speaker 1>you can bloody well be sure that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have two months of food left that</v>

587
00:37:34.831 --> 00:37:35.664
<v Speaker 1>you could take when you were suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>bundled onto the trains and driven to </v>

588
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:41.280
<v Speaker 1>the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

589
00:37:41.281 --> 00:37:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a number of years of that which,</v>

590
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.113
<v Speaker 1>which also involved the forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectivization of all the remaining </v>

591
00:37:48.811 --> 00:37:49.644
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distribution of the land in </v>

592
00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:51.624
<v Speaker 1>principle to everyone and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective farming while the entire </v>

593
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:55.524
<v Speaker 1>agricultural economy fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was particularly the case in </v>

594
00:37:59.071 --> 00:38:00.270
<v Speaker 1>the Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very,</v>

595
00:38:00.271 --> 00:38:01.104
<v Speaker 1>very fertile part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And which was the breadbasket of of </v>

596
00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

597
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:06.803
<v Speaker 1>while everybody starved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Communists had to put up posters </v>

598
00:38:09.901 --> 00:38:12.870
<v Speaker 1>telling people that eating their </v>
<v Speaker 1>children was wrong.</v>

599
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.280
<v Speaker 1>They would kill people if they went out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fields after the harvest.</v>

600
00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:19.740
<v Speaker 1>So they go out with their big harvesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines,</v>

601
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.880
<v Speaker 1>vacuum up all the grain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ship it to the cities because the cities</v>

602
00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:27.360
<v Speaker 1>were also starving and leave nothing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people behind.</v>

603
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.220
<v Speaker 1>And then if you went out there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>

604
00:38:29.221 --> 00:38:30.054
<v Speaker 1>like if you are a mother and your child </v>
<v Speaker 1>was starving to death and you went out </v>

605
00:38:32.341 --> 00:38:33.174
<v Speaker 1>there in the field and you picked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual kernels of grain so that you </v>

606
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.180
<v Speaker 1>gathered them in a cop and bring them </v>
<v Speaker 1>home to feed their,</v>

607
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:44.710
<v Speaker 1>affect your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was an executable crime because you</v>

608
00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:47.610
<v Speaker 1>were supposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stealing from the state if you're</v>

609
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:48.463
<v Speaker 1>going to go out there and bloody well </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickup the wretched little kernels that </v>

610
00:38:51.011 --> 00:38:51.850
<v Speaker 1>are left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

611
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:56.590
<v Speaker 1>half crushed into the ground that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>your moral obligation to turn those over</v>

612
00:38:56.591 --> 00:38:57.424
<v Speaker 1>to the state because I suppose that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of your ability and the needs </v>

613
00:39:00.931 --> 00:39:02.410
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else was greater.</v>

614
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.083
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn was very interested in how </v>

615
00:39:08.471 --> 00:39:10.480
<v Speaker 1>the hell this sort of thing could even </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

616
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:11.943
<v Speaker 1>You don't want because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wasn't interested in precisely </v>

617
00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:15.244
<v Speaker 1>from a political perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would say he started being </v>

618
00:39:17.591 --> 00:39:19.690
<v Speaker 1>interested in it from a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

619
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:23.390
<v Speaker 1>analyzing the actions of people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lenin and Stalin.</v>

620
00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.360
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a very interesting book on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lennon,</v>

621
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:30.660
<v Speaker 1>which was one of the first documents </v>
<v Speaker 1>that made lennon out to be the same sort</v>

622
00:39:30.851 --> 00:39:31.684
<v Speaker 1>of person that Stalin was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I think now the historical </v>

623
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:35.134
<v Speaker 1>evidence for that is crystal clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it solves your nets and ended up </v>

624
00:39:38.351 --> 00:39:43.351
<v Speaker 1>more by doing a psychological analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because as he considered what</v>

625
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:45.634
<v Speaker 1>had happened to his country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't escape the proposition that </v>

626
00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:53.740
<v Speaker 1>the reason it had become so corrupt was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all of the individuals within it</v>

627
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:56.200
<v Speaker 1>had allowed themselves to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>

628
00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.220
<v Speaker 1>And so one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're wondering,</v>

629
00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:01.083
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you know your political system has </v>

630
00:40:03.191 --> 00:40:04.780
<v Speaker 1>become corrupt or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or let's,</v>

631
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:05.643
<v Speaker 1>let's put it differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you know that any system that you </v>

632
00:40:07.811 --> 00:40:10.240
<v Speaker 1>happen to be embedded in has become </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>

633
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:11.463
<v Speaker 1>One way of assessing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>judging that is to determine for </v>

634
00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:19.120
<v Speaker 1>yourself whether or not you're allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say what you think.</v>

635
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.153
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can genuinely think something </v>

636
00:40:24.161 --> 00:40:26.410
<v Speaker 1>without it being right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

637
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:27.483
<v Speaker 1>But if you genuinely think something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your truth and you know in the </v>

638
00:40:31.151 --> 00:40:31.984
<v Speaker 1>marketplace of free ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is allowed to express their </v>

639
00:40:34.901 --> 00:40:37.000
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that doesn't mean everyone's right.</v>

640
00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:40.570
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that you have any right </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have people listen to you.</v>

641
00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.300
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't grant you any access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

642
00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:46.030
<v Speaker 1>but at least you get to say what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

643
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:49.180
<v Speaker 1>And if that's withheld from your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're punished for it.</v>

644
00:40:49.181 --> 00:40:50.014
<v Speaker 1>You can bloody well be certain that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system has started to take a vicious </v>

645
00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:54.424
<v Speaker 1>turn towards oppression and repression </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the outcome of that's going to </v>

646
00:40:58.001 --> 00:41:01.480
<v Speaker 1>be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if your thoughts are reprehensible,</v>

647
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.180
<v Speaker 1>you should be allowed to put them </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

648
00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.013
<v Speaker 1>Not least because the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>society needs to know where the </v>

649
00:41:07.721 --> 00:41:12.580
<v Speaker 1>dangerous wing nuts are so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the ideas can be brought up,</v>

650
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:15.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the open and disqualified,</v>

651
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so freedom of speech encompasses the </v>

652
00:41:18.071 --> 00:41:20.200
<v Speaker 1>freedom to say the most outrageous </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

653
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Just so everybody knows what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

654
00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.213
<v Speaker 1>Because if you can't say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you're not thinking </v>

655
00:41:26.261 --> 00:41:27.094
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to go underground and </v>

656
00:41:28.241 --> 00:41:31.660
<v Speaker 1>fester there like a Freudian repressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

657
00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:33.243
<v Speaker 1>So freedom speech has nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting the kind of speech that is </v>

658
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:40.460
<v Speaker 1>necessarily pro social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the opposite of that is you</v>

659
00:41:40.461 --> 00:41:43.310
<v Speaker 1>want everybody to say what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking because the end,</v>

660
00:41:43.311 --> 00:41:46.910
<v Speaker 1>you know what they're thinking and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>

661
00:41:46.911 --> 00:41:47.744
<v Speaker 1>and it's also often the case that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't come to the truth unless they're </v>

662
00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:54.530
<v Speaker 1>allowed to express their untruth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that,</v>

663
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized in the in public forums.</v>

664
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:03.850
<v Speaker 1>So Solzhenitsyn's conclusion was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no way that the terrors of the</v>

665
00:42:05.691 --> 00:42:06.524
<v Speaker 1>Soviet state could have got the foothold</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they got unless individual people </v>

666
00:42:10.581 --> 00:42:14.600
<v Speaker 1>were willing to falsify that nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own experience.</v>

667
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And in the Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he basically,</v>

668
00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.730
<v Speaker 1>he basically describes the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 2,700 pages long,</v>

669
00:42:22.731 --> 00:42:25.520
<v Speaker 1>this book and it's little tiny type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

670
00:42:25.521 --> 00:42:30.521
<v Speaker 1>very comprehensive examination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He basically shows you story after story</v>

671
00:42:32.391 --> 00:42:36.680
<v Speaker 1>tells you story after story of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>people falsified their experience in the</v>

672
00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:37.514
<v Speaker 1>service of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the story is basically something </v>

673
00:42:40.941 --> 00:42:43.130
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

674
00:42:43.131 --> 00:42:47.420
<v Speaker 1>this is what happens when you give your </v>
<v Speaker 1>God given sole over to human dogma.</v>

675
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.600
<v Speaker 1>So the basic idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

676
00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:51.434
<v Speaker 1>you're left and an you left in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sphere that it is is has the absence of </v>

677
00:42:56.721 --> 00:42:57.554
<v Speaker 1>a well defined meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a consequence of the collapse </v>

678
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:01.610
<v Speaker 1>of the previous belief systems.</v>

679
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:06.530
<v Speaker 1>And because you're torn apart by that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>

680
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.873
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where to turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one direction is of course </v>

681
00:43:09.741 --> 00:43:10.574
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other direction perhaps is </v>

682
00:43:12.231 --> 00:43:13.220
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

683
00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.353
<v Speaker 1>another direction might be that you try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure things out on your own and </v>

684
00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:21.440
<v Speaker 1>still live a life that's truthful and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

685
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:22.483
<v Speaker 1>and that has integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're going to leave that alone for </v>

686
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:25.184
<v Speaker 1>a moment because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to even conceptualize </v>

687
00:43:27.651 --> 00:43:28.484
<v Speaker 1>that might exist if you've already </v>
<v Speaker 1>swallowed the presupposition that all </v>

688
00:43:31.551 --> 00:43:35.300
<v Speaker 1>the values have fallen apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You turn to totalitarianism.</v>

689
00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:36.134
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it tells you what to think and it </v>

690
00:43:37.611 --> 00:43:38.444
<v Speaker 1>tells you how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tells you how your society should be </v>

691
00:43:40.311 --> 00:43:41.144
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does some things that are even </v>

692
00:43:43.641 --> 00:43:44.474
<v Speaker 1>more subtle and subtly destructive than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because what it also does is </v>

693
00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:50.084
<v Speaker 1>positive future utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an organization of the state </v>

694
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:57.740
<v Speaker 1>where everyone has everything they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently.</v>

695
00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Now Dostoyevsky when he wrote notes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>underground,</v>

696
00:44:01.191 --> 00:44:02.420
<v Speaker 1>he basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

697
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:04.700
<v Speaker 1>this was way before the communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

698
00:44:04.701 --> 00:44:08.300
<v Speaker 1>He said he was talking about these sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Utopian,</v>

699
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian communitarians.</v>

700
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:15.560
<v Speaker 1>He said they've got human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely wrong,</v>

701
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.480
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right from the bottom up.</v>

702
00:44:17.481 --> 00:44:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Because if you took the typical person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

703
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.720
<v Speaker 1>if you gave them everything they </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly want to,</v>

704
00:44:22.721 --> 00:44:23.554
<v Speaker 1>to eat so that all they had to ever do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is eat delicious cakes and they didn't </v>

705
00:44:26.451 --> 00:44:29.840
<v Speaker 1>have any other responsibilities than </v>
<v Speaker 1>what did he say,</v>

706
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.033
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indulging in the continuation of the </v>

707
00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:33.954
<v Speaker 1>human species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that if they were so happy that </v>

708
00:44:36.571 --> 00:44:39.600
<v Speaker 1>if you put them under water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but bubbles of bliss would float</v>

709
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:40.434
<v Speaker 1>up to the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that people who were </v>

710
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:47.430
<v Speaker 1>putting in that situation would do would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be to wander around smashing things just</v>

711
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:50.190
<v Speaker 1>so that something unexpected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting would happen.</v>

712
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:51.743
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a brilliant critique of utopianism </v>

713
00:44:53.611 --> 00:44:54.444
<v Speaker 1>because it's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he basically Dostoyevsky said </v>

714
00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.373
<v Speaker 1>people are so crazy that they'd rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>be subjected to inconvenient and </v>

715
00:45:05.341 --> 00:45:10.341
<v Speaker 1>unexpected occurrences than just to lay </v>
<v Speaker 1>there all soporific with bliss.</v>

716
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:11.543
<v Speaker 1>And so that there was something wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the whole utopia notion right from </v>

717
00:45:14.761 --> 00:45:17.370
<v Speaker 1>the get go because that's just not what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are like.</v>

718
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:22.140
<v Speaker 1>They'd rather have interesting trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>than non interesting perfection,</v>

719
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:23.633
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's an incredibly </v>

720
00:45:24.361 --> 00:45:26.370
<v Speaker 1>powerful idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

721
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:30.330
<v Speaker 1>you can just think about that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to your own character.</v>

722
00:45:30.331 --> 00:45:31.164
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often do you do something that's </v>

723
00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:34.380
<v Speaker 1>troubled just to see what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

724
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.260
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly what people are like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

725
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.830
<v Speaker 1>even chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>juvenile champs,</v>

726
00:45:40.831 --> 00:45:43.830
<v Speaker 1>if they see an old male sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the tree,</v>

727
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.100
<v Speaker 1>they'll go and poke them with a stick </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to see what happens,</v>

728
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:47.850
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

729
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:48.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

730
00:45:48.721 --> 00:45:51.570
<v Speaker 1>if you can't see human humanity and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of behavior,</v>

731
00:45:51.571 --> 00:45:53.880
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

732
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.790
<v Speaker 1>but the utopians offered this vision of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>

733
00:45:56.791 --> 00:45:57.624
<v Speaker 1>which was basically paradise on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also proposed that it was </v>

734
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:03.360
<v Speaker 1>something that could be attained through</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain types of,</v>

735
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct political action,</v>

736
00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:08.940
<v Speaker 1>which usually meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fix your neighbor up or even worse,</v>

737
00:46:08.941 --> 00:46:11.850
<v Speaker 1>man steal what he has because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have it anyways.</v>

738
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.983
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with the Utopian Vision </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially was that if my theory is </v>

739
00:46:17.131 --> 00:46:19.860
<v Speaker 1>associated with a future utopian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a logical way,</v>

740
00:46:19.861 --> 00:46:20.694
<v Speaker 1>so I can make a case to you that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do this and we do that and they do this </v>

741
00:46:24.451 --> 00:46:25.284
<v Speaker 1>and we organizing things this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll our shear in a period of </v>

742
00:46:28.561 --> 00:46:33.060
<v Speaker 1>prosperity that's almost heavenly in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>in its promise.</v>

743
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.670
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is it means we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do any bloody thing,</v>

744
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.533
<v Speaker 1>bloody thing we want right now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end product is so valuable that it </v>

745
00:46:39.721 --> 00:46:40.554
<v Speaker 1>justifies it.</v>

746
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:41.783
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that the Utopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision turns into a rationale for the </v>

747
00:46:45.361 --> 00:46:49.770
<v Speaker 1>most destructive forms of behavior in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the here and now.</v>

748
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.020
<v Speaker 1>And then when someone's called to task </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

749
00:46:52.021 --> 00:46:53.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you think you're doing?</v>

750
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:55.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say something like,</v>

751
00:46:55.651 --> 00:46:56.484
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't make an omelet without </v>

752
00:46:57.451 --> 00:46:59.670
<v Speaker 1>breaking eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

753
00:46:59.671 --> 00:47:02.460
<v Speaker 1>and that's all well and good if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to be making the Omelet,</v>

754
00:47:02.461 --> 00:47:05.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's not so damn good if you happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be one of the eggs.</v>

755
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:08.760
<v Speaker 1>And there were plenty of eggs broken on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to,</v>

756
00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:12.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet vision of success while,</v>

757
00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:14.790
<v Speaker 1>and you know there's good evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>stolen.</v>

758
00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:15.624
<v Speaker 1>By the time the mid 1950s came around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's pretty decent evidence from the </v>

759
00:47:20.911 --> 00:47:21.744
<v Speaker 1>KGB archives that he was preparing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>launch a thermonuclear war against </v>

760
00:47:25.441 --> 00:47:26.131
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

761
00:47:26.131 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 1>he'd already killed God only knows how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many million by that point,</v>

762
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.520
<v Speaker 1>a few more hundred million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're really going to weigh that heavily</v>

763
00:47:33.521 --> 00:47:36.880
<v Speaker 1>on his conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last book I read on stolen,</v>

764
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.180
<v Speaker 1>which was published,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was called stolen.</v>

765
00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:45.181
<v Speaker 1>It was written by a guy who had access </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the KGB and Communist Party archives.</v>

766
00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:46.803
<v Speaker 1>He claimed that Khrushchev and three </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people killed Stellan in the late </v>

767
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:54.310
<v Speaker 1>1950s to stop him from invading Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

768
00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:55.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the battle between the communist </v>

769
00:47:59.551 --> 00:48:00.384
<v Speaker 1>utopians and the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we came this close to wiping everything </v>

770
00:48:02.951 --> 00:48:04.570
<v Speaker 1>out several times.</v>

771
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:06.223
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

772
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.650
<v Speaker 1>now what happened in some sense was </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

773
00:48:11.651 --> 00:48:15.040
<v Speaker 1>is that this theory was laid out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover the world.</v>

774
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:15.874
<v Speaker 1>So the Marxist theory was presented </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself as a scientific theory and </v>

775
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:20.343
<v Speaker 1>inevitable theory of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the theory of history was that the </v>

776
00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:29.440
<v Speaker 1>warfare between the oppressed and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressor was the primary fact of life.</v>

777
00:48:29.441 --> 00:48:34.441
<v Speaker 1>And that that needed to transform itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a egalitarian utopia.</v>

778
00:48:35.081 --> 00:48:39.550
<v Speaker 1>And that there were certain states that </v>
<v Speaker 1>political states that mankind would have</v>

779
00:48:39.551 --> 00:48:42.070
<v Speaker 1>to go through to reach that end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

780
00:48:42.071 --> 00:48:46.390
<v Speaker 1>So that was basically the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the theory was that in order</v>

781
00:48:46.391 --> 00:48:47.224
<v Speaker 1>to get to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then resources had to be distributed </v>

782
00:48:49.661 --> 00:48:52.540
<v Speaker 1>equally to all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sounds fine in principle.</v>

783
00:48:52.541 --> 00:48:53.374
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the devil's always in the details and </v>

784
00:48:55.930 --> 00:49:00.930
<v Speaker 1>how to distribute resources equally is </v>
<v Speaker 1>by no means self evident.</v>

785
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that the English came</v>

786
00:49:03.491 --> 00:49:07.120
<v Speaker 1>up with the idea of the free market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Adam Smith fundamentally,</v>

787
00:49:07.121 --> 00:49:07.954
<v Speaker 1>is because Smith figured out that trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what things were worth is </v>

788
00:49:13.331 --> 00:49:16.810
<v Speaker 1>so complicated that you can't actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculate it.</v>

789
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.940
<v Speaker 1>So then we would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

790
00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:21.400
<v Speaker 1>what's your coat worth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>

791
00:49:21.401 --> 00:49:24.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you give me your code for $5</v>

792
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:31.510
<v Speaker 1>$2</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollars okay,</v>

793
00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:32.481
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

794
00:49:32.481 --> 00:49:35.030
<v Speaker 1>but to say the point being is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

795
00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.740
<v Speaker 1>there's no way of establishing the worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things because the worth of one thing</v>

796
00:49:39.741 --> 00:49:44.120
<v Speaker 1>is it's worth in relationship to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things of worth.</v>

797
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a continual interaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between all things of worth.</v>

798
00:49:48.081 --> 00:49:52.490
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you can make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculation is by letting people,</v>

799
00:49:52.491 --> 00:49:53.324
<v Speaker 1>individual people make micro choices and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the value of things is established </v>

800
00:49:58.101 --> 00:50:00.980
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of a hundred billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro choices.</v>

801
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.113
<v Speaker 1>We'd call that in the modern world would</v>
<v Speaker 1>call something that something that's </v>

802
00:50:04.491 --> 00:50:07.730
<v Speaker 1>something like distributed cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

803
00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:11.120
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're outsourcing a price </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision to the marketplace.</v>

804
00:50:11.121 --> 00:50:11.954
<v Speaker 1>What's this thing worth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the answer is whatever people will </v>

805
00:50:15.051 --> 00:50:18.460
<v Speaker 1>trade for it and it's not a copout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

806
00:50:18.461 --> 00:50:19.294
<v Speaker 1>it's an illustration indication of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that you can't come up with a </v>

807
00:50:22.761 --> 00:50:26.270
<v Speaker 1>computation that will allow you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine what something is worth.</v>

808
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:27.853
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example of that from </v>

809
00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:33.680
<v Speaker 1>my own life trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>something is worth.</v>

810
00:50:33.681 --> 00:50:34.514
<v Speaker 1>I developed some software to help people</v>
<v Speaker 1>hire employees and we did the </v>

811
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:40.964
<v Speaker 1>mathematical calculations and figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that if people use this particular </v>

812
00:50:44.091 --> 00:50:48.560
<v Speaker 1>software instead of going through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview process,</v>

813
00:50:48.561 --> 00:50:51.680
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't work very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would basically,</v>

814
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.843
<v Speaker 1>if they used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they gave it to 10 people to select </v>

815
00:50:55.731 --> 00:51:00.731
<v Speaker 1>one employee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would save them about 35% of the</v>

816
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:01.843
<v Speaker 1>salary of the hired person per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you hired someone who was being </v>

817
00:51:06.621 --> 00:51:11.621
<v Speaker 1>paid $100,000 then the return on </v>
<v Speaker 1>investment would be $35,000 a year.</v>

818
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:15.650
<v Speaker 1>And we could sell this for say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

819
00:51:15.651 --> 00:51:16.484
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much do you charge for the tests </v>

820
00:51:18.291 --> 00:51:19.190
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

821
00:51:19.191 --> 00:51:21.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's $35,000 a year,</v>

822
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:23.630
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have this person around </v>
<v Speaker 1>for four years,</v>

823
00:51:23.631 --> 00:51:26.210
<v Speaker 1>because that's how long the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>person stays in their job.</v>

824
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:31.450
<v Speaker 1>That's $150,000 and so then you only </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to use 10 tests.</v>

825
00:51:32.241 --> 00:51:35.150
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe we could take a half of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first year,</v>

826
00:51:35.151 --> 00:51:39.110
<v Speaker 1>so that'd be $17,000 so it'd be $1,750 a</v>
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>

827
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:40.303
<v Speaker 1>And you'd get like a 30 what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get an eight times return on your </v>

828
00:51:43.941 --> 00:51:47.000
<v Speaker 1>investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you should be just jumping at that.</v>

829
00:51:47.001 --> 00:51:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work like that at all.</v>

830
00:51:48.621 --> 00:51:49.454
<v Speaker 1>We ended up having to sell it for about </v>
<v Speaker 1>$20 a test and we could hardly sell it </v>

831
00:51:52.131 --> 00:51:52.964
<v Speaker 1>to anyone because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that are far too complex to </v>

832
00:51:56.151 --> 00:51:56.984
<v Speaker 1>go into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point is is that it's impossible </v>

833
00:52:01.371 --> 00:52:04.310
<v Speaker 1>to make a pricing decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

834
00:52:04.311 --> 00:52:05.144
<v Speaker 1>really difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to think that you could make a </v>

835
00:52:07.251 --> 00:52:08.084
<v Speaker 1>conscious and preprogrammed pricing </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision for every single commodity is </v>

836
00:52:13.881 --> 00:52:14.714
<v Speaker 1>completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what they tried to do in the </v>

837
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I read at one point that the central</v>

838
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:24.020
<v Speaker 1>price pricing committee had to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000 pricing decisions a day.</v>

839
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Well you can't even come up with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>price of one.</v>

840
00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.940
<v Speaker 1>You've put things on Kijiji,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

841
00:52:28.941 --> 00:52:29.541
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

842
00:52:29.541 --> 00:52:30.374
<v Speaker 1>what's it worth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you look at what everyone else is </v>

843
00:52:32.091 --> 00:52:33.860
<v Speaker 1>paying for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

844
00:52:33.861 --> 00:52:34.694
<v Speaker 1>and then it depends on how quickly you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to sell it and what kind of shape </v>

845
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:37.904
<v Speaker 1>it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know it's complicated and you </v>

846
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:42.860
<v Speaker 1>have a pricing guideline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to look the damn thing up.</v>

847
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.050
<v Speaker 1>It's still hard to figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>price is.</v>

848
00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.050
<v Speaker 1>But imagine you have no comparative </v>
<v Speaker 1>information at all.</v>

849
00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:51.620
<v Speaker 1>What's a hypodermic needle worth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

850
00:52:51.621 --> 00:52:54.820
<v Speaker 1>I guess it depends on whether you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to inject the penicillin that's going</v>

851
00:52:54.821 --> 00:52:57.860
<v Speaker 1>to save your life or if you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting it in your cupboard to store it,</v>

852
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:01.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's a complicated decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

853
00:53:01.161 --> 00:53:05.060
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Utopian scheme was set up and we're</v>

854
00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:05.953
<v Speaker 1>acting on the proposition that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>used it at least in part as a </v>

855
00:53:09.081 --> 00:53:12.230
<v Speaker 1>replacement for their alternative for </v>
<v Speaker 1>their old belief systems,</v>

856
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:14.960
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition,</v>

857
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.153
<v Speaker 1>but we're also going to take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic approach and we're going </v>

858
00:53:18.321 --> 00:53:19.154
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

859
00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.053
<v Speaker 1>it also allowed people to manifest bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith because if you're worth can be </v>

860
00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:30.030
<v Speaker 1>determined by how good a car you are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fascist or communist machinery,</v>

861
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.660
<v Speaker 1>it pretty much alleviates you have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that you have to have for</v>

862
00:53:33.661 --> 00:53:34.590
<v Speaker 1>your own life.</v>

863
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.580
<v Speaker 1>So that for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for every positive reason that you might</v>

864
00:53:38.581 --> 00:53:39.414
<v Speaker 1>join a utopian movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a negative reason which as well </v>

865
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:43.163
<v Speaker 1>you can benefit from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exploitive nature and you don't </v>

866
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:45.924
<v Speaker 1>have to take any responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Solzhenitsyn and Frankl both </v>

867
00:53:49.981 --> 00:53:52.290
<v Speaker 1>talked about that a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as did Nisha,</v>

868
00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:53.124
<v Speaker 1>but Franklin soldier knits and are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because they actually </v>

869
00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:56.634
<v Speaker 1>happened to live through the imposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of systems like that and could see them </v>

870
00:54:00.181 --> 00:54:01.014
<v Speaker 1>from the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn's first observation was </v>

871
00:54:04.201 --> 00:54:05.034
<v Speaker 1>Marxist economics didn't work well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a big problem because it was </v>

872
00:54:10.141 --> 00:54:12.510
<v Speaker 1>supposed to work and not only was it </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to work,</v>

873
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.553
<v Speaker 1>it was supposed to work perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that basically meant was that </v>

874
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 1>if it didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only had one of two options.</v>

875
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:21.653
<v Speaker 1>You could either abandon the dam system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and start to complain about the fact </v>

876
00:54:24.421 --> 00:54:26.760
<v Speaker 1>that you had to line up for bread for </v>
<v Speaker 1>four hours a day,</v>

877
00:54:26.761 --> 00:54:31.200
<v Speaker 1>which was perfectly typical daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity for people.</v>

878
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.033
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Poland and in Russia before the wall </v>

879
00:54:34.021 --> 00:54:34.854
<v Speaker 1>came down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything costs nothing but there </v>

880
00:54:36.451 --> 00:54:39.780
<v Speaker 1>wasn't anything to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't very much of a bargain.</v>

881
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And instead of paying for your bread </v>
<v Speaker 1>with money,</v>

882
00:54:42.121 --> 00:54:43.710
<v Speaker 1>you just paid for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With time.</v>

883
00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:47.340
<v Speaker 1>You stayed in line for two hours or </v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours or five hours.</v>

884
00:54:47.341 --> 00:54:50.280
<v Speaker 1>And when you got to the front of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line at the department store,</v>

885
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:53.490
<v Speaker 1>you took whatever the hell was there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you didn't even know what it was</v>

886
00:54:53.491 --> 00:54:55.770
<v Speaker 1>that you were going to be buying when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you joined the lineup.</v>

887
00:54:56.250 --> 00:55:00.420
<v Speaker 1>And so it wasn't like it was free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had just paid for it with your time.</v>

888
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:02.633
<v Speaker 1>So soldier knits and noted that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened as the system continued to </v>

889
00:55:06.421 --> 00:55:07.254
<v Speaker 1>manifest it's counterproductive </v>
<v Speaker 1>properties was that either people had </v>

890
00:55:10.291 --> 00:55:12.000
<v Speaker 1>the choice of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

891
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:12.953
<v Speaker 1>this isn't working worth a damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There must be something rotten in </v>

892
00:55:15.781 --> 00:55:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Denmark or pretending that everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>was all right in lying about everything.</v>

893
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:24.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lied about everything.</v>

894
00:55:24.151 --> 00:55:27.270
<v Speaker 1>And so we've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the situation up to the point</v>

895
00:55:27.271 --> 00:55:30.030
<v Speaker 1>where in East Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the wall came down,</v>

896
00:55:30.031 --> 00:55:34.170
<v Speaker 1>one out of every three people was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>government informer stop man.</v>

897
00:55:34.171 --> 00:55:35.004
<v Speaker 1>If you had a family of six people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two of them were telling the government </v>

898
00:55:37.501 --> 00:55:41.460
<v Speaker 1>what you were talking about at dinner </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was their duty.</v>

899
00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:42.683
<v Speaker 1>And so what that meant in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies was no one ever said anything </v>

900
00:55:45.331 --> 00:55:48.960
<v Speaker 1>that they meant ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they did the probability that the</v>

901
00:55:48.961 --> 00:55:53.730
<v Speaker 1>KGB was going to kick down the door at </v>
<v Speaker 1>four in the morning and take them off to</v>

902
00:55:53.731 --> 00:55:57.270
<v Speaker 1>the central prison before dumping them </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some damn camp where they'd never see</v>

903
00:55:57.271 --> 00:56:00.630
<v Speaker 1>anybody they ever knew for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their life was extraordinarily high.</v>

904
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.490
<v Speaker 1>So you watched everything you said and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you thought around your wife,</v>

905
00:56:05.491 --> 00:56:07.500
<v Speaker 1>around your brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around your sister,</v>

906
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.513
<v Speaker 1>around your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole system ground onward in a </v>

907
00:56:12.961 --> 00:56:17.961
<v Speaker 1>mire of absolute deception and lie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldier knits his point as well.</v>

908
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:22.290
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of Frankel's main </v>
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>

909
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:27.291
<v Speaker 1>is that if people had had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people had decided to stop lying,</v>

910
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.840
<v Speaker 1>the system would have ground to a halt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what people did.</v>

911
00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:35.710
<v Speaker 1>They just kept lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he noticed when he was in the prison</v>

912
00:56:35.711 --> 00:56:37.720
<v Speaker 1>camps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was in them for a long time.</v>

913
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:41.500
<v Speaker 1>He did encounter people inside the camps</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Frankl did,</v>

914
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:45.370
<v Speaker 1>who were absolutely unwilling to falsify</v>
<v Speaker 1>their experience.</v>

915
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:46.503
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that had to happen if </v>

916
00:56:48.131 --> 00:56:48.964
<v Speaker 1>you were arrested by the kgb and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentenced to a prison camp was that it </v>

917
00:56:52.061 --> 00:56:54.730
<v Speaker 1>was necessary for you to sign a </v>
<v Speaker 1>confession.</v>

918
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:56.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's so peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

919
00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:57.943
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to arrest the arbitrarily </v>

920
00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:03.610
<v Speaker 1>and put you on trial for trumped up </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

921
00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Why couldn't they just forge your </v>
<v Speaker 1>signature?</v>

922
00:57:06.671 --> 00:57:08.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did they care if you confessed?</v>

923
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:10.630
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

924
00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:11.883
<v Speaker 1>it was part of the way the system kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself validated because the people who </v>

925
00:57:14.681 --> 00:57:15.514
<v Speaker 1>were torturing you could justify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>torture if you agreed that you are </v>

926
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:19.720
<v Speaker 1>actually at fault.</v>

927
00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:23.770
<v Speaker 1>And so rather than face the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just doing something corrupt,</v>

928
00:57:23.771 --> 00:57:24.604
<v Speaker 1>innocent people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd extract a confession out of use </v>

929
00:57:26.821 --> 00:57:30.790
<v Speaker 1>so that they could convince themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you deserved exactly what you got.</v>

930
00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:35.860
<v Speaker 1>A soldier in Edson said at one time that</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person who stopped lying could bring</v>

931
00:57:35.861 --> 00:57:36.910
<v Speaker 1>down a tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

932
00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:39.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty radical statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

933
00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:40.383
<v Speaker 1>when he wrote the Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he memorized that damn book when </v>

934
00:57:44.141 --> 00:57:44.974
<v Speaker 1>he was in one of the prison camps </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't give him pencil or </v>

935
00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if they did,</v>

936
00:57:49.601 --> 00:57:52.120
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't have been able to carry </v>
<v Speaker 1>the damn manuscript around.</v>

937
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.960
<v Speaker 1>So he basically memorized at 2,700 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pages,</v>

938
00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:57.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>written at the volume of a very loud </v>

939
00:57:59.231 --> 00:58:01.930
<v Speaker 1>scream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he got out of the prison camps,</v>

940
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:06.940
<v Speaker 1>he had two copies of it typed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one by one typist in one by another.</v>

941
00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:10.300
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The KGB broke into the one type is Soman</v>

942
00:58:10.301 --> 00:58:12.370
<v Speaker 1>stole the manuscript and she killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>

943
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

944
00:58:13.961 --> 00:58:15.440
<v Speaker 1>and you can understand why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

945
00:58:15.441 --> 00:58:16.274
<v Speaker 1>when she thought this was a tremendously</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable piece of work and she thought </v>

946
00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:21.700
<v Speaker 1>it was the only copy and they destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

947
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't even tell her that there was</v>

948
00:58:24.311 --> 00:58:26.590
<v Speaker 1>another one because they would have got </v>
<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>

949
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.113
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was exported to the West in </v>

950
00:58:30.041 --> 00:58:33.010
<v Speaker 1>unpublished forum and published in </v>
<v Speaker 1>English to begin with.</v>

951
00:58:33.011 --> 00:58:38.011
<v Speaker 1>And it was an absolute bomb shell like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was published in 1974 was at that</v>

952
00:58:39.671 --> 00:58:40.504
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who had any moral integrity </v>

953
00:58:41.891 --> 00:58:44.080
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was also literate,</v>

954
00:58:44.081 --> 00:58:45.250
<v Speaker 1>read that and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

955
00:58:45.251 --> 00:58:48.400
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>game over all those propositions.</v>

956
00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.473
<v Speaker 1>They're wrong beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that part of what we thought might </v>

957
00:58:53.891 --> 00:58:56.650
<v Speaker 1>be possible is done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

958
00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:58.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened to some degree.</v>

959
00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:02.260
<v Speaker 1>It communism lost a tremendous amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its intellectual credibility.</v>

960
00:59:02.261 --> 00:59:06.070
<v Speaker 1>And that was part of the reason that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>fell over in 1989 but you know,</v>

961
00:59:06.071 --> 00:59:07.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not like everybody has shaken </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

962
00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:08.933
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if everyone's faith in that </v>

963
00:59:10.661 --> 00:59:13.210
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing is being shaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

964
00:59:13.211 --> 00:59:14.044
<v Speaker 1>there's this massive stream of Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>utopianism that's still running through </v>

965
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:19.650
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

966
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made its way to Western universities all</v>

967
00:59:22.161 --> 00:59:25.580
<v Speaker 1>over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So despite all of this,</v>

968
00:59:25.581 --> 00:59:30.581
<v Speaker 1>despite these tens of millions of deaths</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this total moral corruption,</v>

969
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:31.843
<v Speaker 1>and no one even knows about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't understand that it's </v>

970
00:59:35.361 --> 00:59:39.410
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely unacceptable.</v>

971
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 1>It's the biggest lesson of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

972
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:43.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we hear a lot about the Holocaust </v>

973
00:59:44.931 --> 00:59:47.270
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder it was a truly terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

974
00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:48.493
<v Speaker 1>But there's all these other events of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century that were absolutely </v>

975
00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:56.540
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic and they're not part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>general knowledge.</v>

976
00:59:56.570 --> 01:00:01.340
<v Speaker 1>And you have to ask yourself why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if we can't learn from that,</v>

977
01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.773
<v Speaker 1>if we can't learn from all those tens of</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people who were tortured to </v>

978
01:00:06.261 --> 01:00:07.550
<v Speaker 1>death and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

979
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ruined in political prisons,</v>

980
01:00:10.341 --> 01:00:13.280
<v Speaker 1>like you gotta ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we actually learn anything?</v>

981
01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read you some of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Solzhenitsyn wrote.</v>

982
01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:28.580
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't say the name of this person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in,</v>

983
01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:29.493
<v Speaker 1>it's in dashes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone he meant he met either in a </v>

984
01:00:33.611 --> 01:00:34.444
<v Speaker 1>camper afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told how executions were carried out </v>

985
01:00:37.691 --> 01:00:40.510
<v Speaker 1>at a dock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a camp on the [inaudible] river.</v>

986
01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:41.853
<v Speaker 1>They would take the opposition members </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their things out of the camp </v>

987
01:00:45.281 --> 01:00:49.930
<v Speaker 1>compound on a prisoner transport at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night and outside the compound stood the</v>

988
01:00:49.931 --> 01:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>small house of the third section.</v>

989
01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

990
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:58.390
<v Speaker 1>These were people who were opposing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist ideology.</v>

991
01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.410
<v Speaker 1>The condemned men were taken into a room</v>
<v Speaker 1>one at a time and they're,</v>

992
01:01:02.411 --> 01:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>the camp guard sprang on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their mouths were stuffed with something</v>

993
01:01:05.981 --> 01:01:09.040
<v Speaker 1>soft and their arms are bound with cords</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind their backs.</v>

994
01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.533
<v Speaker 1>Then they were led out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>courtyard where harnessed carts were </v>

995
01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:13.294
<v Speaker 1>waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bound prisoners were piled on the </v>

996
01:01:15.761 --> 01:01:19.180
<v Speaker 1>carts five to seven at a time and driven</v>
<v Speaker 1>off to the Gorkha,</v>

997
01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:20.253
<v Speaker 1>the camp cemetery on arrival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were tipped into big pits that had </v>

998
01:01:23.801 --> 01:01:28.570
<v Speaker 1>already been prepared and buried alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not out of brutality.</v>

999
01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:29.943
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had been calculated than would </v>

1000
01:01:32.081 --> 01:01:32.914
<v Speaker 1>dragging and lifting the mood was much </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier and more efficient to cope with </v>

1001
01:01:35.501 --> 01:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>living people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then with corpses,</v>

1002
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:42.190
<v Speaker 1>the work went on for many nights at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dock and that is how the moral political</v>

1003
01:01:42.191 --> 01:01:44.110
<v Speaker 1>unity of our party was achieved.</v>

1004
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1005
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:46.633
<v Speaker 1>This is from Frankel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the concentration camps in Nazi </v>

1006
01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:50.534
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

1007
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1008
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>These.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were the size of cities,</v>

1009
01:01:54.361 --> 01:01:55.260
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1010
01:01:55.261 --> 01:01:56.094
<v Speaker 1>when you think of camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what image it brings up in </v>

1011
01:01:58.291 --> 01:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1012
01:01:59.611 --> 01:02:03.000
<v Speaker 1>you might think of an enclosure the size</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a city block or something like that,</v>

1013
01:02:03.001 --> 01:02:06.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These places where the size of cities,</v>

1014
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>because there was tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in them.</v>

1015
01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:09.983
<v Speaker 1>The most ghastly moment of the 24 hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>of camp life was the awakening when Adh </v>

1016
01:02:13.921 --> 01:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>is still nocturnal hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three shrill blows of a whistle,</v>

1017
01:02:16.981 --> 01:02:17.814
<v Speaker 1>Taurus pitiless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leigh fermor exhausted and from the </v>

1018
01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:20.634
<v Speaker 1>longings in our dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We then began the tussle with our wet </v>

1019
01:02:23.851 --> 01:02:26.340
<v Speaker 1>shoes into which we could scarcely force</v>
<v Speaker 1>our feet,</v>

1020
01:02:26.341 --> 01:02:27.174
<v Speaker 1>which were sore and swollen with edema,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were the usual moans and </v>

1021
01:02:30.841 --> 01:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>groans about petty troubles such as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snapping of wires,</v>

1022
01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>which replaced shoe laces.</v>

1023
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:37.043
<v Speaker 1>One morning I heard someone who my new </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be brave and dignified cry like a </v>

1024
01:02:40.441 --> 01:02:41.274
<v Speaker 1>child because he finally had to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the snowy marching grounds in his bare </v>

1025
01:02:44.611 --> 01:02:45.444
<v Speaker 1>feet as his shoes were too shrunk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for him to wear in these ghastly </v>

1026
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a little bit of comfort,</v>

1027
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.433
<v Speaker 1>a small piece of bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I draw out of my pocket and </v>

1028
01:02:54.631 --> 01:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>munched with absorbed delight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is soldier Knutsen.</v>

1029
01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.810
<v Speaker 1>So in these camps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were set out to work and it would</v>

1030
01:03:03.811 --> 01:03:06.300
<v Speaker 1>depend on where they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were working on,</v>

1031
01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:07.134
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it was the digging of a canal </v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe they were setting up a factory </v>

1032
01:03:09.931 --> 01:03:10.764
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they were doing something that </v>

1033
01:03:13.141 --> 01:03:17.280
<v Speaker 1>required the generally required intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical effort</v>

1034
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:22.620
<v Speaker 1>and each of these camps had a ha they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a,</v>

1035
01:03:22.621 --> 01:03:25.140
<v Speaker 1>a goal right there was established from </v>
<v Speaker 1>above.</v>

1036
01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:26.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like a five year plan.</v>

1037
01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Your camp is to produce this much in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this period of time.</v>

1038
01:03:29.521 --> 01:03:32.040
<v Speaker 1>And then if you didn't produce that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that period of time,</v>

1039
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:35.220
<v Speaker 1>then the people who ran the camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be held accountable,</v>

1040
01:03:35.221 --> 01:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>which generally meant that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be put in some camp themselves.</v>

1041
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:39.833
<v Speaker 1>And so there was every reason to drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to their death in order to </v>

1042
01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:44.580
<v Speaker 1>fulfill the work norms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when that didn't happen,</v>

1043
01:03:44.581 --> 01:03:48.030
<v Speaker 1>they just falsified the records anyways </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what the hell was their choice?</v>

1044
01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.900
<v Speaker 1>And Solzhenitsyn talks about how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>got around the rules</v>

1045
01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:58.460
<v Speaker 1>in called lower than 60 degrees below </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero days were written off.</v>

1046
01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:01.620
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on such days,</v>

1047
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:05.310
<v Speaker 1>the record showed that the workers have </v>
<v Speaker 1>not gone out to work well.</v>

1048
01:04:05.311 --> 01:04:09.480
<v Speaker 1>So then you can tell a bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolence of the Soviet state.</v>

1049
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:13.200
<v Speaker 1>If it was 55 below,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you could go out to work,</v>

1050
01:04:13.201 --> 01:04:15.630
<v Speaker 1>but if it was 60 below,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to stay home.</v>

1051
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.990
<v Speaker 1>While that isn't even how it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1052
01:04:18.991 --> 01:04:19.824
<v Speaker 1>on 60 below days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the record showed that the workers had </v>

1053
01:04:21.721 --> 01:04:22.554
<v Speaker 1>not gone to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they chased them out anyways and </v>

1054
01:04:25.321 --> 01:04:28.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever they squeezed out of them on </v>
<v Speaker 1>those days was added to the other days.</v>

1055
01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:29.873
<v Speaker 1>Thereby raising the percentages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>underserved biomedical section road off </v>

1056
01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:37.350
<v Speaker 1>those who froze to death on such cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>days on some other basis,</v>

1057
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:38.453
<v Speaker 1>and the ones who were left who could no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer walk and we're straining every </v>

1058
01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:44.040
<v Speaker 1>sinew to crawl along and all fours on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way back to camp,</v>

1059
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:45.023
<v Speaker 1>the convoy simply shot so that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't escape before they could come </v>

1060
01:04:47.821 --> 01:04:51.060
<v Speaker 1>back to get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>skeleton.</v>

1061
01:04:51.061 --> 01:04:51.894
<v Speaker 1>Had a group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of people dig a </v>

1062
01:04:55.231 --> 01:05:00.000
<v Speaker 1>canal in the 1930s and I unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the name of the canal,</v>

1063
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:01.253
<v Speaker 1>but some 300,000 people froze to death </v>
<v Speaker 1>digging it with spades and shovels in </v>

1064
01:05:06.631 --> 01:05:08.190
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the Russian winter.</v>

1065
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.370
<v Speaker 1>And when it was finished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so shallow that none of the ships</v>

1066
01:05:11.371 --> 01:05:13.740
<v Speaker 1>that were planned to go up and down it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could use it,</v>

1067
01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 1>but it got finished even though it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the winter.</v>

1068
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.280
<v Speaker 1>This is from William Blake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh rose,</v>

1069
01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:22.203
<v Speaker 1>thou art sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The invisible worm that flies in the </v>

1070
01:05:24.941 --> 01:05:25.774
<v Speaker 1>night and the howling storm have found </v>
<v Speaker 1>out diabet of crimson joy and his dark </v>

1071
01:05:30.431 --> 01:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love does die.</v>

1072
01:05:31.811 --> 01:05:32.644
<v Speaker 1>Life destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is another story from social nets </v>

1073
01:05:36.721 --> 01:05:37.554
<v Speaker 1>in about a women's camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's standing in another camp watching </v>

1074
01:05:41.591 --> 01:05:45.040
<v Speaker 1>this occur because the women of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>were put into camp separate from the man</v>

1075
01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire,</v>

1076
01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:50.350
<v Speaker 1>the branches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crackle,</v>

1077
01:05:50.351 --> 01:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>and the night wind of late autumn blows </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flame of the bonfire back and forth.</v>

1078
01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:55.443
<v Speaker 1>The compound is dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm alone at the bar and fire and I can </v>

1079
01:05:59.621 --> 01:06:02.110
<v Speaker 1>bring it still some more carpenter </v>
<v Speaker 1>shavings.</v>

1080
01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:06.490
<v Speaker 1>The compound that I man is a privileged </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1081
01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:10.090
<v Speaker 1>so privileged that it is almost as if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>were out in freedom.</v>

1082
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:15.390
<v Speaker 1>This is an island of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the Marfino [inaudible],</v>

1083
01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:16.773
<v Speaker 1>which was a scientific institutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>staffed with prisoners in its most </v>

1084
01:06:21.071 --> 01:06:24.460
<v Speaker 1>privileged period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one is overseeing me,</v>

1085
01:06:24.461 --> 01:06:27.730
<v Speaker 1>calling me to a cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing me away from the bonfire.</v>

1086
01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.570
<v Speaker 1>And even then it is chilly in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>penetrating wind,</v>

1087
01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:36.130
<v Speaker 1>but she who has already been standing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wind for hours,</v>

1088
01:06:36.131 --> 01:06:38.590
<v Speaker 1>her arms straight down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her head drooping,</v>

1089
01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:41.140
<v Speaker 1>weeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then growing numb and still,</v>

1090
01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:44.380
<v Speaker 1>and then again she begs pityingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen chief,</v>

1091
01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:46.660
<v Speaker 1>please forgive me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't do it again.</v>

1092
01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:51.460
<v Speaker 1>The wind carries her moan to me just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>if she were moaning next to my ear.</v>

1093
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:57.150
<v Speaker 1>The citizen chief at the gate house </v>
<v Speaker 1>fires up his stove and does not answer.</v>

1094
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:58.263
<v Speaker 1>This was the gate house of the camp next</v>
<v Speaker 1>to us from which workers came into our </v>

1095
01:07:02.021 --> 01:07:02.854
<v Speaker 1>compound to lay water pipes and repair </v>
<v Speaker 1>the old ramshackle seminary building </v>

1096
01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:08.373
<v Speaker 1>across from me beyond the artfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>intertwined many stranded barbed wire </v>

1097
01:07:12.701 --> 01:07:13.534
<v Speaker 1>barricade and two steps away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gate house beneath a bright lantern </v>

1098
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:22.770
<v Speaker 1>stood the punished girl head hanging the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind tugging at her gray work skirt,</v>

1099
01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:27.640
<v Speaker 1>her feet growing numb from the cold and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thin scarf over her head.</v>

1100
01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:29.493
<v Speaker 1>It had been warm during the day when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had been digging a ditch on our </v>

1101
01:07:31.751 --> 01:07:32.584
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another girl slipped down into a </v>

1102
01:07:35.981 --> 01:07:36.814
<v Speaker 1>ravine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crawled her way to the Vladi Keno </v>

1103
01:07:38.531 --> 01:07:39.364
<v Speaker 1>highway and escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guard had bungled and Moscow city </v>

1104
01:07:43.361 --> 01:07:46.450
<v Speaker 1>buses ran right along the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they caught on,</v>

1105
01:07:46.451 --> 01:07:49.420
<v Speaker 1>it was too late to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they raised the alarm,</v>

1106
01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:54.220
<v Speaker 1>a mean dark major arrived in shouted </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they fail to catch the girl,</v>

1107
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.353
<v Speaker 1>the entire camp would be deprived of </v>
<v Speaker 1>visits and parcels for a whole month </v>

1108
01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.433
<v Speaker 1>because of her escape and the women </v>
<v Speaker 1>brigadiers went into a rage and they </v>

1109
01:08:03.221 --> 01:08:04.054
<v Speaker 1>were all shouting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them in particular who kept </v>

1110
01:08:05.891 --> 01:08:08.170
<v Speaker 1>viciously rolling her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1111
01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:12.340
<v Speaker 1>I hope they catcher the bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope they take scissors and clip,</v>

1112
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.830
<v Speaker 1>clip all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take off all of her hair in front of the</v>

1113
01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.440
<v Speaker 1>lineup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't something she had thought up</v>

1114
01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:19.460
<v Speaker 1>for herself.</v>

1115
01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.640
<v Speaker 1>This is the way they punished women in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ghoulag,</v>

1116
01:08:22.730 --> 01:08:23.563
<v Speaker 1>but the girl who is now standing outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gate house in the cold had sighed </v>

1117
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:27.883
<v Speaker 1>and said instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least she can have a good time out </v>

1118
01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:31.514
<v Speaker 1>and freedom for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The jailer overheard what she said and </v>

1119
01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>now she was being punished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else.</v>

1120
01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:37.964
<v Speaker 1>It'd be taken off to the camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she had been set outside there to </v>

1121
01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:42.710
<v Speaker 1>stand at attention in front of the gate </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1122
01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.053
<v Speaker 1>This had been at 6:00 PM and now it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>11:00 PM she tried to shift from one </v>

1123
01:08:48.921 --> 01:08:49.754
<v Speaker 1>foot to another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guards stuck out his hand and </v>

1124
01:08:51.411 --> 01:08:53.360
<v Speaker 1>shouted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand at attention,</v>

1125
01:08:53.361 --> 01:08:57.620
<v Speaker 1>horror or else it will be worse for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now she was not moving.</v>

1126
01:08:57.621 --> 01:08:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Only weeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forgive me,</v>

1127
01:08:59.781 --> 01:09:02.690
<v Speaker 1>citizen chief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me into the camp.</v>

1128
01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:06.620
<v Speaker 1>I won't do it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even in the camp,</v>

1129
01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:09.260
<v Speaker 1>no one was about to say to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1130
01:09:09.261 --> 01:09:10.880
<v Speaker 1>idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on in.</v>

1131
01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.013
<v Speaker 1>The reason they were keeping her out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there any way for so long was that the </v>

1132
01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:19.970
<v Speaker 1>next day was Sunday and she wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed for work such as straw,</v>

1133
01:09:19.971 --> 01:09:21.410
<v Speaker 1>blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 1>naive,</v>

1134
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:22.423
<v Speaker 1>uneducated slip of a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd been in prison for some spool of </v>

1135
01:09:25.521 --> 01:09:28.250
<v Speaker 1>thread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a dangerous thought.</v>

1136
01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.113
<v Speaker 1>You expressed their little sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to teach you a lesson for the </v>

1137
01:09:31.911 --> 01:09:35.420
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fire,</v>

1138
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:40.220
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fought the war and we looked into the</v>

1139
01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:43.040
<v Speaker 1>bonfires to see what kind of victory it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be.</v>

1140
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:47.240
<v Speaker 1>The wind wafted a glowing husk from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bonfire.</v>

1141
01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1142
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.110
<v Speaker 1>To that flame in you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>

1143
01:09:51.111 --> 01:09:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I promise the whole world will read </v>
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>

1144
01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:01.203
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1145
01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:06.740
<v Speaker 1>This is from Milton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paradise lost for Wednesday,</v>

1146
01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.940
<v Speaker 1>but from the author of all ill could </v>
<v Speaker 1>spring so deep,</v>

1147
01:10:09.941 --> 01:10:10.774
<v Speaker 1>a Melis to confound the race of mankind </v>
<v Speaker 1>in one route and earth with hell to </v>

1148
01:10:15.161 --> 01:10:19.630
<v Speaker 1>mingle and involve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done all to spite the great creator.</v>

1149
01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.620
<v Speaker 1>What are the political implications of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential psychology?</v>

1150
01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.040
<v Speaker 1>If you lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you corrupt the system.</v>

1151
01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:31.803
<v Speaker 1>If you ally enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system becomes so corrupt that it </v>

1152
01:10:33.791 --> 01:10:34.624
<v Speaker 1>turns on you and becomes murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the price of freedom as far as the </v>

1153
01:10:38.771 --> 01:10:43.000
<v Speaker 1>existentialists are concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is buttressed by the historical</v>

1154
01:10:43.001 --> 01:10:45.550
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that they garner during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century,</v>

1155
01:10:45.551 --> 01:10:50.551
<v Speaker 1>was that you have a moral obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a moral obligation to speak the</v>

1156
01:10:53.671 --> 01:10:54.504
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain the integrity of the state </v>

1157
01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:00.720
<v Speaker 1>as well as fostering your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological integration.</v>

1158
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.910
<v Speaker 1>We'll see you on Tuesday.</v>
