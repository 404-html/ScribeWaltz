<v Speaker 1>and colleagues who could not be here</v>

4
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>today as the auditorium sold out in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter of hours.</v>

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>My name is Joffrey Clarfield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is my privilege to be the executive</v>

6
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>director of the speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this action group,</v>

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>and I would like to thank founding</v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

<v Speaker 1>surely an haber and our new president</v>
<v Speaker 1>irving.</v>

9
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Why store and all the volunteers who've</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked so hard to make this event</v>

10
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also like to thank our partner</v>

11
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Masood Freedom Foundation and the</v>

12
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:44.061
<v Speaker 1>council for Muslims facing tomorrow who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the a joint sponsors of this event.</v>

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>The speakers action group in particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's supporting groups is dedicated</v>

14
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>to the fight against antisemitism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism.</v>

15
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.130
<v Speaker 1>But without freedom of speech there</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be no fight against antisemitism</v>

16
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.910
<v Speaker 1>or racism for we need freedom of speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>to defend our rights</v>

17
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>and as we will hear today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech is most threatened</v>

18
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.450
<v Speaker 1>where ironically it should be most tree</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the media and the colleges and the</v>

19
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>universities of this country as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an other democracies.</v>

20
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I would like to introduce the emcee for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this afternoon.</v>

21
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Faith Goldie from the rebel media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an organization that is at the forefront</v>

22
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>of the fight for free speech in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

23
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I'd like her to introduce our two</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguished speakers,</v>

24
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>professor Jordan Peterson and Dr. Norman</v>
<v Speaker 1>doidge faith.</v>

25
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for being here today.</v>

26
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.970
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

27
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 3>been a dishwasher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a gas shockey,</v>

28
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 3>a bartender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a short order cook,</v>

29
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 3>a beekeeper apply wood mill laborer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a railway line up worker.</v>

30
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 3>But today professor Jordan B.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peterson is best known for his work in</v>

31
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 3>the academic world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has published more than 100</v>

32
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 3>scientific papers transforming the</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern understanding of personality and</v>

33
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 3>revolutionizing this psychology of</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>

34
00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 3>With his now classic book maps of</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning the architecture of belief as a</v>

35
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Harvard professor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was nominated for the prestigious</v>

36
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 3>Levinson teaching prize now at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>University of Toronto.</v>

37
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 3>He is regarded by students as one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their truly life changing teachers and I</v>

38
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 3>think that I speak for a great deal of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in this room and frankly across</v>

39
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:41.720
<v Speaker 3>the country when I say you need to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of Professor Peterson students to</v>

40
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:45.630
<v Speaker 3>have been enlightened and inspired by</v>
<v Speaker 3>that eight pound universe between his</v>

41
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 3>ears as well as his bravery.</v>

42
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

43
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Most recently Dr. Peterson became the</v>
<v Speaker 3>center of an ongoing national</v>

44
00:02:55.901 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 3>controversy for refusing to abide by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>University of attempt to put very</v>

45
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 3>specific words into his mouth when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>ordered professors comply with the</v>

46
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 3>gender pronouns policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Peterson's vivid descent over</v>

47
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 3>language politics and the political</v>
<v Speaker 3>agenda behind it has seen him threatened</v>

48
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.220
<v Speaker 3>and showed it down by snowflake students</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the academic hierarchy alike as a</v>

49
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 3>result of his public views on how</v>
<v Speaker 3>political correct nate's correctness</v>

50
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 3>rather violates freedom of speech and</v>
<v Speaker 3>academic freedom.</v>

51
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 3>And the west Professor Peterson has</v>
<v Speaker 3>become a cultural icon for liberty</v>

52
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 3>lovers and a long awaited obstruction to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wayfairs on the long march of the</v>

53
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 3>institution's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please join me in welcoming Dr. Jordan</v>

54
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:36.030
<v Speaker 3>bpt</v>

55
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.030
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

56
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 4>So about</v>
<v Speaker 4>three months ago</v>

57
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.250
<v Speaker 4>I sat in my office at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't really sleeping very well and</v>

58
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.570
<v Speaker 4>because my mind was running and it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>running because I had just read some</v>

59
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:13.500
<v Speaker 4>policy documents on the Ontario Human</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rights Commission website in</v>

60
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:18.501
<v Speaker 4>relationship to build see 16 and at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same time I had heard that the</v>

61
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.580
<v Speaker 4>University of Toronto hr and equity</v>

62
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 4>vice president had decided to make anti</v>
<v Speaker 4>unconscious bias training mandatory for</v>

63
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.100
<v Speaker 4>her staff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I find appalling</v>

64
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.430
<v Speaker 4>and still find a polling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would recommend that if any of you</v>

65
00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:45.170
<v Speaker 4>are asked or required to have your</v>
<v Speaker 4>unconscious biases adjusted,</v>

66
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.980
<v Speaker 4>that you might see some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might note to yourself that by</v>

67
00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:53.540
<v Speaker 4>agreeing to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have agreed that you're guilty and I</v>

68
00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:56.780
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't recommend that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

69
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.870
<v Speaker 4>I was mostly trying to straighten up my</v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts on these issues,</v>

70
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.190
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

71
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.170
<v Speaker 4>and that's usually what I do when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>speak,</v>

72
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

73
00:05:03.861 --> 00:05:06.530
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I have a good reputation as a</v>

74
00:05:06.531 --> 00:05:09.320
<v Speaker 4>speaker and I think there's two reasons</v>
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>

75
00:05:09.321 --> 00:05:11.240
<v Speaker 4>And one is I don't ever speak to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>

76
00:05:11.241 --> 00:05:13.850
<v Speaker 4>I always speak to individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

77
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm not speaking to the group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm speaking to individual people and</v>

78
00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:22.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm not telling you what's right because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's right.</v>

79
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.710
<v Speaker 4>What I'm trying to do is to formulate my</v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughts more clearly.</v>

80
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.490
<v Speaker 4>And it's helpful to do that in speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even in front of an audience because</v>

81
00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:33.230
<v Speaker 4>it's a dialogue with an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

82
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.900
<v Speaker 4>if you watched the individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they,</v>

83
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.860
<v Speaker 4>you can tell if they're following you or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether mostly whether they're following</v>

84
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:41.570
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they can understand the line of the</v>

85
00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:43.970
<v Speaker 4>argumentation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some of them will be shaking their</v>

86
00:05:43.971 --> 00:05:46.700
<v Speaker 4>heads and some of them will be nodding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

87
00:05:46.701 --> 00:05:49.310
<v Speaker 4>some of it will be looking puzzled in</v>
<v Speaker 4>which case you have to kind of</v>

88
00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 4>reformulate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

89
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.000
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how I,</v>

90
00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:54.950
<v Speaker 4>that's how to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

91
00:05:54.951 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you're speaking to people,</v>

92
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 4>it's okay to tell them what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but better to show them how you think.</v>

93
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 4>And that means you're going to stumble</v>
<v Speaker 4>around like an idiot some of the time</v>

94
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 4>because you're trying to grapple with</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

95
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 4>And what I tried to do for my students</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to,</v>

96
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 4>to model the process of grappling with</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

97
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 4>Because that's what you do when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

98
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Norman pointed out that you can be right</v>

99
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 4>or you can try to get smarter and to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

100
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:25.760
<v Speaker 4>Then you convince people that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

101
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 4>but to try to get smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you find out why you're wrong.</v>

102
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 4>And so I decided a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the ways to deal with Maya</v>

103
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 4>authoritarian tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

104
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 4>was to make friends with what I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know instead of what I do know.</v>

105
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 4>And that's a whole different way of</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at the world,</v>

106
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:42.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

107
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 4>it's got its pain because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're always trying to figure out more</v>

108
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:51.611
<v Speaker 4>or less wire an abayas moron.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a very long list of,</v>

109
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 4>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a very long list of reasons for</v>

110
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

111
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.320
<v Speaker 4>And then you have to find out why you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

112
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 4>And as a short term mechanism for</v>
<v Speaker 4>attaining psychological stability,</v>

113
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as a long term process where you're</v>

114
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:09.480
<v Speaker 4>trying to make things work better in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>medium to longterm,</v>

115
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 4>then it's the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

116
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to sacrifice the future for</v>

117
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 4>the present,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although it's kind of the reverse of the</v>

118
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:21.320
<v Speaker 4>way you should do things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

119
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 4>I made these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty amateur videos and you know,</v>

120
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 4>the lighting wasn't very good and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of things wrong with</v>

121
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 4>them and a buck.</v>

122
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 4>One of the things I've been wondering</v>
<v Speaker 4>about for the last three months,</v>

123
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Speaker 4>it's just what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>

124
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on here?</v>

125
00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:43.760
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

126
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been accused of a lot of things,</v>

127
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 4>some of which are no doubt true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

128
00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:53.550
<v Speaker 4>I've been accused of being a racist and</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a trans fold.</v>

129
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 4>But what else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Profiteering and uh,</v>

130
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 4>I guess the other one was</v>
<v Speaker 4>scaremongering.</v>

131
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:01.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the other one.</v>

132
00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:05.380
<v Speaker 4>Scaremongering and so of course I'd been</v>
<v Speaker 4>wondering if that,</v>

133
00:08:05.381 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 4>if those things are true because it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not like,</v>

134
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my heart is as pure as the driven snow</v>

135
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 4>hardly and everyone has biases and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>

136
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:16.370
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I also,</v>

137
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.530
<v Speaker 4>well this unfolded had a group of</v>
<v Speaker 4>friends who were definitely critics who</v>

138
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 4>were watching everything I was doing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

139
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 4>letting me know pretty forthrightly when</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was being arrogant and when I was,</v>

140
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look kind of disheveled and when my</v>

141
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 4>arguments were just clear as they could</v>
<v Speaker 4>be and you know,</v>

142
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:35.220
<v Speaker 4>and so on.</v>

143
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 4>These were smart people and their</v>
<v Speaker 4>comments were very incisive.</v>

144
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:42.080
<v Speaker 4>And then of course I had all the blow</v>
<v Speaker 4>back and I was paying attention to it,</v>

145
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because well,</v>

146
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 4>you should pay attention to such things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

147
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 4>and I do pay attention to things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

148
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:52.130
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually pay attention to things and</v>

149
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.490
<v Speaker 4>if I'm embroiled in a controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's a like problem in my home,</v>

150
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 4>I tried to get to the damn bottom of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

151
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 4>the bottom of things is not a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 4>place to look.</v>

152
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 4>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're arguing with someone at</v>

153
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:10.290
<v Speaker 4>home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even someone you love,</v>

154
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.980
<v Speaker 4>you'll notice that your argument can get</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of hand a pretty quick.</v>

155
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 4>So if you're arguing with your wife or</v>
<v Speaker 4>your husband,</v>

156
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it depends on how volatile you are of</v>

157
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 4>course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

158
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:23.814
<v Speaker 4>you start</v>

159
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:31.010
<v Speaker 4>arguing about some little thing and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you come to understand pretty quick that</v>

160
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 4>it's actually not about that little</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing at all.</v>

161
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:37.380
<v Speaker 4>That little thing is associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

162
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 4>a little bigger thing underneath that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe that's associated with even a</v>

163
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:42.960
<v Speaker 4>bigger thing under that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

164
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 4>soon you're taking each other apart for</v>
<v Speaker 4>assuming you've been married for 20</v>

165
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for all the stupid things you've done to</v>

166
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:52.030
<v Speaker 4>each other over the last 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it doesn't have to end there.</v>

167
00:09:52.031 --> 00:09:55.590
<v Speaker 4>And how it's not pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really hard to bind a conversation</v>

168
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 4>so it doesn't go everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

169
00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 4>So one thing you can do if you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to someone about something you</v>

170
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 4>disagree with someone you love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can tell them a bunch of good things</v>

171
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:06.210
<v Speaker 4>about what they've been doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you actually believe.</v>

172
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 4>And then just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

173
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.460
<v Speaker 4>but there's this little problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just like it adjusted in a minor</v>

174
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:12.500
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe that'll,</v>

175
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll sort things out a bit between us</v>

176
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 4>and then maybe you don't fall into that</v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid pit,</v>

177
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.020
<v Speaker 4>which is really easy to fall into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

178
00:10:19.021 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 4>which certainly can lead to divorce</v>
<v Speaker 4>among other things.</v>

179
00:10:22.801 --> 00:10:27.510
<v Speaker 4>And so a huge part of the issue always</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just exactly what is this about?</v>

180
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd been asking myself that question for</v>

181
00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:34.360
<v Speaker 4>a long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long time because I'd been interested in</v>

182
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.550
<v Speaker 4>authoritarian conflict and atrocity and</v>
<v Speaker 4>totalitarianism for way longer than</v>

183
00:10:39.551 --> 00:10:42.160
<v Speaker 4>anyone with any sanity should ever be</v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in it.</v>

184
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.800
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then this,</v>

185
00:10:44.801 --> 00:10:46.720
<v Speaker 4>and then this all came up and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

186
00:10:46.721 --> 00:10:47.411
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

187
00:10:47.411 --> 00:10:48.191
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

188
00:10:48.191 --> 00:10:49.420
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

189
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.600
<v Speaker 4>am I a bigot and a transformed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

190
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.070
<v Speaker 4>I probably have my biases because people</v>
<v Speaker 4>tend to have in group biases,</v>

191
00:10:57.071 --> 00:10:59.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's associated by the way with</v>

192
00:10:59.321 --> 00:11:02.470
<v Speaker 4>compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just so you know it because one of the</v>

193
00:11:02.471 --> 00:11:05.380
<v Speaker 4>things compassion does is make you much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strongly,</v>

194
00:11:05.381 --> 00:11:07.580
<v Speaker 4>much more strongly bound to your</v>
<v Speaker 4>ingroup.</v>

195
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.430
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a mother as compassionate</v>

196
00:11:09.431 --> 00:11:13.510
<v Speaker 4>cause she loves her baby and she loves</v>
<v Speaker 4>the baby more than other things that</v>

197
00:11:13.511 --> 00:11:17.560
<v Speaker 4>aren't the baby obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so actually compassion is one of the</v>

198
00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:21.490
<v Speaker 4>main sources of Ingroup bias,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is something for the compassion</v>

199
00:11:21.491 --> 00:11:24.790
<v Speaker 4>warriors to think about for like three</v>
<v Speaker 4>fifths of a second.</v>

200
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.060
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing less compassionate to</v>

201
00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:31.090
<v Speaker 4>you than a mother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Grizzly bear protecting her cubs.</v>

202
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.510
<v Speaker 4>And so you should think about that when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think about empathy for a minute,</v>

203
00:11:34.511 --> 00:11:38.290
<v Speaker 4>because empathy is by no means an</v>
<v Speaker 4>untrammeled moral virtue.</v>

204
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.170
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's responsible and can be responsible</v>

205
00:11:41.171 --> 00:11:45.460
<v Speaker 4>for absolutely atrocious actions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It depends on who you're empathizing</v>

206
00:11:45.461 --> 00:11:46.690
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

207
00:11:46.691 --> 00:11:51.400
<v Speaker 4>and if you are empathizing with someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you regard as an infant dialyzed</v>

208
00:11:51.401 --> 00:11:55.270
<v Speaker 4>victim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you snap into a frame of mind where</v>

209
00:11:55.271 --> 00:12:00.271
<v Speaker 4>everyone who might be oppressing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>infant dialyzed victim is a predatory</v>

210
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 4>parasite and you're not very bloody</v>
<v Speaker 4>empathetic to them.</v>

211
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:08.731
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now it's a big problem anyways with</v>

212
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 4>regards to this scaremongering issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>

213
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:13.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Biased.</v>

214
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably and blind definitely.</v>

215
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.360
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like more than,</v>

216
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Speaker 4>more than you might expect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

217
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that actually</v>

218
00:12:24.761 --> 00:12:26.590
<v Speaker 4>protected me through all of this was</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

219
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've actually tried to come to terms</v>

220
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 4>with the evil that lurks in human</v>
<v Speaker 4>hearts,</v>

221
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.080
<v Speaker 4>particularly my own.</v>

222
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.100
<v Speaker 4>And I have 500 hours of lectures on that</v>
<v Speaker 4>online.</v>

223
00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:41.101
<v Speaker 4>If anybody has the bizarre desire to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pound their way through them,</v>

224
00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:47.530
<v Speaker 4>they can more or less think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out what I think because I said</v>

225
00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:52.531
<v Speaker 4>500 of hours of it publicly and so I</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't feel too bad about my level of</v>

226
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:55.210
<v Speaker 4>bigotry or hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

227
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:57.850
<v Speaker 4>I think you could probably infer that by</v>
<v Speaker 4>watching the video.</v>

228
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:02.470
<v Speaker 4>So it's kind of protected on that front.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there was this scaremongering</v>

229
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:05.080
<v Speaker 4>issue and that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough one man.</v>

230
00:13:05.081 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at bill [inaudible] 16 it</v>

231
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:11.170
<v Speaker 4>just kind of looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well we're extending protection to</v>

232
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:14.950
<v Speaker 4>another oppressed group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which isn't actually true because gender</v>

233
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:16.150
<v Speaker 4>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

234
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:20.140
<v Speaker 4>no gender expression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not a group I'd like just like to</v>

235
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:23.860
<v Speaker 4>point that out because terminological</v>
<v Speaker 4>accuracy actually matters.</v>

236
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.810
<v Speaker 4>So we've extended legal protection to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fashion essentially.</v>

237
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.590
<v Speaker 4>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well maybe I'm being a bit intransigent</v>

238
00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:34.930
<v Speaker 4>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I read the Dat and policies and I</v>

239
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:37.870
<v Speaker 4>don't think I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's not a group.</v>

240
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.070
<v Speaker 4>So that's an indication of the muddle</v>
<v Speaker 4>headedness behind the legislation.</v>

241
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 4>And then the federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Department of Justice did say on</v>

242
00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 4>their own website that they were going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to interpret that law in light of the</v>

243
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:51.670
<v Speaker 4>policies of the Ontario Human Rights</v>
<v Speaker 4>Commission.</v>

244
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 4>And so fine man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to the Ontario Human Rights</v>

245
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.480
<v Speaker 4>Commission if they haven't taken the</v>
<v Speaker 4>policies off yet and read what they're</v>

246
00:13:58.481 --> 00:13:59.590
<v Speaker 4>up to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if that,</v>

247
00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 4>if you agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well good green with it.</v>

248
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:05.020
<v Speaker 4>But I would suspect that if you agree</v>
<v Speaker 4>with it,</v>

249
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:06.910
<v Speaker 4>you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't understand it or,</v>

250
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.100
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you're up to something and now it</v>

251
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.650
<v Speaker 4>comes to the next part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are,</v>

252
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.140
<v Speaker 4>what are we really talking about here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

253
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.210
<v Speaker 4>so we could be talking about my biases</v>
<v Speaker 4>is my proclivity to scaremonger and you</v>

254
00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:20.080
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fair enough,</v>

255
00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:22.360
<v Speaker 4>but here's some reasons we're not.</v>

256
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.080
<v Speaker 4>And one is that I have all those</v>
<v Speaker 4>lectures online and you know,</v>

257
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:28.570
<v Speaker 4>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there would've been a phrase in any</v>

258
00:14:28.571 --> 00:14:33.280
<v Speaker 4>of them that indicated that there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>something even vaguely morally corrupt</v>

259
00:14:33.281 --> 00:14:35.650
<v Speaker 4>about me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would have been paraded around as</v>

260
00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:37.390
<v Speaker 4>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can be sure of that.</v>

261
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.610
<v Speaker 4>So that's kind of a relief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

262
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:42.790
<v Speaker 4>I did a lot of soul searching in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>last couple of months and it's not like</v>

263
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm without my problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyways.</v>

264
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.040
<v Speaker 4>So what is this about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we'll say,</v>

265
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.020
<v Speaker 4>hopefully it's not about me because</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be stupid.</v>

266
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.630
<v Speaker 4>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>

267
00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:59.570
<v Speaker 4>Why are all these people watching these</v>
<v Speaker 4>videos,</v>

268
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.200
<v Speaker 4>these things I made just to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it was that I was thinking.</v>

269
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I couldn't sleep one night and</v>

270
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 4>because I'm not very damn happy about</v>
<v Speaker 4>that unconscious bias stuff,</v>

271
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:13.430
<v Speaker 4>which I regard as absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 4>reprehensible,</v>

272
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 4>that you could be held guilty for your</v>
<v Speaker 4>implicit perceptions.</v>

273
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.260
<v Speaker 4>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

274
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.260
<v Speaker 4>they use that test as a diagnostic test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

275
00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:27.800
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't meet the criteria for</v>
<v Speaker 4>reliability and validity that you'd use</v>

276
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 4>for a diagnostic test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't produce the same results one</v>

277
00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:34.340
<v Speaker 4>time after another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can use it to target anybody.</v>

278
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.030
<v Speaker 4>And so go along with it if you want and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just see what happens.</v>

279
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.553
<v Speaker 4>Anyways.</v>

280
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

281
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.140
<v Speaker 4>so I've been thinking about this like</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>

282
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.730
<v Speaker 4>Why the outcry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

283
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.070
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well Professor Peterson,</v>

284
00:15:48.071 --> 00:15:50.260
<v Speaker 4>God is 15 minutes of fame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

285
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.960
<v Speaker 4>well I had my 15 minutes of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

286
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:57.640
<v Speaker 4>trivial fame several times in my life</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's some good things about it,</v>

287
00:15:57.641 --> 00:16:01.710
<v Speaker 4>but I am despite what you might think or</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather private person.</v>

288
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:05.950
<v Speaker 4>And so it's not like I'm particularly</v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoying it,</v>

289
00:16:05.951 --> 00:16:07.180
<v Speaker 4>but I thought something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

290
00:16:07.181 --> 00:16:10.870
<v Speaker 4>when I made those videos I thought this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is something I learned from reading</v>

291
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.000
<v Speaker 4>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have to fight a dragon,</v>

292
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.930
<v Speaker 4>you should go to it slayer before it</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to your village.</v>

293
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.640
<v Speaker 4>And so people think of what I did is</v>
<v Speaker 4>courageous and I don't think that's</v>

294
00:16:21.641 --> 00:16:24.460
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think that I can see danger</v>

295
00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:28.690
<v Speaker 4>coming and you get to pick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to pick your anxiety.</v>

296
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.520
<v Speaker 4>I could either be anxious about speaking</v>
<v Speaker 4>or I could be anxious about not</v>

297
00:16:33.521 --> 00:16:36.910
<v Speaker 4>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I chose to be anxious about</v>

298
00:16:36.911 --> 00:16:39.910
<v Speaker 4>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's not exactly courage.</v>

299
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.870
<v Speaker 4>It's more like common sense without</v>
<v Speaker 4>assumes that you're looking into the</v>

300
00:16:43.871 --> 00:16:44.704
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>

301
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.820
<v Speaker 4>So are you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

302
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.410
<v Speaker 4>what gives me any special power to look</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the future and hey,</v>

303
00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:57.700
<v Speaker 4>that's a good question and my God only</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows what's going to happen in the next</v>

304
00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:57.911
<v Speaker 4>few years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

305
00:16:57.911 --> 00:16:59.890
<v Speaker 4>I did read today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is cool.</v>

306
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:05.130
<v Speaker 4>250,000 people will be lifted out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolute poverty today and 300,000 more</v>

307
00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:09.940
<v Speaker 4>will be connected to electricity and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're knocking poverty rates around the</v>

308
00:17:09.941 --> 00:17:14.941
<v Speaker 4>world down faster by a huge margin than</v>
<v Speaker 4>we ever have in human history.</v>

309
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.650
<v Speaker 4>There was an article in New York Times</v>
<v Speaker 4>today called y 2016 was the best year</v>

310
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:21.850
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really worth reading.</v>

311
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.870
<v Speaker 4>I concluded the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worked for a UN committee a couple of</v>

312
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:27.130
<v Speaker 4>years ago when I was looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

313
00:17:27.131 --> 00:17:29.410
<v Speaker 4>what was going to happen down the road</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everything.</v>

314
00:17:29.411 --> 00:17:31.210
<v Speaker 4>I kept reading less while,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

315
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.420
<v Speaker 4>we're getting rid of polio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're getting rid of LFA elephantiasis,</v>

316
00:17:34.421 --> 00:17:35.590
<v Speaker 4>which you really don't want to have.</v>

317
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.780
<v Speaker 4>We're getting rid of Guinea worm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're getting rid of polio,</v>

318
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.410
<v Speaker 4>knock and malaria back into the swamps</v>
<v Speaker 4>from where it comes.</v>

319
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.960
<v Speaker 4>We're lifting people out of poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

320
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.820
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're doing a lot of good things.</v>

321
00:17:45.821 --> 00:17:48.550
<v Speaker 4>You'd sure never guessed that by the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>we treat ourselves.</v>

322
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.930
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what's going on?</v>

323
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.100
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I thought,</v>

324
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:55.980
<v Speaker 4>well I better think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been thinking about a long time.</v>

325
00:17:55.981 --> 00:17:58.200
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

326
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.720
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right wing is really hard on the</v>

327
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.240
<v Speaker 4>Frankfurt school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

328
00:18:02.241 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 4>and the Frankfurt school where these</v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of neo Marxist guys who combined</v>

329
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.920
<v Speaker 4>Marxism with</v>
<v Speaker 4>Friday and Islam in the 1940s and,</v>

330
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.950
<v Speaker 4>and they were avowed neo Marxists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

331
00:18:13.951 --> 00:18:18.030
<v Speaker 4>so it's not like I'm making an</v>
<v Speaker 4>accusation and they were kind of anti</v>

332
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.820
<v Speaker 4>system type people and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of that.</v>

333
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:25.080
<v Speaker 4>But I think to lay what's happening at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the universities and in brought in the</v>

334
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:29.190
<v Speaker 4>broader culture itself at the feet of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Frankfurt school is insufficient.</v>

335
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.930
<v Speaker 4>I really think that it's primarily a</v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of the French intellectuals</v>

336
00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:35.910
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is obviously an</v>

337
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:40.830
<v Speaker 4>oversimplification who emerged out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxism in the early 1970s and produce</v>

338
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:42.180
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

339
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.600
<v Speaker 4>the thing about the postmodernist types</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there nested inside mark's is they</v>

340
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.340
<v Speaker 4>say that straight out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not inventing this.</v>

341
00:18:51.341 --> 00:18:53.540
<v Speaker 4>You read Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's like the,</v>

342
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.670
<v Speaker 4>the joker at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the head of the postmodernist</v>

343
00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:57.750
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

344
00:18:57.751 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean joker because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

345
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.150
<v Speaker 4>he's an intellectual clown and not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean he's stupid because he is</v>

346
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:05.370
<v Speaker 4>not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not at all.</v>

347
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.430
<v Speaker 4>These people are not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know exactly what they're doing.</v>

348
00:19:08.431 --> 00:19:11.520
<v Speaker 4>They know precisely what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're a hell of a lot more educated</v>

349
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:13.470
<v Speaker 4>about what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you are less,</v>

350
00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:16.800
<v Speaker 4>you happen to be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they mean exactly what they say.</v>

351
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Just like people always do when they</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you what they're going to do or</v>

352
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:24.720
<v Speaker 4>they write it down and they say straight</v>
<v Speaker 4>out on their websites say that women's</v>

353
00:19:24.721 --> 00:19:28.110
<v Speaker 4>studies websites,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we think the patriarchy is an oppressive</v>

354
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.130
<v Speaker 4>structure that should be broken down to</v>
<v Speaker 4>its core.</v>

355
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.120
<v Speaker 4>And they meet core conceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just social,</v>

356
00:19:36.121 --> 00:19:39.210
<v Speaker 4>it's linguistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophical and attitudinal.</v>

357
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:44.220
<v Speaker 4>It should be broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What wiped out and restructured from the</v>

358
00:19:44.221 --> 00:19:47.070
<v Speaker 4>bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they mean that.</v>

359
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 4>So when it's not accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any of this,</v>

360
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:54.000
<v Speaker 4>and I know it sounds like a bloody</v>
<v Speaker 4>paranoid conspiracy theory,</v>

361
00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:56.850
<v Speaker 4>but you know I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always been of the idea,</v>

362
00:19:56.851 --> 00:20:01.500
<v Speaker 4>especially from reading young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that ideas people don't have ideas,</v>

363
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.280
<v Speaker 4>ideas have people and these are powerful</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

364
00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:08.790
<v Speaker 4>There's a good book called explaining</v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism that I might recommend by</v>

365
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:13.200
<v Speaker 4>a guy named named Steven RC Hicks and</v>
<v Speaker 4>his first chapter,</v>

366
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:16.590
<v Speaker 4>which isn't very long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good introduction to political</v>

367
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 4>correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so while,</v>

368
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:22.590
<v Speaker 4>so why do I think this is about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about that?</v>

369
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.630
<v Speaker 4>Well her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's my reasons.</v>

370
00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:28.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean it doesn't seem to be about me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think all idea to actually was</v>

371
00:20:28.201 --> 00:20:30.870
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made the general specific k,</v>

372
00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:33.450
<v Speaker 4>which is kind of what you have to do if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really want to make a point,</v>

373
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.490
<v Speaker 4>a point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

374
00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:37.890
<v Speaker 4>That's one place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to make a point.</v>

375
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:42.120
<v Speaker 4>And my point was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying made up words generated</v>

376
00:20:42.121 --> 00:20:47.121
<v Speaker 4>by postmodern neo Marxists because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>despise everything they stand for.</v>

377
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.490
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm not using those damn words</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's okay.</v>

378
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.143
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like,</v>

379
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.700
<v Speaker 4>I have something against transgender</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

380
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:03.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure some of them are lovely people</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some of them aren't,</v>

381
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so they can do whatever they want as</v>

382
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:08.290
<v Speaker 4>far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as long as they don't,</v>

383
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.400
<v Speaker 4>they can do whatever they want as far as</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm concerned,</v>

384
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:17.700
<v Speaker 4>as long as I'm not forced to go along</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the most radical representatives of</v>

385
00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:21.820
<v Speaker 4>them who don't even speak for them</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyways.</v>

386
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.320
<v Speaker 4>I've got like 20 letters from</v>
<v Speaker 4>transsexual people supporting what I've</v>

387
00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:29.470
<v Speaker 4>done and like none opposing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

388
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:32.890
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that's kind of cool is</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've only got three hate letters.</v>

389
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.350
<v Speaker 4>I thought three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

390
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:36.184
<v Speaker 4>you guys,</v>

391
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.363
<v Speaker 2>you guys are,</v>

392
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:44.470
<v Speaker 4>you guys aren't trying very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got like a thousand letters of</v>

393
00:21:45.531 --> 00:21:50.531
<v Speaker 4>support and if you go on youtube where</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm radically overrepresented,</v>

394
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you look at the comments and the</v>

395
00:21:52.971 --> 00:21:55.490
<v Speaker 4>likes and the dislikes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's about the same ratio.</v>

396
00:21:55.491 --> 00:21:59.210
<v Speaker 4>It's like likes to dislikes is like</v>
<v Speaker 4>about a hundred to one and almost all</v>

397
00:21:59.211 --> 00:22:01.460
<v Speaker 4>the comments are positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you know,</v>

398
00:22:01.461 --> 00:22:04.190
<v Speaker 4>could easily be a selection bias and</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably is,</v>

399
00:22:04.191 --> 00:22:06.560
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it still means that there's quite a few</v>

400
00:22:06.561 --> 00:22:11.450
<v Speaker 4>people who think that what I'm doing is</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of okay as far as they're</v>

401
00:22:11.451 --> 00:22:13.280
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's important.</v>

402
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.420
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to talk a little bit about</v>

403
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.130
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

404
00:22:19.131 --> 00:22:23.010
<v Speaker 4>So let's go back to France in the 19 end</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the 1960.</v>

405
00:22:23.011 --> 00:22:24.500
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is of course an</v>

406
00:22:24.501 --> 00:22:28.220
<v Speaker 4>oversimplification and I'm sure I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong about some of it because you know,</v>

407
00:22:28.221 --> 00:22:31.970
<v Speaker 4>it's not exactly my field of speciality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of sociology.</v>

408
00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm more of the scientist tight,</v>

409
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:35.750
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

410
00:22:35.751 --> 00:22:38.630
<v Speaker 4>and if I read philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tend not to read second rate</v>

411
00:22:38.631 --> 00:22:41.660
<v Speaker 4>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I've tried to avoid the</v>

412
00:22:41.661 --> 00:22:43.970
<v Speaker 4>postmodernists to some degree because</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>

413
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.700
<v Speaker 4>there any coherency is one of the least</v>
<v Speaker 4>of their sins.</v>

414
00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.060
<v Speaker 4>But they don't care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

415
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.390
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to understand,</v>

416
00:22:50.391 --> 00:22:53.690
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's modernists 10 enlightenment people</v>

417
00:22:53.691 --> 00:22:56.000
<v Speaker 4>and even traditionalist who care about</v>
<v Speaker 4>coherency,</v>

418
00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.280
<v Speaker 4>the postmodernists don't believe in</v>
<v Speaker 4>coherency.</v>

419
00:22:58.281 --> 00:23:00.500
<v Speaker 4>They don't believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not making this up,</v>

420
00:23:00.501 --> 00:23:03.500
<v Speaker 4>this is part of their philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't believe in logic.</v>

421
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.280
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>debt does says straight out that Western</v>

422
00:23:07.281 --> 00:23:12.281
<v Speaker 4>society has fellow logo centric by which</v>
<v Speaker 4>he means male centered and privileging</v>

423
00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.330
<v Speaker 4>the idea of logic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

424
00:23:14.331 --> 00:23:16.910
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't buy any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't think that there's a truth</v>

425
00:23:16.911 --> 00:23:20.120
<v Speaker 4>that is out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't believe that individuals can</v>

426
00:23:20.121 --> 00:23:21.830
<v Speaker 4>reach any sort of truth by thinking.</v>

427
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:26.180
<v Speaker 4>He certainly doesn't believe that we can</v>
<v Speaker 4>move towards truth in dialogue because</v>

428
00:23:26.181 --> 00:23:27.470
<v Speaker 4>that's dialogic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

429
00:23:27.471 --> 00:23:28.940
<v Speaker 4>There's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wonder,</v>

430
00:23:28.941 --> 00:23:32.090
<v Speaker 4>well why don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did the postmodern types keep other</v>

431
00:23:32.091 --> 00:23:34.220
<v Speaker 4>thinkers off the campus?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

432
00:23:34.221 --> 00:23:37.700
<v Speaker 4>it's not because they're afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well also some of the market,</v>

433
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.310
<v Speaker 4>but they use their fragility as a mask</v>
<v Speaker 4>for their,</v>

434
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the underlying philosophical,</v>

435
00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.960
<v Speaker 4>their underlying philosophical and</v>
<v Speaker 4>political interests.</v>

436
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 4>They do that Freidman terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like every social justice</v>

437
00:23:49.101 --> 00:23:49.934
<v Speaker 4>warrior is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

438
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>soared carrie and pork postmodernists</v>

439
00:23:53.271 --> 00:23:56.510
<v Speaker 4>but the idea are fragmented and</v>
<v Speaker 4>distributed among them.</v>

440
00:23:56.511 --> 00:24:00.530
<v Speaker 4>Like they're distributed among a mob.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you put the whole mob together,</v>

441
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.920
<v Speaker 4>you get the whole post modernists thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening at the same time.</v>

442
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:07.400
<v Speaker 4>And that's how ideas have people instead</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the other way around.</v>

443
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.000
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forget about logic.</v>

444
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.940
<v Speaker 4>That's out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just a construct of Western</v>

445
00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:16.940
<v Speaker 4>society and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the whole point of the construct was</v>

446
00:24:16.941 --> 00:24:21.170
<v Speaker 4>to oppress other people and to take</v>
<v Speaker 4>their wealth and to privilege the people</v>

447
00:24:21.171 --> 00:24:25.850
<v Speaker 4>who live within that so called logic</v>
<v Speaker 4>system so that they can justify to</v>

448
00:24:25.851 --> 00:24:30.851
<v Speaker 4>themselves and other people their prey</v>
<v Speaker 4>Predator rapaciousness straight and</v>

449
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:32.054
<v Speaker 4>simple.</v>

450
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.450
<v Speaker 4>And that's partly because postmodernism</v>
<v Speaker 4>was influenced by Marxism.</v>

451
00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:39.390
<v Speaker 4>And of course that's what the Marxists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about any situation where there's</v>

452
00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.300
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's call it a power status</v>

453
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:43.790
<v Speaker 4>differential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people at the top are only there</v>

454
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:46.370
<v Speaker 4>because they've stole everything from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people at the bottom.</v>

455
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 4>And so the knee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Marxists in France realized by the</v>

456
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:56.111
<v Speaker 4>end of 1960s there abouts when even John</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul Sartre finally figured out that to</v>

457
00:24:56.391 --> 00:25:01.340
<v Speaker 4>be a communist probably wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>acceptable given that the bloody Soviet</v>

458
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:06.350
<v Speaker 4>had killed like 30 million people</v>
<v Speaker 4>between 1919 and 1959 and the Maoists</v>

459
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.890
<v Speaker 4>done the same thing on a greater scale</v>
<v Speaker 4>in China.</v>

460
00:25:09.891 --> 00:25:12.560
<v Speaker 4>And then we talk about North Korea and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can talk about,</v>

461
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by whatever,</v>

462
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:15.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't,</v>

463
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.710
<v Speaker 4>students don't learn any of that in</v>
<v Speaker 4>school anymore.</v>

464
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.930
<v Speaker 4>And even if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't want to listen to it.</v>

465
00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:26.210
<v Speaker 4>When I tell my students in my second</v>
<v Speaker 4>year psychology class about the Gulag</v>

466
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:28.280
<v Speaker 4>archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hardly any of them know,</v>

467
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:29.510
<v Speaker 4>well why is that?</v>

468
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.510
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because they haven't been taught</v>

469
00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:34.400
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is that?</v>

470
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see if you can figure it out.</v>

471
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.360
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

472
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.880
<v Speaker 4>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to the postmodern types.</v>

473
00:25:42.881 --> 00:25:45.770
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it got to the point where there's just</v>

474
00:25:45.771 --> 00:25:49.040
<v Speaker 4>no way you could be a Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially after social knits.</v>

475
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:51.080
<v Speaker 4>And because Solzhenitsyn wrote this</v>
<v Speaker 4>great book,</v>

476
00:25:51.081 --> 00:25:54.290
<v Speaker 4>which is actually out of print for</v>
<v Speaker 4>crying out loud,</v>

477
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 4>which I've actually been able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>popularize like mad over the last three</v>

478
00:25:57.831 --> 00:25:58.491
<v Speaker 4>months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

479
00:25:58.491 --> 00:26:01.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really mind boggling and what soldier</v>

480
00:26:01.511 --> 00:26:05.480
<v Speaker 4>Nitsa did in his genius manner because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's up there with Dostoevsky and</v>

481
00:26:05.481 --> 00:26:06.650
<v Speaker 4>tolstoy like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

482
00:26:06.651 --> 00:26:09.440
<v Speaker 4>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a towering intellect and a person</v>

483
00:26:09.441 --> 00:26:12.410
<v Speaker 4>of tack can or moral force,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

484
00:26:12.411 --> 00:26:14.690
<v Speaker 4>like he put himself on the line for that</v>
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>

485
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:17.780
<v Speaker 4>He memorized it when he was in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the prison camps.</v>

486
00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:20.960
<v Speaker 4>It's about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's three volumes that fic,</v>

487
00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:24.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like 2000 pages of someone's</v>

488
00:26:24.141 --> 00:26:27.650
<v Speaker 4>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The smartest person you've ever met,</v>

489
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:33.130
<v Speaker 4>the wisest person you've ever met,</v>
<v Speaker 4>screaming and outrage for 2000 pages.</v>

490
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.900
<v Speaker 4>It's no bloody wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's out of print.</v>

491
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what soldier in its did was</v>

492
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.230
<v Speaker 4>take on this claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You often hear the radical leftists make</v>

493
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 4>about communism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about Marxism.</v>

494
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.070
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

495
00:26:50.071 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't real Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

496
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.440
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well how many countries do you need to</v>

497
00:26:55.441 --> 00:26:59.280
<v Speaker 4>disprove your thesis?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many millions of people have to die</v>

498
00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 4>before you might admit that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

499
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously more than a hundred million</v>

500
00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 4>because that's the approximate total of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's probably an underestimate,</v>

501
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:11.970
<v Speaker 4>but we'll be conservative because I had</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get another 10 million.</v>

502
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't really make that much</v>
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>

503
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.930
<v Speaker 4>So soldier Nansen took that argument</v>
<v Speaker 4>apart partly in his book lending in</v>

504
00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:22.250
<v Speaker 4>Zurich,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then partly in the Gulag</v>

505
00:27:22.251 --> 00:27:24.290
<v Speaker 4>archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buck groundwork had already been laid</v>

506
00:27:24.291 --> 00:27:27.080
<v Speaker 4>for all of that by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knew exactly what was coming in the</v>

507
00:27:27.081 --> 00:27:30.740
<v Speaker 4>20th century and by Dostoyevsky who</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote a book called the possess back in</v>

508
00:27:30.741 --> 00:27:35.741
<v Speaker 4>like 1880 where he outlined in painful</v>
<v Speaker 4>detail the precise mindset that would</v>

509
00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:38.690
<v Speaker 4>produce the Russian revolution like 30</v>
<v Speaker 4>years later.</v>

510
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.090
<v Speaker 4>Amazing and Tolstoy as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

511
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.610
<v Speaker 4>he knew what was coming and made him</v>
<v Speaker 4>suicidal.</v>

512
00:27:43.611 --> 00:27:45.800
<v Speaker 4>He wrote in his confession that win</v>

513
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.710
<v Speaker 4>the conflict between the ideas of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia,</v>

514
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:53.490
<v Speaker 4>the traditional ideas and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment ideas sweeping in from the</v>

515
00:27:53.491 --> 00:27:54.324
<v Speaker 4>west,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

516
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.200
<v Speaker 4>they blew his worldview apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was traditional religious blew his</v>

517
00:27:58.201 --> 00:28:01.860
<v Speaker 4>worldview apart so badly that he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>suicidal at the height of his fame.</v>

518
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:06.150
<v Speaker 4>Tolstoy knew what was going to come to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's not like soldier Mitson was</v>

519
00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:08.340
<v Speaker 4>the only person who could see this or</v>
<v Speaker 4>are we all knew it.</v>

520
00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.140
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Malcolm Muggeridge knew it in the 1930s</v>

521
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:16.190
<v Speaker 4>what he was noting that the Soviets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>given their idea of class guilt,</v>

522
00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:20.760
<v Speaker 4>which sounds a lot like white privilege</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me or any other form of racism,</v>

523
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.610
<v Speaker 4>they use that doctrine to just round up</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the Kulaks they were the productive</v>

524
00:28:27.611 --> 00:28:31.810
<v Speaker 4>farmers and ship them off to Siberia and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then 6 million Ukrainian starve to</v>

525
00:28:31.811 --> 00:28:32.644
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

526
00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.650
<v Speaker 4>they had too many Ukrainians anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it didn't really matter.</v>

527
00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.730
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to the postmodern types.</v>

528
00:28:39.731 --> 00:28:40.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

529
00:28:40.721 --> 00:28:45.721
<v Speaker 4>this all came was revealed in such</v>
<v Speaker 4>painful detail that even the kind of</v>

530
00:28:45.851 --> 00:28:49.600
<v Speaker 4>closed minded India log that Norman</v>
<v Speaker 4>referred to just quite,</v>

531
00:28:49.601 --> 00:28:52.570
<v Speaker 4>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't quite muster up the moral</v>

532
00:28:52.571 --> 00:28:55.720
<v Speaker 4>courage to keep beating the same damn</v>
<v Speaker 4>drum.</v>

533
00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:00.160
<v Speaker 4>So what they did instead being highly</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent individuals was play a game</v>

534
00:29:00.161 --> 00:29:03.110
<v Speaker 4>of sleight of hand and transformed these</v>
<v Speaker 4>marks,</v>

535
00:29:03.111 --> 00:29:06.490
<v Speaker 4>his presuppositions into postmodernism</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the 1970s.</v>

536
00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.500
<v Speaker 4>And the idea basically was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

537
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.260
<v Speaker 4>the working class isn't going to rise up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and crush the burrs,</v>

538
00:29:11.261 --> 00:29:13.120
<v Speaker 4>waze,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because first of all they're getting</v>

539
00:29:13.121 --> 00:29:14.870
<v Speaker 4>rich and that wasn't supposed to happen.</v>

540
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:15.850
<v Speaker 4>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

541
00:29:15.851 --> 00:29:18.310
<v Speaker 4>it's sorted seemed to be a catastrophe</v>
<v Speaker 4>when that occurred,</v>

542
00:29:18.311 --> 00:29:21.310
<v Speaker 4>let's say in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so maybe we won't do that anymore</v>

543
00:29:21.311 --> 00:29:24.040
<v Speaker 4>because the working class actually isn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>buying into this either,</v>

544
00:29:24.041 --> 00:29:25.910
<v Speaker 4>which is also a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

545
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.030
<v Speaker 4>having internalized their own</v>
<v Speaker 4>oppression,</v>

546
00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:31.780
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't buy into this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the global myth of Utopia.</v>

547
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.420
<v Speaker 4>So maybe it's because they had some</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

548
00:29:34.421 --> 00:29:36.310
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>

549
00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.080
<v Speaker 4>the slight of hand was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

550
00:29:38.081 --> 00:29:39.670
<v Speaker 4>well fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll just play a different,</v>

551
00:29:39.671 --> 00:29:42.430
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oppressor versus gain and we'll</v>

552
00:29:42.431 --> 00:29:46.300
<v Speaker 4>introduce identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

553
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:47.051
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

554
00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:49.600
<v Speaker 4>You're not being oppressed because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a member of the working class.</v>

555
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:53.440
<v Speaker 4>You're being oppressed because you're a</v>
<v Speaker 4>woman or you're being oppressed because</v>

556
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.980
<v Speaker 4>you have an ethnicity that's outside the</v>
<v Speaker 4>main paradigm,</v>

557
00:29:56.981 --> 00:29:58.810
<v Speaker 4>whatever that might be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

558
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.970
<v Speaker 4>or it's because of your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

559
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.580
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your sexual preference or your sexual</v>

560
00:30:03.581 --> 00:30:04.990
<v Speaker 4>identity or whatever.</v>

561
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 4>Whatever places you in some manner</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside the normative culture.</v>

562
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:12.010
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing is the postmodernist you</v>

563
00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:12.701
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might think,</v>

564
00:30:12.701 --> 00:30:15.580
<v Speaker 4>well your culture is good for something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gives you a hierarchy of value.</v>

565
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.000
<v Speaker 4>It rewards competent people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gives you a direction so you can</v>

566
00:30:19.001 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 4>climb up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

567
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 4>cause otherwise everything's leveled to</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

568
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:23.000
<v Speaker 4>And then why do anything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

569
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.720
<v Speaker 4>they don't care about any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't believe that there's any such</v>

570
00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:27.940
<v Speaker 4>thing as competence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't believe that there's any such</v>

571
00:30:27.941 --> 00:30:31.240
<v Speaker 4>thing as up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is all postmodernism wipes,</v>

572
00:30:31.241 --> 00:30:34.700
<v Speaker 4>all of that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when the postmodernist tantalize</v>

573
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.390
<v Speaker 4>the text,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all they care about is how it privileges</v>

574
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:39.820
<v Speaker 4>the position of the author and who had</v>
<v Speaker 4>impresses.</v>

575
00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.100
<v Speaker 4>And that's the only thing they regard as</v>
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>

576
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:44.950
<v Speaker 4>And they don't believe in grand unifying</v>
<v Speaker 4>narratives.</v>

577
00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:46.840
<v Speaker 4>They don't believe that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canadian identity.</v>

578
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.730
<v Speaker 4>They don't believe that there's an</v>
<v Speaker 4>American identity.</v>

579
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.890
<v Speaker 4>They don't believe that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>western identity.</v>

580
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.320
<v Speaker 4>They don't believe that value structures</v>
<v Speaker 4>exist.</v>

581
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.600
<v Speaker 4>Or if they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are replaceable.</v>

582
00:30:55.601 --> 00:30:58.300
<v Speaker 4>With some other value structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they certainly don't believe that they</v>

583
00:30:58.301 --> 00:31:02.950
<v Speaker 4>have any biological grounding that</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's any such thing as a human being.</v>

584
00:31:02.951 --> 00:31:06.400
<v Speaker 4>It's all socially constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really convenient if what you</v>

585
00:31:06.401 --> 00:31:11.080
<v Speaker 4>want to do is be the author of an</v>
<v Speaker 4>entirely social constructed you utopia</v>

586
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.350
<v Speaker 4>that you can run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when the marks is say,</v>

587
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.500
<v Speaker 4>well that wasn't real Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it really means,</v>

588
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:19.210
<v Speaker 4>and I've thought about this for a long</v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

589
00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:22.720
<v Speaker 4>it's the most arrogant possible</v>
<v Speaker 4>statement anyone could ever make.</v>

590
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.930
<v Speaker 4>It means if I would've been installing</v>
<v Speaker 4>his position,</v>

591
00:31:25.931 --> 00:31:28.450
<v Speaker 4>I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sure didn't the damn utopia instead</v>

592
00:31:28.451 --> 00:31:33.370
<v Speaker 4>that instead of the genocidal massacres,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I understand the doctrine of</v>

593
00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:35.890
<v Speaker 4>Marxism and everything about me is good.</v>

594
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.730
<v Speaker 4>It's like well think again sunshine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't understand it,</v>

595
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.970
<v Speaker 4>you don't understand it and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>that good.</v>

596
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.750
<v Speaker 4>And if the power was in your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assuming you had the competence,</v>

597
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:50.590
<v Speaker 4>which you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't have done any better.</v>

598
00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:52.900
<v Speaker 4>And even if you had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there would have been someone else</v>

599
00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:56.890
<v Speaker 4>waiting right behind you to shoot you</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time you actually tried to do</v>

600
00:31:56.891 --> 00:31:59.230
<v Speaker 4>anything good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happened to all of the</v>

601
00:31:59.231 --> 00:32:03.730
<v Speaker 4>old guard who ran the damn revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stalin rounded them all up and shot them</v>

602
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.580
<v Speaker 4>along with their families and millions</v>
<v Speaker 4>of other people.</v>

603
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:11.530
<v Speaker 4>So even if you do happen to be that</v>
<v Speaker 4>Avatar of moral purity that you claim</v>

604
00:32:11.531 --> 00:32:14.260
<v Speaker 4>implicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the probability that you'd give it to</v>

605
00:32:14.261 --> 00:32:18.820
<v Speaker 4>act out your goodness in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 4>those possessed by Your radiology is</v>

606
00:32:18.821 --> 00:32:21.040
<v Speaker 4>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's</v>

607
00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:29.670
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

608
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:30.540
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

609
00:32:30.541 --> 00:32:32.730
<v Speaker 4>why are these postmodern is doing what</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing?</v>

610
00:32:32.731 --> 00:32:35.460
<v Speaker 4>Why did they oppose the patriarchic?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's a question,</v>

611
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.520
<v Speaker 4>why don't the feminists complaining</v>
<v Speaker 4>about Saudi Arabia?</v>

612
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:39.733
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

613
00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God sod,</v>

614
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.290
<v Speaker 4>who's this guy up concordia who is in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>business school so he can actually say</v>

615
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:54.980
<v Speaker 4>what he thinks now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he tweeted yesterday,</v>

616
00:32:54.981 --> 00:32:55.671
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

617
00:32:55.671 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 4>see tweeted to the woman's march.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

618
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.650
<v Speaker 4>cause there's little twitter thing you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could do that I suppose for the</v>

619
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:01.790
<v Speaker 4>organizers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

620
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.480
<v Speaker 4>why don't you go to the Middle East and</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a nice march again Saudi Arabia and</v>

621
00:33:05.481 --> 00:33:07.720
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see how that works out for Ya.</v>

622
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.980
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you think,</v>

623
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:11.420
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why not?</v>

624
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:12.500
<v Speaker 4>Like why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

625
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.790
<v Speaker 4>Why are the why or the radical left as</v>
<v Speaker 4>to are so much for rights everywhere.</v>

626
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:20.030
<v Speaker 4>That's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why aren't they complaining about Saudi</v>

627
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:20.863
<v Speaker 4>Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

628
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.920
<v Speaker 4>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>breeds a particularly pathological form</v>

629
00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:27.830
<v Speaker 4>of video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>logically rigid Islam that basically in</v>

630
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Speaker 4>slaves they're women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's to put it properly.</v>

631
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.010
<v Speaker 4>It's like why not complain about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well how about this?</v>

632
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.800
<v Speaker 4>The enemy of my enemy is my friend.</v>

633
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

634
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.670
<v Speaker 4>And so when push comes to shove,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see how much concern there is among</v>

635
00:33:41.671 --> 00:33:43.830
<v Speaker 4>the radical feminists for the rights of</v>
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>

636
00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like if the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the pushing those rights forward</v>

637
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:52.700
<v Speaker 4>doesn't also at the same time under a</v>
<v Speaker 4>undermine the western patriarchy,</v>

638
00:33:52.711 --> 00:33:55.890
<v Speaker 4>then we'll take the undermining and</v>
<v Speaker 4>leave the damn rights behind.</v>

639
00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:00.300
<v Speaker 4>And so there's an insight for you about</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly what's going on at the bottom of</v>

640
00:34:00.301 --> 00:34:02.010
<v Speaker 4>all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

641
00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.240
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then there's another weird thing,</v>

642
00:34:06.241 --> 00:34:08.460
<v Speaker 4>and I've already sort of hit on it</v>
<v Speaker 4>tangentially.</v>

643
00:34:08.461 --> 00:34:10.950
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well the postmodernists don't believe in</v>

644
00:34:10.951 --> 00:34:13.890
<v Speaker 4>grand unifying narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't believe in narratives at all.</v>

645
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.120
<v Speaker 4>They don't care about value because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>never know.</v>

646
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.070
<v Speaker 4>You have to value something in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in order to have some hope in life,</v>

647
00:34:20.071 --> 00:34:22.440
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when you value something,</v>

648
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.810
<v Speaker 4>you're pursuing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the pursuit,</v>

649
00:34:24.811 --> 00:34:27.150
<v Speaker 4>that's where the meaning in life is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

650
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.810
<v Speaker 4>cause the rest of it's suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're trying to struggle upwards</v>

651
00:34:30.811 --> 00:34:32.190
<v Speaker 4>towards the light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

652
00:34:32.191 --> 00:34:36.360
<v Speaker 4>well that's something to motivate you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to protect you against the</v>

653
00:34:36.361 --> 00:34:38.730
<v Speaker 4>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the postmodernists don't care about</v>

654
00:34:38.731 --> 00:34:41.310
<v Speaker 4>any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say it's because they don't</v>

655
00:34:41.311 --> 00:34:42.390
<v Speaker 4>care about suffering.</v>

656
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

657
00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.770
<v Speaker 4>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so here,</v>

658
00:34:46.771 --> 00:34:48.690
<v Speaker 4>but here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the final question.</v>

659
00:34:48.691 --> 00:34:49.524
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

660
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.550
<v Speaker 4>if the postmodernists don't care about</v>
<v Speaker 4>grand unifying narratives and they don't</v>

661
00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.040
<v Speaker 4>believe in identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why in the world are they willing to</v>

662
00:34:56.041 --> 00:35:01.041
<v Speaker 4>believe in gender identity and sexual</v>
<v Speaker 4>identity and racial identity and ethnic</v>

663
00:35:01.411 --> 00:35:03.330
<v Speaker 4>identity?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer to that is,</v>

664
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:04.800
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't,</v>

665
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.130
<v Speaker 4>but they don't care because coherence</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't on their agenda.</v>

666
00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.220
<v Speaker 4>And besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when push comes to shove,</v>

667
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.880
<v Speaker 4>they're postmodernism is nested inside a</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeper Marxism.</v>

668
00:35:14.881 --> 00:35:17.550
<v Speaker 4>And so when the postmodern narrative</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't suffice,</v>

669
00:35:17.551 --> 00:35:20.610
<v Speaker 4>say to push forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that Western civilization</v>

670
00:35:20.611 --> 00:35:23.880
<v Speaker 4>should be overturned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just revert back to the over</v>

671
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.680
<v Speaker 4>arching Marxism and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

672
00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.350
<v Speaker 4>those people are oppressed and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad thing.</v>

673
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.430
<v Speaker 4>It's like you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

674
00:35:29.431 --> 00:35:32.460
<v Speaker 4>you're a postmodernist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you'll believe in any of that.</v>

675
00:35:32.461 --> 00:35:33.294
<v Speaker 4>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

676
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:35.550
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm only a postmodernist this deep.</v>

677
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:39.900
<v Speaker 4>But underneath that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I can always rely on that to fill in</v>

678
00:35:39.901 --> 00:35:42.030
<v Speaker 4>the gaps and that's exactly what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

679
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.870
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's what's happening as far as I</v>

680
00:35:45.871 --> 00:35:47.340
<v Speaker 4>can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

681
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 4>so why do I believe this will all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a little war going on in our</v>

682
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:53.310
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's not so little.</v>

683
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.920
<v Speaker 4>I put my finger on it and I wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>recommend that,</v>

684
00:35:55.921 --> 00:35:57.270
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

685
00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.130
<v Speaker 4>because okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you explain it man.</v>

686
00:35:59.131 --> 00:36:02.610
<v Speaker 4>You explain why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like 3 million people have watched the</v>

687
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 4>UFT free speech rally and I think 7</v>
<v Speaker 4>million people downloaded the Joe Rogan</v>

688
00:36:07.771 --> 00:36:09.660
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like crazy.</v>

689
00:36:09.661 --> 00:36:12.810
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was 180 newspaper articles about</v>

690
00:36:12.811 --> 00:36:15.180
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was news for four months.</v>

691
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.940
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who cares what I think,</v>

692
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.490
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even care that much about what</v>

693
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:25.550
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about trump?</v>

694
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.760
<v Speaker 4>What's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on there?</v>

695
00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:33.770
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

696
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:38.930
<v Speaker 4>it was interesting listening to trump's</v>
<v Speaker 4>inauguration speech because I detected</v>

697
00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:41.400
<v Speaker 4>elements of national socialists thought</v>
<v Speaker 4>in it,</v>

698
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not being dismissive.</v>

699
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:48.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm seriously not being dismissive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you radically activate on the</v>

700
00:36:48.931 --> 00:36:52.830
<v Speaker 4>side of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you call forth compensate Tory forces</v>

701
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:56.460
<v Speaker 4>and they're not in your control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like trump opened his speech,</v>

702
00:36:56.461 --> 00:36:57.370
<v Speaker 4>he just read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

703
00:36:57.371 --> 00:36:59.640
<v Speaker 4>he sounds like a 1950 socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

704
00:36:59.641 --> 00:37:03.840
<v Speaker 4>he's going to use the power of the state</v>
<v Speaker 4>to bring the industry home to produce a</v>

705
00:37:03.841 --> 00:37:07.110
<v Speaker 4>lot of infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a state business unity with the</v>

706
00:37:07.111 --> 00:37:10.050
<v Speaker 4>state in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then at the end of his speech,</v>

707
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.260
<v Speaker 4>which is where he stopped speeding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least the international kind of</v>

708
00:37:13.261 --> 00:37:14.250
<v Speaker 4>socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

709
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.530
<v Speaker 4>well borders are really important and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>is national identity.</v>

710
00:37:17.531 --> 00:37:20.250
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does embed that within belief in God,</v>

711
00:37:20.251 --> 00:37:24.090
<v Speaker 4>which is probably a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assuming that he's serious about that.</v>

712
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.920
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that trump was elected in the</v>

713
00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:30.810
<v Speaker 4>end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there was such a fight between him</v>

714
00:37:30.811 --> 00:37:33.540
<v Speaker 4>and the Clintonites and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that the Clinton nights were playing</v>

715
00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:36.450
<v Speaker 4>identity politics instead of speaking</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the working class,</v>

716
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.060
<v Speaker 4>who then trump co-opted like he should</v>
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>

717
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.790
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there there's a war going on there.</v>

718
00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:43.260
<v Speaker 4>And then what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about brexit?</v>

719
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:46.170
<v Speaker 4>What's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what about France with Marine Le Pen</v>

720
00:37:46.171 --> 00:37:49.410
<v Speaker 4>and what about Holand with wielders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

721
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.490
<v Speaker 4>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're in a chaotic time and you know,</v>

722
00:37:53.491 --> 00:37:57.150
<v Speaker 4>I've gotten letters from people all over</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world who tell me how they can't say</v>

723
00:37:57.151 --> 00:37:58.260
<v Speaker 4>what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

724
00:37:58.261 --> 00:37:59.580
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's not very good.</v>

725
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:02.610
<v Speaker 4>And they're kind of happy with me</v>
<v Speaker 4>because maybe they think that I</v>

726
00:38:02.611 --> 00:38:05.670
<v Speaker 4>emboldened them in some way and so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good for that.</v>

727
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.310
<v Speaker 4>Hypothetically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And most of the people who wrote me the</v>

728
00:38:08.311 --> 00:38:12.120
<v Speaker 4>overwhelming majority were reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So pretty happy about that too.</v>

729
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.580
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe I'm wrong about my damn</v>

730
00:38:14.581 --> 00:38:19.380
<v Speaker 4>diagnosis because like what do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I do have this proclivity to get to</v>

731
00:38:19.381 --> 00:38:23.700
<v Speaker 4>the bottom of things and what's out the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom of this as an ideological war or</v>

732
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:24.780
<v Speaker 4>philosophical war.</v>

733
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.420
<v Speaker 4>It's even deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might even be deeper than a</v>

734
00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:29.820
<v Speaker 4>philosophical board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is something that's more like a</v>

735
00:38:29.821 --> 00:38:32.820
<v Speaker 4>metaphysical or theological war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

736
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:37.120
<v Speaker 4>It depends on how far down you look and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the know exactly what they're doing.</v>

737
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:38.590
<v Speaker 4>This isn't accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

738
00:38:38.591 --> 00:38:42.180
<v Speaker 4>you shut down speakers you don't agree</v>
<v Speaker 4>with because you can't have a dialogue</v>

739
00:38:42.181 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 4>with him then anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because human beings can't have</v>

740
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:46.660
<v Speaker 4>dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no such thing as a human</v>

741
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:48.580
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no such thing as truth.</v>

742
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:52.930
<v Speaker 4>Here's the postmodern world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the hubs Z and nightmare.</v>

743
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:56.500
<v Speaker 4>It's everyone against everyone else</v>
<v Speaker 4>except it's not individuals.</v>

744
00:38:56.501 --> 00:39:00.310
<v Speaker 4>It's groups and you're stuck in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>damn group and it's the only thing about</v>

745
00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:00.880
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

746
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.910
<v Speaker 4>that's relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why we might base our hiring on</v>

747
00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:05.020
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

748
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:08.830
<v Speaker 4>and you're oppressed and even if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know it just only because you've</v>

749
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:11.320
<v Speaker 4>internalized it and it's the only thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's real about you.</v>

750
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:16.300
<v Speaker 4>Anyways and I can't talk to you because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in my own little silo of privileged</v>

751
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:18.730
<v Speaker 4>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And besides we can't use logic because</v>

752
00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:21.640
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you're in a group and I'm in a</v>

753
00:39:21.641 --> 00:39:25.600
<v Speaker 4>group and all we can do is have a war or</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can talk,</v>

754
00:39:25.601 --> 00:39:28.750
<v Speaker 4>but we don't get to talk cause he can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk if you're a postmodernist because</v>

755
00:39:28.751 --> 00:39:33.700
<v Speaker 4>speech is just chatter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when it's just chatter that supports</v>

756
00:39:33.701 --> 00:39:36.310
<v Speaker 4>the people in power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how they think.</v>

757
00:39:36.311 --> 00:39:41.311
<v Speaker 4>And so the whole world is this little</v>
<v Speaker 4>armed war of identity group against</v>

758
00:39:41.681 --> 00:39:46.360
<v Speaker 4>identity group against identity group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you shut down people who don't agree</v>

759
00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:49.120
<v Speaker 4>with you because why should you let them</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk?</v>

760
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.320
<v Speaker 4>It's you don't believe in any of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons why you would let someone talk.</v>

761
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:57.160
<v Speaker 4>So this isn't accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not because they're afraid.</v>

762
00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.400
<v Speaker 4>Although it's also because of that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>hijack,</v>

763
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fear,</v>

764
00:40:02.291 --> 00:40:06.430
<v Speaker 4>they hijack compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make anyone who who puts forward an</v>

765
00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:11.431
<v Speaker 4>alternative view into a terrorist of</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas and someone who's heartless at the</v>

766
00:40:11.531 --> 00:40:14.380
<v Speaker 4>core,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really incredibly intelligent.</v>

767
00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:18.790
<v Speaker 4>It's such a good strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so devious and brilliant and it's</v>

768
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:22.840
<v Speaker 4>so effective because who wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who the hell wants to be labeled a</v>

769
00:40:22.841 --> 00:40:24.760
<v Speaker 4>bigot?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You probably are a damn big.</v>

770
00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:28.630
<v Speaker 4>It just like everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know when it's easy to make</v>

771
00:40:28.631 --> 00:40:30.970
<v Speaker 4>people feel guilty about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe they should.</v>

772
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.410
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>

773
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.860
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what do you do about it?</v>

774
00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:40.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you do about it,</v>

775
00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:43.300
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's when I'd been working on for</v>

776
00:40:43.301 --> 00:40:46.060
<v Speaker 4>like 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of the problems with</v>

777
00:40:46.061 --> 00:40:48.820
<v Speaker 4>postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to take five minutes and</v>

778
00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:51.490
<v Speaker 4>then we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the problems with postmodernism</v>

779
00:40:51.491 --> 00:40:54.040
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a big problem,</v>

780
00:40:54.041 --> 00:40:57.310
<v Speaker 4>like this is a fatal problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apart from the fact that it's incoherent</v>

781
00:40:57.311 --> 00:41:00.520
<v Speaker 4>and there's no value structure in it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fundamentally divisive and</v>

782
00:41:00.521 --> 00:41:03.490
<v Speaker 4>destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a logical problem with a two</v>

783
00:41:03.491 --> 00:41:06.250
<v Speaker 4>that's even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you might be noticing that the</v>

784
00:41:06.251 --> 00:41:09.570
<v Speaker 4>lgbt set of acronyms keeps growing hay</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>

785
00:41:09.571 --> 00:41:10.480
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Kinda,</v>

786
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.480
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a form of it's own parody</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some sense.</v>

787
00:41:13.481 --> 00:41:13.901
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

788
00:41:13.901 --> 00:41:14.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

789
00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:15.341
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

790
00:41:15.341 --> 00:41:16.050
<v Speaker 4>you are.</v>

791
00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:17.860
<v Speaker 4>And while I'm impressed too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

792
00:41:17.861 --> 00:41:21.820
<v Speaker 4>you're also oppressed and maybe I'm even</v>
<v Speaker 4>pressing you being part of this other</v>

793
00:41:21.821 --> 00:41:23.980
<v Speaker 4>marginalized group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least we share oppression.</v>

794
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.510
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm also oppressed.</v>

795
00:41:25.511 --> 00:41:26.230
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so am I.</v>

796
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm oppressed too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

797
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:30.640
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so here's the problem.</v>

798
00:41:30.641 --> 00:41:33.100
<v Speaker 4>There's a big problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is,</v>

799
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.290
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're oppressed,</v>

800
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.530
<v Speaker 4>you're oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're oppressed,</v>

801
00:41:36.531 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 4>you're oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God only knows why.</v>

802
00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.130
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you're too short,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you know what,</v>

803
00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:42.050
<v Speaker 4>as beautiful as you could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>

804
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:45.020
<v Speaker 4>your parent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your grandparent was a surf likely</v>

805
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:47.720
<v Speaker 4>because almost everybody's granted great</v>
<v Speaker 4>grandparent was,</v>

806
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.010
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

807
00:41:49.011 --> 00:41:52.490
<v Speaker 4>and you're not as smart as he could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have a sick relative and you</v>

808
00:41:52.491 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 4>have your own physical problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

809
00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:57.530
<v Speaker 4>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a mass and you're oppressed in</v>

810
00:41:57.531 --> 00:42:00.500
<v Speaker 4>every possible way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including your ancestry and your</v>

811
00:42:00.501 --> 00:42:04.490
<v Speaker 4>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the entire sum of human history has</v>

812
00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:08.690
<v Speaker 4>conspired to produce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>victimized you with all your individual</v>

813
00:42:08.691 --> 00:42:10.430
<v Speaker 4>pathological problems.</v>

814
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:11.660
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

815
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:13.850
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

816
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.550
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that it is true.</v>

817
00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:19.950
<v Speaker 4>And so if you take the oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to fractionate them and</v>

818
00:42:19.951 --> 00:42:21.980
<v Speaker 4>fractured ate them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're a woman.</v>

819
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.521
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

820
00:42:22.521 --> 00:42:23.600
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a black woman.</v>

821
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a black woman who has two children.</v>

822
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.800
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a black woman who has two children</v>

823
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:30.260
<v Speaker 4>and one of them isn't very healthy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

824
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.220
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

825
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Hispanic woman and I have a genius</v>
<v Speaker 4>son who doesn't have any money so that</v>

826
00:42:35.151 --> 00:42:38.840
<v Speaker 4>he cannot go to university and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a hell of a time getting across</v>

827
00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:40.580
<v Speaker 4>the border.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really hard on me to get my</v>

828
00:42:40.581 --> 00:42:43.340
<v Speaker 4>citizenship and my husband is an</v>
<v Speaker 4>alcoholic brute.</v>

829
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:44.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

830
00:42:44.301 --> 00:42:46.940
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sucks too and so well,</v>

831
00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:48.020
<v Speaker 4>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

832
00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:52.880
<v Speaker 4>let's fix all your oppressive oppression</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'll take every single thing into</v>

833
00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:54.190
<v Speaker 4>account and then we'll fix yours too.</v>

834
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Speaker 4>We'll take every single thing into</v>
<v Speaker 4>account.</v>

835
00:42:56.091 --> 00:42:56.901
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

836
00:42:56.901 --> 00:43:00.230
<v Speaker 4>you won't because you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>

837
00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.350
<v Speaker 4>It is technically impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

838
00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:05.690
<v Speaker 4>you can't even list all the ways that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're oppressed.</v>

839
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.550
<v Speaker 4>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to weight them?</v>

840
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:09.800
<v Speaker 4>Third,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's going to decide,</v>

841
00:43:09.801 --> 00:43:12.770
<v Speaker 4>and that's the bloody thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's going to decide?</v>

842
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:14.800
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

843
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:17.900
<v Speaker 4>what's the answer in the West?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like in free markets.</v>

844
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:20.390
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ will never be able to solve this</v>

845
00:43:20.391 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one can solve it.</v>

846
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.890
<v Speaker 4>What are we going to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to outsource it to the</v>

847
00:43:24.891 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Speaker 4>marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to take your,</v>

848
00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:29.450
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pathetic being and you're going to try</v>

849
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:34.310
<v Speaker 4>to offer me something that may be I want</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to take my story pathetic</v>

850
00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:35.810
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to say,</v>

851
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:39.860
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all things considered as well as I can</v>

852
00:43:39.861 --> 00:43:42.980
<v Speaker 4>understand that maybe I could give you</v>
<v Speaker 4>this much money,</v>

853
00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:47.490
<v Speaker 4>which is actually a promise for that</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and you've packed all of your damn</v>

854
00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:51.380
<v Speaker 4>old pressured into the price and I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>packed on my oppression into the</v>

855
00:43:51.381 --> 00:43:54.350
<v Speaker 4>willingness to pay it and that solution</v>
<v Speaker 4>sucks.</v>

856
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.770
<v Speaker 4>It's a bad solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But compared to every other solution,</v>

857
00:43:57.771 --> 00:43:59.140
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's white.</v>

858
00:43:59.141 --> 00:44:02.640
<v Speaker 4>10% of us have freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so there,</v>

859
00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:05.390
<v Speaker 4>there's a tremendous illogic at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bottom of this.</v>

860
00:44:05.391 --> 00:44:09.740
<v Speaker 4>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to fraction eight theo pressed</v>

861
00:44:09.741 --> 00:44:12.290
<v Speaker 4>all the way down to the level of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>

862
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:14.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what the West figured out.</v>

863
00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a couple of figures who at the</v>

864
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:19.730
<v Speaker 4>mythological roots of our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

865
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.700
<v Speaker 4>people get upset with me because I bring</v>
<v Speaker 4>in religious themes,</v>

866
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:25.480
<v Speaker 4>but I understand some things about</v>
<v Speaker 4>mythology and religion.</v>

867
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.700
<v Speaker 4>It's not an accident that the axiomatic</v>
<v Speaker 4>western individual is someone who was</v>

868
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:35.190
<v Speaker 4>unfairly nailed to a cross and torture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

869
00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.710
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

870
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:42.240
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do you do about that?</v>

871
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.590
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought about that for a long time</v>

872
00:44:46.591 --> 00:44:47.424
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

873
00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:50.040
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get together in a damn Bob,</v>

874
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:54.390
<v Speaker 4>because all that does is allow you to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>as horrible as you could possibly</v>

875
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:56.940
<v Speaker 4>imagine and suffer from none of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences.</v>

876
00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.540
<v Speaker 4>That's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how about we don't do that?</v>

877
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.690
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a deep idea in the west too.</v>

878
00:45:03.691 --> 00:45:08.160
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pick up your damn suffering and Barrett.</v>

879
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:09.203
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

880
00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.410
<v Speaker 4>And try to be a good person so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it worse.</v>

881
00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:14.733
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

882
00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:17.200
<v Speaker 4>well that's a truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

883
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:22.120
<v Speaker 4>I read a lot about the terrible things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people have done to each other.</v>

884
00:45:22.121 --> 00:45:26.410
<v Speaker 4>You just cannot even imagine it so</v>
<v Speaker 4>awful.</v>

885
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.090
<v Speaker 4>So you don't want to be someone like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

886
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.890
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a reason to be?</v>

887
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:35.610
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a lots of reasons to be God.</v>

888
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:38.130
<v Speaker 4>There's reasons to be resentful about</v>
<v Speaker 4>your existence.</v>

889
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:41.830
<v Speaker 4>Everyone you know is going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you too,</v>

890
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.910
<v Speaker 4>and there's going to be a fair bit of</v>
<v Speaker 4>pain along the way and lots of it's</v>

891
00:45:44.911 --> 00:45:46.350
<v Speaker 4>going to be unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

892
00:45:46.351 --> 00:45:48.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no wonder you're resentful.</v>

893
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.820
<v Speaker 4>It's like act it out and see what</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

894
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.570
<v Speaker 4>You make everything you're complaining</v>
<v Speaker 4>about infinitely worse.</v>

895
00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:58.830
<v Speaker 4>There's this idea that hell is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bottomless pit and that's because no</v>

896
00:45:58.831 --> 00:46:01.410
<v Speaker 4>matter how bad is some stupid son of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>

897
00:46:01.411 --> 00:46:04.350
<v Speaker 4>like you could figure out a way to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>it a lot worse.</v>

898
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.420
<v Speaker 4>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

899
00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:08.790
<v Speaker 4>what do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

900
00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:11.280
<v Speaker 4>you accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what life is like.</v>

901
00:46:11.281 --> 00:46:14.880
<v Speaker 4>It's suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the religious people have</v>

902
00:46:14.881 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 4>always said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life is suffering.</v>

903
00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:19.050
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

904
00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:20.400
<v Speaker 4>who wants to admit that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

905
00:46:20.401 --> 00:46:22.290
<v Speaker 4>just think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

906
00:46:22.291 --> 00:46:24.240
<v Speaker 4>so what do you do in the face of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering?</v>

907
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.300
<v Speaker 4>Try to reduce it.</v>

908
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

909
00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.910
<v Speaker 4>start with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What good are you?</v>

910
00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:34.060
<v Speaker 4>Get yourself together for Christ sake so</v>
<v Speaker 4>that when your father dies,</v>

911
00:46:34.061 --> 00:46:37.690
<v Speaker 4>you're not wining away in a corner and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can help plan the funeral and you</v>

912
00:46:37.691 --> 00:46:40.900
<v Speaker 4>can stand up solidly so that people can</v>
<v Speaker 4>rely on you.</v>

913
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.070
<v Speaker 4>That's better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who'll be a damn victim course.</v>

914
00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:47.290
<v Speaker 4>You're a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus obviously</v>

915
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:52.700
<v Speaker 4>put yourself together and then maybe if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put yourself together,</v>

916
00:46:52.701 --> 00:46:54.890
<v Speaker 4>you know how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what's wrong with you,</v>

917
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:57.200
<v Speaker 4>if you'll admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know there's a few things you could</v>

918
00:46:57.201 --> 00:47:00.680
<v Speaker 4>like paulie sharp a little bit that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>might even be able to manage.</v>

919
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.220
<v Speaker 4>You're insufficient present condition</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you might shine yourself up a</v>

920
00:47:05.221 --> 00:47:07.640
<v Speaker 4>little bit and then your eyes will be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little more open.</v>

921
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:11.190
<v Speaker 4>Then you can sign yourself up a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit more and then maybe you could bring</v>

922
00:47:11.191 --> 00:47:14.460
<v Speaker 4>your family together instead of having</v>
<v Speaker 4>them be the hateful,</v>

923
00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:17.850
<v Speaker 4>spiteful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>neurotic in fighting batch that you're</v>

924
00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.550
<v Speaker 4>like doom to spend Christmas with.</v>

925
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.380
<v Speaker 4>So then you fix yourself up a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit,</v>

926
00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:28.530
<v Speaker 4>kind of humbly because you know God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a fixer upper.</v>

927
00:47:28.531 --> 00:47:31.360
<v Speaker 4>If there ever was one and then you got</v>
<v Speaker 4>to figure out,</v>

928
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:34.360
<v Speaker 4>well what can you figure out how to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>peace with your idiot brother and</v>

929
00:47:34.361 --> 00:47:36.880
<v Speaker 4>probably not because he's just as dumb</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you,</v>

930
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:38.860
<v Speaker 4>so the holiday hell are you going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>manage that?</v>

931
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.460
<v Speaker 4>And so then you've maybe you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere that way and your family sort</v>

932
00:47:42.461 --> 00:47:45.580
<v Speaker 4>of functioning and you find out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that kind of relieved a little bit</v>

933
00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:48.400
<v Speaker 4>of suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although it reduce the opportunities for</v>

934
00:47:48.401 --> 00:47:53.140
<v Speaker 4>spiteful revenge and that's kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>pain in the neck and so then you get</v>

935
00:47:53.141 --> 00:47:57.280
<v Speaker 4>your family together a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 4>your little clued in then at least a bit</v>

936
00:47:57.281 --> 00:48:00.400
<v Speaker 4>because you've done something difficult</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's actually difficult.</v>

937
00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:04.270
<v Speaker 4>You're a little wiser and so then maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could put an tend to do finger out</v>

938
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.320
<v Speaker 4>beyond the family and try to change some</v>
<v Speaker 4>little thing without racking it.</v>

939
00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:12.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like our society is complex and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>teach our students that they could just</v>

940
00:48:12.641 --> 00:48:15.910
<v Speaker 4>fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like go fix a military helicopter</v>

941
00:48:15.911 --> 00:48:19.150
<v Speaker 4>and see how far you get with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're going to get a dude,</v>

942
00:48:19.151 --> 00:48:21.610
<v Speaker 4>you're like a chimp with a wrench.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whack.</v>

943
00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 4>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's better.</v>

944
00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:24.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

945
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:26.830
<v Speaker 4>it's not better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things are complicated.</v>

946
00:48:26.831 --> 00:48:31.831
<v Speaker 4>And to fix things is really hard and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to be like a golden tool to fix</v>

947
00:48:32.861 --> 00:48:36.100
<v Speaker 4>things and you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

948
00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:38.320
<v Speaker 4>and that's the other message of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>West.</v>

949
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like how do you overcome the</v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering of the of life?</v>

950
00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.980
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying it's only the message</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the West.</v>

951
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:49.120
<v Speaker 4>How do you overcome the suffering of</v>
<v Speaker 4>life is be a better person.</v>

952
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.760
<v Speaker 4>That's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

953
00:48:51.761 --> 00:48:54.820
<v Speaker 4>that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes responsibility.</v>

954
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:55.901
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

955
00:48:55.901 --> 00:48:58.750
<v Speaker 4>if you said to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to have a meaningful life,</v>

956
00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:01.120
<v Speaker 4>everything you do matters.</v>

957
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:03.430
<v Speaker 4>That's a definition of a meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

958
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:07.510
<v Speaker 4>But everything you do matters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to carry that with</v>

959
00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:10.870
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or do you want to just forget about the</v>

960
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:14.890
<v Speaker 4>whole meaning thing and then you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have any responsibility because who the</v>

961
00:49:14.891 --> 00:49:17.350
<v Speaker 4>hell cares?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can wander through life doing</v>

962
00:49:17.351 --> 00:49:18.880
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gratifying,</v>

963
00:49:18.881 --> 00:49:22.030
<v Speaker 4>impulsive desires for how useful that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be.</v>

964
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:26.110
<v Speaker 4>And you're stuck in meaninglessness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you don't have any responsibility,</v>

965
00:49:26.111 --> 00:49:28.330
<v Speaker 4>which one do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

966
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:33.310
<v Speaker 4>ask yourself which one are you pursuing</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'll find very rapidly that it</v>

967
00:49:33.311 --> 00:49:37.720
<v Speaker 4>isn't the majority of your soul that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>pursuing the whole meaning thing</v>

968
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.240
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well look what you have to do to do</v>

969
00:49:40.241 --> 00:49:41.074
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

970
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.630
<v Speaker 4>Have to take on the fact that life is</v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering.</v>

971
00:49:43.631 --> 00:49:46.540
<v Speaker 4>You have put yourself together in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>face of that.</v>

972
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:48.910
<v Speaker 4>Well that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ,</v>

973
00:49:48.911 --> 00:49:50.620
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People can even do it.</v>

974
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:55.860
<v Speaker 4>I'm stunned every day when I go outside</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it isn't a re a riot with everything</v>

975
00:49:56.411 --> 00:49:57.880
<v Speaker 4>burning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could really,</v>

976
00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:01.570
<v Speaker 4>God you talk to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I knew this guy,</v>

977
00:50:01.571 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 4>he'd been in a motorcycle accident and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really ruined him and he was like a</v>

978
00:50:05.381 --> 00:50:06.161
<v Speaker 4>linesman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

979
00:50:06.161 --> 00:50:09.640
<v Speaker 4>working on the power and he was working</v>
<v Speaker 4>with someone who had Parkinson's disease</v>

980
00:50:09.641 --> 00:50:14.641
<v Speaker 4>and they had complimentary inadequacies</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so two of them could do the job of</v>

981
00:50:15.821 --> 00:50:19.630
<v Speaker 4>one person and so they're out there</v>
<v Speaker 4>fixing power lines in the freezing cold</v>

982
00:50:19.631 --> 00:50:23.560
<v Speaker 4>despite the fact that one was three</v>
<v Speaker 4>quarters wrecked with a motorcycle</v>

983
00:50:23.561 --> 00:50:25.510
<v Speaker 4>accident and the other one had</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parkinson's.</v>

984
00:50:25.511 --> 00:50:30.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's how our works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's all these ruled people</v>

985
00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:32.240
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got problems like you can't</v>

986
00:50:32.241 --> 00:50:35.360
<v Speaker 4>believe off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go to work and do things they don't</v>

987
00:50:35.361 --> 00:50:36.500
<v Speaker 4>even like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and look,</v>

988
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:38.210
<v Speaker 4>the lights are on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My God.</v>

989
00:50:38.211 --> 00:50:39.470
<v Speaker 4>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

990
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:42.020
<v Speaker 4>it's a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a miracle.</v>

991
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.440
<v Speaker 4>And we're so ungrateful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>College students,</v>

992
00:50:45.441 --> 00:50:47.900
<v Speaker 4>the postmodern types,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're so ungrateful.</v>

993
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.240
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't know that they're surrounded</v>

994
00:50:50.241 --> 00:50:51.980
<v Speaker 4>by it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a bloody miracle.</v>

995
00:50:51.981 --> 00:50:54.560
<v Speaker 4>It's a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It all this stuff works that all you</v>

996
00:50:54.561 --> 00:50:56.840
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chimpanzees that don't know each other</v>

997
00:50:56.841 --> 00:51:01.520
<v Speaker 4>can sit in the same room for two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweltering away without tearing each</v>

998
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:03.920
<v Speaker 4>other apart because that's what chimps</v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

999
00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:05.283
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1000
00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:12.730
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what happened?</v>

1001
00:51:12.731 --> 00:51:15.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made some videos and I got to the</v>

1002
00:51:15.101 --> 00:51:17.680
<v Speaker 4>bottom of some things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least as far as I can tell.</v>

1003
00:51:17.681 --> 00:51:20.830
<v Speaker 4>So I told you what the bottom is and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I got this idea about what you</v>

1004
00:51:20.831 --> 00:51:23.260
<v Speaker 4>might do about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which isn't my idea.</v>

1005
00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:24.790
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not my idea.</v>

1006
00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:26.020
<v Speaker 4>It's an old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old,</v>

1007
00:51:26.021 --> 00:51:26.980
<v Speaker 4>old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old idea.</v>

1008
00:51:26.981 --> 00:51:30.020
<v Speaker 4>It's far older than Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all,</v>

1009
00:51:30.021 --> 00:51:34.720
<v Speaker 4>it's the oldest story of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get yourself together,</v>

1010
00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:39.550
<v Speaker 4>transcend your suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see if you can be some kind of hero,</v>

1011
00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:43.270
<v Speaker 4>make the suffering in the world less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1012
00:51:43.271 --> 00:51:45.400
<v Speaker 4>that's the way forward as far as I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell,</v>

1013
00:51:45.401 --> 00:51:47.770
<v Speaker 4>if there isn't any way forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Knots,</v>

1014
00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:50.080
<v Speaker 4>what's under assault by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodernists?</v>

1015
00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.780
<v Speaker 4>So look out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause they know exactly what they're</v>

1016
00:51:52.781 --> 00:51:55.450
<v Speaker 4>doing and they know exactly why they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>

1017
00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.520
<v Speaker 4>And that's what it looks like to me.</v>

1018
00:51:58.310 --> 00:51:59.143
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1019
00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:01.613
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

1020
00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:07.220
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
