1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Good Morning Boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls,</v>

2
00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>and interested others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said a couple of days ago,</v>

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:07.164
<v Speaker 1>last week that I was going to produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>three videos on political correctness </v>

4
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>and that the third one would be about </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactics.</v>

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.923
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm doing this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably produce a number of </v>

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:16.704
<v Speaker 1>relatively short videos on tactics </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that that might be more </v>

7
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>effective way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to disseminate them.</v>

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>And so by tactics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to figure out is how the</v>

9
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.013
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric surrounding these issues can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>translated into effective action at the </v>

10
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:32.334
<v Speaker 1>individual level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hoping that people who want to </v>

11
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>play a tactical game with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a PC extremists,</v>

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.033
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it upon themselves as individuals </v>

13
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>to stand up against this and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully do something about it.</v>

14
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not going to be an easy thing</v>

15
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:48.504
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully we can do it with some </v>

16
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:51.744
<v Speaker 1>good humor and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some and some and a light touch and </v>

17
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>a bit of detachment and in a peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thoughtful and rational way.</v>

18
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.263
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to propose a game today</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've designed with some of the </v>

19
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>people who are helping me think this </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

20
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>And I'm gonna walk you through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

21
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>So we're gonna start by talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the PC game and the PC game is a form of</v>

22
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>videology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

23
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.393
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what an ideology does is attempt to </v>

24
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:19.314
<v Speaker 1>simplify the world in a very radical way</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it indicates to it's holders </v>

25
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>that they have understanding even when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

26
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>And that way it reduces uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty,</v>

27
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:28.824
<v Speaker 1>and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also helps them improve their </v>

28
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>short term regulation because if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can view themselves,</v>

29
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>idiot logs can view themselves as proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>game players,</v>

30
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>then they can feel good about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>position in the world.</v>

31
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.493
<v Speaker 1>And so the purpose of the PC game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is technically a biased </v>

32
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:44.634
<v Speaker 1>compression algorithm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it does is it takes the complexity </v>

33
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>of the world and compresses it to a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple axioms.</v>

34
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it does that.</v>

35
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a biased impression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your algorithm,</v>

36
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:54.534
<v Speaker 1>I think because it doesn't accurately </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the complexity of the world </v>

37
00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>across,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the full array of,</v>

38
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>of detail necessary to deal with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively.</v>

39
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

40
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>so here are the rules of the PC game </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

41
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>and this is I think what's taught to </v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

42
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.943
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on mouse in universities now as an </v>

43
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.893
<v Speaker 1>alternative to actual critical thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the development of a comprehensive </v>

44
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>and powerful and a functional individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>

45
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 1>It's the alternative to wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it.</v>

46
00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here are the rules of the PC game.</v>

47
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is identify an area of human</v>

48
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be any error of human activity.</v>

49
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be sports,</v>

50
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>it could be writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be socioeconomic status,</v>

51
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>it could be that the garnering of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>

52
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.413
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter anywhere where people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing something that can be </v>

53
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>identifiably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>measured in terms of its outcome and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluate along that way.</v>

55
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Then the next thing you do is you note </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a distribution of success.</v>

56
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And of course there's a distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>success in any human creative activity.</v>

57
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because in most human </v>
<v Speaker 1>domains of activity,</v>

58
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>there are winner take all games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's called a pareto distribution.</v>

59
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>You can look that up if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>P,</v>

60
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>R,</v>

61
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.031
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>
<v Speaker 1>t,</v>

62
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:07.864
<v Speaker 1>O,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most domains of human creative </v>

63
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>achievement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followup prieto distribution.</v>

64
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

65
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>that a very small minority of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have most of the money.</v>

66
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.143
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also true that a small minority of </v>

67
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.713
<v Speaker 1>authors write most of the books and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>small minority of those who sell books </v>

68
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>the biggest bestsellers and why a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>small number of recordings,</v>

70
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>audio recordings become successful.</v>

71
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>And why a very small number of players </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominate each game.</v>

72
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:35.674
<v Speaker 1>And it's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's definitely a distribution of </v>

73
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>success in any domain of human activity.</v>

74
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.083
<v Speaker 1>So you note that then what you do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify the people who are being </v>

75
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:43.564
<v Speaker 1>successful as winners and the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are being relatively unsuccessful as </v>

76
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>losers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

77
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.353
<v Speaker 1>And then you claim that the losers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>losing only because they are oppressed </v>

78
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:54.034
<v Speaker 1>by the winters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can dispense with things like </v>

79
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 1>competence and quality when you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

80
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's really useful if you're an </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy of competence and quality.</v>

81
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.953
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you claim that the losers are losing </v>

82
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>because they're oppressed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>winners.</v>

83
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.853
<v Speaker 1>Then you claiming allegiance with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>losers and so you put yourself on the </v>

84
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>side of those that you define as </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfairly victimized.</v>

85
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.263
<v Speaker 1>Then that allows you to do two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is to feel secure in your </v>

86
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:16.834
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive explanation of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also helps if you surround </v>

87
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>yourself with people who think exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way you do,</v>

88
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:23.074
<v Speaker 1>because then that oversimplified and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually rather pathetic comprehensive </v>

89
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 1>explanation of the world never goes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged.</v>

90
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.053
<v Speaker 1>Then the next thing you do is revel in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your moral superiority because what </v>

91
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.074
<v Speaker 1>you've done as well as oversimplifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is placed yourself forever on </v>

92
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:39.364
<v Speaker 1>the side of the morally righteous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've been able to do that with a </v>

93
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:42.154
<v Speaker 1>minimum of cognitive effort and no ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no actual expertise and no real desire </v>

94
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:46.834
<v Speaker 1>to mate or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no commitment to making a positive </v>

95
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 1>change in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a very,</v>

96
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:51.664
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes years to make a positive </v>

97
00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:55.160
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even at,</v>

98
00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.840
<v Speaker 1>kind of a minute level of the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

101
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've oversimplified the world,</v>

102
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:03.004
<v Speaker 1>you get to revel in your moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>superiority and this is the real dark </v>

103
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:06.484
<v Speaker 1>side of such movements is that whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment you might have as a </v>

104
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:10.534
<v Speaker 1>consequence of construing yourself as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>victim or as identify or because of </v>

105
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>identifying with victims that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>generated a fair bit of resentment would</v>

106
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>you can then target towards your newly </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered enemies and resentment fueled</v>

107
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>targeting is a very dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>

108
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the sort of thing that,</v>

109
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.313
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffice it to say that it's a very </v>

110
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:31.234
<v Speaker 1>dangerous phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you do is repeat the game </v>

111
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.000
<v Speaker 1>forever everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

112
00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:40.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a very good game in that regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can continually identify new</v>

113
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:45.601
<v Speaker 1>domains of human achievement and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually multiply the categories of,</v>

114
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>of winners and losers and you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that outed and fund item essentially.</v>

115
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:53.020
<v Speaker 1>So that it's a game that you can never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a game that will never end,</v>

116
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:56.050
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the reason why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing what I can to try to put a stop to</v>

117
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:56.884
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least put a stop to its perceived </v>

118
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>validity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

119
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.071
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

120
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:01.904
<v Speaker 1>you can learn to play this game in about</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours and that's what people are </v>

121
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>taught to do in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many university,</v>

122
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>departments now.</v>

123
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's absolutely pathetic.</v>

124
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's morally reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

125
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:13.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

126
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>it abandons the principle of individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

127
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it's intellectually specious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hollow.</v>

128
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it's badly motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

129
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.953
<v Speaker 1>there's almost no end to the number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad things that can be said about this </v>

130
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

131
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's got out of hand,</v>

132
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.033
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why has it become necessary to do </v>

133
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>something about this now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

134
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said already,</v>

135
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it's gone too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

136
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:39.584
<v Speaker 1>that's only my own personal opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to stay attentive to the </v>

137
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.400
<v Speaker 1>psychological underpinnings of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political landscape.</v>

138
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 1>And it is my opinion that this has gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>too far.</v>

139
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

140
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pc,</v>

141
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 1>the PC movement was quite powerful in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1990s,</v>

142
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 1>although it disappeared back into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld from,</v>

143
00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.653
<v Speaker 1>from which it emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought maybe at that point we </v>

144
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:02.384
<v Speaker 1>were done with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was wrong because it's come </v>

145
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 1>back with a vengeance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the last five years.</v>

146
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.063
<v Speaker 1>And I've been trying to sort of why that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is and here's why what I think's </v>

147
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.480
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the universities,</v>

148
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.953
<v Speaker 1>especially the radical left leaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>departments and those would be the </v>

149
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:18.010
<v Speaker 1>women's studies departments and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

150
00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 1>and those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of places.</v>

151
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.513
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other departments that I think </v>

152
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 1>are also primarily responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

153
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>there are estimates that about 20% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social scientists identify themselves to</v>

154
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 1>use a cursed phrase as Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

155
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:35.481
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:36.314
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a very good idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Marxism produced the death of </v>

157
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:40.004
<v Speaker 1>millions of people in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't think that Marxism was </v>

158
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Marxism was directly responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

159
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:45.554
<v Speaker 1>then I would recommend that you read </v>
<v Speaker 1>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Gulag </v>

160
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:50.570
<v Speaker 1>archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's 2,700 pages long and it's</v>

161
00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily emotionally draining to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

162
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.553
<v Speaker 1>But Solzhenitsyn does an unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>good job of detailing out his argument </v>

163
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:03.311
<v Speaker 1>for why the murderous excesses of places</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this Delonis Soviet Union and Mao's</v>

164
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:04.214
<v Speaker 1>China and Vietnam and Cambodia and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other places where Marxist murders </v>

165
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:08.384
<v Speaker 1>took place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't aberrations in relationship to </v>

166
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Marxist ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the purest expression of the,</v>

167
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.630
<v Speaker 1>of the philosophy that was embodied </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside that,</v>

168
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.613
<v Speaker 1>that doctrine.</v>

169
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.453
<v Speaker 1>So you can read that if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the seminal books of the </v>

170
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:22.844
<v Speaker 1>20th century and I don't think that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually have a reasonable </v>

171
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 1>dialog about this sort of thing if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not familiar with it.</v>

172
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:29.144
<v Speaker 1>Partly because Solzhenitsyn's book was </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the major causes of the collapse </v>

173
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:34.950
<v Speaker 1>of the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

174
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he eradicated any shreds of intellectual</v>

175
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 1>respectability that the doctrine upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>which the Soviet Union had been built,</v>

176
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>still maintained after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after it's decades of,</v>

177
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 1>of unbelievable murderous existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd recommend that you read that,</v>

178
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.003
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you enter into this kind of </v>

179
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

180
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:54.014
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I'm going to do is to </v>

181
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>start to make some videos about soldier </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitson and his writing so that everybody</v>

182
00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.633
<v Speaker 1>has a chance to understand what it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was talking about because 2,700 </v>

183
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 1>pages is a pretty long slog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

184
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:07.853
<v Speaker 1>there have been many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many left radical left leaning </v>

185
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.290
<v Speaker 1>departments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>training people over the last 30 years.</v>

186
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not only in how to think they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught them how to play the PC game,</v>

187
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:17.814
<v Speaker 1>but they explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explicitly trained them how to become </v>

188
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:20.604
<v Speaker 1>effective activists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you go on women's studies </v>

189
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 1>websites for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done this with many such websites,</v>

190
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:31.350
<v Speaker 1>they proudly trumpet their training of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of radical leftist activists and they're</v>

191
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good at it.</v>

192
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:33.144
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the universities have </v>

193
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:37.020
<v Speaker 1>probably trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly how to generate the</v>

194
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 1>estimates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the lower bound is about 300,000</v>

195
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:44.250
<v Speaker 1>people and the upper bound might be 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>times that trained them over the last 30</v>

196
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:45.200
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

197
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 1>and now they exist at many levels of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social hierarchy and you know,</v>

198
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 1>so at the top level of the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

199
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:51.294
<v Speaker 1>there's our political structures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can fragment that into major </v>

200
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:54.744
<v Speaker 1>organizations and fragment that into </v>
<v Speaker 1>minor sub organizations and put the </v>

201
00:09:57.781 --> 00:09:59.220
<v Speaker 1>individuals at the bottom of that.</v>

202
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the,</v>

203
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:05.730
<v Speaker 1>the PC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the PC game players have infiltrated our</v>

204
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 1>institutions at many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many levels of the hierarchy.</v>

205
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're also now writing legislation</v>

206
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:12.654
<v Speaker 1>at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now we've got a positive feedback </v>

207
00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:14.874
<v Speaker 1>loop going between the legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legislative activities at the top and </v>

208
00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:18.894
<v Speaker 1>the people who are acting as essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurgents for this movement at all the </v>

209
00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:22.464
<v Speaker 1>levels of the social hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's producing an increasingly </v>

210
00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>rigidified positive feedback loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also,</v>

211
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:29.274
<v Speaker 1>you could also think about it as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of what has been described as </v>

212
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:34.930
<v Speaker 1>the long march through the institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

213
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.490
<v Speaker 1>you can look this up on Wikipedia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the long march through the institutions,</v>

214
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:42.090
<v Speaker 1>but we'll look first to say what to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Herbert marcuse said about it.</v>

215
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:43.803
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marcuse was a member of the Frankfurt </v>

216
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.253
<v Speaker 1>School of critical theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a neo Marxist school of </v>

217
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:49.464
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

218
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he commented about this idea of the long</v>

219
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:54.620
<v Speaker 1>march through the institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a,</v>

220
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 1>a student named Rudy Dukie in the 1960s </v>
<v Speaker 1>generated this idea.</v>

221
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.713
<v Speaker 1>And here's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to work against the established </v>

222
00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:06.570
<v Speaker 1>institutions while working within them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not simply by boring,</v>

223
00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:09.180
<v Speaker 1>from within.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather by doing the job,</v>

224
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.520
<v Speaker 1>learning how to program and read </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

225
00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 1>how to teach at all levels of education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to use the mass media,</v>

226
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:17.010
<v Speaker 1>how to organize production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to recognize an issue,</v>

227
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.320
<v Speaker 1>planned obsolescence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to design,</v>

228
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:20.940
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time,</v>

229
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:23.220
<v Speaker 1>preserve our consciousness in working </v>
<v Speaker 1>with others.</v>

230
00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:24.990
<v Speaker 1>And that means our political </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

231
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.790
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

232
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.850
<v Speaker 1>this has happened and it's happened at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least in part,</v>

233
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.030
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of conscious planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

234
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that,</v>

235
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.490
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

236
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.390
<v Speaker 1>that seems a potentially very dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

237
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.370
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't take that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed people.</v>

238
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take that large of a large,</v>

239
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.713
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed minority to produce </v>

240
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:48.150
<v Speaker 1>substantive changes in the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

241
00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:48.691
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

242
00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 1>we see those changes happening now and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think they're,</v>

243
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 1>they're very detrimental to things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech.</v>

244
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:55.084
<v Speaker 1>And I regard free speech as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prerequisite to a civilized society </v>

245
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:01.840
<v Speaker 1>because freedom of speech means that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can have combat with words.</v>

246
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.703
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that people can happily </v>

247
00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:05.824
<v Speaker 1>and gently exchange opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that we can engage in combat </v>

248
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.573
<v Speaker 1>with words and the battleground of ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that that's acceptable </v>

249
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:14.283
<v Speaker 1>and why it's acceptable that people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings get hurt during that combat is </v>

250
00:12:16.811 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 1>that the combat of ideas is far </v>
<v Speaker 1>preferable to actual combat.</v>

251
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.143
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the only alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people have genuine </v>

252
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:24.904
<v Speaker 1>disagreements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't let them talk them out </v>

253
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:29.740
<v Speaker 1>and reach some sort of consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some court of negotiated settlement,</v>

254
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.743
<v Speaker 1>then then they can either swallow their </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions and become enraged or they can </v>

255
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Speaker 1>engage in actual combat.</v>

256
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.873
<v Speaker 1>And so I think anything that threatens </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech threatens the </v>

257
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:41.950
<v Speaker 1>stability of the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the PC accesses,</v>

258
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened freedom of speech.</v>

259
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:45.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think they threatened it quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>severely.</v>

260
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I already know people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

261
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:48.514
<v Speaker 1>at the universities who are loath to </v>
<v Speaker 1>teach anything to do with gender or </v>

262
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:53.470
<v Speaker 1>sexual identity because they're afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of saying the wrong thing.</v>

263
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.200
<v Speaker 1>And that puts a pall over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

264
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 1>over free discussion at the university </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

265
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.090
<v Speaker 1>on a whole array of vital issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

266
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so having said that,</v>

267
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.593
<v Speaker 1>I've identified the PC game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've identified why I think it's </v>

268
00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:09.640
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and why it spread so rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

269
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that now we need at least in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

270
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:12.843
<v Speaker 1>we need tactics to fight back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I'm going to </v>

271
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:18.880
<v Speaker 1>propose as a counter game and here's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles that I think the counter game</v>

272
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.550
<v Speaker 1>has to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

273
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 1>here's the features that the counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>game has to have.</v>

274
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 1>It has to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be playable everywhere.</v>

275
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause obviously the PC game is playable </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

276
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.433
<v Speaker 1>It has to make the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the point is that there is </v>

277
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:37.500
<v Speaker 1>widespread opposition to these pc ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the opposition is,</v>

278
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

279
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.000
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>important and uh,</v>

280
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.873
<v Speaker 1>needs to be attended to carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to spread fast and it would help </v>

281
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:48.490
<v Speaker 1>if it was a bit humorous because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be good if we could do this with a</v>

282
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:49.324
<v Speaker 1>bit of detachment and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some rationality and some careful </v>

283
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 1>argumentation and some playfulness and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some,</v>

284
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well all of that would be real good.</v>

285
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.280
<v Speaker 1>But it's not an easy thing to manage </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a serious business and um,</v>

286
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.130
<v Speaker 1>but you have to keep a light touch when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this sort of thing.</v>

287
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:06.993
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the indications that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've actually attained some mastery </v>

288
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:11.230
<v Speaker 1>over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So keep that in mind when,</v>

289
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.073
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in this sort of </v>

290
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:14.284
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

291
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.120
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to announce pokemon pc and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to first say that of course the</v>

292
00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:19.954
<v Speaker 1>good people who've produced the pokemon </v>
<v Speaker 1>artifacts in the past and products have </v>

293
00:14:23.291 --> 00:14:24.760
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

294
00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:25.933
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't be blamed for it and I hope </v>

295
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:32.731
<v Speaker 1>they'll forgive me for using their </v>
<v Speaker 1>terminology in a satirical and political</v>

296
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:34.690
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can,</v>

297
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.000
<v Speaker 1>everyone can play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all the rage.</v>

298
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.140
<v Speaker 1>It's spreading like wildfire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are the rules to Pokemon PC.</v>

299
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:45.010
<v Speaker 1>First purchase your starter pack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pokemon pc stickers.</v>

300
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.730
<v Speaker 1>So I've put them on Ebay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ordered about 5,000 of them.</v>

301
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.220
<v Speaker 1>You can buy a starter pack of 50 or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred.</v>

302
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you feel like doing that,</v>

303
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:54.494
<v Speaker 1>then I would encourage you to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if people will be </v>

304
00:14:56.121 --> 00:14:56.954
<v Speaker 1>interested in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an experiment considered an </v>

305
00:14:58.581 --> 00:15:01.010
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're feeling really enthusiastic by</v>

306
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:02.780
<v Speaker 1>a couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them to your friends.</v>

307
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Advanced players can purchase the </v>
<v Speaker 1>accessory packs too,</v>

308
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.290
<v Speaker 1>and the accessory packs or larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>stickers at least to begin with.</v>

309
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 1>And I'll post them relatively quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the sticker.</v>

310
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.790
<v Speaker 1>So here's the design principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

311
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 1>we didn't want it to be black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red and white,</v>

312
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 1>like the antismoking stickers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:20.834
<v Speaker 1>because that just seemed a bit much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we decided to make it look kind of </v>

314
00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:25.130
<v Speaker 1>peaceful and playful and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

315
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.700
<v Speaker 1>it's green and purple and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

316
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not in an,</v>

317
00:15:29.891 --> 00:15:30.724
<v Speaker 1>in your face sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this doesn't have to be an in your </v>

318
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:33.284
<v Speaker 1>face sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I liked the design and some of </v>

319
00:15:35.391 --> 00:15:37.030
<v Speaker 1>the people who are advising and helping </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

320
00:15:37.031 --> 00:15:37.864
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what the PC stickers look </v>

321
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:41.324
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two inches by two inches and </v>

322
00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:43.664
<v Speaker 1>we've designed them well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll continue with the rules of the </v>

323
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Pokemon pc game.</v>

324
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's just starter packs there.</v>

325
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Ebay item one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

326
00:15:52.431 --> 00:15:57.431
<v Speaker 1>(216) 702-3413 all of course post that </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

327
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.500
<v Speaker 1>on this youtube website there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Snipley,</v>

328
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's like a bitly,</v>

329
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.090
<v Speaker 1>you a url for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that particular item.</v>

330
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 1>The hundred sticker item is one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

331
00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:07.994
<v Speaker 1>(216) 700-1902.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can buy 50 sticker packs or a </v>

332
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.990
<v Speaker 1>hundred sticker packs and then you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>start using them to play pc pokemon.</v>

333
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 1>And here are the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

334
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 1>take your starter pack of 50 to 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>stickers to school or work.</v>

335
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:24.254
<v Speaker 1>It can be carried conveniently in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>backpack or a briefcase or under your </v>

336
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:29.480
<v Speaker 1>shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a real double o seven type,</v>

337
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.950
<v Speaker 1>then wander the halls of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution or workplace,</v>

338
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.030
<v Speaker 1>be stealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthful.</v>

339
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.540
<v Speaker 1>And if you need to whistle nonchalantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that people don't know what you're up</v>

340
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:39.374
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose points if you get caught too </v>

341
00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:41.780
<v Speaker 1>early in the game.</v>

342
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Pay careful attention while you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

343
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.840
<v Speaker 1>And I would say always pay careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

344
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.240
<v Speaker 1>So this is the eye of horus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

345
00:16:50.241 --> 00:16:51.074
<v Speaker 1>It's an old Egyptian God and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians worshiped at 10 attention as </v>

346
00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:57.530
<v Speaker 1>their highest daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They regarded the careful attention that</v>

347
00:16:57.531 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 1>individuals paid as the antidote to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption in stagnation of the state.</v>

348
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.950
<v Speaker 1>So horace was an open eyed God who </v>
<v Speaker 1>rescued his father from the underworld.</v>

349
00:17:06.951 --> 00:17:07.784
<v Speaker 1>And so he's the god of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess I could think about him as </v>

350
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:13.940
<v Speaker 1>the patron saint of the PC pokemon </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

351
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.153
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then now you're in your institution or </v>

352
00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:17.954
<v Speaker 1>your workplace or your school and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering around and you're looking for </v>

353
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:21.044
<v Speaker 1>posters that advertise the PC game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now to describe what the PC game is so </v>

354
00:17:24.261 --> 00:17:25.094
<v Speaker 1>you can use your judgment about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>posters are designed to support that </v>

355
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:29.720
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say do it carefully.</v>

356
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

357
00:17:30.741 --> 00:17:31.574
<v Speaker 1>And don't just put the stickers </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere because that reduces their </v>

358
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:35.780
<v Speaker 1>utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at a poster.</v>

359
00:17:35.781 --> 00:17:36.614
<v Speaker 1>Think if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think and considered to see if it is </v>

360
00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:41.570
<v Speaker 1>playing the game that I described it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it is,</v>

361
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.433
<v Speaker 1>then stealthily remove one of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pokemon pc stickers from your starter </v>

362
00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:48.290
<v Speaker 1>pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remove the backing.</v>

363
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.423
<v Speaker 1>If you need eye protection while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that because you're concerned </v>

364
00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:53.400
<v Speaker 1>about the danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that you wear it,</v>

365
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 1>handled the sticker reverently then </v>
<v Speaker 1>strike like the Cobra.</v>

366
00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the sticker Cobra by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

367
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:01.763
<v Speaker 1>and I found this guy on the right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mano Mano is a Canadian Hero Mono the </v>

368
00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Air Cobra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess he could be another,</v>

369
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.470
<v Speaker 1>he's our patron superhero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

370
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Mono the Air Cobra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you strike like mono the Air Cobra.</v>

371
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Canadian superheroes by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pretty rare.</v>

372
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.303
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

373
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

374
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.063
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so take your pokemon pc sticker and </v>

375
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.000
<v Speaker 1>carefully place it on the lower right </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the poster.</v>

376
00:18:27.001 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 1>I've put an example down here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see there's an example of proper</v>

377
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:32.310
<v Speaker 1>placement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

378
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:33.203
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put the PC sticker on the lower right </v>

379
00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 1>part of the PC game poster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be a little subtle.</v>

380
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:38.634
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't stick it.</v>

381
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Obviously in bone headedly in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>

382
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.970
<v Speaker 1>you want to let the PC game poster </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to broadcast it's evil message,</v>

383
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.013
<v Speaker 1>but you want to register your opposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more importantly you want to show </v>

384
00:18:48.151 --> 00:18:49.980
<v Speaker 1>that someone's paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

385
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Because we need to show that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to this sort of things.</v>

386
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.263
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing these games are particularly </v>

387
00:18:55.861 --> 00:18:58.860
<v Speaker 1>brave and so I think if proper attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>is called to what they're doing,</v>

388
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 1>they might wander back into the darkness</v>
<v Speaker 1>that initially spawned them.</v>

389
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.370
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next thing you do,</v>

390
00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:06.204
<v Speaker 1>I would like you to do is photograph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use your cell phone to photograph the </v>

391
00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:12.660
<v Speaker 1>newly modified poster and then I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to prepare to upload that photo when</v>

392
00:19:12.661 --> 00:19:17.340
<v Speaker 1>what I hope will be the pokemon pc app </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrives and later in the video I'm going</v>

393
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:18.174
<v Speaker 1>to call for an app designer because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like volunteers to help me design </v>

394
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:23.820
<v Speaker 1>an APP that has a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>features and more features.</v>

395
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:25.860
<v Speaker 1>If you have ideas for more features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's welcome.</v>

396
00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:28.620
<v Speaker 1>So I would ask the APP producers to send</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a proposal.</v>

397
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:29.783
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could either do it as volunteers or </v>

398
00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:31.704
<v Speaker 1>you could send me a budget and I'll see </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can scrounge up the money to pay </v>

399
00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:36.900
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can certainly use the whatever revenue</v>

400
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:37.734
<v Speaker 1>might be generated with the PC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pokemon pc stickers to generate enough </v>

401
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.800
<v Speaker 1>revenue maybe to develop the APP.</v>

402
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.780
<v Speaker 1>So there's an example of proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>placement.</v>

403
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Be Nice and careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stick it on the lower right hand,</v>

404
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:49.830
<v Speaker 1>right hand side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

405
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.993
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if more than one of you come across the </v>

406
00:19:52.201 --> 00:19:53.034
<v Speaker 1>same poster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you could put another sticker </v>

407
00:19:54.301 --> 00:19:57.150
<v Speaker 1>on there beside it that would register a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vote,</v>

408
00:19:57.151 --> 00:19:59.420
<v Speaker 1>but another vote say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

409
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.290
<v Speaker 1>against the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the content of that poster.</v>

410
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:05.340
<v Speaker 1>But don't use a bunch of stickers from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your starter packs on the same poster,</v>

411
00:20:05.341 --> 00:20:07.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So be subtle and,</v>

412
00:20:07.161 --> 00:20:07.994
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and intelligent about all this and </v>

413
00:20:09.031 --> 00:20:11.850
<v Speaker 1>careful and awake and tough and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

414
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.713
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the things that you should be if </v>

415
00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:16.380
<v Speaker 1>you're a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well functioning individual.</v>

416
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:17.723
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you disappear stealthily into </v>

417
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:20.910
<v Speaker 1>the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Zorro.</v>

418
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:21.803
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe someone else so you can pick </v>

419
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:25.340
<v Speaker 1>your stealthily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear or,</v>

420
00:20:25.341 --> 00:20:26.174
<v Speaker 1>and emulate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's good thing to emulate people </v>

421
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:28.434
<v Speaker 1>that you admire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so pick somebody you admire and </v>

422
00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:32.130
<v Speaker 1>emulate that sucker and that'd be a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

423
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then 10 play again with another poster.</v>

424
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

425
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:38.723
<v Speaker 1>and then again and then again and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>again as long as necessary for years if </v>

426
00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:44.130
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

427
00:20:44.131 --> 00:20:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Because this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a long haul.</v>

428
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.083
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a long haul process and this is </v>

429
00:20:49.271 --> 00:20:51.310
<v Speaker 1>only the starting place as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

430
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.373
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to call for an APP designer</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all you people out there who have </v>

431
00:20:55.631 --> 00:20:57.110
<v Speaker 1>computer ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

432
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:57.953
<v Speaker 1>I'd like you to design a pokemon pc app </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be used as a mobile </v>

433
00:21:00.611 --> 00:21:01.444
<v Speaker 1>application.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like it to be able to upload </v>

434
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:03.574
<v Speaker 1>photos of Pokemon pc stickered posters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I want it to link to Google </v>

435
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:09.880
<v Speaker 1>maps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that might be done.</v>

436
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.103
<v Speaker 1>And what I would like to have happen is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can get a comprehensive library </v>

437
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:15.184
<v Speaker 1>of pc posters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I want you to be very </v>

438
00:21:17.471 --> 00:21:18.304
<v Speaker 1>careful in what you select to sticker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that we could also make a map a now </v>

439
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:24.430
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the distribution of these posters,</v>

440
00:21:24.431 --> 00:21:28.780
<v Speaker 1>because then we can find out where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>layers of the PC game players are.</v>

441
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And then we can go on to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of Pokemon PC,</v>

442
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 1>which I have to think through and which </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll announce later.</v>

443
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:40.350
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say thanks for playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids and always remember play Pokemon pc</v>

444
00:21:41.351 --> 00:21:42.184
<v Speaker 1>safely</v>

445
00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:44.653
<v Speaker 2>over and out.</v>
