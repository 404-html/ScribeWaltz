1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.720
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk some more about</v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialism today</v>

2
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.770
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to talk to you about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of Swiss psychiatrists in swinger</v>

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.810
<v Speaker 1>and boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just as a starting point.</v>

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.490
<v Speaker 1>There are psychological viewpoint was</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced to a large degree by a</v>

6
00:00:21.491 --> 00:00:22.930
<v Speaker 1>philosopher named heidegger.</v>

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>And heidegger considered himself a</v>
<v Speaker 1>student of being and for heidegger that</v>

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.190
<v Speaker 1>the main mystery of the world was why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it existed and the the best way to</v>

10
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>think about the phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a phenomenologist.</v>

11
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:46.850
<v Speaker 1>And the best way to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenology and existentialism is that</v>

12
00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:51.851
<v Speaker 1>phenomenology is the study of experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it's lived.</v>

13
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.640
<v Speaker 1>And then existentialism puts a twist on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because existentialists assume that</v>

14
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.040
<v Speaker 1>being has implicitly moral dimension</v>

15
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.623
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

16
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.460
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists psychologists</v>
<v Speaker 1>presume that</v>

17
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>pathology at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a consequence of a disturbed</v>

18
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.640
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a disturbed moral relationship with the</v>

19
00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:24.641
<v Speaker 1>self and being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very tricky thinking and it's not</v>

20
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:30.350
<v Speaker 1>often handled in personality courses</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

21
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The phenomenological element in</v>

22
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing I really like about it is</v>

23
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:41.301
<v Speaker 1>that it's a really good counterpart to</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern materialistic viewpoint because</v>

24
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>it puts consciousness at the center of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

25
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:50.751
<v Speaker 1>instead of treating it as if it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's a secondary phenomena</v>

26
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>that emerges from something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

27
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

28
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.490
<v Speaker 1>our modern presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the scientific</v>

29
00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions or what passed for</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific presuppositions,</v>

30
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.010
<v Speaker 1>are generally extremely reductionist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they assume that consciousness is in</v>

31
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>some manner that's not yet been</v>
<v Speaker 1>determined,</v>

32
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I guess secondary biproduct of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally material processes,</v>

33
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:19.580
<v Speaker 1>and it's a perfectly reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis,</v>

34
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't say there's any real</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence for it.</v>

35
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

36
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.060
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to over state how mysterious</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is as a phenomena.</v>

37
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.703
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.590
<v Speaker 1>For heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness was a mystery that was in</v>

39
00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:43.591
<v Speaker 1>some sense equivalent to the mystery of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being and the way that the reason for</v>

40
00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:49.190
<v Speaker 1>that was that he couldn't conceive of</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence without a soul,</v>

41
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>without a subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine if the world was</v>

42
00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 1>stripped of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to describe what</v>

43
00:02:58.361 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>would be left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

44
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:01.880
<v Speaker 1>if you take a very straightforward</v>
<v Speaker 1>materialistic viewpoint,</v>

45
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>you could make the presumption that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that was conscious was</v>

46
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>eradicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then things would be just the way they</v>

47
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>are now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

48
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.313
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

49
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a shallow viewpoint</v>
<v Speaker 1>because consciousness is what gives</v>

50
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>everything a perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives it a size and it gives it a</v>

51
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>duration and it gives it colors and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the qualities that we associate with</v>

52
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>being and without that consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>

53
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>at least in comprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there are deeper problems that</v>

54
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>are dealt with by people like John</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wheeler,</v>

55
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:44.671
<v Speaker 1>who's a quantum physicist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who believes that consciousness is</v>

56
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:49.711
<v Speaker 1>necessarily is necessary for quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>indeterminacy to resolve itself into</v>

57
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:56.761
<v Speaker 1>something that's concrete in actual so</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheeler and many physicists like him put</v>

58
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>consciousness at the center of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process that turns potential into</v>

59
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:03.634
<v Speaker 1>actuality.</v>

60
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.010
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

61
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.440
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these quantum ideas were being</v>

62
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.430
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These philosophical ideas and</v>

63
00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:18.431
<v Speaker 1>psychological ideas that I'm describing</v>
<v Speaker 1>are being developed and they provide</v>

64
00:04:19.971 --> 00:04:22.670
<v Speaker 1>such a different take on the structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality that</v>

65
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.380
<v Speaker 1>that I think they're indispensable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think they're,</v>

66
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.180
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're interesting in relationship in</v>

67
00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:35.181
<v Speaker 1>particular to piaget's thought because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists have a</v>

68
00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:38.660
<v Speaker 1>constructivist element to their thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that</v>

69
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.080
<v Speaker 1>they believe that consciousness plays a</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructive role in the establishment</v>

70
00:04:45.081 --> 00:04:45.914
<v Speaker 1>of being.</v>

71
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

72
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.120
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to look at being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so again,</v>

73
00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:53.850
<v Speaker 1>the way to think about this is you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to flip your viewpoint in a sense is</v>

74
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>you have to think about your experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>as reality and that everything that's</v>

75
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.900
<v Speaker 1>inside that experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak as a subcomponent of that</v>

76
00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:07.010
<v Speaker 1>reality instead of thinking of material</v>
<v Speaker 1>things as the reality and your</v>

77
00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:09.080
<v Speaker 1>experience somehow emerging out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

78
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.110
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an inversion of what constitutes</v>

79
00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:15.470
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could think about it in sense</v>

80
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>as an intellectual exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean most of the way that people think</v>

81
00:05:22.431 --> 00:05:25.850
<v Speaker 1>is predicated on some kind of implicit</v>
<v Speaker 1>set of axioms.</v>

82
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.060
<v Speaker 1>And if you changed the axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also,</v>

83
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.530
<v Speaker 1>you can often shed light on reality in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new and interesting way.</v>

84
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.820
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to walk through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological viewpoint and we're</v>

85
00:05:37.821 --> 00:05:42.470
<v Speaker 1>going to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>why and how that might be interesting,</v>

86
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.200
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenological and existential</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints.</v>

87
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.560
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm in the next lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put a twist on that because</v>

88
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.780
<v Speaker 1>what you think about the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality appears to have some powerful</v>

89
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.110
<v Speaker 1>relationship with how that reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfolds itself and the existentialists,</v>

90
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're very big believers in the reality</v>

91
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>of subjective experience and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialists.</v>

92
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 1>We're very big believers in the ethical</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of the individual.</v>

93
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to talk to you about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the Soviet Union between</v>

94
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:22.991
<v Speaker 1>1919 in 1959 which is a period of world</v>
<v Speaker 1>history that isn't well covered in our</v>

95
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:25.420
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

96
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows about the Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust,</v>

97
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>but very few people know that between 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>million and 60 million people were</v>

98
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 1>killed as a consequence of internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>repression in the Soviet Union between</v>

99
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:40.301
<v Speaker 1>1919 to 1959 that's a figure that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>five times as big as the commonly held</v>

100
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:44.720
<v Speaker 1>figures for the Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm going to introduce</v>

101
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 1>that to you is first you should know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because it's the stellar</v>

102
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 1>example of what happens when people</v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned their individual</v>

103
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:51.410
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

104
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.800
<v Speaker 1>And second and related to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an object lesson in why in what</v>

105
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>happens when the presuppositions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists and the</v>

106
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>existentialists hailed about the nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality,</v>

107
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.470
<v Speaker 1>we're completely dismissed in favor of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalist,</v>

108
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:14.471
<v Speaker 1>utopianism and rationalist utopias</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically rational utopias killed</v>

109
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions of people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>

110
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that you can make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly powerful case that</v>

111
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.993
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.500
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your view of reality when it's played</v>

113
00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:38.501
<v Speaker 1>out in the social world turns genocidal</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and time again,</v>

114
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 1>there's probably something existentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with it.</v>

115
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:49.090
<v Speaker 1>And then a secondary ovation of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be if there's something that</v>

116
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:54.791
<v Speaker 1>existentially wrong with a viewpoint in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what way can you consider it tenable</v>

117
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 1>even if it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's rational.</v>

118
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 1>If the outcome is genocide and deceit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and misery,</v>

119
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.240
<v Speaker 1>it's perfectly reasonable to presume</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's evidence that it's wrong.</v>

120
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of you,</v>

121
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.250
<v Speaker 1>and this is particularly true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of universities are taught a</v>

122
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 1>kind of at least a kind of implicit</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral relativism.</v>

123
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.033
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

124
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 1>it is and that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's reasonable from a scientific</v>

125
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:27.650
<v Speaker 1>perspective at least to some point.</v>

126
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:35.140
<v Speaker 1>But there's a problem with that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are forms of moral presupposition</v>

127
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:41.290
<v Speaker 1>that seemed to lead to horrendous ends</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's always struck me because I grew</v>

128
00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 1>up like you and under the shadow of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear destruction,</v>

129
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it always has struck me that if certain</v>

130
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:55.100
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints lead to</v>
<v Speaker 1>genocide load comes,</v>

131
00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.200
<v Speaker 1>if they do that consistently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's extremely dangerous for us not</v>

132
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>to act as if that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course if something's wrong,</v>

133
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>then that also implies that something is</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

134
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the opposite of wrong just</v>

135
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even if you can't necessarily</v>

136
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:15.270
<v Speaker 1>figure out what's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to ground yourself to</v>

137
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 1>some degree by figuring out what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

138
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll walk through the philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the psychology first and then we'll</v>

139
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 1>walk through the sociological</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of it's abandonment in a</v>

140
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:30.090
<v Speaker 1>sense and well then you can see for</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself if you think that this</v>

141
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 1>perspective is worthy of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>

142
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 1>It's very complicated.</v>

143
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:39.723
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

144
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 1>well we'll look at this first.</v>

145
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.433
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

146
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenology in part is based on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of [inaudible] and [inaudible]</v>

147
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.280
<v Speaker 1>means being there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

148
00:09:51.281 --> 00:09:54.640
<v Speaker 1>this way of simplifying madness is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it as your experience.</v>

149
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.590
<v Speaker 1>And then this is a map I've made of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's experience,</v>

150
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.660
<v Speaker 1>which I think is at least roughly</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to the phenomenologists</v>

151
00:10:04.661 --> 00:10:07.240
<v Speaker 1>design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it has the advantage that I can</v>

152
00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:09.190
<v Speaker 1>explain it well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to use it.</v>

153
00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:13.000
<v Speaker 1>And so the phenomenologists believed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the past and the present and the</v>

154
00:10:13.001 --> 00:10:18.001
<v Speaker 1>future all tangled up together in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>current experience in that say</v>

155
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.090
<v Speaker 1>everything that you're doing is related</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the future,</v>

156
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.140
<v Speaker 1>which of course is because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in this class that has some</v>

157
00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:28.060
<v Speaker 1>consequences for whether or not you</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate.</v>

158
00:10:28.061 --> 00:10:32.920
<v Speaker 1>And that has some consequences for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>status and your career moving forward.</v>

159
00:10:32.921 --> 00:10:37.480
<v Speaker 1>And you're perfectly aware of that so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you experienced the meaning of the,</v>

160
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.820
<v Speaker 1>the lecture say in the context of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptions of the future.</v>

161
00:10:42.821 --> 00:10:47.680
<v Speaker 1>And of course the same thing is true of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your experience now because of your</v>

162
00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:51.430
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the past and the future in some</v>

163
00:10:51.431 --> 00:10:56.080
<v Speaker 1>sense are here now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly because</v>

164
00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.440
<v Speaker 1>when you're experiencing things,</v>

165
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.370
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

166
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.280
<v Speaker 1>you consider your current situation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you consider</v>

167
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:09.100
<v Speaker 1>where it is that you're headed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so dad's side and also has this</v>

168
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:14.320
<v Speaker 1>element of becoming in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's you're not just a static thing</v>

169
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:19.420
<v Speaker 1>and you don't ever experience anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in your environment as something</v>

170
00:11:19.421 --> 00:11:22.810
<v Speaker 1>that's merely static.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always experiencing,</v>

171
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.020
<v Speaker 1>you're always experiencing it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to your plans for</v>

172
00:11:26.021 --> 00:11:28.570
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might be short term,</v>

173
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.660
<v Speaker 1>like maybe your board of the class</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you need to go get a cup of</v>

174
00:11:31.661 --> 00:11:36.300
<v Speaker 1>coffee and not colors your current</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience or maybe it's long term or</v>

175
00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:37.660
<v Speaker 1>medium term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

176
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.930
<v Speaker 1>The point is is that your viewpoint of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future conditions,</v>

177
00:11:40.931 --> 00:11:44.440
<v Speaker 1>your experience in the present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense the future is already</v>

178
00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:47.230
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case that what you do now</v>

179
00:11:47.231 --> 00:11:50.650
<v Speaker 1>is going to have effects and</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences into the future.</v>

180
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the more complicated consequence.</v>

181
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 1>So you're somewhere now and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the future and one of the</v>

182
00:12:11.811 --> 00:12:16.550
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that is that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system,</v>

183
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.290
<v Speaker 1>it's one way of looking at it parses up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world in relationship to the</v>

184
00:12:21.291 --> 00:12:24.560
<v Speaker 1>relationship between those two poles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

185
00:12:24.561 --> 00:12:27.800
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you walk into a class and your plan</v>

186
00:12:27.801 --> 00:12:30.830
<v Speaker 1>is to sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're immediately going to</v>

187
00:12:30.831 --> 00:12:34.640
<v Speaker 1>perceive an array of chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you were coming in here to clean</v>

188
00:12:34.641 --> 00:12:38.420
<v Speaker 1>up the room instead of sitting down for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lecture.</v>

189
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Well then the things that would manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to you would be qualitatively</v>

190
00:12:43.911 --> 00:12:46.460
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you'd only be looking for the</v>

191
00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:50.540
<v Speaker 1>things that were out of place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you're coming in here because</v>

192
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.970
<v Speaker 1>you're a spectacularly lonesome and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that you know there's some buddy</v>

193
00:12:55.971 --> 00:12:59.270
<v Speaker 1>here who might be a potential partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the world's going to array</v>

194
00:12:59.271 --> 00:13:01.820
<v Speaker 1>itself in front of you in a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

195
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.680
<v Speaker 1>And the degree to which what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing in relationship to where you</v>

196
00:13:06.681 --> 00:13:11.681
<v Speaker 1>are determines even how the objects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world manifest themselves to you is</v>

197
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:14.210
<v Speaker 1>indeterminate.</v>

198
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:21.730
<v Speaker 1>It happens to a tremendous degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not only that things manifest</v>

199
00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:26.810
<v Speaker 1>themselves to you as objects in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to your conception of your</v>

200
00:13:26.811 --> 00:13:31.670
<v Speaker 1>current situation and your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your emotions are also hang on that</v>

201
00:13:31.671 --> 00:13:33.380
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

202
00:13:33.381 --> 00:13:35.840
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're writing an exam and you expect</v>

203
00:13:35.841 --> 00:13:39.080
<v Speaker 1>to see you're hoping for a c and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a b,</v>

204
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.750
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be extremely happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

205
00:13:41.751 --> 00:13:44.450
<v Speaker 1>But if you are hoping for an a and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a b,</v>

206
00:13:44.451 --> 00:13:46.850
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappy about it.</v>

207
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.800
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting about that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in some sense the stimulus as the</v>

208
00:13:51.801 --> 00:13:56.210
<v Speaker 1>behaviors would have it is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the emotional consequences actually</v>

209
00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:59.240
<v Speaker 1>reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me to be sort of related to</v>

210
00:13:59.241 --> 00:14:01.940
<v Speaker 1>the idea of Maya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a Buddhist idea,</v>

211
00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:06.230
<v Speaker 1>which is that people live inside a</v>
<v Speaker 1>framework that's conditioned by desire</v>

212
00:14:06.231 --> 00:14:08.750
<v Speaker 1>and as a consequence it's not actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

213
00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And the unreal lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unreality of it is that you can</v>

214
00:14:14.781 --> 00:14:19.781
<v Speaker 1>change what manifests itself to you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the importance of what manifests itself</v>

215
00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:23.210
<v Speaker 1>to you by changing your conception of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

216
00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.070
<v Speaker 1>of your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your future,</v>

217
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:30.220
<v Speaker 1>or also by changing your conception of</v>
<v Speaker 1>who and where you are right now.</v>

218
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.280
<v Speaker 1>And so in that sense being your</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences malleable and</v>

219
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

220
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.100
<v Speaker 1>it's malleable at least in part as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the choices that you</v>

221
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:47.850
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that implies from a</v>

222
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.300
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological perspective is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>freewill and the manner in which the</v>

223
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:59.081
<v Speaker 1>world manifests itself are integrally</v>
<v Speaker 1>related and from an existential point of</v>

224
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it implies that you actually bear a fair</v>

225
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:09.251
<v Speaker 1>bit of responsibility for the ongoing</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of your experience.</v>

226
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.950
<v Speaker 1>And the existentialists would presume</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that responsibility is built into</v>

227
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:18.800
<v Speaker 1>the nature of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way out of it.</v>

228
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like a precondition for being</v>

229
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.130
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word phenomenon is from a Greek word</v>

230
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.110
<v Speaker 1>and the Greek word is famous thigh and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what saint is thigh means is to shine</v>

231
00:15:41.111 --> 00:15:46.060
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the presuppositions of the</v>

232
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.240
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal logical viewpoint is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and in some sense is composed of</v>

233
00:15:51.971 --> 00:15:56.020
<v Speaker 1>what shines forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a very difficult thing to</v>

234
00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:58.960
<v Speaker 1>explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can do it partly this way.</v>

235
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:02.410
<v Speaker 1>So when you're moving from point a to</v>
<v Speaker 1>point b,</v>

236
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.770
<v Speaker 1>you can parse the world up into tools</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obstacles.</v>

237
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I showed you that in the last slide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tools or things that get you to where</v>

238
00:16:09.461 --> 00:16:11.870
<v Speaker 1>you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what the tools are,</v>

239
00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:14.920
<v Speaker 1>it depends on where you're going and</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles are the things that get in</v>

240
00:16:14.921 --> 00:16:17.620
<v Speaker 1>your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you perceive tools,</v>

241
00:16:17.621 --> 00:16:19.660
<v Speaker 1>then that makes you happy because</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>

242
00:16:19.661 --> 00:16:23.020
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is experienced in relationship to</v>

243
00:16:23.021 --> 00:16:25.990
<v Speaker 1>movement towards a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you experienced nothing but</v>

244
00:16:25.991 --> 00:16:28.150
<v Speaker 1>obstacles that's going to produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>

245
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:33.460
<v Speaker 1>And so this is a variant of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the variant is when you're moving</v>

246
00:16:33.461 --> 00:16:36.160
<v Speaker 1>from point a to point b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can experience things that you</v>

247
00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:41.161
<v Speaker 1>predict or desire and those make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopeful and happy or you can experience</v>

248
00:16:42.881 --> 00:16:45.790
<v Speaker 1>things that are unpredictable and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>make you,</v>

249
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.070
<v Speaker 1>those are threats and they make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious,</v>

250
00:16:48.071 --> 00:16:52.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's broader than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They disinhibit negative emotion in a</v>

251
00:16:52.121 --> 00:16:56.230
<v Speaker 1>more general sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you can experience</v>

252
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:07.260
<v Speaker 1>something that's so unpredicted and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>shocking that it blows the framework</v>

253
00:17:08.831 --> 00:17:10.080
<v Speaker 1>that you're using it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

254
00:17:10.081 --> 00:17:10.600
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

255
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.940
<v Speaker 1>what would you say the phenomenologists</v>
<v Speaker 1>called?</v>

256
00:17:12.941 --> 00:17:15.760
<v Speaker 1>That loss of world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the framework,</v>

257
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.940
<v Speaker 1>the thing that you encounter is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected that it's appearance blows</v>

258
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.450
<v Speaker 1>the structure of being apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that happens,</v>

259
00:17:25.451 --> 00:17:27.880
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people are betrayed by someone that</v>

260
00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:31.720
<v Speaker 1>they love or maybe they're very</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously hurt or they develop a very</v>

261
00:17:31.721 --> 00:17:35.170
<v Speaker 1>serious illness or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a dream that they've been pursuing</v>

262
00:17:35.171 --> 00:17:38.590
<v Speaker 1>for a long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's rendered impossible by some failure</v>

263
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.640
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some unexpected natural occurrence.</v>

264
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the question is,</v>

265
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.690
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your world falls apart,</v>

266
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.380
<v Speaker 1>your world emerges from something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then when it falls apart,</v>

267
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:58.620
<v Speaker 1>it falls back into that something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic state.</v>

268
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.040
<v Speaker 1>And that the phenomenologists say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you experience most basically is</v>

269
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:08.310
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for,</v>

270
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 1>from a phenomenological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

271
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:14.820
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at the world you</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive meaning and then you derive</v>

272
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:19.850
<v Speaker 1>objects from that and you just arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the objects in relationship to your</v>

273
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.850
<v Speaker 1>representation of your current state and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your future state.</v>

274
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.960
<v Speaker 1>So from a phenomenological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the base of the world is meaning.</v>

275
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Now I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you some hints about how that</v>

276
00:18:33.301 --> 00:18:34.930
<v Speaker 1>plays itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

277
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.480
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one</v>

278
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.460
<v Speaker 1>interesting phenomena</v>

279
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.953
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

280
00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.200
<v Speaker 1>how interest guides your ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate.</v>

281
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that you've got,</v>

282
00:18:48.171 --> 00:18:50.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an array of difficult papers on your</v>

283
00:18:50.721 --> 00:18:52.130
<v Speaker 1>desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to read them.</v>

284
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.880
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of those papers independently of</v>

285
00:18:55.881 --> 00:18:59.000
<v Speaker 1>their difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those papers will presume that</v>

286
00:18:59.001 --> 00:19:02.930
<v Speaker 1>you're actually interested in and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them you're not interested in.</v>

287
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.720
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the papers that you're interested in</v>

288
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.960
<v Speaker 1>come with this quality that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists described,</v>

289
00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:14.590
<v Speaker 1>a shining forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about them that grips</v>

290
00:19:14.591 --> 00:19:17.860
<v Speaker 1>your attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that enables you to concentrate,</v>

291
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.480
<v Speaker 1>that enables you learn and that enables</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to remember and in a relatively</v>

292
00:19:22.481 --> 00:19:24.490
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effortless way.</v>

293
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the other papers that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in,</v>

294
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.320
<v Speaker 1>assuming there have equivalent</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulty,</v>

295
00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.510
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to focus your</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention on and they lie there in sort</v>

296
00:19:34.511 --> 00:19:37.210
<v Speaker 1>of an inert manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

297
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.970
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

298
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.690
<v Speaker 1>The fit thin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his thigh phenomenon is partially</v>

299
00:19:42.691 --> 00:19:47.691
<v Speaker 1>apprehendable by considering what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences to you between something</v>

300
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:51.930
<v Speaker 1>that you're interested in and something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not now.</v>

301
00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:56.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

302
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:03.350
<v Speaker 1>someone like you would think of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest as a consequence of an internal</v>

303
00:20:03.351 --> 00:20:07.310
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychological process that's guiding</v>

304
00:20:07.311 --> 00:20:10.320
<v Speaker 1>your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the phenomenologists at least in,</v>

305
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.320
<v Speaker 1>it's tricky because they go both ways on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would consider the fact that some</v>

306
00:20:15.321 --> 00:20:19.880
<v Speaker 1>things are illuminated so that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to concentrate on is actually a</v>

307
00:20:19.881 --> 00:20:23.660
<v Speaker 1>function of being itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't something that you apply to the</v>

308
00:20:23.661 --> 00:20:25.580
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a characteristic of being.</v>

309
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Some things shine forth as meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some things don't.</v>

310
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Now the existentialists would say at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least in part that you have a duty to</v>

311
00:20:34.611 --> 00:20:39.110
<v Speaker 1>follow the things that shine forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the moral element of this</v>

312
00:20:39.111 --> 00:20:41.840
<v Speaker 1>comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

313
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Ben Swagger said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

314
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:49.280
<v Speaker 1>what we perceive our first foremost not</v>
<v Speaker 1>impressions of tastes,</v>

315
00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:50.620
<v Speaker 1>tone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell or touch.</v>

316
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Not even things or objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but meanings.</v>

317
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.980
<v Speaker 1>And then Ben Swagger and boss split on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

318
00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:03.620
<v Speaker 1>reason for</v>
<v Speaker 1>why some things manifest themselves as</v>

319
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:10.530
<v Speaker 1>compelling and some things don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bins Wanger would say that you come</v>

320
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:16.270
<v Speaker 1>equipped with an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a Kantian idea with an a</v>

321
00:21:16.271 --> 00:21:21.271
<v Speaker 1>priori ontological structure and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine you're reading a book.</v>

322
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

323
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.230
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the book obviously has meaning</v>

324
00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.970
<v Speaker 1>you're reading it and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're into it.</v>

325
00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.600
<v Speaker 1>You might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is the book?</v>

326
00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

327
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.370
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

328
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.980
<v Speaker 1>the book is the physical object that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have in my hand.</v>

329
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what people act like in some</v>

330
00:21:44.431 --> 00:21:45.870
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least that's what they say.</v>

331
00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:48.510
<v Speaker 1>They act like the book is the physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>

332
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.620
<v Speaker 1>But then person a might read the book</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

333
00:21:52.621 --> 00:21:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was a terrible book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Person B might read that book and</v>

334
00:21:55.561 --> 00:21:56.820
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was a great book.</v>

335
00:21:56.821 --> 00:22:00.990
<v Speaker 1>And Person A and B might differ on how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they responded to the characters.</v>

336
00:22:00.991 --> 00:22:04.330
<v Speaker 1>And they're going to differ in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the imagine the situation.</v>

337
00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.460
<v Speaker 1>And like there's a tremendous amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>flexibility in exactly what constitutes</v>

338
00:22:08.461 --> 00:22:10.950
<v Speaker 1>the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you'd say,</v>

339
00:22:10.951 --> 00:22:14.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book is an artifact and the artifact</v>

340
00:22:14.191 --> 00:22:19.080
<v Speaker 1>is produced by the the author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course it's not just produced by</v>

341
00:22:19.081 --> 00:22:23.850
<v Speaker 1>the author because it's produced inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cultural context that shape the author</v>

342
00:22:23.851 --> 00:22:24.750
<v Speaker 1>and that shaped you.</v>

343
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.480
<v Speaker 1>And then you bring something to bear on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book,</v>

344
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.820
<v Speaker 1>which is the sum total of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual knowledge and you're</v>

345
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.710
<v Speaker 1>enculturated knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that it's</v>

346
00:22:34.711 --> 00:22:39.711
<v Speaker 1>almost as if there's a pattern that</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes you and there's a pattern</v>

347
00:22:39.721 --> 00:22:43.200
<v Speaker 1>that constitutes the book and when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the two of them together,</v>

348
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:47.640
<v Speaker 1>you get a juxtaposition of the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns and it's the juxtaposition</v>

349
00:22:47.641 --> 00:22:51.720
<v Speaker 1>that's the book and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the realization of it.</v>

350
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:56.780
<v Speaker 1>This in some part it's led to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>oddities of postmodernism and and to the</v>

351
00:22:57.421 --> 00:23:02.421
<v Speaker 1>claim that there's no canonical meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>to any given text because it's a matter</v>

352
00:23:02.671 --> 00:23:04.410
<v Speaker 1>of interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

353
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well just because it's a matter of</v>

354
00:23:06.901 --> 00:23:11.901
<v Speaker 1>interpretation and even maybe just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the interpretations are very</v>

355
00:23:11.911 --> 00:23:14.940
<v Speaker 1>wide in potential scope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that the text doesn't</v>

356
00:23:14.941 --> 00:23:17.670
<v Speaker 1>have any meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can understand how that idea</v>

357
00:23:17.671 --> 00:23:20.610
<v Speaker 1>might've come about now for been</v>
<v Speaker 1>swinger.</v>

358
00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.400
<v Speaker 1>The reason the book would be meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part it's because you're</v>

359
00:23:25.401 --> 00:23:29.180
<v Speaker 1>imposing something on it and so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be your individuality.</v>

360
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Boss would say the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would say,</v>

361
00:23:32.961 --> 00:23:33.381
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

362
00:23:33.381 --> 00:23:38.381
<v Speaker 1>the book itself is manifesting its</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning to you in some sense of its own</v>

363
00:23:39.171 --> 00:23:41.840
<v Speaker 1>accord and that that's because</v>

364
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.170
<v Speaker 1>boss doesn't make a distinction</v>

365
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:50.070
<v Speaker 2>between the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book and the entire context within</v>

366
00:23:50.071 --> 00:23:52.890
<v Speaker 2>which it's embedded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would consider the meaning</v>

367
00:23:52.891 --> 00:23:55.560
<v Speaker 2>emerging as a consequence of that entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

368
00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.390
<v Speaker 2>You can't separate the book out from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation in which it's embedded.</v>

369
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Here's a map that I made a while back</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helped me understand this,</v>

370
00:24:11.581 --> 00:24:16.581
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists talk about three</v>

371
00:24:17.851 --> 00:24:22.080
<v Speaker 1>elements of being of Dad's side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the unwell,</v>

372
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.030
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another is the Mitt wealth.</v>

373
00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.080
<v Speaker 1>And the third is the AIGA dwells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are various ways to</v>

374
00:24:28.081 --> 00:24:30.870
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can give you a couple.</v>

375
00:24:30.871 --> 00:24:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Umwelt is the natural world.</v>

376
00:24:33.661 --> 00:24:37.230
<v Speaker 1>So when we say nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we mean.</v>

377
00:24:37.231 --> 00:24:37.831
<v Speaker 1>We say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

378
00:24:37.831 --> 00:24:41.880
<v Speaker 1>human beings live in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a natural environment.</v>

379
00:24:41.881 --> 00:24:45.600
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that there's a natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment is like a canonical idea.</v>

380
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

381
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.770
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we even think of the natural environment</v>

382
00:24:49.771 --> 00:24:54.210
<v Speaker 1>sometimes as the unspoiled natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment as if they're our natural</v>

383
00:24:54.211 --> 00:24:57.930
<v Speaker 1>environments that exist in the complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of human</v>

384
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:00.763
<v Speaker 2>endeavor.</v>

385
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And then we also have a social world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the social world is the world of</v>

386
00:25:06.871 --> 00:25:08.880
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's nature and culture.</v>

387
00:25:08.881 --> 00:25:12.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's Umwelt and Mitt wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>

388
00:25:12.931 --> 00:25:15.360
<v Speaker 1>other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the world of the self,</v>

389
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:20.930
<v Speaker 1>which is the part of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>your being that's only accessible to</v>

390
00:25:22.691 --> 00:25:24.430
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's you</v>

391
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.350
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of culture,</v>

392
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.180
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those are the elements of</v>

393
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Dad's side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

394
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.190
<v Speaker 2>for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Swagger,</v>

395
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.640
<v Speaker 1>it's the mid belt that contains most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning,</v>

396
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.800
<v Speaker 1>or at least that structures the meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're reading a great novel,</v>

397
00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.870
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which you can extract</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning from it is a consequence of your</v>

398
00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.950
<v Speaker 1>previous education and your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>inculturation.</v>

399
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:07.933
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

400
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.940
<v Speaker 1>that isn't necessarily the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at things like</v>

401
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.150
<v Speaker 1>if you walk into a bookstore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

402
00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.990
<v Speaker 1>and a book catches your eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say that that book caught my</v>

403
00:26:17.991 --> 00:26:21.140
<v Speaker 1>eye while you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly does that mean?</v>

404
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that out of all the innumerable</v>

405
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.370
<v Speaker 1>entities in the bookstore that could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have caught your eye,</v>

406
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.750
<v Speaker 1>only that one did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might ask why.</v>

407
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Boston would say,</v>

408
00:26:34.221 --> 00:26:37.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is disclosing a particular</v>

409
00:26:37.341 --> 00:26:38.390
<v Speaker 1>meaning to you.</v>

410
00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

411
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:52.200
<v Speaker 1>that has something to do with the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're playing out your individual</v>

412
00:26:52.201 --> 00:26:53.034
<v Speaker 1>destiny.</v>

413
00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.553
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

414
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Let's show you this first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is both a constructivist Stan,</v>

415
00:27:08.261 --> 00:27:10.820
<v Speaker 1>a phenomenological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here,</v>

416
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.860
<v Speaker 1>here's the idea that the thing that's at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the center of reality is the domain</v>

417
00:27:18.101 --> 00:27:20.980
<v Speaker 1>that's not yet mapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

418
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.310
<v Speaker 1>you're in a relationship,</v>

419
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:25.720
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

420
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.640
<v Speaker 1>The relationship is betrayed before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're betrayed,</v>

421
00:27:30.641 --> 00:27:33.400
<v Speaker 1>you're in one place and after you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>betrayed,</v>

422
00:27:33.401 --> 00:27:36.220
<v Speaker 1>you're in another place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before you're betrayed,</v>

423
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:41.140
<v Speaker 1>your world is all structured and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know where you are and what you're doing</v>

424
00:27:41.141 --> 00:27:43.360
<v Speaker 1>and who you're with and what everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

425
00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:47.110
<v Speaker 1>The second after you're betrayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that's true.</v>

426
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:48.663
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

427
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.080
<v Speaker 1>the second after your be trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing is structured.</v>

428
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like everything reverts to see to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic place.</v>

429
00:27:57.801 --> 00:28:02.801
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only time that you encounter a pure</v>

430
00:28:03.201 --> 00:28:05.690
<v Speaker 1>view of what the world itself is made</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of,</v>

431
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.720
<v Speaker 1>what the ground of being is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when you encounter an error that's so</v>

432
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:16.690
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming that your current framework</v>
<v Speaker 1>of meaning is no longer applicable.</v>

433
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.460
<v Speaker 1>So the framework blows apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't as if nothing happens when</v>

434
00:28:22.461 --> 00:28:26.300
<v Speaker 1>the framework blows apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're in a committed</v>

435
00:28:26.301 --> 00:28:30.080
<v Speaker 1>relationship and you find security in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you believe that the security</v>

436
00:28:30.081 --> 00:28:34.760
<v Speaker 1>is genuine and that's blows apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everything that you presumed is</v>

437
00:28:34.761 --> 00:28:37.560
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your mid dwelt.</v>

438
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.760
<v Speaker 1>But when that disappears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something underneath it.</v>

439
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.690
<v Speaker 1>And what's underneath it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

440
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.670
<v Speaker 1>that's the ground of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ground of reality is what you</v>

441
00:28:49.671 --> 00:28:54.671
<v Speaker 1>explore to put yourself back together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to put the world back together.</v>

442
00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.380
<v Speaker 1>So you're betrayed and you fall into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and you're anxious.</v>

443
00:29:00.381 --> 00:29:02.960
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility of a new</v>

444
00:29:02.961 --> 00:29:06.230
<v Speaker 1>relationship that beckons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps your previous relationship</v>

445
00:29:06.231 --> 00:29:09.350
<v Speaker 1>wasn't perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the chaos that you fall into is</v>

446
00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.700
<v Speaker 1>depressing and anxiety provoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So generates a lot of negative emotion,</v>

447
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.960
<v Speaker 1>but sort of lurking behind that are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of dim remnants of hope.</v>

448
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:23.450
<v Speaker 1>And then as you proceed forward with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your grief and your misery,</v>

449
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:28.690
<v Speaker 1>and you're attempting to reconstruct a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable motive being you take out of that</v>

450
00:29:30.171 --> 00:29:31.550
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a normal us,</v>

451
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.930
<v Speaker 1>you and the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So another way of thinking about this is</v>

452
00:29:39.981 --> 00:29:44.350
<v Speaker 1>that for the phenomenologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where they're similar to the</v>

453
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:47.500
<v Speaker 1>constructivists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground of reality isn't so much</v>

454
00:29:47.501 --> 00:29:51.520
<v Speaker 1>matter as it is information and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

455
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:55.120
<v Speaker 1>when you're living in in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed world and things are going</v>

456
00:29:55.121 --> 00:29:59.680
<v Speaker 1>the way that you want them to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've constrained that information</v>

457
00:29:59.681 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 1>in a particular way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constrained and narrowed it in a</v>

458
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:06.970
<v Speaker 1>particular way that serves your</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular narrow end and that that</v>

459
00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:10.540
<v Speaker 1>makes things much more comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you don't have to deal with</v>

460
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the information that constitutes the</v>

461
00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:14.800
<v Speaker 1>entire world.</v>

462
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:20.190
<v Speaker 1>You can remove most of it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well all that's relevant to me,</v>

463
00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:25.270
<v Speaker 1>all that necessarily makes up my world</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being are these</v>

464
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:31.910
<v Speaker 1>circumscribed is this circumscribed set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of phenomena and that works well when</v>

465
00:30:32.761 --> 00:30:35.460
<v Speaker 1>it's working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it doesn't work and it blows</v>

466
00:30:35.461 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that puts you somewhere else and that</v>

467
00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:42.570
<v Speaker 1>that being put somewhere else can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>well revelatory sometimes.</v>

468
00:30:42.571 --> 00:30:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes people make new</v>
<v Speaker 1>discoveries that blow their previous</v>

469
00:30:46.651 --> 00:30:50.400
<v Speaker 1>frames of reference and it's like are</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiring and overwhelming to them in a</v>

470
00:30:50.401 --> 00:30:54.090
<v Speaker 1>positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you can come across something</v>

471
00:30:54.091 --> 00:30:59.091
<v Speaker 1>new that helps you reconfigure the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're living almost instantly in a</v>

472
00:31:00.061 --> 00:31:04.500
<v Speaker 1>more comprehensive and fuller way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But more common is the traumatic</v>

473
00:31:04.501 --> 00:31:07.680
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is when the presuppositions of</v>

474
00:31:07.681 --> 00:31:12.681
<v Speaker 1>your world are shifted dramatically and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fall into the surrounding chaos,</v>

475
00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:18.560
<v Speaker 1>then it's so hard on you that you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually does use psychophysiological</v>

476
00:31:18.721 --> 00:31:19.554
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>

477
00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.013
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

478
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:31.710
<v Speaker 1>You remember that</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing I showed you</v>

479
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 1>with the little ovals at the bottom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bigger ovals at the top,</v>

480
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:40.030
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember that?</v>

481
00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:45.031
<v Speaker 1>Does everybody remember that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decomposed say good person,</v>

482
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:50.190
<v Speaker 1>which is a very high order abstraction</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to put a fork on the table,</v>

483
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:53.470
<v Speaker 1>which is a motor movement that's part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>making dinner,</v>

484
00:31:53.471 --> 00:31:57.220
<v Speaker 1>which is part of being a good parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of being a good citizen,</v>

485
00:31:57.221 --> 00:32:00.730
<v Speaker 1>which is part of being a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea was that the higher order</v>

486
00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:05.731
<v Speaker 1>abstractions can be concretized down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the motor behaviors in hierarchy.</v>

487
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

488
00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.093
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

489
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:16.250
<v Speaker 1>if someone goes after you at the good</v>
<v Speaker 1>person level of analysis and they just</v>

490
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.280
<v Speaker 1>demolish you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know in the course of say a three</v>

491
00:32:20.281 --> 00:32:25.281
<v Speaker 1>year relationship hacking away at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that you have any moral worth</v>

492
00:32:25.741 --> 00:32:28.290
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what happens when you're abused,</v>

493
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:33.740
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to knock you into</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces at a very complex and high level</v>

494
00:32:35.281 --> 00:32:37.410
<v Speaker 1>of abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that can undermine your entire</v>

495
00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.240
<v Speaker 1>worldview if the person instead,</v>

496
00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:41.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

497
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.690
<v Speaker 1>helps you retool the little behaviors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and little micro structures that make</v>

498
00:32:45.691 --> 00:32:49.170
<v Speaker 1>you up and if you're willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in that and if you're open</v>

499
00:32:49.171 --> 00:32:54.000
<v Speaker 1>to corrective feedback from the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can continually adjust yourself</v>

500
00:32:54.001 --> 00:32:58.590
<v Speaker 1>at a small level and then that makes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in the hierarchy little higher,</v>

501
00:32:58.591 --> 00:33:01.350
<v Speaker 1>a little healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that makes the aggregation of</v>

502
00:33:01.351 --> 00:33:03.540
<v Speaker 1>those things a little higher in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

503
00:33:03.541 --> 00:33:05.040
<v Speaker 1>a little healthier and little more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complete.</v>

504
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Then you can do this</v>

505
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:13.080
<v Speaker 1>bit by bit retooling</v>
<v Speaker 1>without ever having to suffer the</v>

506
00:33:13.661 --> 00:33:16.240
<v Speaker 1>demolition of huge chunks of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

507
00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.360
<v Speaker 1>So let's go back to the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's a betrayal.</v>

508
00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:24.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like virtually every time someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets flipped upside down because of a</v>

509
00:33:25.751 --> 00:33:29.080
<v Speaker 1>betrayal interrelationship after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>betrayal happens,</v>

510
00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.560
<v Speaker 1>they say to themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were all these signs I didn't pay</v>

511
00:33:32.561 --> 00:33:37.561
<v Speaker 1>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when maybe the first sign is who</v>

512
00:33:37.571 --> 00:33:40.540
<v Speaker 1>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your partner starts to flirt a bit more</v>

513
00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:45.340
<v Speaker 1>when you go out on a social occasion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a lot more,</v>

514
00:33:45.341 --> 00:33:50.110
<v Speaker 1>just a bit more and you decide because</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're timid that that that's</v>

515
00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:52.540
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to just do anything</v>

516
00:33:52.541 --> 00:33:54.490
<v Speaker 1>about it but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

517
00:33:55.810 --> 00:34:00.810
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It grabs your attention and it means</v>

518
00:34:03.071 --> 00:34:06.550
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you decide is it's not worth</v>

519
00:34:06.551 --> 00:34:09.910
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe the next eight times that</v>

520
00:34:09.911 --> 00:34:12.040
<v Speaker 1>you go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing happens,</v>

521
00:34:12.041 --> 00:34:16.840
<v Speaker 1>but it happens at a somewhat accelerated</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate and then maybe the person starts to</v>

522
00:34:16.841 --> 00:34:21.760
<v Speaker 1>go out without you and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this progression towards the end</v>

523
00:34:21.761 --> 00:34:25.000
<v Speaker 1>state of betrayal and every time you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little hint,</v>

524
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.120
<v Speaker 1>the world tells you that something's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>

525
00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:32.770
<v Speaker 1>you put it aside and you failed to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>it into account.</v>

526
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're forgoing your opportunity.</v>

527
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

528
00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:43.300
<v Speaker 1>to adjust the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At micro stages because maybe what you</v>

529
00:34:43.301 --> 00:34:46.960
<v Speaker 1>should've done the first time that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened is you should have gone home</v>

530
00:34:46.961 --> 00:34:48.990
<v Speaker 1>with your partner and sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

531
00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:53.710
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is what was happening,</v>

532
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.180
<v Speaker 1>why are you doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

533
00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.140
<v Speaker 1>here's how you should have behaved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's going to be a</v>

534
00:34:59.141 --> 00:35:01.030
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's absolutely no doubt about it,</v>

535
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:02.463
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

536
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
<v Speaker 1>it might be a micro fight instead of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship is over fight and in</v>

537
00:35:10.091 --> 00:35:14.380
<v Speaker 1>order to keep our relationship healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it needs,</v>

538
00:35:14.381 --> 00:35:16.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be retooled at micro levels</v>

539
00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:20.360
<v Speaker 1>constantly and the same as the case with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own character.</v>

540
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.450
<v Speaker 1>When you encounter something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected,</v>

541
00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.030
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's small enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>handle,</v>

542
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:28.070
<v Speaker 1>you need to extract the information from</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

543
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:32.450
<v Speaker 1>rebuild the world and rebuild yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe if you continue doing</v>

544
00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:35.660
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you get evidence of an</v>

545
00:35:35.661 --> 00:35:39.000
<v Speaker 1>anomaly or an error or every the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest some meaning to you,</v>

546
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.530
<v Speaker 1>then you won't have to fall apart</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the structure that constitutes</v>

547
00:35:43.531 --> 00:35:48.531
<v Speaker 1>you is going to remain viable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy from the bottom up.</v>

548
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.590
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then those errors are going to</v>

549
00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:57.591
<v Speaker 1>accumulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they finally do manifest</v>

550
00:35:57.841 --> 00:36:00.360
<v Speaker 1>themselves as unavoidable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when your partner says,</v>

551
00:36:00.361 --> 00:36:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be with you anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I've been with someone else for the</v>

552
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.940
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no ignoring that,</v>

553
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.190
<v Speaker 1>then the whole thing comes crashing</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

554
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.850
<v Speaker 1>You're no longer in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're no longer in a good relationship.</v>

555
00:36:11.851 --> 00:36:13.800
<v Speaker 1>And then all the other things become</v>
<v Speaker 1>questionable.</v>

556
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:19.910
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning manifests itself</v>

557
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.880
<v Speaker 1>so that you can read tool</v>
<v Speaker 1>being itself.</v>

558
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:30.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

559
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:35.730
<v Speaker 1>on a continual basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well simultaneously minimizing the risk</v>

560
00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:41.451
<v Speaker 1>of total collapse and morality then</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes the act of paying sufficient</v>

561
00:36:45.601 --> 00:36:50.601
<v Speaker 1>attention and reacting sufficiently so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that corrective process occurs now.</v>

562
00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:07.310
<v Speaker 1>So you're inside one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going from point a to point b.</v>

563
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.190
<v Speaker 1>And as you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you want to have happen,</v>

564
00:37:10.191 --> 00:37:14.660
<v Speaker 1>happen and things you don't want to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and things you don't understand</v>

565
00:37:14.661 --> 00:37:17.960
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's say that you investigate</v>

566
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.230
<v Speaker 1>the things that you don't want to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and you investigate the things</v>

567
00:37:23.231 --> 00:37:26.290
<v Speaker 1>that you didn't expect and you do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they come up.</v>

568
00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:29.890
<v Speaker 1>So then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

569
00:37:29.891 --> 00:37:34.891
<v Speaker 1>partly what happens is you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change your perceptions a bit and you're</v>

570
00:37:35.291 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 1>going to change your actions a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that'll,</v>

571
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.110
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

572
00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:41.990
<v Speaker 1>culminating over time is that this whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>structural change.</v>

573
00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.320
<v Speaker 1>So instead of going from point a to</v>
<v Speaker 1>point b,</v>

574
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:50.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe you start shifting so that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going from point a to point c because as</v>

575
00:37:50.121 --> 00:37:54.890
<v Speaker 1>you're gathering information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of the inadequacies of</v>

576
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:59.630
<v Speaker 1>the way you're looking at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are you improving your ability</v>

577
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:04.010
<v Speaker 1>to perceive and to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also gathering information</v>

578
00:38:04.011 --> 00:38:07.700
<v Speaker 1>that helps shift your perspective to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better point b.</v>

579
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:08.451
<v Speaker 1>Because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

580
00:38:08.451 --> 00:38:11.480
<v Speaker 1>where are you going and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is while you have</v>

581
00:38:11.481 --> 00:38:13.160
<v Speaker 1>a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get your degree.</v>

582
00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what your longterm plan is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no reason to assume that</v>

583
00:38:17.991 --> 00:38:22.880
<v Speaker 1>your longterm plan is correct even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though there's no reason to assume that</v>

584
00:38:22.881 --> 00:38:26.360
<v Speaker 1>you can do without one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're in this weird situation where</v>

585
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:30.680
<v Speaker 1>you have to live within a bounded space</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bounded space is going to</v>

586
00:38:30.681 --> 00:38:33.440
<v Speaker 1>produce errors and it's also going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

587
00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:38.110
<v Speaker 1>But at the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you use the bounded space,</v>

588
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:41.110
<v Speaker 1>then you can transform it continually</v>
<v Speaker 1>across time,</v>

589
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.970
<v Speaker 1>even what it's aimed at and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimize the probability of precipitous</v>

590
00:38:45.971 --> 00:38:46.804
<v Speaker 1>collapse.</v>

591
00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:48.613
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

592
00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.710
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you how this has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented.</v>

593
00:38:52.711 --> 00:38:55.710
<v Speaker 1>It's very complicated and difficult.</v>

594
00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

595
00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:02.670
<v Speaker 1>So on the right you see that the Harry</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potter snitch thing,</v>

596
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the left here you see this</v>

597
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.780
<v Speaker 1>incredibly peculiar l chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>

598
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.520
<v Speaker 1>And the image is something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what this image means.</v>

599
00:39:18.521 --> 00:39:22.960
<v Speaker 1>It means at the base of the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this weird combination of matter and</v>

600
00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:25.180
<v Speaker 1>spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is matter and this is spirit.</v>

601
00:39:25.181 --> 00:39:29.410
<v Speaker 1>The winged element represents spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then out of that comes something</v>

602
00:39:29.411 --> 00:39:34.411
<v Speaker 1>that's like primordial and Reptilian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then out of that comes something</v>

603
00:39:35.321 --> 00:39:37.340
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

604
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.433
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

605
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a map of the way that consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges from the base of reality.</v>

606
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.023
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

607
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.140
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that this thing and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

608
00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:53.010
<v Speaker 1>the snitch and that this thing is called</v>
<v Speaker 1>a round chaos.</v>

609
00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.710
<v Speaker 1>This thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snatch and the round chaos are the</v>

610
00:39:55.711 --> 00:39:59.850
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in in Harry Potter,</v>

611
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.560
<v Speaker 1>when he plays Quidditch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember piaget had such an emphasis on</v>

612
00:40:04.561 --> 00:40:05.394
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

613
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Piaget believed that games were the sub</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of human culture.</v>

614
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:10.860
<v Speaker 1>And quidditch is this weird two level</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

615
00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.380
<v Speaker 1>We're on one level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like soccer,</v>

616
00:40:13.381 --> 00:40:16.350
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then on another level you have two</v>

617
00:40:16.351 --> 00:40:19.920
<v Speaker 1>players that are seekers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they seek is this snitch</v>

618
00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:25.500
<v Speaker 1>and the snatch is this thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>captures your attention.</v>

619
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.110
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's Goldman winging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It moves around very fast.</v>

620
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:30.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like mercury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit mercury,</v>

621
00:40:30.481 --> 00:40:35.010
<v Speaker 1>because mercury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the God had winged feet and he was the</v>

622
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:38.580
<v Speaker 1>messenger of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

623
00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:41.820
<v Speaker 1>that's how mercury was conceived of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you something else that's</v>

624
00:40:41.821 --> 00:40:44.880
<v Speaker 1>weird about mercury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mercury is a metal as well.</v>

625
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.170
<v Speaker 1>And if you mix mercury with sand and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sand has gold in it,</v>

626
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.470
<v Speaker 1>then the mercury will pick up the sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then or the gold,</v>

627
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.170
<v Speaker 1>and then you can heat up the mercury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all that's left is gold.</v>

628
00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:00.300
<v Speaker 1>So Mercury will lead you to where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold is and the spirit Mercurius the</v>

629
00:41:00.301 --> 00:41:03.390
<v Speaker 1>mercurial spirit was the messenger of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gods.</v>

630
00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.480
<v Speaker 1>And if you paid attention to mercury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the God,</v>

631
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.290
<v Speaker 1>then you gathered the gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't the gold of fools.</v>

632
00:41:10.291 --> 00:41:12.780
<v Speaker 1>It was the gold that made your lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>

633
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:16.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same thing that's played</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in this weird quidditch game.</v>

634
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.320
<v Speaker 1>The two best players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fastest,</v>

635
00:41:19.321 --> 00:41:22.470
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are most awake aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing the normal game.</v>

636
00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:27.540
<v Speaker 1>They're playing a super ordinate game</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the super ordered game is pay</v>

637
00:41:27.541 --> 00:41:30.270
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention.</v>

638
00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.620
<v Speaker 1>And if you pay attention then you'll get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing</v>

639
00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.440
<v Speaker 1>that's most valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You win the game.</v>

640
00:41:38.441 --> 00:41:40.870
<v Speaker 1>But there's more than that because in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Harry Potter series,</v>

641
00:41:40.871 --> 00:41:42.820
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a piece of soul in that.</v>

642
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:48.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's related to the idea that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention to what interests you,</v>

643
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:53.980
<v Speaker 1>what manifest itself is meaning full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do you build the world out of</v>

644
00:41:53.981 --> 00:41:58.600
<v Speaker 1>that because you're differentiating</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's undifferentiated into</v>

645
00:41:58.601 --> 00:42:00.520
<v Speaker 1>something that's comprehensible and</v>
<v Speaker 1>usable,</v>

646
00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.370
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time you're doing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing to yourself.</v>

647
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the constructivist idea,</v>

648
00:42:05.741 --> 00:42:06.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that,</v>

649
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.343
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you,</v>

650
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.650
<v Speaker 1>where do you come from?</v>

651
00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come from exploration and the</v>

652
00:42:13.861 --> 00:42:15.870
<v Speaker 1>generation of information and</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration.</v>

653
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:21.290
<v Speaker 1>What should you explore while the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shine forth to you?</v>

654
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:27.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the phenomenal logical idea and</v>
<v Speaker 1>existential idea is if you refuse to</v>

655
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:32.760
<v Speaker 1>explore the things that shine forth for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

656
00:42:32.761 --> 00:42:35.550
<v Speaker 1>that capture your interest in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

657
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:41.600
<v Speaker 1>then that will lessen you as a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll make you weaker and progressively</v>

658
00:42:42.391 --> 00:42:45.750
<v Speaker 1>weaker because not only do you remain</v>
<v Speaker 1>unformed,</v>

659
00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:51.080
<v Speaker 1>but the ratio of chaos to world in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of being becomes too intolerable,</v>

660
00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.640
<v Speaker 1>too much chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not enough order,</v>

661
00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:01.350
<v Speaker 1>not enough of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the whole thing is unstable.</v>

662
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Then you've only got two options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that you lose belief than being</v>

663
00:43:06.031 --> 00:43:08.850
<v Speaker 1>itself and that's like a nihilistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>

664
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:14.150
<v Speaker 1>And the other is you turn to some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of totalitarian or ideological solution</v>

665
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:20.270
<v Speaker 1>that fills in for where you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's an abdication of your</v>

666
00:43:21.841 --> 00:43:26.100
<v Speaker 1>individual responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the consequences of turning to</v>

667
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.450
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian ideologies like that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

668
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.980
<v Speaker 1>they stagnate and become brittle because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no transformation in them</v>

669
00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.930
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because all of the people inside of them</v>

670
00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.740
<v Speaker 1>have decided that transformation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary.</v>

671
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:49.160
<v Speaker 1>And so they become increasingly outdated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and corrupt.</v>

672
00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.753
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

673
00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

674
00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:57.080
<v Speaker 1>that's the first step on the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>having everything fall apart in the most</v>

675
00:43:57.391 --> 00:44:02.250
<v Speaker 1>horrible possible way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that plays out at the state level,</v>

676
00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.740
<v Speaker 1>just like it plays out at the individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

677
00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a dream I had about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>since we're just out of the</v>

678
00:44:15.331 --> 00:44:18.270
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can show you using this,</v>

679
00:44:18.271 --> 00:44:22.730
<v Speaker 1>how dreams often</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve problems.</v>

680
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:26.933
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

681
00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll just read it to you cause I wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>it when I just,</v>

682
00:44:30.121 --> 00:44:33.870
<v Speaker 1>after I had it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just tell it to you.</v>

683
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.473
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

684
00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:45.720
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I saw was</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a view from a space shuttle.</v>

685
00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:51.840
<v Speaker 1>So it was a global view and I could see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Atlantic Ocean and on the surface of</v>

686
00:44:52.991 --> 00:44:56.710
<v Speaker 1>the Atlanta Goshen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were four hurricanes and they were</v>

687
00:44:56.711 --> 00:45:01.240
<v Speaker 1>in a quadrant like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a circle here in a circle</v>

688
00:45:01.241 --> 00:45:06.241
<v Speaker 1>here in a circle here in a circle here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we're very large hurricanes.</v>

689
00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean one hurricanes quite good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for,</v>

690
00:45:09.371 --> 00:45:12.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of hurricanes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was impressive.</v>

691
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:17.670
<v Speaker 1>And so then the next thing I saw was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bank of scientists in kind of a dark</v>

692
00:45:18.311 --> 00:45:23.311
<v Speaker 1>room watching TV screens focused on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurricane storm event and wondering what</v>

693
00:45:26.411 --> 00:45:29.770
<v Speaker 1>was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing I saw was this</v>

694
00:45:29.771 --> 00:45:34.771
<v Speaker 1>little ball about this big hovering over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface of the ocean.</v>

695
00:45:34.991 --> 00:45:39.220
<v Speaker 1>So now I was in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the four hurricanes had an eye in the</v>

696
00:45:39.221 --> 00:45:40.810
<v Speaker 1>middle of the immuno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a calm place.</v>

697
00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.870
<v Speaker 1>And so this little ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was about 10 feet above the</v>

698
00:45:43.871 --> 00:45:46.580
<v Speaker 1>surface of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in that calm place.</v>

699
00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.960
<v Speaker 1>And the storms were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a company mint.</v>

700
00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:53.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was zooming along at a very rapid</v>

701
00:45:53.141 --> 00:45:55.150
<v Speaker 1>rate and it was bringing the storms with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

702
00:45:55.810 --> 00:46:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And so all of the scientists with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>satellites,</v>

703
00:46:00.101 --> 00:46:04.120
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to figure out what this</v>
<v Speaker 1>little ball that was 10 feet off the</v>

704
00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:09.080
<v Speaker 1>ocean surface and the needed like four</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurricanes to accompany in that a</v>

705
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.920
<v Speaker 1>company yet they're trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what this thing was.</v>

706
00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next scene was I was a third</v>

707
00:46:17.261 --> 00:46:20.710
<v Speaker 1>person observer and I was in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a small room,</v>

708
00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:23.950
<v Speaker 1>about eight by eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in the middle of the room there was</v>

709
00:46:23.951 --> 00:46:27.210
<v Speaker 1>this display case like a museum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

710
00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:29.350
<v Speaker 1>like a Victorian Museum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was made out of wood,</v>

711
00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:34.560
<v Speaker 1>the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had this glass and inside the case</v>

712
00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.880
<v Speaker 1>was this ball and it was just floating.</v>

713
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:40.870
<v Speaker 1>And inside the room was Steven Hawking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

714
00:46:40.871 --> 00:46:45.871
<v Speaker 1>the physicist in the wheelchair and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>faceless president of the United States.</v>

715
00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:49.600
<v Speaker 1>It didn't matter who he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just mattered that he was president</v>

716
00:46:49.601 --> 00:46:52.180
<v Speaker 1>of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the room itself,</v>

717
00:46:52.181 --> 00:46:55.930
<v Speaker 1>I remember from the dream was made out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of titanium dioxide.</v>

718
00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:58.810
<v Speaker 1>And I woke up and I after this dream and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

719
00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:04.440
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is titanium dioxide?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the walls were seven feet thick.</v>

720
00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:10.740
<v Speaker 1>So that the idea was that little ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had caused those four storms was</v>

721
00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:13.210
<v Speaker 1>going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they caught it and they put it in that</v>

722
00:47:13.211 --> 00:47:17.350
<v Speaker 1>room and it was going to stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Titanium dioxide turned out to be the</v>

723
00:47:17.351 --> 00:47:21.000
<v Speaker 1>metal that the hall of the starship</v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise is built out of.</v>

724
00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

725
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:26.980
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it represented like an impermeable</v>

726
00:47:26.981 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

727
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:35.460
<v Speaker 1>so there was this box made out of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>high tech metal and then inside the room</v>

728
00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.330
<v Speaker 1>the American president was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he sort of representative of the myth</v>

729
00:47:40.331 --> 00:47:40.931
<v Speaker 1>dwelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

730
00:47:40.931 --> 00:47:43.300
<v Speaker 1>the social environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sort of King of the social</v>

731
00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:45.520
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Stephen Hawking,</v>

732
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.730
<v Speaker 1>while Stephen Hawking is disembodied</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality,</v>

733
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:50.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

734
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:56.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the room was a classification system</v>

735
00:47:56.501 --> 00:47:58.000
<v Speaker 1>in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this ball,</v>

736
00:47:58.001 --> 00:48:01.270
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was stuck in there.</v>

737
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:05.890
<v Speaker 1>And so it was going to be a thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could look at in a museum and it</v>

738
00:48:05.891 --> 00:48:08.830
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it had been fixed.</v>

739
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.140
<v Speaker 1>And so I was watching this thing</v>

740
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:13.723
<v Speaker 3>and then</v>

741
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:18.460
<v Speaker 1>when I was watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did two weird things in the museum</v>

742
00:48:18.461 --> 00:48:20.590
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing it did was turned into a</v>

743
00:48:20.591 --> 00:48:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Chrysalis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know what a Chrysalis is.</v>

744
00:48:23.741 --> 00:48:26.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cocoon that a butterfly</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out of.</v>

745
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.170
<v Speaker 1>And you may not know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the word,</v>

746
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:31.090
<v Speaker 1>the Greek word for butterflies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche,</v>

747
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:37.030
<v Speaker 1>and the reason the psyche is a butterfly</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because the psyche is something that</v>

748
00:48:37.031 --> 00:48:40.060
<v Speaker 1>transforms and it transforms towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

749
00:48:40.061 --> 00:48:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Let's like an aerial spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this ball was transforming.</v>

750
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:47.920
<v Speaker 1>It transformed into a Chrysalis and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did a really strange thing.</v>

751
00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:51.310
<v Speaker 1>It transformed into a pipe like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking pipe.</v>

752
00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.400
<v Speaker 1>It was a mere Sharm pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a carve pipe,</v>

753
00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Irish sort of looks like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little saxophone and thing,</v>

754
00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:01.810
<v Speaker 1>but it was definitely a pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was the whole dream.</v>

755
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.950
<v Speaker 1>And I woke up and I thought I got the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chrysalis idea,</v>

756
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:12.400
<v Speaker 1>this whatever this ball was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the thing that's capable of</v>

757
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:14.890
<v Speaker 1>transforming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I thought,</v>

758
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.780
<v Speaker 1>what the hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

759
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.180
<v Speaker 1>What could that possum pipe possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>

760
00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.153
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

761
00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:28.900
<v Speaker 1>one other thing transformed into</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chrysalis and then back to a ball and</v>

762
00:49:29.481 --> 00:49:34.400
<v Speaker 1>then it transformed into a pipe and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>back into a ball and then went and shot</v>

763
00:49:34.401 --> 00:49:38.390
<v Speaker 1>out of the case and shot right through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seven feet walls and it was gone and</v>

764
00:49:38.391 --> 00:49:40.220
<v Speaker 1>it just left a hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was,</v>

765
00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:42.890
<v Speaker 1>it was moving so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was just a hole in the case and</v>

766
00:49:42.891 --> 00:49:44.510
<v Speaker 1>there was a hole in the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the end of that.</v>

767
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.180
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a ball.</v>

768
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:49.400
<v Speaker 1>It did its Chrysalis thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get his pipe thing,</v>

769
00:49:49.401 --> 00:49:54.401
<v Speaker 1>and then it was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That barks was not going to hold it.</v>

770
00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:04.880
<v Speaker 1>So after I had that dream quite a while</v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

771
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.540
<v Speaker 1>two years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this little poem from Dante is</v>

772
00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.070
<v Speaker 1>from the inferno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inferno is an interesting book</v>

773
00:50:13.071 --> 00:50:15.970
<v Speaker 1>because it's Dante is attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

774
00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:21.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a book about hell and it's Dante is</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt in a sense to turn the old idea</v>

775
00:50:21.021 --> 00:50:23.090
<v Speaker 1>of hell into something that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological.</v>

776
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:28.690
<v Speaker 1>So Dante has this vision of hell as this</v>
<v Speaker 1>place has multiple depths with something</v>

777
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:34.040
<v Speaker 1>that's the absolute worst right at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

778
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:38.660
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense it's his attempt to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with a category structure of,</v>

779
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 1>of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually puts betrayers right in the</v>

780
00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:44.660
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He figured that was the worst form of,</v>

781
00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:50.300
<v Speaker 1>of moral error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

782
00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:54.520
<v Speaker 1>here's part of the poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virgil and Dante are going into the</v>

783
00:50:54.521 --> 00:50:56.470
<v Speaker 1>inferno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virgil's the guide.</v>

784
00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly they're broke on the dirty</v>
<v Speaker 1>swell of the dark marsh,</v>

785
00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:04.900
<v Speaker 1>a squall of terrible sound that sent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremor through both shores of hell.</v>

786
00:51:04.901 --> 00:51:09.901
<v Speaker 1>A sound as if two continents of air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one frigid in one scorching clashed head</v>

787
00:51:10.181 --> 00:51:13.330
<v Speaker 1>on in a war of wins that strips the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forest bare,</v>

788
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:17.430
<v Speaker 1>ripped off whole boughs and blew them</v>
<v Speaker 1>helter skelter along the range of dust</v>

789
00:51:17.431 --> 00:51:22.431
<v Speaker 1>it raised before it making the beasts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shepherds run from shelter run for</v>

790
00:51:22.631 --> 00:51:26.170
<v Speaker 1>shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a messenger from God comes down</v>

791
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:29.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's how he makes himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested.</v>

792
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:30.241
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

793
00:51:30.241 --> 00:51:34.560
<v Speaker 1>That's very much like this dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had two continents of air</v>

794
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:36.730
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

795
00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:40.630
<v Speaker 1>there was this similar idea that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was something at the center that was</v>

796
00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.970
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't be encapsulated in a,</v>

797
00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:44.440
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

798
00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.530
<v Speaker 1>what a conceptual structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least not for any length of time.</v>

799
00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.780
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being is like that.</v>

800
00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:54.220
<v Speaker 1>You can't encapsulate it in a conceptual</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure for any length of time,</v>

801
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:58.240
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you think you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if you're right enough for the</v>

802
00:51:58.241 --> 00:52:01.840
<v Speaker 1>time being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being is transforming and you have to</v>

803
00:52:01.841 --> 00:52:05.680
<v Speaker 1>keep up with it because otherwise the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that you were inhabiting</v>

804
00:52:05.681 --> 00:52:09.220
<v Speaker 1>becomes dead and decays and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall apart.</v>

805
00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:14.440
<v Speaker 1>And so you need a conceptual structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it orients you,</v>

806
00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:19.870
<v Speaker 1>but it can't be static.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with totalitarian</v>

807
00:52:19.871 --> 00:52:23.800
<v Speaker 1>ideology is that totalitarian ideology</v>
<v Speaker 1>is predicated on the idea.</v>

808
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:28.660
<v Speaker 1>It's utopia that you can finally model</v>
<v Speaker 1>things once and for all.</v>

809
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.350
<v Speaker 1>And so once you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect and then it never has to</v>

810
00:52:32.351 --> 00:52:33.880
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

811
00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.850
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically,</v>

812
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not wrong arbitrarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a kind of a relative wrong,</v>

813
00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.400
<v Speaker 1>it's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's because whatever being is,</v>

814
00:52:45.401 --> 00:52:48.160
<v Speaker 1>it's not static.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so whatever it is that you inhabit</v>

815
00:52:48.161 --> 00:52:53.161
<v Speaker 1>to allow being to work in your favor</v>
<v Speaker 1>also can't be static,</v>

816
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:58.200
<v Speaker 1>even though it has to be a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I figured out why it was a pipe and</v>

817
00:53:02.191 --> 00:53:05.040
<v Speaker 1>not talk about three years for me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that out.</v>

818
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.250
<v Speaker 1>And this is a famous painting by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magritte,</v>

819
00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:10.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it says this is not a pipe.</v>

820
00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:12.720
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

821
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.863
<v Speaker 2>What does he mean?</v>

822
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:21.140
<v Speaker 1>The first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a pipe?</v>

823
00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 2>What did we think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of idea.</v>

824
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 2>But that's</v>

825
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:26.993
<v Speaker 3>the image.</v>

826
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:30.470
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually an image of an image of a</v>

827
00:53:30.471 --> 00:53:31.400
<v Speaker 1>pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

828
00:53:31.401 --> 00:53:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Because we're projecting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yes,</v>

829
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:35.960
<v Speaker 1>you're exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a pipe.</v>

830
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.860
<v Speaker 1>And so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's my greed trying to</v>

831
00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:44.630
<v Speaker 1>communicate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the idea?</v>

832
00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:54.260
<v Speaker 1>The idea is the conception is not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>object or another way of putting it is</v>

833
00:53:54.261 --> 00:53:58.640
<v Speaker 1>the map is not the territory and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in the map in some sense,</v>

834
00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.960
<v Speaker 1>but the territory is always underneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and the reason that little ball</v>

835
00:54:02.961 --> 00:54:06.200
<v Speaker 1>turned into a pipe was to make that</v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

836
00:54:06.201 --> 00:54:11.201
<v Speaker 1>It's like it was in this box and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>being transformed into a,</v>

837
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:18.040
<v Speaker 1>an entity that was defined and static</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it it,</v>

838
00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.900
<v Speaker 1>it said two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It said,</v>

839
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:23.960
<v Speaker 1>everything transforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Chrysalis and everything</v>

840
00:54:23.961 --> 00:54:28.961
<v Speaker 1>transforms into psyche because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>butterfly is psyche and then it said</v>

841
00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:34.240
<v Speaker 1>don't mistake the map for the territory</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it left and</v>

842
00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:41.740
<v Speaker 1>the being that manifests itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the being that shines forth in the</v>

843
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:48.280
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists sense is the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot be encapsulated inside any</v>

844
00:54:50.541 --> 00:54:54.170
<v Speaker 1>conceptual structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always outside of it.</v>

845
00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.650
<v Speaker 1>It's always outside of it and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep up with it.</v>

846
00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why in the Harry Potter book for</v>

847
00:54:59.721 --> 00:55:04.721
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best players don't play that game.</v>

848
00:55:04.771 --> 00:55:09.771
<v Speaker 1>They chased the snitch and what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means is that they follow what manifests</v>

849
00:55:10.021 --> 00:55:14.760
<v Speaker 1>itself to them as most meaningful at any</v>
<v Speaker 1>given time.</v>

850
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Now young would have thought of that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manifestation of the self cause he</v>

851
00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:23.880
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like I can never remember who.</v>

852
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:27.810
<v Speaker 1>I can never differentiate these two</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers</v>

853
00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:37.310
<v Speaker 1>young's like bins wanger he assumes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning is a consequence of the</v>

854
00:55:38.471 --> 00:55:43.471
<v Speaker 1>action of some internal structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less that he characterized as</v>

855
00:55:43.631 --> 00:55:48.631
<v Speaker 1>the self</v>
<v Speaker 1>boss's perspective is more in some sense</v>

856
00:55:53.631 --> 00:55:55.910
<v Speaker 1>it's more like a classical religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

857
00:55:55.911 --> 00:55:59.330
<v Speaker 1>although he dispenses almost entirely</v>
<v Speaker 1>with any religion,</v>

858
00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:03.940
<v Speaker 1>just language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes the claim that meaning is the</v>

859
00:56:03.941 --> 00:56:08.941
<v Speaker 1>fundamental fundamental element of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that if you lose touch with meaning,</v>

860
00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:13.930
<v Speaker 1>then the quality of your being is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to</v>

861
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:20.600
<v Speaker 1>collapse and not only yours but also the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the society that you're part</v>

862
00:56:21.151 --> 00:56:22.920
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because not only when you're,</v>

863
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:25.600
<v Speaker 1>when you're paying attention to what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>

864
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 1>not only are you updating yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not,</v>

865
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.460
<v Speaker 1>not only are you improving the quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your own being,</v>

866
00:56:33.461 --> 00:56:37.900
<v Speaker 1>but because you're embedded in this myth</v>
<v Speaker 1>welk and you're like a node in a</v>

867
00:56:37.901 --> 00:56:42.901
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your transformations effect the</v>

868
00:56:43.511 --> 00:56:45.700
<v Speaker 1>transformations of the people around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

869
00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't only transform yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>or fail to,</v>

870
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:54.250
<v Speaker 1>if you transform yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also transform society.</v>

871
00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:58.420
<v Speaker 1>And if you fail to transform yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you also fail to transform society.</v>

872
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And if you fail to transform society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it stays static and it stays</v>

873
00:57:03.101 --> 00:57:04.630
<v Speaker 1>static,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it dies.</v>

874
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:09.640
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenal logical viewpoint and the</v>

875
00:57:09.641 --> 00:57:14.300
<v Speaker 1>existential viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

876
00:57:14.301 --> 00:57:17.810
<v Speaker 1>what the phenomenologists force you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grapple with is the phenomena of</v>

877
00:57:17.811 --> 00:57:20.300
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it seems to me,</v>

878
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.240
<v Speaker 1>and this is basically heidegger's point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

879
00:57:23.241 --> 00:57:26.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's self evident?</v>

880
00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one answer is objects.</v>

881
00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

882
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:37.090
<v Speaker 1>The other ass answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is is predicated on a different</v>

883
00:57:37.091 --> 00:57:38.240
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

884
00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Meaning is self evident in that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't escape from it.</v>

885
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.690
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can escape from the positive</v>

886
00:57:46.691 --> 00:57:51.691
<v Speaker 1>elements of it by being locks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you cannot escape from the negative</v>

887
00:57:53.231 --> 00:57:55.720
<v Speaker 1>elements of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't argue yourself out of it.</v>

888
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.823
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

889
00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:01.270
<v Speaker 1>and you act as if there's nothing more</v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

890
00:58:01.271 --> 00:58:03.940
<v Speaker 1>So if you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it this way,</v>

891
00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:10.030
<v Speaker 1>if is terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to act it out and you</v>

892
00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:13.250
<v Speaker 1>cannot calm them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using rational means if someone's in</v>

893
00:58:13.251 --> 00:58:14.990
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

894
00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Both anxiety or terror and pain are</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of meaning and they're not.</v>

895
00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:26.600
<v Speaker 1>They're underneath rationality in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense in the rationality is powerless</v>

896
00:58:26.601 --> 00:58:31.601
<v Speaker 1>against terror and pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're terrified,</v>

897
00:58:31.701 --> 00:58:33.440
<v Speaker 1>then you'll act that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're in pain,</v>

898
00:58:33.441 --> 00:58:36.950
<v Speaker 1>then you'll act that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might do everything you can to</v>

899
00:58:36.951 --> 00:58:41.090
<v Speaker 1>say there's no such thing as meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're,</v>

900
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:43.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

901
00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:46.740
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your state of being is one of terror,</v>

902
00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:50.820
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to act like that's real.</v>

903
00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.370
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to ask yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>another question is,</v>

904
00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.020
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

905
00:58:56.020 --> 00:59:00.550
<v Speaker 1>what's more reflective of real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you say</v>

906
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:07.640
<v Speaker 1>or how you act</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it matters because what constitutes</v>

907
00:59:08.551 --> 00:59:12.850
<v Speaker 1>real changes with weather?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

908
00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:17.700
<v Speaker 1>what defines real changes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or depending on how you answered that</v>

909
00:59:17.701 --> 00:59:22.350
<v Speaker 1>question</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the existentialists</v>

910
00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:23.220
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

911
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:27.330
<v Speaker 3>how you act as what's Real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you act reflects what's real.</v>

912
00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:43.120
<v Speaker 1>But greed played with this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's another painting by me.</v>

913
00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Greet</v>
<v Speaker 1>you often uses men in suits.</v>

914
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Like a suit is representative of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain kind of a certain motive being,</v>

915
00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:57.930
<v Speaker 1>and it's a mode of being that is focused</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

916
00:59:57.990 --> 01:00:02.280
<v Speaker 1>it's focused rather narrowly on whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>a business suit represents.</v>

917
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

918
01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:07.200
<v Speaker 1>key success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

919
01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:09.750
<v Speaker 1>materialistic possessions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

920
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>at least the cliched and satirical</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of business.</v>

921
01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:19.460
<v Speaker 1>It certainly represents conformity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Magritte migrates painting is a</v>

922
01:00:20.131 --> 01:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>representation of blindness induced by</v>
<v Speaker 1>conformity.</v>

923
01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>These people can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're only seeing what's right in</v>

924
01:00:29.161 --> 01:00:33.060
<v Speaker 1>front of their eyes and what's right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of their eyes that they see blocks</v>

925
01:00:33.061 --> 01:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>them from seeing everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

926
01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:44.530
<v Speaker 1>In there in the first quarter of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>

927
01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:48.060
<v Speaker 3>More like kind of average.</v>

928
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>

929
01:00:50.451 --> 01:00:51.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

930
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:54.170
<v Speaker 1>it's conformity essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

931
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:55.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

932
01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's moral conformity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

933
01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

934
01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:04.430
<v Speaker 1>it's that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in the guise of moral conformity.</v>

935
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.020
<v Speaker 1>If you wear a suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

936
01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:10.340
<v Speaker 1>you're representing what the culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceives to be</v>

937
01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:15.220
<v Speaker 1>associated with citizenship and</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

938
01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Lot of what [inaudible] did was to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dissociate</v>

939
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:35.480
<v Speaker 1>the structure from the underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

940
01:01:35.481 --> 01:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>And he does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

941
01:01:37.071 --> 01:01:42.071
<v Speaker 1>in the painting on the right where</v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes any image and then juxtaposes</v>

942
01:01:43.011 --> 01:01:45.680
<v Speaker 1>it with the wrong signifier.</v>

943
01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:48.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

944
01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I suppose though in some sense those are</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like that that painting is almost</v>

945
01:01:51.801 --> 01:01:56.801
<v Speaker 1>like a poem in that the juxtaposition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the label and the entity forces you to</v>

946
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>imagine more than either of them would</v>
<v Speaker 1>force you to do alone.</v>

947
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Cause you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in what manner is a horse like a</v>

948
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>door</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what and what manner is the clock</v>

949
01:02:14.601 --> 01:02:18.800
<v Speaker 1>like the wind</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a picture like a bird?</v>

950
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Well and he returns to normal in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last one and time flies like the wind.</v>

951
01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>When a horse is something that takes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>

952
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>it's like a door,</v>

953
01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.553
<v Speaker 2>a bird.</v>

954
01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:38.810
<v Speaker 1>It isn't exactly clear to me how vases</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the bird,</v>

955
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:49.720
<v Speaker 1>this is another dream</v>

956
01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:56.510
<v Speaker 1>that's attempting to lay out the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

957
01:02:57.350 --> 01:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>So you are what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's Davinci,</v>

958
01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:06.680
<v Speaker 1>the Da Vinci's Vitruvian man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this figure.</v>

959
01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Presume you've all seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

960
01:03:08.991 --> 01:03:13.970
<v Speaker 1>very famous image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the man is in a square and then</v>

961
01:03:13.971 --> 01:03:15.690
<v Speaker 1>the squares in a circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

962
01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this dream,</v>

963
01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:24.980
<v Speaker 1>this dream had that image except the</v>
<v Speaker 1>square wasn't a square,</v>

964
01:03:24.981 --> 01:03:29.030
<v Speaker 1>it was a cube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the figure inside the,</v>

965
01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.970
<v Speaker 1>there was a figure inside the cube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was uh,</v>

966
01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.660
<v Speaker 1>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a generic man or an idealized</v>

967
01:03:35.661 --> 01:03:39.500
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the cube was about nine feet maybe</v>

968
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:41.870
<v Speaker 1>or eight feet by eight feet by eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

969
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:45.020
<v Speaker 1>And the man was suspended in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the cube.</v>

970
01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.380
<v Speaker 1>So he was about a foot and a half off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the floor floating.</v>

971
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:49.543
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

972
01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>from his hands to the wall was about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot and a half and</v>

973
01:03:56.650 --> 01:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>he could reach close to the wall that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in front of them.</v>

974
01:03:59.981 --> 01:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>And then the inside of the cube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter where the man looked,</v>

975
01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>was covered with these squares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the circle in them.</v>

976
01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>And inside the circle there was a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon's tail.</v>

977
01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>And if the man walked forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the cube went with them.</v>

978
01:04:14.771 --> 01:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>And if the man walked backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cube went with them.</v>

979
01:04:16.781 --> 01:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>And so it was a representation of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounds you in reality.</v>

980
01:04:22.330 --> 01:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>And then the man could reach out to any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these squares with the circle,</v>

981
01:04:27.161 --> 01:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>with the tail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he can pull on one of the tails and</v>

982
01:04:30.341 --> 01:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>that would pull something into being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were all these choices in</v>

983
01:04:34.961 --> 01:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>front of him that represented different</v>
<v Speaker 1>paths of being.</v>

984
01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that dream represented was this,</v>

985
01:04:43.001 --> 01:04:43.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

986
01:04:43.781 --> 01:04:45.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

987
01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>It's right in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say,</v>

988
01:04:49.061 --> 01:04:54.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chairs and the floor and students and</v>

989
01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:00.060
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

990
01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.370
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's another way of thinking</v>

991
01:05:04.371 --> 01:05:07.100
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that what's right in front of</v>

992
01:05:07.101 --> 01:05:12.101
<v Speaker 1>you is a landscape of possibility to</v>
<v Speaker 1>which your conception of objects blind</v>

993
01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:17.763
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

994
01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:20.163
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

995
01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:25.080
<v Speaker 1>no matter where you're going in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

996
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:28.530
<v Speaker 1>the things that present themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

997
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:30.060
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

998
01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Offer an array of almost unlimited</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

999
01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:39.320
<v Speaker 1>And so when I look ahead and I see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>student or students,</v>

1000
01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:45.080
<v Speaker 1>then that makes all of you one bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information in a sense,</v>

1001
01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've generalized across all of</v>

1002
01:05:50.461 --> 01:05:54.540
<v Speaker 1>you and there's some utility in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that</v>

1003
01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:57.403
<v Speaker 2>part of</v>

1004
01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:01.900
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing here can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as being a student.</v>

1005
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:07.710
<v Speaker 1>But the loss in that perception might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>far greater than the gain because it</v>

1006
01:06:09.761 --> 01:06:14.761
<v Speaker 1>reduces all of your complexity to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single utterance and makes you flat.</v>

1007
01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:19.720
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think as you wander</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world,</v>

1008
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:26.190
<v Speaker 1>are you seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

1009
01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:33.680
<v Speaker 1>or are you seeing a wall in front of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that from which you can pull anything</v>

1010
01:06:34.561 --> 01:06:39.561
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the standard viewpoint would be</v>

1011
01:06:40.501 --> 01:06:45.501
<v Speaker 1>that this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to me that you can make a</v>

1012
01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:53.620
<v Speaker 1>reasonable case that what you interact</v>
<v Speaker 1>with is not so much reality as it is</v>

1013
01:06:53.621 --> 01:06:58.621
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the possibility is what lurks</v>

1014
01:06:59.051 --> 01:07:04.051
<v Speaker 1>behind your conception of what's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that possibility is also the thing</v>

1015
01:07:04.391 --> 01:07:06.490
<v Speaker 1>out of which everything emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I,</v>

1016
01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:12.210
<v Speaker 1>if you come to my office and I sit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to you and I</v>

1017
01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.300
<v Speaker 1>try to approach you without any</v>
<v Speaker 1>preconceptions which would be saying a</v>

1018
01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:24.301
<v Speaker 1>Rogerian approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all sorts of things can emerge into</v>

1019
01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:29.500
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't emerge at all if I stayed</v>

1020
01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:34.360
<v Speaker 1>rigidly in a prescribed role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's some utility in the</v>

1021
01:07:34.361 --> 01:07:36.760
<v Speaker 1>prescribed role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong because it gives</v>

1022
01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:40.840
<v Speaker 1>people structure and it and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps to manage their expectations</v>

1023
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:45.250
<v Speaker 1>and it protects them from being exposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to too much possibility at any one time</v>

1024
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.450
<v Speaker 1>because that can be overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the danger is,</v>

1025
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:54.370
<v Speaker 1>at least in part that you'll blind</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to all the things that are</v>

1026
01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:59.371
<v Speaker 1>there by only allowing yourself to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you can immediately see.</v>

1027
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.500
<v Speaker 1>The Buddhists talk about desire as</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to</v>

1028
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.450
<v Speaker 1>push aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's</v>

1029
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:16.180
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>

1030
01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Attempt to warn people about the danger</v>
<v Speaker 1>of substituting their own preconceptions</v>

1031
01:08:22.671 --> 01:08:27.520
<v Speaker 1>about what should be or what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

1032
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:32.530
<v Speaker 1>four attention to what's behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you're depressed and</v>

1033
01:08:36.401 --> 01:08:41.110
<v Speaker 1>your board and all the positive meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>has gone out of your life.</v>

1034
01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Well perhaps it's because you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>substituted your a Priori perceptions</v>

1035
01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:55.300
<v Speaker 1>for possibility and you're in this cage</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's in part a mirror and all it</v>

1036
01:08:56.781 --> 01:09:00.920
<v Speaker 1>does is reflect back to you your sterile</v>
<v Speaker 1>preconceptions.</v>

1037
01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Well behind that is the possibility and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's conceivable in that possibility,</v>

1038
01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:14.230
<v Speaker 1>which is maybe infinite possibility that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that you lack now that's</v>

1039
01:09:15.231 --> 01:09:20.231
<v Speaker 1>making you so rigid and board could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled out of that possibility.</v>

1040
01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Boss said man's option to respond to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this claim or to choose not to,</v>

1041
01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.430
<v Speaker 1>not to do so seems to be the very core</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human freedom.</v>

1042
01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.480
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to return to a theme that I</v>

1043
01:10:02.481 --> 01:10:04.490
<v Speaker 1>developed partway through this lecture.</v>

1044
01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:10.563
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1045
01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.690
<v Speaker 1>If being doesn't manifest itself to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>as structured,</v>

1046
01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.990
<v Speaker 1>then it's as if you're falling</v>
<v Speaker 1>endlessly.</v>

1047
01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:24.740
<v Speaker 1>It needs structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like a set of tools that that you</v>

1048
01:10:26.091 --> 01:10:28.100
<v Speaker 1>have at your disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

1049
01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:34.450
<v Speaker 1>the problem with structures that it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind you to possibility</v>

1050
01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.870
<v Speaker 1>and the possibility might be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>important than the structure.</v>

1051
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:43.010
<v Speaker 1>And that means that partly what you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do is balance the possibility and the</v>

1052
01:10:43.011 --> 01:10:48.011
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One possibility is that the things that</v>

1053
01:10:50.311 --> 01:10:55.311
<v Speaker 1>manifest themselves to you as meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 1>are constituted gateway between</v>

1054
01:10:57.090 --> 01:11:02.090
<v Speaker 1>structure and possibility so that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow that which shines forth,</v>

1055
01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:07.350
<v Speaker 1>then you stay sufficiently within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

1056
01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:13.040
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time you're pulling in</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough new possibility so that the stays</v>

1057
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:18.360
<v Speaker 1>dynamic and alive instead of static and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

1058
01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.900
<v Speaker 1>If if your nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

1059
01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:30.020
<v Speaker 1>if you pay attention to the cues that</v>
<v Speaker 1>being is offering you,</v>

1060
01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:34.580
<v Speaker 1>showing you where to look and you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually look,</v>

1061
01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:40.200
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you can stay flexible enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that as things shift around you,</v>

1062
01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:45.680
<v Speaker 1>you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow a huge gap between yourself and the</v>

1063
01:11:45.681 --> 01:11:47.570
<v Speaker 1>world and fall.</v>

1064
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:49.723
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you just</v>

1065
01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:54.390
<v Speaker 1>interact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1066
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:58.690
<v Speaker 1>like in a dance that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's acceptable</v>

1067
01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:03.440
<v Speaker 1>emotional significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1068
01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:08.490
<v Speaker 1>it's anxiety provoking enough to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>you awake and it's compelling enough to</v>

1069
01:12:09.461 --> 01:12:12.820
<v Speaker 1>keep you interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those two things in some sense</v>

1070
01:12:12.821 --> 01:12:15.940
<v Speaker 1>constitute the core of meaning.</v>

1071
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.943
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1072
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:25.800
<v Speaker 1>In order to interact with the world in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

1073
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:30.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to flip your preconceptions</v>
<v Speaker 1>upside down</v>

1074
01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:37.040
<v Speaker 1>and make the presupposition that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>material elements that people,</v>

1075
01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:43.700
<v Speaker 1>modern people regard as most real are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually secondary and limited</v>

1076
01:12:44.491 --> 01:12:48.270
<v Speaker 1>derivations of something that's more</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental.</v>

1077
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.700
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that's more fundamental is</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility and possibility shines</v>

1078
01:12:53.701 --> 01:12:58.170
<v Speaker 1>through structure with meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the phenomenal logical</v>

1079
01:12:58.171 --> 01:13:03.171
<v Speaker 1>perspective and the existential</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is follow that meaning or</v>

1080
01:13:03.241 --> 01:13:04.590
<v Speaker 1>suffer the consequences.</v>

1081
01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.153
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>

1082
01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.030
<v Speaker 1>See you Thursday.</v>
