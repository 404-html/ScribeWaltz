00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.273
<v Speaker 1>So back in February,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I received the following letter from a </v>

2
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:10.680
<v Speaker 1>student at Linfield college and </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to its website</v>

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.043
<v Speaker 1>with campuses in Mcminnville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portland and a prestigious online </v>

4
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:16.914
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Linfield college is a premier choice in </v>

5
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific northwest for a high quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional liberal arts education.</v>

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.593
<v Speaker 1>Want to learn more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact us for details about her degree </v>

7
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.330
<v Speaker 1>and certificate program offerings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A student there who I won't name,</v>

8
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent me the followup letter.</v>

9
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Dear Dr. Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an undergraduate student at Linfield</v>

10
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>college in Mcminnville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon.</v>

11
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.303
<v Speaker 1>The international students for Liberty </v>
<v Speaker 1>Conference recently granted me a small </v>

12
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:46.674
<v Speaker 1>sum to organize pro liberty events on </v>
<v Speaker 1>campus with an emphasis on the </v>

13
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:51.564
<v Speaker 1>importance of free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing to ask you if you're </v>

14
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.253
<v Speaker 1>accepting speaking invitations at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and if your schedule sometime </v>

15
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>between now and may would allow it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help narrow down my options.</v>

16
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.853
<v Speaker 1>I would like to offer you $1,500 and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>invitation to speak here this spring </v>

17
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>semester.</v>

18
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Your travel and accommodation costs will</v>
<v Speaker 1>also be covered.</v>

19
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I perceived Linfield as an institution </v>
<v Speaker 1>at an ideological crossroads.</v>

20
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.343
<v Speaker 1>I feel it is my responsibility to pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most effective voice possible for </v>

21
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:23.634
<v Speaker 1>helping lynnfield chart a course that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will ensure its future as a place of </v>

22
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>reason and academic integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After listening to many of your lectures</v>

23
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:31.764
<v Speaker 1>and interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe your message is ideal for our </v>

24
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:34.524
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honest and productive argumentation is </v>

25
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:38.094
<v Speaker 1>one of your specialties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lynnfield would greatly benefit from </v>

26
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>being introduced to your ideas on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

27
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>We are a small college of roughly 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>students situated in quiet wine country.</v>

28
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.093
<v Speaker 1>Your work continues to have a deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on my personal and intellectual </v>

29
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be honored to hear from you.</v>

30
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for your time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>

31
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.143
<v Speaker 1>So after considering it for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agreed to come and speak at Linfield </v>

32
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.663
<v Speaker 1>College.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On March 18th I received a note from an </v>

33
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>invitation student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inviting student who said,</v>

34
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>good morning Dr. Peterson.</v>

35
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I would be overjoyed to confirm a date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we went about doing that.</v>

36
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>On April 7th he replied to me again to </v>
<v Speaker 1>update me.</v>

37
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.623
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the talk will be held in Ice Auditorium </v>

38
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.163
<v Speaker 1>in Melrose Hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>April 24th beginning at 7:00 PM I'm </v>

39
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:32.814
<v Speaker 1>referring to the event simply as a talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Jordan Peterson because his </v>

40
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>speaking style allows for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluidity in topic.</v>

41
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.763
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the core theme to the event is the </v>

42
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>importance of freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in higher education.</v>

43
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.513
<v Speaker 1>Some of the administration slash student</v>
<v Speaker 1>government have began to fret about the </v>

44
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>potential for people to feel open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

45
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>offended and oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Closed quote by Peter since talk.</v>

46
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>It's more pushback than I expected at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Linfield,</v>

47
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's a cause for </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern.</v>

48
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.413
<v Speaker 1>I'm fighting hard to keep their worries </v>
<v Speaker 1>at bay and there's a very supportive </v>

49
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>group of students and community members </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have my back free speech.</v>

50
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.483
<v Speaker 1>We'll win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On April 17th the following article </v>

51
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>appeared in the student newspaper,</v>

52
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Bye Kelly or Neil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>editor in chief.</v>

53
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.580
<v Speaker 1>It's called hate symbol on ball riles </v>
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>

54
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.090
<v Speaker 1>The Lindsay of young Americans for </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty groups,</v>

55
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.983
<v Speaker 1>free speech ball outside of Walker Hall </v>
<v Speaker 1>on April 12th received attention from </v>

56
00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:37.530
<v Speaker 1>students and faculty when a student drew</v>
<v Speaker 1>pepe the frog,</v>

57
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.040
<v Speaker 1>which has recently been appropriated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>white supremacist groups.</v>

58
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Linfield college posted a picture of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball on it's an instagram account,</v>

59
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.870
<v Speaker 1>but it was later removed because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frogs association with alt right groups.</v>

60
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.290
<v Speaker 1>As soon as it was pointed out that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>photo included the image,</v>

61
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.243
<v Speaker 1>the instagram post was removed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Thomas helped set the free </v>

62
00:03:57.511 --> 00:03:58.344
<v Speaker 1>speech ball event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first event in the speak freely at </v>

63
00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:01.884
<v Speaker 1>series at linfield encourage students to</v>
<v Speaker 1>express themselves by writing and </v>

64
00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:07.290
<v Speaker 1>drawing on the ball to promote free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

65
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Pepe the frog is a popular Internet mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is often appeared in humorous ways.</v>

66
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.153
<v Speaker 1>The Anti Defamation League has listed </v>
<v Speaker 1>pepe the frog on it to heat symbols </v>

67
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.263
<v Speaker 1>database.</v>

68
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.823
<v Speaker 1>I only heard about it second hand and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that it is a place for free </v>

69
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:25.470
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in all reality it was certainly done</v>

70
00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:26.304
<v Speaker 1>in very poor taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Junior John Christianson set according </v>

71
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:33.810
<v Speaker 1>to its website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the y a l mission is to open quote,</v>

72
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.010
<v Speaker 1>identify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educate,</v>

73
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.873
<v Speaker 1>train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mobilize youth activists committed </v>

74
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:38.244
<v Speaker 1>to winning on principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our goal is to cast the leaders of </v>

75
00:04:41.131 --> 00:04:43.680
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow and reclaim the policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates,</v>

76
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.080
<v Speaker 1>and direction of our government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Close quote,</v>

77
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>a member of y,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a l drew.</v>

78
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.613
<v Speaker 1>The pepe the frog on the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but asked to remain unidentified open </v>

79
00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:55.920
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew the person who drew peppy.</v>

80
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.980
<v Speaker 1>He didn't draw it to be negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drew it to be funny.</v>

81
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Close quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>senior Parker Wells,</v>

82
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.093
<v Speaker 1>a member of y a l said he continued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We understand some groups appropriated </v>

83
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.170
<v Speaker 1>the image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but any image can be appropriated.</v>

84
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Well said his goals with the free speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>

85
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.173
<v Speaker 1>We're to get people thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights to free expression and to bring </v>

86
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:21.240
<v Speaker 1>more attention to the y a l group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

87
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I understand that it's necessary to set </v>
<v Speaker 1>limits,</v>

88
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.660
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think this cartoon fraud is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a limit to set for free speech.</v>

89
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.093
<v Speaker 1>I find it unfortunate that people can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy this event because of the frog </v>

90
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:34.740
<v Speaker 1>image</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a part of it.</v>

91
00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:35.574
<v Speaker 1>Speak freely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Series y a l is bringing Dr. Jordan </v>

92
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Peterson to campus on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>April 24th the group is also showing the</v>

93
00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:45.840
<v Speaker 1>documentary the red pill on Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>May 2nd</v>

<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

96
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.773
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both the invitation of Jordan Peterson </v>

97
00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:55.874
<v Speaker 1>and the screening of the documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the red by the young Americans for </v>

98
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Liberty Club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extremely problematic.</v>

99
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Problematic because neither peterson </v>
<v Speaker 1>northern film,</v>

100
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 1>we'll be promoting dialogues about </v>
<v Speaker 1>gendered inclusions,</v>

101
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>but rather be promoting a dangerous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive logic of gendered exclusions.</v>

102
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Butler staff continued the promotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of such exclusionary practices,</v>

103
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.900
<v Speaker 1>greatly threatened safe spaces for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

104
00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:20.734
<v Speaker 1>staff and faculty who belonged to </v>
<v Speaker 1>marginalized groups and violates our </v>

105
00:06:23.651 --> 00:06:26.710
<v Speaker 1>ethos of upholding mutual respect on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>

106
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.263
<v Speaker 1>The president's diversity committee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're holding discussion at 5:30 PM on </v>

107
00:06:33.151 --> 00:06:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Monday in the pioneer reading room </v>
<v Speaker 1>titled Free Speech,</v>

108
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.060
<v Speaker 1>what it is and what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the discussion.</v>

109
00:06:39.061 --> 00:06:43.230
<v Speaker 1>We'll examine free speech and members of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Linfield community are encouraged to</v>

110
00:06:43.231 --> 00:06:44.064
<v Speaker 1>attend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the end of that newspaper </v>

111
00:06:46.081 --> 00:06:46.914
<v Speaker 1>article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I read that it was forwarded to me </v>

112
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.710
<v Speaker 1>soon after I tweeted the following </v>
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Open quote,</v>

<v Speaker 1>April 24th</v>

115
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.383
<v Speaker 1>well on April 19th I received a letter </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the student who would organize my </v>

116
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:11.100
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

117
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>things have gone nuclear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This email.</v>

118
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.080
<v Speaker 1>The one I'm going to read to you was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sad to all of Lynnfield.</v>

119
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.873
<v Speaker 1>One of the stipulations they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>referring to is the contract which they </v>

120
00:07:23.251 --> 00:07:24.084
<v Speaker 1>rejected because it was a day late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our Club is currently looking for space </v>

121
00:07:27.151 --> 00:07:30.300
<v Speaker 1>in downtown in Mcminnville to hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson's talk in step.</v>

122
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.860
<v Speaker 1>The media is likely getting involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry for this insanity.</v>

123
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.220
<v Speaker 1>We tried very hard to keep things civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

124
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.210
<v Speaker 1>so here is the letter sent out to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire community</v>

125
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.403
<v Speaker 1>Lynnfield community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am writing on behalf of the Linfield </v>

126
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:52.220
<v Speaker 1>cabinet as officer in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what President Peli is out.</v>

127
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.533
<v Speaker 1>I want to let the Linfield community </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that the a s l c associated </v>

128
00:07:57.891 --> 00:07:58.724
<v Speaker 1>students of Linfield college has </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined it will not fund Dr. Jordan </v>

129
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.943
<v Speaker 1>Peterson appearance next week because </v>
<v Speaker 1>stipulations for the event were not met </v>

130
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:07.940
<v Speaker 1>by the requester,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young Americans for liberty.</v>

131
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Since the authorization parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not satisfied.</v>

132
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.613
<v Speaker 1>The college will not host the event on </v>
<v Speaker 1>April 24th among the stipulations was </v>

133
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:17.654
<v Speaker 1>that the event was to be a private </v>
<v Speaker 1>linfield college only event by his own </v>

134
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:22.094
<v Speaker 1>tweet yesterday to 107,000 followers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson indicates he would be open </v>

135
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violating more safe spaces.</v>

136
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Sued Linfield College,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close quote,</v>

137
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 1>likeminded supporters from outside our </v>
<v Speaker 1>community have responded affirmatively.</v>

138
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.033
<v Speaker 1>Our policy on anti harassment protection</v>
<v Speaker 1>and academic freedom states that open </v>

139
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:45.704
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy harassment policies are not </v>

140
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:48.224
<v Speaker 1>intended to limit the free exchange of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions or the vigorous debate over </v>

141
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:53.240
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

142
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.100
<v Speaker 1>intimidation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harassment,</v>

143
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.943
<v Speaker 1>exploitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the use or threat of force are </v>

144
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 1>incompatible with the preservation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this freedom.</v>

145
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.170
<v Speaker 1>The letter continues based on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaker's own words.</v>

146
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.063
<v Speaker 1>This event no longer presents the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of academic inquiry within </v>

147
00:09:10.281 --> 00:09:12.950
<v Speaker 1>the Linfield community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our policy is clear,</v>

148
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:17.240
<v Speaker 1>open quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harassment and intimidation preclude the</v>

149
00:09:17.241 --> 00:09:21.230
<v Speaker 1>very possibility for maintaining an </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere of academic freedom.</v>

150
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.843
<v Speaker 1>We cannot welcome speakers when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stipulations for their appearances are </v>

151
00:09:25.641 --> 00:09:26.474
<v Speaker 1>not met and who attend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who intend to violate the safety of our </v>

152
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:33.110
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Respectfully,</v>

153
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Susan Egg Ref Kip in hand.</v>

154
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.380
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote a letter to Susan Agra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Hamm.</v>

155
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Now you understand that by this time the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flights had been arranged,</v>

156
00:09:45.581 --> 00:09:48.340
<v Speaker 1>the accommodation had been arranged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was in place,</v>

157
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.710
<v Speaker 1>and of course they had known about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>

158
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:52.203
<v Speaker 1>Dear Susan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I received a copy of your letter to the </v>

159
00:09:55.721 --> 00:09:56.554
<v Speaker 1>Linfield community this morning as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an indication that my long scheduled </v>

160
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:02.680
<v Speaker 1>talk at Linfield has been canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is fine,</v>

161
00:10:02.681 --> 00:10:03.514
<v Speaker 1>I suppose except that the plane tickets </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been booked and the hotel </v>

162
00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:07.084
<v Speaker 1>reservations have been made as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>three days taken out of my schedule at </v>

163
00:10:10.361 --> 00:10:11.194
<v Speaker 1>my expense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you are treating me and the </v>

164
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:19.531
<v Speaker 1>student group who invited me in a manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is absolutely reprehensible as well</v>

165
00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:21.520
<v Speaker 1>as cowardly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an underhanded.</v>

166
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.750
<v Speaker 1>I have made arrangements to come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>linfield which is extremely distant from</v>

167
00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:28.420
<v Speaker 1>me and out of the way in good faith.</v>

168
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:30.303
<v Speaker 1>Now you cancel it with a plethora of </v>
<v Speaker 1>specious reasons including your anti </v>

169
00:10:34.451 --> 00:10:35.284
<v Speaker 1>harassment policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I have harassed no one nor </v>

170
00:10:37.481 --> 00:10:38.890
<v Speaker 1>intimidated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploited,</v>

171
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.873
<v Speaker 1>or threaten force had I not previously </v>
<v Speaker 1>received notice of the controversy </v>

172
00:10:44.201 --> 00:10:47.260
<v Speaker 1>around my arrival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in my opinion on warranted,</v>

173
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.140
<v Speaker 1>I would not have tweeted my intent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>open quote,</v>

174
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.020
<v Speaker 1>violate safe spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close quote,</v>

175
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.860
<v Speaker 1>which is a satirical comment in case it </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be said.</v>

176
00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.993
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you were looking for any </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse no matter how trivial to cancel </v>

177
00:11:01.121 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 1>this event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also note that open quote,</v>

178
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.003
<v Speaker 1>this event no longer presents the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of academic inquiry within </v>

179
00:11:09.551 --> 00:11:14.050
<v Speaker 1>the Linfield community close quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might point out that Linfield,</v>

180
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.003
<v Speaker 1>it's a college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a community and that ideas need to </v>

181
00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:21.610
<v Speaker 1>be discussed in a college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also state that open quote,</v>

182
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.653
<v Speaker 1>anti harassment policies are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>intended to limit the free exchange of </v>

183
00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:28.060
<v Speaker 1>opinions or the vigorous debate over </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

184
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.510
<v Speaker 1>close quote and then proceed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly that.</v>

185
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.423
<v Speaker 1>You also mentioned that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>received support from open quote like </v>

186
00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:40.120
<v Speaker 1>binded supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close quote from outside your community,</v>

187
00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.343
<v Speaker 1>which is hardly surprising or </v>
<v Speaker 1>informative given that they were </v>

188
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:44.704
<v Speaker 1>likeminded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also suggest that because the </v>

189
00:11:47.381 --> 00:11:48.214
<v Speaker 1>contract was delayed one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that constitutes sufficient grounds for </v>

190
00:11:50.951 --> 00:11:51.784
<v Speaker 1>cancellation even though you knew well </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the event was booked and finalized </v>

191
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's such delays are by no means </v>
<v Speaker 1>unheard of in such situations.</v>

192
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.633
<v Speaker 1>You might also note that aghast invited </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your college might expect to be </v>

193
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:07.180
<v Speaker 1>treated with a modicum of consideration </v>
<v Speaker 1>and respect.</v>

194
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.033
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I plan to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make a video tomorrow </v>

195
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 1>morning at the latest reading this </v>
<v Speaker 1>letter on Youtube,</v>

196
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 1>explaining that by invitation has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>revoked.</v>

197
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 1>What that means for me and the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reasons given.</v>

198
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.880
<v Speaker 1>I will also read this letter of response</v>
<v Speaker 1>from me.</v>

199
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.630
<v Speaker 1>It should be watched by about 150,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewers,</v>

200
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:29.523
<v Speaker 1>many of whom I imagine we'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>lynnfield alumni supporters and </v>

201
00:12:32.171 --> 00:12:33.004
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

202
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm perfectly willing to see what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>all have to say.</v>

203
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Then we can let the dust settle where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>may sincerely,</v>

204
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Jordan B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson,</v>

205
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>professor of psychology at University of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto.</v>

206
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I received absolutely nothing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

207
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.570
<v Speaker 1>I've got no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.063
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even have the decency to send </v>
<v Speaker 1>me a notification explaining their </v>

209
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:55.090
<v Speaker 1>rationale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

210
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.880
<v Speaker 1>So I was treated as far as I'm concerned</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

211
00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.103
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's call it unprofessionally and </v>

212
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:04.600
<v Speaker 1>leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the story now?</v>

213
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 1>The organizing students tried to book an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative venue.</v>

214
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.210
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have enough money to rent a </v>
<v Speaker 1>suitable theater or lecture hall.</v>

215
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.710
<v Speaker 1>I told them that they could use my </v>
<v Speaker 1>honorarium to pay for the space,</v>

216
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 1>which they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The yamhill valley news.</v>

217
00:13:20.861 --> 00:13:21.694
<v Speaker 1>register.com posted this update April </v>

<v Speaker 1>controversial speaker to campus for a </v>

<v Speaker 1>Monday,</v>

222
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.840
<v Speaker 1>the group has responded by lining up an </v>
<v Speaker 1>off campus location for the presentation</v>

223
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.883
<v Speaker 1>featuring Jordan Peterson,</v>

224
00:13:52.311 --> 00:13:53.144
<v Speaker 1>against gender neutral pronouns is </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered offensive by some do the </v>

225
00:13:57.321 --> 00:13:58.154

<v Speaker 1>So on with the show,</v>

228
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.593
<v Speaker 1>and you can figure out what I think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the linfield administrators who pulled </v>

229
00:14:16.851 --> 00:14:18.500
<v Speaker 1>this stunt on your own.</v>

230
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for watching.</v>
