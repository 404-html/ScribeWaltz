<v Speaker 1>and you've got to join us and watch and </v>

3
00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>listen to under the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did we talk about?</v>

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was deep.</v>

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Was everything under the sun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:15.730
<v Speaker 1>you're an exhausting interviewer in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best possible.</v>

8
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.320
<v Speaker 1>We really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really enjoyed it.</v>

9
00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a good open conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

10
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.810
<v Speaker 1>we went through a lot topics such as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about there,</v>

11
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.693
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversies that you've been involved </v>

12
00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:26.590
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even some of my control vcs,</v>

13
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.200
<v Speaker 1>if you enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about inequality.</v>

14
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>We told her that in American attorneys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talked about politics,</v>

15
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.120
<v Speaker 1>how the temperament means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what words mean where power lies.</v>

16
00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty good conversation.</v>

17
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 1>We both have got vague headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel a bit sort of exhausted.</v>

18
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:43.870
<v Speaker 1>This would probably be the big way we </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say something stupid.</v>

19
00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>So please listen to under the skin and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to be alive.</v>

21
00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one thing you could do,</v>

22
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>you could do that and to that within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scope of your freedoms.</v>
