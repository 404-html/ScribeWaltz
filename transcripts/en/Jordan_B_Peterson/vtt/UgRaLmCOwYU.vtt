1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.010
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really kind of hoping that at least</v>

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 1>30% of you will be severely unhappy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this lecture.</v>

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.503
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find out afterwards.</v>

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>This is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dimension of personality.</v>

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness is one of the dimensions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that most particularly differentiate men</v>

8
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:34.281
<v Speaker 1>and women and obviously the differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>or similarities between men and women is</v>

9
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:44.751
<v Speaker 1>a matter of hot debate in our society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want it run through the science</v>

11
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

12
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess then we'll see what,</v>

13
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>what we conclude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

14
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>you remember that the big five were</v>
<v Speaker 1>derived from a statistical analysis of</v>

15
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>the content of language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

16
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of interesting because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>means that in so far as any</v>

17
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.400
<v Speaker 1>psychological theory in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology has been a theoretical with</v>

18
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>the possible exception of intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>research,</v>

19
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>which was also the Iq is also derived</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistically.</v>

20
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was derived by golden or it was</v>

21
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>initially theorized by golden in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense back in the late 18 hundreds.</v>

22
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:41.631
<v Speaker 1>But what Golden Thought of as Eminence</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears very little relationship to what</v>

23
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 1>the psychometric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the psychometricians measure as</v>

24
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So intelligence is a statistical</v>

25
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>construct or Iq is a statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>construct and the big five traits are</v>

26
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:59.170
<v Speaker 1>statistical constructs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that there,</v>

27
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>there are theoretical presumptions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>went into their derivation,</v>

28
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's very difficult to think of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>as political because the first</v>

29
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis was only that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental dimensions of</v>

30
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>personality would be reflected in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>language English to begin with.</v>

31
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>But then other languages as the research</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressed around the world,</v>

32
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for me to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a political theory.</v>

33
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause if scientific findings have</v>

34
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:35.061
<v Speaker 1>political implications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to wonder if the biases of</v>

35
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>the researchers put the political</v>
<v Speaker 1>implications into the data before</v>

36
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>revealing them as data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's very difficult to argue that.</v>

37
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I think with regards to trait theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that happened with trait</v>

38
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:52.011
<v Speaker 1>theories is that the statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis suggested their existence.</v>

39
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until after the traits were</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably well identified.</v>

40
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:02.061
<v Speaker 1>And this really started to kick in in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 90s that we started to under stand</v>

41
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.450
<v Speaker 1>the potential biological basis and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even the nature,</v>

42
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>the descriptive nature of the traits it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the aspect level now where you</v>

43
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>differentiate the big five into 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still aspects that that we don't</v>

44
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>know much about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

45
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't really understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between politeness and</v>

46
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that liberals are more</v>

47
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>compassionate than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than conservatives and conservatives are</v>

48
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>more polite than liberals and we think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that politeness is somehow associated</v>

49
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>with the tendency of conservatives to</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow social rules.</v>

50
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>But that's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's about all we know</v>

51
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know how much difference</v>

52
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>there will turn out to be between polite</v>
<v Speaker 1>politeness and compassion.</v>

53
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.030
<v Speaker 1>But were there are ongoing studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand the covariates and</v>

54
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>correlates of the aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same is true of the traits.</v>

55
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of argument about</v>

56
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 1>openness when it first was discovered</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistically.</v>

57
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Some people like Hans Isaac who</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated some of the early three</v>

58
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>dimensional models of personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was extroversion,</v>

59
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and psychotic racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he thought would predict the</v>

60
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 1>proclivity towards schizophrenia but</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually turned out to be composed of</v>

61
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>low agreeableness and low</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

62
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Isaac didn't even think that openness</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a reasonable trade.</v>

63
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:32.011
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was mostly captured by Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually that seems to be the case</v>

64
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>to some degree because if you divide</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness into intellect and openness to</v>

65
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like Iq loads on intellect or</v>

66
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:44.461
<v Speaker 1>at least the nonverbal part of Iq loads</v>
<v Speaker 1>on intellect where the verbal part of Iq</v>

67
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 1>tends to load more on openness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sodas,</v>

68
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>openness to experience and so does</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

69
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>But this is all discovered after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>

70
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.170
<v Speaker 1>So now one of the things that's happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of parsing out</v>

71
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:04.531
<v Speaker 1>personality into the big five traits and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also using other traits schemas is that</v>

72
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>it's quite clear that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between the sexes or if you</v>

73
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:14.821
<v Speaker 1>like differences between the genders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a thorny problem and it's</v>

74
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>thorny for a number of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One reason is that it's a dogmatic</v>

75
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.130
<v Speaker 1>assumption proposition of social</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructionists that gender differences</v>

76
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>are socially constructed.</v>

77
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they separate out the idea of sex,</v>

78
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>which you could think of as bio</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological sex you could think of is</v>

79
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:40.480
<v Speaker 1>chromosomal sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume that's one thing,</v>

80
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>but gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different thing and</v>

81
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:47.350
<v Speaker 1>gender is the manner in which men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women present themselves to the world in</v>

82
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:49.690
<v Speaker 1>terms of differences in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

83
00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>anything that you can measure that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>above the fundamentally biological</v>

84
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could say anything above the</v>

85
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>chromosomal difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't exactly know where the</v>

86
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>distinction is supposed to be made</v>
<v Speaker 1>between biological sex and gender.</v>

87
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not a simple thing to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the proposition is still obtains</v>

88
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:13.871
<v Speaker 1>that if there are differences between</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women at the level of phenotypic</v>

89
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 1>manifestation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're socially constructed.</v>

90
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.710
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is that it seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be wrong and not just a little bit</v>

91
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:24.620
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wrong,</v>

92
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>right to the core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that I would like</v>

93
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:33.311
<v Speaker 1>to propose to you is that the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructionists only have theory on</v>

94
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 1>their side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe they have any data to</v>

95
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>support their claims whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

96
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 1>I also think that they wouldn't accept</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of things that I'm going to</v>

97
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 1>talk to you about as data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a whole different argument.</v>

98
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.573
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

99
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't really understand how it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible for people in an,</v>

100
00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.030
<v Speaker 1>in the modern world to reject scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims given that almost everything they</v>

101
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:03.690
<v Speaker 1>do in their day to day life that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to do with technology</v>

102
00:07:03.691 --> 00:07:07.140
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends for its function on the validity</v>

103
00:07:07.141 --> 00:07:09.780
<v Speaker 1>of the scientific theories that underpin</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology.</v>

104
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat scientific data as if it's just</v>

105
00:07:16.741 --> 00:07:19.980
<v Speaker 1>another form of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially constructed information,</v>

106
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.060
<v Speaker 1>certainly don't behave like that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow them around in the actual world.</v>

107
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the proposition about</v>

108
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.660
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is the case because</v>

109
00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:33.580
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things we don't</v>

110
00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:35.380
<v Speaker 1>understand about the big five</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>

111
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.700
<v Speaker 1>but this is how I've worked it out for</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own understanding and it's in</v>

112
00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 1>accordance with the data in so far as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can determine that</v>

113
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.080
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness seems to be the dimension</v>
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>

114
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.270
<v Speaker 1>we certainly know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people were empathic and</v>

115
00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:55.680
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know less about disagreeable people,</v>

116
00:07:55.681 --> 00:07:57.720
<v Speaker 1>although we know that they're more</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to be male.</v>

117
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Now you could associate being</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable with being more callous and</v>

118
00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:07.581
<v Speaker 1>more harsh and more selfish in that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to bargain with someone who's</v>

119
00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:10.860
<v Speaker 1>low in agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would fight harder for their side</v>

120
00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:14.460
<v Speaker 1>of the equation than someone high in</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness would fight for.</v>

121
00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:19.461
<v Speaker 1>There's now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things about human</v>

122
00:08:19.651 --> 00:08:23.850
<v Speaker 1>beings that that aren't considered</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently.</v>

123
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I believe in so far as we conceptualize</v>
<v Speaker 1>human personality.</v>

124
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:33.150
<v Speaker 1>And one is that humans are unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 1>maternal,</v>

125
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.300
<v Speaker 1>both genders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to be,</v>

126
00:08:36.301 --> 00:08:40.890
<v Speaker 1>because our babies are born for a mammal</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our size.</v>

127
00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:42.900
<v Speaker 1>That gestation period should be two</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

128
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.280
<v Speaker 1>nine months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that babies,</v>

129
00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:49.050
<v Speaker 1>human babies are already born premature.</v>

130
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.680
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell that because you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ungulates deer thinking gears and</v>

131
00:08:55.611 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Angelette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter pretty much as soon as</v>

132
00:08:58.411 --> 00:09:01.050
<v Speaker 1>they're born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can stagger up on their legs and</v>

133
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 1>start to run around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a human baby isn't doing that</v>

134
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 1>till 15 months or 13 months or 17 months</v>
<v Speaker 1>or depending on the baby,</v>

135
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

136
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>and babies are pretty much completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>helpless at birth and so they need a</v>

137
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:16.500
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then because we have such a large</v>

138
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 1>cortex and because we're so behaviorally</v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic,</v>

139
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 1>we have an extraordinarily long</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependence and development period.</v>

140
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a minimum,</v>

141
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 1>it depends on the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a minimum of 13 years and it</v>

142
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 1>can certainly extend far beyond that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>does in cultures where there's a</v>

143
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of inculcation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

144
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.750
<v Speaker 1>So we also know that maternal behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very common among mammals.</v>

145
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean the very definition of mammal in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense has to do with maternal</v>

146
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:49.920
<v Speaker 1>behavior because mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they bear live young and they</v>

147
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:52.200
<v Speaker 1>produce milk with her warm blooded and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

148
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.230
<v Speaker 1>there's some other characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

149
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.280
<v Speaker 1>so the ability to care for helpless,</v>

150
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:04.543
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

151
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Frequently upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent</v>

152
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:15.190
<v Speaker 1>creatures for a very long period of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>is part of our behavioral repertoire.</v>

153
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Now then you might wonder are there</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual differences in the degree to</v>

154
00:10:18.671 --> 00:10:21.730
<v Speaker 1>which people are maternal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's captured,</v>

155
00:10:21.731 --> 00:10:26.320
<v Speaker 1>at least in part with agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense because on the positive</v>

156
00:10:26.321 --> 00:10:28.540
<v Speaker 1>pole of agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you get warmth and</v>

157
00:10:28.541 --> 00:10:33.541
<v Speaker 1>compassion and empathy and the desire to</v>
<v Speaker 1>care for others and and self sacrifice.</v>

158
00:10:34.541 --> 00:10:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I would say one of the things will will</v>
<v Speaker 1>show later is that agreeable.</v>

159
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.090
<v Speaker 1>This is negatively correlated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>income,</v>

160
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.890
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you'd expect if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were negotiating with someone who</v>

161
00:10:44.891 --> 00:10:48.640
<v Speaker 1>was self sacrificing because they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to put forward their side of the</v>

162
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.330
<v Speaker 1>power equation as forcefully as someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is disagreeable.</v>

163
00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.190
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

164
00:10:54.191 --> 00:10:57.670
<v Speaker 1>in order to raise a baby you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>self sacrificing.</v>

165
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.140
<v Speaker 1>There is no two ways about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might find that rewarding and</v>

166
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.010
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe there is a parent</v>

167
00:11:06.011 --> 00:11:11.011
<v Speaker 1>who actually becomes a good parent who</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't put their child's welfare first.</v>

168
00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's particularly true of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mothers,</v>

169
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.910
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the first year after</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth.</v>

170
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.730
<v Speaker 1>It's probably true right up to the age</v>
<v Speaker 1>of three,</v>

171
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.140
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's virtually undeniably</v>
<v Speaker 1>true for the first year.</v>

172
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.490
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

173
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.590
<v Speaker 1>reflected in personality traits?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

174
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.390
<v Speaker 1>the other thing about people that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile recognizing is that</v>

175
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.680
<v Speaker 1>we're hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

176
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:48.500
<v Speaker 1>People are coniferous are pretty damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at bringing down big game.</v>

177
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 1>It's reasonable to suppose that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that there aren't as many large</v>

178
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:59.010
<v Speaker 1>animals in North America as there are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa is because when human beings came</v>

179
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 1>into North Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North America,</v>

180
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 1>15,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed all of them.</v>

181
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.320
<v Speaker 1>They killed all the Mammas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed all the giant bears,</v>

182
00:12:08.321 --> 00:12:10.420
<v Speaker 1>they killed all the cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed all the,</v>

183
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I think there were camels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe can't remember precisely.</v>

184
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a very large array,</v>

185
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 1>a very large mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they started to disappear pretty</v>

186
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:25.711
<v Speaker 1>damn quickly after the period of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people migrated into North</v>

187
00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:26.591
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

188
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:31.591
<v Speaker 1>one of the theories is that in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals and the people call evolved</v>

189
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 1>so that the animals and the people had</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen into some sort of mutual</v>

190
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.620
<v Speaker 1>stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in North America,</v>

191
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:44.190
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't the case at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

192
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was that easy to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>down a mammoth with a spear.</v>

193
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.060
<v Speaker 1>So it was very destructive of people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what they did.</v>

194
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:57.061
<v Speaker 1>But it also says volumes about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are like and it's certainly</v>

195
00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:03.211
<v Speaker 1>the case that a non trivial proportion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human population still hunts and</v>

196
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:07.690
<v Speaker 1>they'll do that for leisure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something that's very difficult</v>

197
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 1>for people who aren't countries to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and they're almost all men,</v>

198
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think will come as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise to anyone.</v>

199
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:20.430
<v Speaker 1>So I think that predatory aggression is</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of agreeableness</v>

200
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 1>and we also know that the best predictor</v>
<v Speaker 1>of whether or not you're going to be in</v>

201
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:32.461
<v Speaker 1>prison is low agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now low conscientiousness also helps,</v>

202
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.880
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental marker of antisocial</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior in so far as it's captured by</v>

203
00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:40.090
<v Speaker 1>the big five personality markers seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be low agreeableness.</v>

204
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.810
<v Speaker 1>And that you might also say given that</v>
<v Speaker 1>men are less agreeable than women,</v>

205
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.740
<v Speaker 1>that that's part of the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 1>men are much more likely to be in prison</v>

206
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.700
<v Speaker 1>than women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's between,</v>

207
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.103
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

208
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 91% of incarcerated</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminals are male,</v>

209
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.630
<v Speaker 1>but I'm certain that it's above 80% I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it's 91%</v>

210
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.080
<v Speaker 1>now one of the things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality traits that you want to keep</v>

211
00:14:16.721 --> 00:14:19.360
<v Speaker 1>in mind is that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're normally distributed</v>

212
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.580
<v Speaker 1>and you need to understand some things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the normal distribution.</v>

213
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:30.810
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to understand how</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality affects social outcomes</v>

214
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.250
<v Speaker 1>because it looks like men are only about</v>
<v Speaker 1>a half standard deviation less agreeable</v>

215
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:39.970
<v Speaker 1>than women and what that means if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull a given woman out of the population</v>

216
00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:42.880
<v Speaker 1>in a given man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can by no means say for certain</v>

217
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:45.460
<v Speaker 1>which of those two are going to be less</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable.</v>

218
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:50.490
<v Speaker 1>On average it's going to be the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's not a huge difference in,</v>

219
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 1>it's still quite highly probable that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman will be the least agreeable of</v>

220
00:14:56.961 --> 00:15:01.930
<v Speaker 1>the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a normal distribution presupposes a</v>

221
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.773
<v Speaker 1>mean</v>

222
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.250
<v Speaker 1>and then random distribution around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean</v>

223
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:13.250
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that you'll learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychology is that variables are</v>

224
00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:15.740
<v Speaker 1>normally distributed and that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>not true.</v>

225
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Some variables are normally distributed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lots aren't.</v>

226
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 1>And you need to know about the ones that</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't because a lot,</v>

227
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.730
<v Speaker 1>many of them are extremely important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wealth is not normally distributed.</v>

228
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Creative ability is not normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed any.</v>

229
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Anything that has to do with the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>propensity to produce is not normally</v>

230
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that in in those</v>

231
00:15:40.911 --> 00:15:45.911
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost every one does nothing and a very</v>

232
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:49.100
<v Speaker 1>tiny fraction of the people do</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

233
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.120
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that the median number of</v>

234
00:15:53.121 --> 00:15:58.121
<v Speaker 1>records that you people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced is zero.</v>

235
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:02.660
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

236
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:07.661
<v Speaker 1>that's the case for very many phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are associated with creativity.</v>

237
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 1>There are some things that are normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed in personality traits seem</v>

238
00:16:13.971 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 1>to be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The effect of personality traits on</v>

239
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:19.280
<v Speaker 1>production might not be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the personality traits themselves</v>

240
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:22.730
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see if you look at this</v>

241
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:24.830
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something you really have to</v>

242
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.070
<v Speaker 1>know and understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to understand research</v>

243
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:31.010
<v Speaker 1>and psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like a basic axiom of all the</v>

244
00:16:31.011 --> 00:16:34.070
<v Speaker 1>statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first axiom is that the phenomena</v>

245
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:35.810
<v Speaker 1>that you're measuring are normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>

246
00:16:35.811 --> 00:16:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Generally when you do a statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

247
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.530
<v Speaker 1>you have to test to see if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most statistics can handle a fair</v>

248
00:16:42.531 --> 00:16:46.130
<v Speaker 1>bit of deviation from normality without</v>
<v Speaker 1>being rendered invalid.</v>

249
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.970
<v Speaker 1>But the list of variables that I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>described to you,</v>

250
00:16:49.971 --> 00:16:53.120
<v Speaker 1>say those that are associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative production do not fall into</v>

251
00:16:53.121 --> 00:16:55.630
<v Speaker 1>that category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have very long tails there.</v>

252
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.430
<v Speaker 1>They're distributed according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something called the prieto</v>

253
00:16:58.431 --> 00:17:00.920
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we'll talk about more when we get</v>

254
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:05.921
<v Speaker 1>to conscientiousness and trade openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you'll see there's a middle line</v>

255
00:17:06.321 --> 00:17:10.280
<v Speaker 1>there and that's the mean and the median</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mode in a real normal</v>

256
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:14.060
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the curve is divided up into</v>

257
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:19.061
<v Speaker 1>equal sections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly four of them on each side of the</v>

258
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.480
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So eight in total that represent a way</v>

259
00:17:23.481 --> 00:17:28.481
<v Speaker 1>of representing the normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so by the time you get out to three</v>

260
00:17:29.871 --> 00:17:34.871
<v Speaker 1>standard deviations above the mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about 0.1% of the</v>

261
00:17:35.061 --> 00:17:37.400
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

262
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.560
<v Speaker 1>and the same thing is true on the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

263
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Three standard deviations below the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

264
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.770
<v Speaker 1>So basically the entire population is</v>
<v Speaker 1>encompassed within eight standard</v>

265
00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 1>deviations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not quite because the tails</v>

266
00:17:50.131 --> 00:17:52.200
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just fewer.</v>

267
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.520
<v Speaker 1>There's so few people out there at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point that you know they vanish into</v>

268
00:17:56.521 --> 00:17:58.560
<v Speaker 1>almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they almost vanish.</v>

269
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their existence is not necessarily</v>

270
00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:03.690
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

271
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 1>one guy who's six standard deviations</v>
<v Speaker 1>below the mean in agreeableness might be</v>

272
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 1>the serial killer who killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills a hundred people.</v>

273
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.660
<v Speaker 1>So those exceptions can still have</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily powerful impacts.</v>

274
00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:17.670
<v Speaker 1>They're just not statistically very</v>
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>

275
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Now the normal distribution for man and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women overlaps quite a lot for most</v>

276
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:27.030
<v Speaker 1>single personality traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women are half a standard deviation,</v>

277
00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:31.260
<v Speaker 1>more agreeable than man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine two curves that</v>

278
00:18:31.261 --> 00:18:36.261
<v Speaker 1>overlap with the female distribution</v>
<v Speaker 1>being shunted slightly to the right.</v>

279
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.140
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

280
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:43.320
<v Speaker 1>if you take out a random woman or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>random man from the distribution,</v>

281
00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:47.190
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhat of a toss up who's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more or less agreeable.</v>

282
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.970
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the situation is such that only the</v>

283
00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:58.890
<v Speaker 1>person who's one in a hundred least</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable ends up in prison,</v>

284
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.100
<v Speaker 1>all of the people who end up in prison</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be men.</v>

285
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Because the consequence of shifting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>curves slightly to the right is that</v>

286
00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:10.830
<v Speaker 1>when you move out to the left hand side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the distribution,</v>

287
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.040
<v Speaker 1>outstay three standard deviations in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire population,</v>

288
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.910
<v Speaker 1>all of the people out there are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be man.</v>

289
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.340
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that small</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in the mean,</v>

290
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Speaker 1>even if the distribution is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the same shape,</v>

291
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.060
<v Speaker 1>small deviations from the mean can</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce huge,</v>

292
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.240
<v Speaker 1>huge social effects at the periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

293
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.320
<v Speaker 1>here's an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't that many people who are</v>

294
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:40.440
<v Speaker 1>five standard deviations above the mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>and intelligence.</v>

295
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:45.480
<v Speaker 1>But among them are a tremendous number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Nobel prize laureates.</v>

296
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.440
<v Speaker 1>So because you can understand with</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

297
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.230
<v Speaker 1>it isn't exactly how smart you are that</v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

298
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.200
<v Speaker 1>It's how smart you are compared to other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

299
00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you're smarter than other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

300
00:19:58.181 --> 00:20:01.270
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get to where everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going faster.</v>

301
00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:06.130
<v Speaker 1>And it's the fastest person who it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who's fastest at that,</v>

302
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.600
<v Speaker 1>who's going to get there first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So comparative ability really,</v>

303
00:20:10.601 --> 00:20:14.970
<v Speaker 1>really matters when you're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptional levels of ability of,</v>

304
00:20:14.971 --> 00:20:18.580
<v Speaker 1>of productive output.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a rough law.</v>

305
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.790
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a rule.</v>

306
00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.800
<v Speaker 1>This is called price's law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The square root of the number of people</v>

307
00:20:26.801 --> 00:20:31.801
<v Speaker 1>in a domain do half the work is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means if there's 10,000 neuroscientists,</v>

308
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.360
<v Speaker 1>10,000 publishing neuroscientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred of them have half the</v>

309
00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:42.361
<v Speaker 1>publications</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of them have zero or one.</v>

310
00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 1>So the rule for publications is among</v>

311
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Phd students is</v>

312
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.960
<v Speaker 1>the median number of publications that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phd students have is somewhere between</v>

313
00:20:55.961 --> 00:21:00.961
<v Speaker 1>zero and one half is many have to half</v>
<v Speaker 1>as many of that has three,</v>

314
00:21:01.091 --> 00:21:05.410
<v Speaker 1>half as many as that have four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a tremendous step down in</v>

315
00:21:05.411 --> 00:21:10.411
<v Speaker 1>productivity as it's an exponential</v>
<v Speaker 1>stepped down in probability with a</v>

316
00:21:10.481 --> 00:21:14.350
<v Speaker 1>linear step up in productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

317
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:16.360
<v Speaker 1>very frightening fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

318
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:21.390
<v Speaker 1>it accounts for why 1% of the population</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a huge chunk of the money.</v>

319
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.330
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take that 1% and you divide them</v>

320
00:21:25.331 --> 00:21:30.331
<v Speaker 1>into 99% and 1% the top 1% of the 1% has</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all the money that the top 1%</v>

321
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you take the top 1% of 1%</v>

322
00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:41.071
<v Speaker 1>and you divide them into 99% and 1% the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top 1% of that tiny slice has almost all</v>

323
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:48.061
<v Speaker 1>of the money that that tiny slice house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's also scalable and it's a problem</v>

324
00:21:49.661 --> 00:21:53.800
<v Speaker 1>because it means that productivity is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

325
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.930
<v Speaker 1>is always in the hands of a few and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one knows what to do about that.</v>

326
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Or even if there's anything that can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>done about it or even if there's</v>

327
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:06.970
<v Speaker 1>anything that should be done about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know you might think of it as</v>

328
00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:09.460
<v Speaker 1>unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's certainly on fair in terms of</v>

329
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.870
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian distribution of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of productivity.</v>

330
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 1>But what are you going to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

331
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:21.970
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like stopping the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were hyper productive from being</v>

332
00:22:21.971 --> 00:22:25.810
<v Speaker 1>hyper productive constitutes a useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to that problem.</v>

333
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even if you allow huge populations</v>

334
00:22:29.831 --> 00:22:34.831
<v Speaker 1>of people access to higher education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might boost the overall levels of</v>

335
00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:37.660
<v Speaker 1>productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't change the distribution</v>

336
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.750
<v Speaker 1>partly because it just makes everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>more competitive.</v>

337
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:41.584
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

338
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.533
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

339
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.840
<v Speaker 1>here's the definition of gender that</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically it's basically the 1960s to 19</v>

340
00:22:55.430 --> 00:23:00.430
<v Speaker 1>well to 2010 feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Description of gender is socially</v>

341
00:23:02.271 --> 00:23:05.990
<v Speaker 1>constructed system of classification</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ascribes qualities of masculinity</v>

342
00:23:05.991 --> 00:23:09.740
<v Speaker 1>and femininity to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gender characteristics can change over</v>

343
00:23:09.741 --> 00:23:14.741
<v Speaker 1>time and are different between cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

344
00:23:15.171 --> 00:23:18.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of claims in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that it's socially constructed</v>

345
00:23:18.471 --> 00:23:22.160
<v Speaker 1>and the second is that it can change</v>
<v Speaker 1>over second and third that it changes</v>

346
00:23:22.161 --> 00:23:24.050
<v Speaker 1>over time and are different between</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>

347
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

348
00:23:26.731 --> 00:23:31.710
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you mean by different</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the key issue on what</v>

349
00:23:31.711 --> 00:23:34.770
<v Speaker 1>measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something you can't</v>

350
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.310
<v Speaker 1>not ask when you make a statement like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

351
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 1>but that's the basic proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the truth of the matter actually</v>

352
00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:49.891
<v Speaker 1>is is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make,</v>

353
00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.670
<v Speaker 1>make a one to one mapping of personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>on to gender,</v>

354
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.370
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>is socially constructed.</v>

355
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.000
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a lot of evidence that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

356
00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:15.120
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not socially constructed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in such a way that it would allow the</v>

357
00:24:15.121 --> 00:24:16.980
<v Speaker 1>emergence of more than five dimensions.</v>

358
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:23.890
<v Speaker 1>It might be socially constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least to the degree that some one</v>

359
00:24:23.891 --> 00:24:28.690
<v Speaker 1>society can push people regardless of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their gender or even regardless of their</v>

360
00:24:28.691 --> 00:24:31.570
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>farther up the distribution or farther</v>

361
00:24:31.571 --> 00:24:33.340
<v Speaker 1>down the distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then another culture,</v>

362
00:24:33.341 --> 00:24:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know for example,</v>

363
00:24:35.201 --> 00:24:37.520
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes us,</v>

364
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.900
<v Speaker 1>if you take kids who are adopted out</v>
<v Speaker 1>twins and you want to produce a 15 point</v>

365
00:24:43.751 --> 00:24:48.130
<v Speaker 1>difference in their Iq by the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're 18 you have to have a minimum of</v>

366
00:24:48.131 --> 00:24:52.240
<v Speaker 1>three standard deviations difference in</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth between the families that they</v>

367
00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:56.350
<v Speaker 1>lambed in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what a one standard deviation</v>

368
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.740
<v Speaker 1>increase intelligence costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot.</v>

369
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't even obvious that that gain</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustains itself across the entire</v>

370
00:25:06.551 --> 00:25:11.380
<v Speaker 1>lifespan because one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is that as identical twins who</v>

371
00:25:11.381 --> 00:25:14.860
<v Speaker 1>were separated at birth and raised in</v>
<v Speaker 1>different families age,</v>

372
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.580
<v Speaker 1>their Iq is become more like each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>until by the time they're about 60 their</v>

373
00:25:20.921 --> 00:25:24.850
<v Speaker 1>iqs are so similar that it's as if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're testing the same person twice.</v>

374
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's weird day because what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would think you would definitely think</v>

375
00:25:28.691 --> 00:25:32.290
<v Speaker 1>that well as once you separate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>twins,</v>

376
00:25:32.291 --> 00:25:36.040
<v Speaker 1>the longer they stay apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more different they're going to be.</v>

377
00:25:36.041 --> 00:25:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you would assume that their</v>

378
00:25:38.021 --> 00:25:41.020
<v Speaker 1>environments stay different and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences are going to accumulate</v>

379
00:25:41.021 --> 00:25:43.480
<v Speaker 1>across time and that they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>divert.</v>

380
00:25:43.481 --> 00:25:45.130
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what happens at all.</v>

381
00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at some,</v>

382
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.940
<v Speaker 1>some interesting things here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's one study.</v>

383
00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you might ask yourself</v>

384
00:25:58.361 --> 00:26:03.361
<v Speaker 1>is</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do boys like to play with trucks and</v>

385
00:26:04.471 --> 00:26:08.130
<v Speaker 1>girls like to play with like stuffed</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and dolls,</v>

386
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.220
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one answer is,</v>

387
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.290
<v Speaker 1>well that's socially constructed</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

388
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.320
<v Speaker 1>whether they want to or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentially reinforce toy preferences</v>

389
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:26.910
<v Speaker 1>subtly and directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence that the cumulative</v>

390
00:26:26.911 --> 00:26:30.600
<v Speaker 1>effect of that determines what toys the</v>
<v Speaker 1>children are going to play with.</v>

391
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious from the literature</v>

392
00:26:34.591 --> 00:26:37.380
<v Speaker 1>that that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

393
00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.400
<v Speaker 1>that's not a theory that can explain</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

394
00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:45.450
<v Speaker 1>So what the researchers was take a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of toys and have a number of</v>

395
00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:50.190
<v Speaker 1>people classify them as either feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotyped or masculine stereotype.</v>

396
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:55.410
<v Speaker 1>And then they give them to a number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>children to see which toys,</v>

397
00:26:55.411 --> 00:27:00.411
<v Speaker 1>which gendered children played with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they found that the male children</v>

398
00:27:01.081 --> 00:27:05.430
<v Speaker 1>tended to play with the stereotypically</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine toys given free choice and the</v>

399
00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:10.380
<v Speaker 1>female children tended to play with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>female stereotype toys given choice.</v>

400
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have anything to do at all</v>

401
00:27:12.721 --> 00:27:17.580
<v Speaker 1>with the socialization hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except they did the same thing with</v>

402
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:23.100
<v Speaker 1>rhesus monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We compare the interactions of 34 rhesus</v>

403
00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 1>monkeys living within 135 monkey troop</v>
<v Speaker 1>with human wheeled toys and plush toys.</v>

404
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Male monkeys like boys showed consistent</v>
<v Speaker 1>and strong preferences for wheeled toys.</v>

405
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:37.170
<v Speaker 1>While female monkeys like girls show</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater variability at preferences.</v>

406
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the magnitude of preference for</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheeled over plush toys different</v>

407
00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:46.620
<v Speaker 1>significantly between males and females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The similarities to human findings.</v>

408
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.480
<v Speaker 1>The top graph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

409
00:27:48.481 --> 00:27:52.890
<v Speaker 1>is human subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the bottom graph is monkey subjects.</v>

410
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.060
<v Speaker 1>On the left you see males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

411
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.780
<v Speaker 1>the black bar is masculine toys and on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right you see females where the</v>

412
00:28:02.941 --> 00:28:04.860
<v Speaker 1>black bars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine toys.</v>

413
00:28:04.861 --> 00:28:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see is the females are more</v>

414
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:09.150
<v Speaker 1>likely to play with masculine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine toys,</v>

415
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.430
<v Speaker 1>although they slightly prefer feminine</v>
<v Speaker 1>toys,</v>

416
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:15.150
<v Speaker 1>whereas the males overwhelmingly prefer</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine toys.</v>

417
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.600
<v Speaker 1>The similarities to human findings</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate that says preferences can</v>

418
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:24.030
<v Speaker 1>develop without explicit gendered</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialization.</v>

419
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.660
<v Speaker 1>We offer the hypothesis that toy</v>
<v Speaker 1>preferences reflect hormonally</v>

420
00:28:27.661 --> 00:28:29.940
<v Speaker 1>influenced behavioral and cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>biases,</v>

421
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:34.110
<v Speaker 1>which are sculpted by social processes</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the sex differences seen in monkeys</v>

422
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.273
<v Speaker 1>and humans.</v>

423
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:36.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

424
00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Janice M Hassett was the lead author on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

425
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.903
<v Speaker 3>paper.</v>

426
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.240
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a rough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

427
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:48.550
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious at all why male rhesus</v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys would want to play with wheel</v>

428
00:28:48.551 --> 00:28:49.420
<v Speaker 1>toys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

429
00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:50.500
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

430
00:28:50.501 --> 00:28:51.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like rhesus monkeys.</v>

431
00:28:51.841 --> 00:28:54.070
<v Speaker 1>They're driving around in trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

432
00:28:54.071 --> 00:28:58.540
<v Speaker 1>So it's not exactly clear why these</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences exist when you're thinking</v>

433
00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:01.180
<v Speaker 1>about how they're responding to plush</v>
<v Speaker 1>toys,</v>

434
00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:04.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are basically pseudo infants.</v>

435
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.240
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of an easier thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand,</v>

436
00:29:07.241 --> 00:29:11.290
<v Speaker 1>especially because we know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hallmarks of cuteness,</v>

437
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.200
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the stimuli that are necessary</v>

438
00:29:14.201 --> 00:29:17.200
<v Speaker 1>to evoke a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a maternal response,</v>

439
00:29:17.201 --> 00:29:20.530
<v Speaker 1>the hallmarks of cuteness are pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>much stable across mammals,</v>

440
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.920
<v Speaker 1>which is why people think kittens are</v>
<v Speaker 1>cute and you know,</v>

441
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.830
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well any little baby thing is cute and</v>

442
00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:30.010
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that is big i's and</v>
<v Speaker 1>little nose and it sort of moves</v>

443
00:29:30.011 --> 00:29:30.580
<v Speaker 1>helplessly.</v>

444
00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:35.020
<v Speaker 1>It has short limbs and all of that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of adds up to cute and cute is a very</v>

445
00:29:35.021 --> 00:29:40.021
<v Speaker 1>powerful set of triggering stimuli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it wasn't obviously children who</v>

446
00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:46.030
<v Speaker 1>were playing with little like plush</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears wouldn't baby them,</v>

447
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously a plus there is not a</v>

448
00:29:48.341 --> 00:29:50.470
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's similar enough to a baby</v>

449
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.570
<v Speaker 1>schematically that it evokes</v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically evokes those sorts of</v>

450
00:29:55.571 --> 00:29:56.450
<v Speaker 1>responses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

451
00:29:56.451 --> 00:29:57.490
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

452
00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.450
<v Speaker 1>when my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter used to have this stuff toy</v>

453
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:05.140
<v Speaker 1>and it was a cat and I used to play with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cat.</v>

454
00:30:05.141 --> 00:30:08.320
<v Speaker 1>And one thing I used to do with it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could actually push its head inside.</v>

455
00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:13.240
<v Speaker 1>It's little plus body know that she did</v>
<v Speaker 1>not find that the least bit of music.</v>

456
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's a difference in masculine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine play patterns there too.</v>

457
00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:20.590
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

458
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.080
<v Speaker 1>she knew perfectly well that this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be hurt.</v>

459
00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.300
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

460
00:30:25.301 --> 00:30:26.200
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

461
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:30.580
<v Speaker 1>the behavioral responses that it evoked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're part of a sect,</v>

462
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was perfectly healthy of her to</v>

463
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:36.700
<v Speaker 1>be responding as if this thing was</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserving of caring,</v>

464
00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:39.700
<v Speaker 1>compassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was practicing doing that is a very</v>

465
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:42.310
<v Speaker 1>important thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs practice.</v>

466
00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.473
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

467
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll read this to you now.</v>

468
00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I think some of the best research done</v>
<v Speaker 1>on why gender differences exist outside</v>

469
00:30:53.161 --> 00:30:55.790
<v Speaker 1>of socialization has been done by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

470
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Simon Baron Cohen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon Bar Cohen.</v>

471
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

472
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.510
<v Speaker 1>He's a borats brother by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so you know,</v>

473
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:12.470
<v Speaker 1>what he showed is that you might think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the classical human body type is</v>

474
00:31:14.401 --> 00:31:17.100
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense,</v>

475
00:31:17.101 --> 00:31:22.101
<v Speaker 1>every creature human creature starts out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a prototypically female body</v>

476
00:31:23.671 --> 00:31:26.580
<v Speaker 1>structure by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even though there's chromosomal</v>

477
00:31:26.581 --> 00:31:30.590
<v Speaker 1>differences between the two sexes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what happens is that masculinization</v>

478
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.990
<v Speaker 1>occurs as a consequence of fetal</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>

479
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.230
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of variation in fetal</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone from male fetus to male</v>

480
00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:45.231
<v Speaker 1>female fetus and some of Cohen's work</v>
<v Speaker 1>has demonstrated quite clearly that</v>

481
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:50.790
<v Speaker 1>field testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fetal testosterone levels are very much</v>

482
00:31:50.791 --> 00:31:55.020
<v Speaker 1>associated with post birth masculine</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>

483
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.690
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he's found out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

484
00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:03.110
<v Speaker 1>he believes that autism is hyper</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity because he's found that</v>

485
00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.810
<v Speaker 1>the feeder old boys who are hyper</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinized are much more likely to</v>

486
00:32:09.811 --> 00:32:12.210
<v Speaker 1>become autistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's interesting</v>

487
00:32:12.211 --> 00:32:14.850
<v Speaker 1>about autistic kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are autistic females as well,</v>

488
00:32:14.851 --> 00:32:16.500
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of them are male,</v>

489
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:21.920
<v Speaker 1>is that the most fundamental lack they</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to have is the lack of ability to,</v>

490
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.930
<v Speaker 1>to engage in any sort of social contact</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

491
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.070
<v Speaker 1>So they don't make eye contact and boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

492
00:32:29.071 --> 00:32:31.290
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies make less eye contact and girl</v>

493
00:32:31.291 --> 00:32:33.390
<v Speaker 1>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the autistic kids,</v>

494
00:32:33.391 --> 00:32:35.880
<v Speaker 1>they don't make hardly any I call to</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact at all.</v>

495
00:32:35.881 --> 00:32:38.580
<v Speaker 1>And they have a very difficult time</v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing any kind of social</v>

496
00:32:38.581 --> 00:32:42.980
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this study is kind of interesting.</v>

497
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.140
<v Speaker 1>So it was published in,</v>

498
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 2012 let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me read it to you.</v>

499
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Previous research has shown that</v>
<v Speaker 1>prenatal exposure to endocrine</v>

500
00:32:55.401 --> 00:32:59.420
<v Speaker 1>disrupting chemicals can alter</v>
<v Speaker 1>children's neurodevelopment including</v>

501
00:32:59.421 --> 00:33:04.010
<v Speaker 1>sex typed behavior and that it can do so</v>
<v Speaker 1>in different ways in males and females.</v>

502
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Non Chemical exposure including</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosocial stress may disrupt the</v>

503
00:33:09.261 --> 00:33:14.261
<v Speaker 1>prenatal hormonal meal you as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To date only one published study has</v>

504
00:33:14.991 --> 00:33:19.250
<v Speaker 1>perspectively that means over time</v>
<v Speaker 1>examined the relationship between</v>

505
00:33:19.251 --> 00:33:23.870
<v Speaker 1>exposure to prenatal stress and gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific play behavior during childhood.</v>

506
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Finding masculinized play behavior in</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls who experienced high prenatal life</v>

507
00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.470
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress but no associations in boys.</v>

508
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Here we examine this question in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

509
00:33:36.411 --> 00:33:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Prospect of cohort from the study for</v>
<v Speaker 1>future families.</v>

510
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Pregnant women completed questionnaires</v>
<v Speaker 1>on stressful events,</v>

511
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:46.040
<v Speaker 1>life events during pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those who reported one or more</v>

512
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:50.570
<v Speaker 1>events were considered stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Families were recontact,</v>

513
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:55.220
<v Speaker 1>contacted several years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mean age of their children was five</v>

514
00:33:55.221 --> 00:33:59.180
<v Speaker 1>years and mother's completed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire including the validated</v>

515
00:33:59.181 --> 00:34:03.410
<v Speaker 1>preschool activities inventory which</v>
<v Speaker 1>measures sexually dimorphic play</v>

516
00:34:03.411 --> 00:34:08.411
<v Speaker 1>behavior in sex stratified analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>after adjusting for child's age,</v>

517
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.470
<v Speaker 1>parental attitudes towards gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>atypical play,</v>

518
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:17.600
<v Speaker 1>age and sex of siblings and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant covariates girls exposed to</v>

519
00:34:17.601 --> 00:34:18.740
<v Speaker 1>prenatal life events.</v>

520
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Stress had higher scores on the p s ai</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine subscale.</v>

521
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:24.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

522
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:28.990
<v Speaker 1>And showed a trend towards higher or</v>
<v Speaker 1>more masculine composite scores.</v>

523
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:34.030
<v Speaker 1>By contrast in males there was a trend</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards an association between prenatal</v>

524
00:34:34.031 --> 00:34:39.031
<v Speaker 1>stress and Higher Psi Feminine subscale</v>
<v Speaker 1>scores but no association with masculine</v>

525
00:34:40.301 --> 00:34:43.270
<v Speaker 1>or composite scores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These data confirmed previous findings</v>

526
00:34:43.271 --> 00:34:47.500
<v Speaker 1>of human and animal models suggesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that prenatal stress is a non chemical</v>

527
00:34:47.501 --> 00:34:52.501
<v Speaker 1>endocrine disruptor that may have</v>
<v Speaker 1>androgenic effects on female fetuses and</v>

528
00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.320
<v Speaker 1>anti androgenic effects on male feed</v>
<v Speaker 1>fetuses,</v>

529
00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:01.560
<v Speaker 1>androgenic being male hormone effected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Simon Baron Cohen direct study.</v>

530
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the tests hypothetically that you</v>

531
00:35:11.641 --> 00:35:15.330
<v Speaker 1>can use to assess empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it turns out to be rather</v>

532
00:35:15.331 --> 00:35:18.390
<v Speaker 1>difficult to do that reliably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to use what's called the mind in the</v>

533
00:35:18.391 --> 00:35:20.940
<v Speaker 1>eyes test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically with that test,</v>

534
00:35:20.941 --> 00:35:25.941
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you show subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a slice of a photograph of eyes.</v>

535
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:32.040
<v Speaker 1>The person in the photograph had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting some display of emotion and</v>

536
00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.920
<v Speaker 1>some emotional displays are associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with change.</v>

537
00:35:34.921 --> 00:35:35.970
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

538
00:35:35.971 --> 00:35:39.810
<v Speaker 1>a Duchenne smile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a true smile also involves</v>

539
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:44.870
<v Speaker 1>lifting of the eyes at the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's whereas just a like a fake social</v>

540
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:50.181
<v Speaker 1>smile is just the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can read a smile from the eyes.</v>

541
00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Now you can't read that as well as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could if you had the whole face.</v>

542
00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:55.560
<v Speaker 1>You can read anger from the eyes because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eyebrows,</v>

543
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it includes the eyebrows,</v>

544
00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:59.420
<v Speaker 1>eyebrows go down and you can read</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise and,</v>

545
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:02.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of a tenuated because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the whole face.</v>

546
00:36:02.341 --> 00:36:06.030
<v Speaker 1>And so hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are more attuned to social</v>

547
00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:09.060
<v Speaker 1>cues can do a better job of reading the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind in eyes.</v>

548
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:16.360
<v Speaker 1>So these researchers looked at children</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whom fetal testosterone data was</v>

549
00:36:16.611 --> 00:36:20.540
<v Speaker 1>available and then determined at how old</v>
<v Speaker 1>were they?</v>

550
00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

551
00:36:25.701 --> 00:36:29.540
<v Speaker 1>They have data on fetal testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 1>from obviously from before birth.</v>

552
00:36:29.541 --> 00:36:31.940
<v Speaker 1>And then at some point in their child</v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

553
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:35.690
<v Speaker 1>they were given this test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Empathy involves an understanding of</v>

554
00:36:35.691 --> 00:36:40.130
<v Speaker 1>what others are thinking and feeling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>enables us to interact and the social</v>

555
00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:43.790
<v Speaker 1>world</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the empathizing,</v>

556
00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.970
<v Speaker 1>systematizing theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the theory.</v>

557
00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:50.960
<v Speaker 1>The theory is that women are tilted</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards empathizing and males are tilted</v>

558
00:36:50.961 --> 00:36:54.590
<v Speaker 1>towards systematizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that seems to fall into</v>

559
00:36:54.591 --> 00:36:59.591
<v Speaker 1>alignment with other observations</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that the biggest gender</v>

560
00:37:00.321 --> 00:37:04.160
<v Speaker 1>difference between adult humans is</v>

561
00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.093
<v Speaker 2>mmm.</v>

562
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Interest preference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are much more likely to express</v>

563
00:37:10.281 --> 00:37:13.400
<v Speaker 1>interest in occupations that involve a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of social contact,</v>

564
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.280
<v Speaker 1>whereas men are more likely to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

565
00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:21.380
<v Speaker 1>manifest interest in occupations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do with things.</v>

566
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.860
<v Speaker 1>And so one example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this in the Scandinavian</v>

567
00:37:24.861 --> 00:37:27.350
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that they've really</v>

568
00:37:27.351 --> 00:37:31.400
<v Speaker 1>done everything possible to flatten out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environmental differences between,</v>

569
00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for,</v>

570
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.190
<v Speaker 1>for boys and for girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that in the Scandinavian countries,</v>

571
00:37:37.191 --> 00:37:41.060
<v Speaker 1>the ratio of male nurses to female</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurses is one to 20.</v>

572
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:46.640
<v Speaker 1>And of male of female engineers to male</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers is one to 20.</v>

573
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.240
<v Speaker 1>And the government's now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then do a big push to try to get</v>

574
00:37:50.241 --> 00:37:51.290
<v Speaker 1>more men into</v>

575
00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.753
<v Speaker 2>mmm.</v>

576
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Into nursing and more women into</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering.</v>

577
00:37:55.721 --> 00:38:00.721
<v Speaker 1>And with a lot of push and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising and marketing and so forth,</v>

578
00:38:01.021 --> 00:38:05.550
<v Speaker 1>they can shift the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proportions to some minor degree.</v>

579
00:38:05.551 --> 00:38:09.300
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as they stop pushing hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just snapped back to one in 20.</v>

580
00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.690
<v Speaker 1>And it's really interesting if you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

581
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:17.691
<v Speaker 1>that the biggest gender differences that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are reported in the world are reported</v>

582
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:21.330
<v Speaker 1>between men and women and Scandinavian</v>
<v Speaker 1>societies because those are the most</v>

583
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:25.410
<v Speaker 1>gender equal societies in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the perverse things that</v>

584
00:38:25.411 --> 00:38:29.490
<v Speaker 1>has happened is that you can imagine</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's some reason that men and</v>

585
00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:31.560
<v Speaker 1>women are different is because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental,</v>

586
00:38:31.561 --> 00:38:33.000
<v Speaker 1>very variability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

587
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 1>The environment for the women and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment for the man is different.</v>

588
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.010
<v Speaker 1>And then some proportion is due to</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic variability.</v>

589
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:44.410
<v Speaker 1>And so then one idea which is false is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you were radic hated the</v>

590
00:38:44.411 --> 00:38:47.740
<v Speaker 1>environmental variability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gender differences would disappear.</v>

591
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.220
<v Speaker 1>That would only be the case if all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender differences were due to</v>

592
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:55.180
<v Speaker 1>environmental variability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens instead is that when you</v>

593
00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:00.010
<v Speaker 1>eliminate the environmental variability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you maximize the genetic variability and</v>

594
00:39:00.011 --> 00:39:01.990
<v Speaker 1>the reason you do that is because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that's left,</v>

595
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:04.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've eradicated the other source of</v>

596
00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 1>variability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the only thing left is genetic</v>

597
00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:10.390
<v Speaker 1>variability and the consequence of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is being is that men and women differ</v>

598
00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:13.750
<v Speaker 1>more in Scandinavia than they do in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other place on the planet.</v>

599
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Now that to me that seems like the death</v>
<v Speaker 1>knoll of social construction theories</v>

600
00:39:19.661 --> 00:39:24.661
<v Speaker 1>because it's exactly the opposite of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would have been predicted precisely</v>

601
00:39:24.671 --> 00:39:26.110
<v Speaker 1>the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

602
00:39:26.111 --> 00:39:29.500
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it would've been a good thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>if flattening out the opportunity</v>

603
00:39:29.501 --> 00:39:33.100
<v Speaker 1>landscape would have eradicated gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in personality and</v>

604
00:39:33.101 --> 00:39:36.220
<v Speaker 1>preference and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't self evident that that's a</v>

605
00:39:36.221 --> 00:39:40.270
<v Speaker 1>good thing because you could also say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I need galatarian.</v>

606
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Society optimally constructed is one in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the differences between people are</v>

607
00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:51.541
<v Speaker 1>allowed to manifest themselves so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>each person is able to find a place in a</v>

608
00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:54.310
<v Speaker 1>niche and the society that actually fits</v>
<v Speaker 1>their temperament.</v>

609
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Empathy involves and understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what others are thinking and feeling and</v>

610
00:39:59.031 --> 00:40:02.780
<v Speaker 1>enables us to interact in the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>world according to the empathizing</v>

611
00:40:02.781 --> 00:40:06.260
<v Speaker 1>systemizing theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now part of this systemizing theory as</v>

612
00:40:06.261 --> 00:40:10.100
<v Speaker 1>well is that one of the thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>autistic people,</v>

613
00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:11.070
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

614
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:13.500
<v Speaker 1>is that they systematized like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

615
00:40:13.501 --> 00:40:17.670
<v Speaker 1>so to the degree that their cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>abilities are intact,</v>

616
00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.880
<v Speaker 1>which is extraordinarily variable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more often the case that if an</v>

617
00:40:24.961 --> 00:40:27.750
<v Speaker 1>autistic child focus on focuses on</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

618
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:32.870
<v Speaker 1>they do it obsessively and what they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is classify and systematize to a degree</v>

619
00:40:32.911 --> 00:40:36.010
<v Speaker 1>that looks you need dimensional and and</v>

620
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.053
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

621
00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.700
<v Speaker 1>you need dimensional and fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused</v>

622
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.000
<v Speaker 1>according to the empathizing systemizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

623
00:40:48.001 --> 00:40:51.030
<v Speaker 1>females on average have a stronger drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>to empathize that males,</v>

624
00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:54.600
<v Speaker 1>this sex difference May in part reflect</v>
<v Speaker 1>developmental differences in brain</v>

625
00:40:54.601 --> 00:40:58.080
<v Speaker 1>structure and function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are themselves under the influence</v>

626
00:40:58.081 --> 00:41:01.230
<v Speaker 1>of fetal testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Previous studies and found that fetal</v>

627
00:41:01.231 --> 00:41:06.231
<v Speaker 1>testosterone is inversely backwards</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlated with social behaviors such as</v>

628
00:41:07.831 --> 00:41:12.300
<v Speaker 1>eye contact and infancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peer relationships and preschoolers and</v>

629
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.970
<v Speaker 1>mentalistic interpretation of animate</v>
<v Speaker 1>motion.</v>

630
00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Male fetuses are exposed to higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of testosterone.</v>

631
00:41:22.491 --> 00:41:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Then our female fetuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The present study investigates</v>

632
00:41:26.271 --> 00:41:30.410
<v Speaker 1>empathizing and children as a function</v>
<v Speaker 1>of amniotic measures of fetal</v>

633
00:41:30.411 --> 00:41:33.320
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>193 mothers of children,</v>

634
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:37.040
<v Speaker 1>100 males 93 see males age six to eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of age,</v>

635
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:40.040
<v Speaker 1>completed children's versions of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathy quotient,</v>

636
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:43.910
<v Speaker 1>which is a questionnaire I believe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>children themselves.</v>

637
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.460
<v Speaker 1>We're tested on reading the mind in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes task.</v>

638
00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:52.770
<v Speaker 1>All mothers had had amniocentesis during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second trimester of pregnancy.</v>

639
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.790
<v Speaker 1>There was a significant negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation between fetal testosterone</v>

640
00:41:56.791 --> 00:41:59.220
<v Speaker 1>and scores on both measures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

641
00:41:59.221 --> 00:42:01.980
<v Speaker 1>empathy may be influenced by postnatal</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

642
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.960
<v Speaker 1>The results suggest that prenatal</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology also plays an important role</v>

643
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:09.330
<v Speaker 1>mediated by androgen effects in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

644
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:13.530
<v Speaker 1>These results also have implication for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the causes of disability involving</v>

645
00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:18.000
<v Speaker 1>empathy such as autism spectrum</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions and may explain the increased</v>

646
00:42:18.001 --> 00:42:20.640
<v Speaker 1>rate of such conditions among males.</v>

647
00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Here's some differentiators between</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion and politeness.</v>

648
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Compassionate people feel others'</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

649
00:42:32.781 --> 00:42:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Inquire about others' wellbeing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathize with other feelings,</v>

650
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:38.990
<v Speaker 1>others' feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>polite people.</v>

651
00:42:38.991 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Respect authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate to seem pushy and avoid imposing</v>

652
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:44.000
<v Speaker 1>their will on others.</v>

653
00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:47.403
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

654
00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:48.760
<v Speaker 1>so there's the,</v>

655
00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:50.250
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

656
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:52.350
<v Speaker 1>The non overlapping distributions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

657
00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:53.180
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

658
00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Talk to you about</v>

659
00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.200
<v Speaker 1>the probability that a randomly drawn</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman will be more agreeable than a</v>

660
00:43:00.201 --> 00:43:05.201
<v Speaker 1>randomly drawn men is 63% so six if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do random pairs 10 times,</v>

661
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.700
<v Speaker 1>six times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman will be more agreeable than</v>

662
00:43:10.701 --> 00:43:12.840
<v Speaker 1>the man that you chose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see that it's not,</v>

663
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:15.620
<v Speaker 1>in some sense it's not a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

664
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.950
<v Speaker 1>You know it deviates from 50 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

665
00:43:18.951 --> 00:43:22.910
<v Speaker 1>but it still leaves a lot of room for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the claim that men and women are</v>

666
00:43:22.911 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 1>basically more similar than they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

667
00:43:25.101 --> 00:43:27.830
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on where in the distribution</v>

668
00:43:27.831 --> 00:43:29.870
<v Speaker 1>that you're looking because of the,</v>

669
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:32.250
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

670
00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:35.020
<v Speaker 1>the increasing effects of a difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>in distribution.</v>

671
00:43:35.021 --> 00:43:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Now as you move farther and farther out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the edges of the population,</v>

672
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:47.870
<v Speaker 1>women are more extroverted than man by</v>
<v Speaker 1>0.15 of a standard deviation in</v>

673
00:43:49.711 --> 00:43:52.200
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more enthusiastic after the</v>

674
00:43:52.201 --> 00:43:55.740
<v Speaker 1>aspect level and enthusiastic and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to manifest a lot of positive</v>

675
00:43:55.741 --> 00:43:58.560
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's quite interesting because one of</v>

676
00:43:58.561 --> 00:44:01.770
<v Speaker 1>the things that that seems to imply is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we know that women are also more</v>

677
00:44:01.771 --> 00:44:05.340
<v Speaker 1>sensitive to negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women actually seem to have a broader</v>

678
00:44:05.341 --> 00:44:09.600
<v Speaker 1>range of emotional expression than men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more prone to positive emotion</v>

679
00:44:09.601 --> 00:44:11.370
<v Speaker 1>and they're more prone to negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

680
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:23.460
<v Speaker 1>You UN index is of a gender equality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic development are associated with</v>

681
00:44:23.461 --> 00:44:27.180
<v Speaker 1>larger differences in agreeableness but</v>
<v Speaker 1>not an extroversion or neuroticism.</v>

682
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:31.590
<v Speaker 1>So basically if you rank countries by</v>
<v Speaker 1>how</v>

683
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:33.490
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

684
00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:38.380
<v Speaker 1>favorably they look upon equal rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how much they've been able to put</v>

685
00:44:38.381 --> 00:44:42.700
<v Speaker 1>that in practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The countries that rank higher in rights</v>

686
00:44:42.701 --> 00:44:46.990
<v Speaker 1>for women produce women and men who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>more variable on agreeableness rather</v>

687
00:44:46.991 --> 00:44:49.390
<v Speaker 1>than less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't see the effect of with</v>

688
00:44:49.391 --> 00:44:52.270
<v Speaker 1>extroversion and neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

689
00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.750
<v Speaker 1>occupational preference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the people things,</v>

690
00:44:58.751 --> 00:45:03.130
<v Speaker 1>dimension men prefer working with things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women with people.</v>

691
00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.770
<v Speaker 1>And the difference is almost a full</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard deviation</v>

692
00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:13.060
<v Speaker 1>and the end is 500,000 so you know when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're starting to get up the numbers</v>

693
00:45:13.521 --> 00:45:17.480
<v Speaker 1>like that in the study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes increasingly more reasonable</v>

694
00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:20.150
<v Speaker 1>to consider it representative of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual population.</v>

695
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Holand John Holland has produced a</v>
<v Speaker 1>typology of jobs which he acronine turns</v>

696
00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:31.100
<v Speaker 1>into an acronym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is reassess,</v>

697
00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.650
<v Speaker 1>realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginative,</v>

698
00:45:33.651 --> 00:45:35.270
<v Speaker 1>artistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

699
00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:38.690
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

700
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:42.020
<v Speaker 1>And Conventional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure about the entrepreneurial</v>

701
00:45:42.021 --> 00:45:45.710
<v Speaker 1>one man show stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>realistic and investigative interests</v>

702
00:45:45.711 --> 00:45:49.640
<v Speaker 1>and women's show stronger artistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social and conventional interests.</v>

703
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no differences in</v>

704
00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:53.720
<v Speaker 1>enterprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not entrepreneurial ability.</v>

705
00:45:53.721 --> 00:45:56.390
<v Speaker 1>It's enterprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fundamentally the same thing.</v>

706
00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:04.130
<v Speaker 1>So how does that express itself and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>social terms,</v>

707
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.910
<v Speaker 1>while there are more men as well known</v>
<v Speaker 1>in science,</v>

708
00:46:07.911 --> 00:46:10.790
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering and mathematics,</v>

709
00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.420
<v Speaker 1>now God only knows if that'll be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>case in 20 years.</v>

710
00:46:14.421 --> 00:46:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to our society very rapidly is</v>

711
00:46:17.961 --> 00:46:21.710
<v Speaker 1>that men are bailing out of higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>education institutions at a rate that's</v>

712
00:46:21.711 --> 00:46:24.560
<v Speaker 1>nothing short of terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I</v>

713
00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.840
<v Speaker 1>already in educational institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher</v>

714
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:32.060
<v Speaker 1>edgy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

715
00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.470
<v Speaker 1>institutes of higher education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women radically outnumber men.</v>

716
00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:40.570
<v Speaker 1>And the rate at which they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's changing seems it's in itself to</v>

717
00:46:40.571 --> 00:46:44.140
<v Speaker 1>be increasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why that is is not so obvious.</v>

718
00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.850
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case that in pre higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>education settings,</v>

719
00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:54.120
<v Speaker 1>increasingly girls outperform boys and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also not self evident why that is.</v>

720
00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:02.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's some gender differences in</v>

721
00:47:04.471 --> 00:47:08.730
<v Speaker 1>employment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that might interest</v>

722
00:47:08.731 --> 00:47:10.690
<v Speaker 1>you might annoy you is that okay?</v>

723
00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:17.460
<v Speaker 1>The most common occupation for women in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1956 was basically secretarial.</v>

724
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.390
<v Speaker 1>That's still the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although the names are different because</v>

725
00:47:21.391 --> 00:47:24.180
<v Speaker 1>it's often administrative assistant or</v>
<v Speaker 1>executive assistant,</v>

726
00:47:24.181 --> 00:47:27.930
<v Speaker 1>but the job descriptions are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally equivalent.</v>

727
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:33.190
<v Speaker 1>There's 11% women in construction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15% women in forestry,</v>

728
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:38.610
<v Speaker 1>19% women in mining and 25% women in in</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

729
00:47:39.341 --> 00:47:44.341
<v Speaker 1>That involves utilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no female brick masons,</v>

730
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:48.100
<v Speaker 1>block masons or stone masons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>0.1% very,</v>

731
00:47:48.101 --> 00:47:51.250
<v Speaker 1>very few cement masons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concrete finishers and turnout,</v>

732
00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.160
<v Speaker 1>so workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few electrical power line</v>

733
00:47:54.161 --> 00:47:57.400
<v Speaker 1>installers and repairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carpet floor and tile installers,</v>

734
00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.690
<v Speaker 1>heating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>air conditioning,</v>

735
00:47:58.691 --> 00:48:00.700
<v Speaker 1>refrigeration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics and installers,</v>

736
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.660
<v Speaker 1>structural iron and rebar workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bus and truck mechanics and diesel</v>

737
00:48:04.661 --> 00:48:07.630
<v Speaker 1>engine specialists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miscellaneous vehicle in mobile</v>

738
00:48:07.631 --> 00:48:08.620
<v Speaker 1>equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics,</v>

739
00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:13.420
<v Speaker 1>installers and repairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tile and do make dye makers tool and die</v>

740
00:48:13.421 --> 00:48:18.421
<v Speaker 1>makers and roofers all under 1%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women.</v>

741
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:25.090
<v Speaker 1>This is the 10 most female dominated</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupations in the United States as of</v>

742
00:48:25.091 --> 00:48:28.180
<v Speaker 1>2010 secretaries and administrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>assistants,</v>

743
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:33.100
<v Speaker 1>96% childcare workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95% receptionists and information</v>

744
00:48:33.101 --> 00:48:35.830
<v Speaker 1>clerks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>93% teacher assistants,</v>

745
00:48:35.831 --> 00:48:40.240
<v Speaker 1>92% registered nurses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>91% it's all around 90.</v>

746
00:48:40.241 --> 00:48:42.940
<v Speaker 1>So while cops stop saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bookkeeping,</v>

747
00:48:42.941 --> 00:48:44.290
<v Speaker 1>accounting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>auditing,</v>

748
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.940
<v Speaker 1>maids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>housekeepers,</v>

749
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.580
<v Speaker 1>nursing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric and home health aides,</v>

750
00:48:48.581 --> 00:48:52.240
<v Speaker 1>personal and home care aides and general</v>
<v Speaker 1>office clerks.</v>

751
00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.660
<v Speaker 1>All of those are 85% or more female.</v>

752
00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Other differences between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men are taller than women on average</v>

753
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:05.650
<v Speaker 1>five inches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average woman in North America is</v>

754
00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:07.990
<v Speaker 1>five foot four and the average man is</v>
<v Speaker 1>five foot nine.</v>

755
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:13.810
<v Speaker 1>The average man weighs 194 pounds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average woman weighs 164 pounds.</v>

756
00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men are 40 to 60% stronger in their</v>

757
00:49:17.351 --> 00:49:18.184
<v Speaker 1>upper body</v>

758
00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:25.460
<v Speaker 1>and they and their and their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their jaw size is much larger.</v>

759
00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:29.670
<v Speaker 1>That's because jaws are used for</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

760
00:49:29.671 --> 00:49:32.460
<v Speaker 1>They're used for biting and so it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hangover from,</v>

761
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.090
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hangover from our more primordial</v>

762
00:49:36.091 --> 00:49:39.660
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women have a higher proportion of body</v>

763
00:49:39.661 --> 00:49:42.420
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more resistant to disease.</v>

764
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:47.990
<v Speaker 1>There are far more male homicide victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>77% there are far more male homicide</v>

765
00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:53.250
<v Speaker 1>perpetrators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>85% if women kill someone,</v>

766
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:57.780
<v Speaker 1>it's usually an intimate partner or</v>
<v Speaker 1>family member 60% of the time.</v>

767
00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if men kill someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually a non intimate acquaintance</v>

768
00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:07.760
<v Speaker 1>or a stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously you're much safer with a</v>

769
00:50:07.891 --> 00:50:11.160
<v Speaker 1>woman you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

770
00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:17.100
<v Speaker 1>predation instrumental versus defensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>

771
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:21.840
<v Speaker 1>8% of the male population hunts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's 91% male.</v>

772
00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

773
00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that is characteristic</v>

774
00:50:30.301 --> 00:50:35.301
<v Speaker 1>of modern culture is that we associate</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost unthinkingly axiomatically</v>

775
00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:42.560
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness with virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we think that compassion,</v>

776
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.823
<v Speaker 1>empathy</v>

777
00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.393
<v Speaker 2>are</v>

778
00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:53.350
<v Speaker 1>virtues that should predominate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's virtue hierarchy and that they</v>

779
00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:56.960
<v Speaker 1>should be fostered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that's very much</v>

780
00:50:56.961 --> 00:51:00.890
<v Speaker 1>worth considering is that all virtues</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned into vices.</v>

781
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:04.280
<v Speaker 1>If you push them far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of the reason why they</v>

782
00:51:04.281 --> 00:51:05.840
<v Speaker 1>would be normally distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

783
00:51:05.841 --> 00:51:10.841
<v Speaker 1>Because every trait has a range within</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it's functional and outside of</v>

784
00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:13.790
<v Speaker 1>that range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that it will be</v>

785
00:51:13.791 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 1>functional starts to become very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>

786
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>empathy,</v>

787
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:23.420
<v Speaker 1>warmth and compassion sound like very</v>
<v Speaker 1>good things,</v>

788
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:24.523
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

789
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:29.020
<v Speaker 1>they can also be construed as trusting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>submissive,</v>

790
00:51:29.021 --> 00:51:32.050
<v Speaker 1>and compliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could be perceived as naivete</v>

791
00:51:32.051 --> 00:51:35.740
<v Speaker 1>docility and a tendency to follow rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than lead.</v>

792
00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Now we do know that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictors of dependent personality</v>

793
00:51:40.871 --> 00:51:44.830
<v Speaker 1>disorder is high levels of agreeableness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that is a disorder that is more</v>

794
00:51:44.831 --> 00:51:48.760
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of women and anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorders and depressive disorders are</v>

795
00:51:48.761 --> 00:51:52.570
<v Speaker 1>also much more prevalent in women and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's likely associated not with</v>

796
00:51:52.571 --> 00:51:54.400
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with high levels of negative</v>

797
00:51:54.401 --> 00:51:58.990
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this paper 2001 is the effects of</v>

798
00:51:58.991 --> 00:52:02.080
<v Speaker 1>personality on executive career success</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the U S and Europe.</v>

799
00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:03.603
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

800
00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:05.860
<v Speaker 1>everybody talks about the glass ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

801
00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:10.210
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that women make less money</v>
<v Speaker 1>than men for the same amount of work.</v>

802
00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say is that's</v>

803
00:52:12.101 --> 00:52:15.100
<v Speaker 1>not true for single people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so you know,</v>

804
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:17.263
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

805
00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:22.390
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious that the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>women make less money than men when they</v>

806
00:52:22.391 --> 00:52:27.391
<v Speaker 1>do is because of prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women are more likely to work part</v>

807
00:52:27.701 --> 00:52:28.600
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

808
00:52:28.601 --> 00:52:30.190
<v Speaker 1>And the reasons for that are pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>

809
00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:33.190
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is think about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 15 seconds to figure out why.</v>

810
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:38.430
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is is that many women</v>
<v Speaker 1>have children in their thirties and one</v>

811
00:52:39.201 --> 00:52:44.201
<v Speaker 1>of the ways of balancing the development</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your career with the burden of having</v>

812
00:52:45.321 --> 00:52:48.020
<v Speaker 1>children or the wonder of having</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

813
00:52:48.021 --> 00:52:51.320
<v Speaker 1>it depending on how you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is by working part time.</v>

814
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems with that,</v>

815
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two problems potentially.</v>

816
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you the next slide before I</v>

817
00:52:59.721 --> 00:53:00.830
<v Speaker 1>get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

818
00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:05.160
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go to this next one.</v>

819
00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

820
00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:11.130
<v Speaker 1>So here's some correlations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is between how much money</v>

821
00:53:11.131 --> 00:53:15.990
<v Speaker 1>you make and your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the correlation between neuroticism</v>

822
00:53:15.991 --> 00:53:18.300
<v Speaker 1>and how much money you get paid is</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative 0.3.</v>

823
00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:21.330
<v Speaker 1>The higher you are neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less you make,</v>

824
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.160
<v Speaker 1>less you get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

825
00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

826
00:53:31.421 --> 00:53:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Because you're not confident in your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>abilities.</v>

827
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.510
<v Speaker 1>You have low self esteem and if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not confident in your own abilities and</v>

828
00:53:37.511 --> 00:53:41.380
<v Speaker 1>you're anxious about your performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to</v>

829
00:53:41.381 --> 00:53:46.060
<v Speaker 1>feel confident and calm about</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiating for more money or even</v>

830
00:53:46.061 --> 00:53:47.830
<v Speaker 1>asking for a raise is quite low.</v>

831
00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:49.953
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

832
00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Extraversion and money made virtually no</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation.</v>

833
00:53:52.701 --> 00:53:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no correlation.</v>

834
00:53:53.871 --> 00:53:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative 0.2 for now,</v>

835
00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:59.390
<v Speaker 1>you might not think that those</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlations are very large,</v>

836
00:53:59.391 --> 00:54:03.110
<v Speaker 1>but if the correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and money made is negative</v>

837
00:54:03.111 --> 00:54:06.580
<v Speaker 1>0.3 if you translate that into an effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>size cause,</v>

838
00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:09.290
<v Speaker 1>this is called a binomial effect size</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

839
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:14.500
<v Speaker 1>just the effect of neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll ensure that 65% of men make more</v>

840
00:54:16.041 --> 00:54:19.220
<v Speaker 1>money than average and 35% of women make</v>
<v Speaker 1>more money than average.</v>

841
00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Just the effect of neuroticism and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you add neuroticism and agreeableness</v>

842
00:54:24.351 --> 00:54:26.660
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to do the math because I have to</v>

843
00:54:26.661 --> 00:54:28.430
<v Speaker 1>square,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to take the square root.</v>

844
00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:30.230
<v Speaker 1>It's 0.5</v>

845
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.960
<v Speaker 2>0.5</v>

846
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:41.790
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that in front of a class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately it's going to push it up</v>

847
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:46.791
<v Speaker 1>to about 70 30 or higher than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bit of a negative</v>

848
00:54:46.801 --> 00:54:51.030
<v Speaker 1>correlation between conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and money made</v>

849
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.690
<v Speaker 1>ascendancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How well you progress up the ranks.</v>

850
00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:55.613
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

851
00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Directly or indirectly?</v>

852
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:03.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't look that,</v>

853
00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't look in detail into the models</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use,</v>

854
00:55:06.101 --> 00:55:08.470
<v Speaker 1>so I was just going to stick to the zero</v>
<v Speaker 1>order correlations.</v>

855
00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:13.980
<v Speaker 1>So ascendancy negative 0.2,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one for neuroticism,</v>

856
00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:17.500
<v Speaker 1>negative 0.144</v>

857
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:23.450
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects are larger if you totaled</v>

858
00:55:23.451 --> 00:55:25.700
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

859
00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Here's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something to think about.</v>

860
00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Job Satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correlation with neuroticism is</v>

861
00:55:34.011 --> 00:55:37.460
<v Speaker 1>negative points for two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>

862
00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:40.340
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about neuroticism is it's</v>

863
00:55:40.341 --> 00:55:42.740
<v Speaker 1>also a very good predictor of marital</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction.</v>

864
00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:47.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting in that light to</v>
<v Speaker 1>note that 70% of divorces are initiated</v>

865
00:55:47.961 --> 00:55:49.130
<v Speaker 1>by women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

866
00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.820
<v Speaker 1>one reason for that is that men are</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to get along with.</v>

867
00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:57.320
<v Speaker 1>And the other possibility is that women</v>
<v Speaker 1>are too sensitive to that and there's no</v>

868
00:55:57.321 --> 00:56:00.410
<v Speaker 1>way of sorting that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's nonetheless interesting to note</v>

869
00:56:00.411 --> 00:56:02.510
<v Speaker 1>that that's still where the gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference lives.</v>

870
00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism correlation with job</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction,</v>

871
00:56:08.121 --> 00:56:10.910
<v Speaker 1>negative 0.42 correlation with life</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction,</v>

872
00:56:10.911 --> 00:56:13.970
<v Speaker 1>negative 0.42 correlation with career</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction,</v>

873
00:56:13.971 --> 00:56:18.971
<v Speaker 1>negative 0.41 so one of the things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to remember is that almost all the</v>

874
00:56:20.121 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 1>measures that purport to measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like wellbeing or happiness or</v>

875
00:56:24.071 --> 00:56:28.990
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction are so contaminated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism that it's not even clear</v>

876
00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 1>that they're measuring something</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

877
00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:35.260
<v Speaker 1>You see agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correlation with career</v>

878
00:56:35.261 --> 00:56:37.450
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just negative 0.2</v>

879
00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:45.890
<v Speaker 1>if you get men to rate their performance</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get their bosses to rate their</v>

880
00:56:45.991 --> 00:56:48.960
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men rate their performance pretty much</v>

881
00:56:48.961 --> 00:56:52.350
<v Speaker 1>the same as the bosses rate their</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance or maybe they rate them a</v>

882
00:56:52.351 --> 00:56:55.680
<v Speaker 1>little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if women rate their own performance,</v>

883
00:56:55.890 --> 00:56:58.830
<v Speaker 1>they rate their own performance as worse</v>
<v Speaker 1>than their bosses rating of their</v>

884
00:56:58.831 --> 00:57:02.460
<v Speaker 1>performance consistently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the predictor of that seems to be</v>

885
00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:04.140
<v Speaker 1>negative emotionality.</v>

886
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Now you might wonder if negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionality is something that's</v>

887
00:57:12.381 --> 00:57:17.381
<v Speaker 1>associated with lower levels of life</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction across a broad variety of</v>

888
00:57:17.691 --> 00:57:20.600
<v Speaker 1>measures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What possible use could it be?</v>

889
00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:23.960
<v Speaker 1>But then you have to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

890
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:28.010
<v Speaker 1>exactly how is the physical environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>different for women and for men?</v>

891
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:33.430
<v Speaker 1>And one clearer fact is that at an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual level,</v>

892
00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:38.930
<v Speaker 1>at least in relationship to dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>battles with men,</v>

893
00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.680
<v Speaker 1>women are at a disadvantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not least because of their size.</v>

894
00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Now it is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

895
00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:49.940
<v Speaker 1>that women hit men in marital</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships more often than men hit</v>

896
00:57:49.941 --> 00:57:50.774
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

897
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

898
00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:54.430
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of statistic that makes</v>

899
00:57:54.431 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 1>you wonder about measures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics.</v>

900
00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:01.980
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with that measure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

901
00:58:05.521 --> 00:58:07.380
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

902
00:58:07.381 --> 00:58:10.410
<v Speaker 1>so it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends precisely on how you define</v>

903
00:58:10.411 --> 00:58:11.850
<v Speaker 1>hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

904
00:58:11.851 --> 00:58:14.970
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very tricky thing because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be frequency,</v>

905
00:58:14.971 --> 00:58:17.640
<v Speaker 1>it could even be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be frequency that that</v>

906
00:58:17.641 --> 00:58:22.140
<v Speaker 1>certainly might be a measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the best measure would likely likely</v>

907
00:58:22.141 --> 00:58:24.990
<v Speaker 1>be something like damaged per blow.</v>

908
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Here's a study of the differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>between men and women.</v>

909
00:58:34.091 --> 00:58:36.850
<v Speaker 1>At an aspect level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are more enthusiastic,</v>

910
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:41.140
<v Speaker 1>one fifth of a standard deviation there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little less assertive,</v>

911
00:58:41.141 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 1>but not very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are both elements of extroversion.</v>

912
00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:47.200
<v Speaker 1>They're more compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost half a standard deviation.</v>

913
00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:49.360
<v Speaker 1>There are about a third of a standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation,</v>

914
00:58:49.361 --> 00:58:51.490
<v Speaker 1>more polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference in</v>

915
00:58:51.491 --> 00:58:54.190
<v Speaker 1>industriousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are slightly more orderly than</v>

916
00:58:54.191 --> 00:58:55.960
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's something to think about.</v>

917
00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:58.120
<v Speaker 1>This is something that I noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

918
00:58:58.121 --> 00:59:03.121
<v Speaker 1>when I was raising kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would intervene when my kids were</v>

919
00:59:03.161 --> 00:59:06.070
<v Speaker 1>misbehaving far more often than my wife</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

920
00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:10.450
<v Speaker 1>but if I could just shut up for five</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds when they were being annoying,</v>

921
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:14.290
<v Speaker 1>then she had to intervene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all that meant was my threshold for</v>

922
00:59:14.291 --> 00:59:18.040
<v Speaker 1>being annoyed by misbehavior was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly lower than hers.</v>

923
00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:21.800
<v Speaker 1>But what that meant in practice was</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was lower,</v>

924
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I ended up doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up intervening far more often</v>

925
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:26.150
<v Speaker 1>because I would get fed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

926
00:59:26.151 --> 00:59:31.151
<v Speaker 1>if it took her 63 seconds to get annoyed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and me 60 what that would mean</v>

927
00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.090
<v Speaker 1>practically would be that I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>intervening most of the time.</v>

928
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:38.240
<v Speaker 1>So in women are a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly than men too.</v>

929
00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:41.420
<v Speaker 1>So you might ask yourself what exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would mean for the division of</v>

930
00:59:41.421 --> 00:59:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Labor in a household.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what it suggests is that if</v>

931
00:59:44.751 --> 00:59:49.700
<v Speaker 1>there's disarray in the household,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability is such that the tip of</v>

932
00:59:49.701 --> 00:59:53.810
<v Speaker 1>a woman will get more annoyed about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster than the typical Matt and how</v>

933
00:59:53.811 --> 00:59:57.140
<v Speaker 1>that would translate into the manner in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which household duties are distributed.</v>

934
00:59:57.141 --> 00:59:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's important to remember that</v>

935
00:59:59.841 --> 01:00:03.680
<v Speaker 1>small differences at the mean level can</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce very large differences in</v>

936
01:00:03.681 --> 01:00:04.514
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

937
01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Women are lower and intellect and higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>and openness.</v>

938
01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.470
<v Speaker 1>And I think that probably goes along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

939
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:15.590
<v Speaker 1>with the interest dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw already that women are more</v>

940
01:00:15.591 --> 01:00:19.700
<v Speaker 1>interested in artistic pursuits than men</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and that makes sense because we know</v>

941
01:00:19.701 --> 01:00:24.440
<v Speaker 1>that the openness to experience part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness is a predictor for example,</v>

942
01:00:24.441 --> 01:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>of whether you were in the humanities or</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sciences in university.</v>

943
01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:33.191
<v Speaker 1>So intellect predicts roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in the sciences and openness to</v>

944
01:00:33.291 --> 01:00:35.960
<v Speaker 1>experience predicts interest in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities.</v>

945
01:00:35.961 --> 01:00:40.961
<v Speaker 1>In the arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are half a standard deviation,</v>

946
01:00:41.381 --> 01:00:45.250
<v Speaker 1>more agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is at the big five level and four</v>

947
01:00:45.251 --> 01:00:49.510
<v Speaker 1>tenths of a standard deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sensitive to negative emotion.</v>

948
01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>So the two really big traits that</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate men from women are</v>

949
01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.410
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And negative emotion.</v>

950
01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another chart that's quite</v>

951
01:01:03.611 --> 01:01:05.150
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um</v>

952
01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:09.663
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

953
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Motivation variables by big five traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evenings worked.</v>

954
01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Extrovert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extroverts are more likely to work.</v>

955
01:01:17.821 --> 01:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Evenings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreeable people are less likely to work</v>

956
01:01:20.491 --> 01:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>evenings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's interesting because you might</v>

957
01:01:22.801 --> 01:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>think that if they were agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd work more evenings.</v>

958
01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>But I suspect that's what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the agreeable people is that</v>

959
01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>because their primary commitment is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationships,</v>

960
01:01:33.811 --> 01:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>they're more likely to consider their</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary domain,</v>

961
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>their responsibilities to intimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>partners of various sorts.</v>

962
01:01:41.491 --> 01:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>And so they'll goal work for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

963
01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Conscientious people work is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>central to their life.</v>

964
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case with open people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

965
01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:53.630
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

966
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correlation between agreeableness</v>

967
01:01:56.041 --> 01:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>and hours worked is negative 0.16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between agreeableness</v>

968
01:02:00.541 --> 01:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>and the hours of work that someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>desires is negative 0.17.</v>

969
01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:12.493
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

970
01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Here's some things that predict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

971
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>relationship instability on divorce.</v>

972
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Most personality traits have substantial</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects on mating and parenting related</v>

973
01:02:24.971 --> 01:02:27.850
<v Speaker 1>behaviors such as sexual promiscuity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship stability,</v>

974
01:02:27.851 --> 01:02:29.590
<v Speaker 1>and divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Promiscuity.</v>

975
01:02:29.591 --> 01:02:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And the desire for multiple sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>partners are predicted by extraversion</v>

976
01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:37.150
<v Speaker 1>openness to experience neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in women.</v>

977
01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Positive skid sodomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we won't bother with.</v>

978
01:02:39.731 --> 01:02:43.780
<v Speaker 1>And the dark traits like narcissism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathy and machiavellianism,</v>

979
01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.610
<v Speaker 1>negative predictors of promiscuity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>short term mating include agreeableness,</v>

980
01:02:48.611 --> 01:02:50.800
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honesty,</v>

981
01:02:50.801 --> 01:02:52.360
<v Speaker 1>humility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the HEXACO model,</v>

982
01:02:52.361 --> 01:02:56.080
<v Speaker 1>which is a six dimensional model and</v>
<v Speaker 1>autistic light traits,</v>

983
01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>relationship instability is associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with extroversion,</v>

984
01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>low agreeableness and low</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

985
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:03.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

986
01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>that's high extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low agreeableness and low</v>

987
01:03:06.341 --> 01:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tilting quite hard towards</v>

988
01:03:09.281 --> 01:03:12.480
<v Speaker 1>psychopathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone who is really extroverted and</v>

989
01:03:12.481 --> 01:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>really low and really low in</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

990
01:03:15.611 --> 01:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be narcissistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not necessarily a problem if</v>

991
01:03:20.081 --> 01:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>they're high in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you can still,</v>

992
01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>they might be selfish and after their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own interest,</v>

993
01:03:25.451 --> 01:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>but if they're high in</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

994
01:03:26.831 --> 01:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>if they tell you that they'll do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

995
01:03:28.391 --> 01:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>they'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And generally you can expect that.</v>

996
01:03:31.181 --> 01:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell you the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're low in conscientiousness,</v>

997
01:03:34.211 --> 01:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>well then you have a big problem because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be somewhat parasitical,</v>

998
01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>which is one way of defining low</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and disagreeable.</v>

999
01:03:42.161 --> 01:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>So they only care about themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroverted.</v>

1000
01:03:44.081 --> 01:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>So they're very dominant and outgoing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1001
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:48.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1002
01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

1003
01:03:49.151 --> 01:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>low conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to a smaller extent,</v>

1004
01:03:51.371 --> 01:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>low agreeableness all contribute to</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase the likelihood of divorce.</v>

1005
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Now in this study,</v>

1006
01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.433
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1007
01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>there is a 16 pdf study done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see it here because it's cut</v>

1008
01:04:14.771 --> 01:04:17.830
<v Speaker 1>off on this slide a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they did,</v>

1009
01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.140
<v Speaker 1>it's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of just looking at the zero</v>

1010
01:04:20.141 --> 01:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>order correlations between gender and</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

1011
01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:26.590
<v Speaker 1>they summed all the differences to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the overall difference was between</v>

1012
01:04:26.591 --> 01:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have one normal distribution</v>

1013
01:04:29.411 --> 01:04:31.840
<v Speaker 1>that was man and another normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution that was women,</v>

1014
01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>and then you could see how much they</v>
<v Speaker 1>overlapped.</v>

1015
01:04:33.941 --> 01:04:35.710
<v Speaker 1>If you summed up all the gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>

1016
01:04:35.711 --> 01:04:40.030
<v Speaker 1>and the answer was they were three</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard deviations different in total,</v>

1017
01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:43.390
<v Speaker 1>which is a whopping difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It meant that the personality</v>

1018
01:04:43.391 --> 01:04:47.890
<v Speaker 1>distributions of men and women over out</v>
<v Speaker 1>only overlapped in total by 10%</v>

1019
01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.860
<v Speaker 1>they found in the 16 pdf pdf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotty,</v>

1020
01:04:51.861 --> 01:04:55.400
<v Speaker 1>that's an old personality scale that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally formulated by cattle and it</v>

1021
01:04:55.401 --> 01:04:58.550
<v Speaker 1>was a precursor to the big five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason they used it was because they</v>

1022
01:04:58.551 --> 01:05:02.030
<v Speaker 1>had historical data that many thousands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people had filled out.</v>

1023
01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:05.750
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychometrically arrayed probably didn't</v>

1024
01:05:05.751 --> 01:05:09.680
<v Speaker 1>mean there was no information in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women were hiring sensitivity,</v>

1025
01:05:09.681 --> 01:05:10.940
<v Speaker 1>warmth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and apprehension,</v>

1026
01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.250
<v Speaker 1>warmth than apprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could associate it with</v>

1027
01:05:13.251 --> 01:05:16.640
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness and neuroticism and men</v>
<v Speaker 1>were more emotionally stable,</v>

1028
01:05:16.641 --> 01:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>more dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more rural,</v>

1029
01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more vigilant.</v>

1030
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one last thing.</v>

1031
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.083
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1032
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:34.670
<v Speaker 1>This is something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do men and women differ in the way</v>

1033
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:36.760
<v Speaker 1>they evaluate mates?</v>

1034
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the study.</v>

1035
01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.640
<v Speaker 1>More than a thousand respondents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily female,</v>

1036
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.140
<v Speaker 1>what they looked at was how much each</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1037
01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:50.990
<v Speaker 1>how much prestige each person had in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their occupation.</v>

1038
01:05:50.991 --> 01:05:53.300
<v Speaker 1>So kind of where they were situated in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy,</v>

1039
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:56.150
<v Speaker 1>what their income was in education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're all markers,</v>

1040
01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:59.930
<v Speaker 1>they're all pretty decent markers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>socio economic status,</v>

1041
01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>or they're pretty decent markers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>

1042
01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they looked at how many</v>

1043
01:06:05.031 --> 01:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>partners each person had number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime partners and number of</v>

1044
01:06:09.141 --> 01:06:12.000
<v Speaker 1>preceding year or sexual partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1045
01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.530
<v Speaker 1>lifetime occurrence of simultaneous</v>
<v Speaker 1>partners.</v>

1046
01:06:14.531 --> 01:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>So that was someone who was in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

1047
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:20.360
<v Speaker 1>a sexual relationship with more than one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person at the same time and lifetime</v>

1048
01:06:20.361 --> 01:06:25.361
<v Speaker 1>frequency of simultaneous partners from</v>
<v Speaker 1>one very seldom or never to five very</v>

1049
01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:28.730
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's their assumption,</v>

1050
01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:33.820
<v Speaker 1>the number of partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a member of sex a acquires is an index</v>

1051
01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:38.390
<v Speaker 1>of how often this individual is chosen</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the other sex.</v>

1052
01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just a definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an indication of reproductive</v>

1053
01:06:42.831 --> 01:06:45.920
<v Speaker 1>fitness as judged by members of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite sex</v>

1054
01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Male criteria</v>

1055
01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:56.430
<v Speaker 1>for women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between their fertility</v>

1056
01:06:56.431 --> 01:06:59.580
<v Speaker 1>rates and the number of partners in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous year was 0.94</v>

1057
01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:05.260
<v Speaker 1>so that's basically markers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological youth and also markers of</v>

1058
01:07:05.261 --> 01:07:09.400
<v Speaker 1>biological health like symmetry or waist</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hip ratio,</v>

1059
01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:11.920
<v Speaker 1>which actually tends to be correlated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with reproductive,</v>

1060
01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:17.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fitness because women with lower waist</v>

1061
01:07:18.311 --> 01:07:22.870
<v Speaker 1>to hip ratios are generally healthier</v>
<v Speaker 1>because especially in youth,</v>

1062
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:28.300
<v Speaker 1>the acquisition of abdominal fat is</v>
<v Speaker 1>often an indicator of subpar physical</v>

1063
01:07:28.301 --> 01:07:31.090
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between the fertility</v>

1064
01:07:31.091 --> 01:07:35.290
<v Speaker 1>rate and the number of partners in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous year is 0.94 that's all of it,</v>

1065
01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never see a correlation to 0.94</v>

1066
01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:43.900
<v Speaker 1>anywhere ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Males choose fertility indicators,</v>

1067
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:46.630
<v Speaker 1>beauty waist to hip ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youthful appearance,</v>

1068
01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:51.580
<v Speaker 1>neon naughtiness facial features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Nia naughtiness beans like a infant.</v>

1069
01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:56.790
<v Speaker 1>So one of the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the markers of feminine beauty is</v>

1070
01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:01.990
<v Speaker 1>a face that has small childlike</v>
<v Speaker 1>features,</v>

1071
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:08.360
<v Speaker 1>female criteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all respondents.</v>

1072
01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:12.320
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between socioeconomic</v>
<v Speaker 1>status and frequency of simultaneous</v>

1073
01:08:12.321 --> 01:08:14.060
<v Speaker 1>partners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For men it's 0.5.</v>

1074
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:17.030
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the status of the man man,</v>

1075
01:08:17.031 --> 01:08:19.940
<v Speaker 1>the more likely he has simultaneous</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual partners,</v>

1076
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:22.760
<v Speaker 1>so it means he's going out with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually at the same time.</v>

1077
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:28.400
<v Speaker 1>For men it's 0.49.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Women it's zero age 30 and over.</v>

1078
01:08:28.401 --> 01:08:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Correlation between socioeconomic status</v>
<v Speaker 1>and frequency of simultaneous partners.</v>

1079
01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>For men it's 0.8.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Women it's zero</v>

1080
01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:42.690
<v Speaker 1>age 30 to 39 the correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic status for women and</v>

1081
01:08:42.691 --> 01:08:44.400
<v Speaker 1>frequency of Simile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tineas partners.</v>

1082
01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:47.880
<v Speaker 1>For men it's 0.92 that's a very small</v>
<v Speaker 1>end though.</v>

1083
01:08:48.150 --> 01:08:49.620
<v Speaker 1>For Women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 0.11</v>

1084
01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:54.240
<v Speaker 1>female criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For men,</v>

1085
01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:58.020
<v Speaker 1>it might reflect the tendency on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of females to choose high status</v>

1086
01:08:58.021 --> 01:09:00.660
<v Speaker 1>partners during their own pre peak</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive years.</v>

1087
01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:04.110
<v Speaker 1>This might account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for the strong relationship</v>

1088
01:09:04.111 --> 01:09:09.111
<v Speaker 1>founded men between the age of 30 and 39</v>
<v Speaker 1>women who typically prefer men three to</v>

1089
01:09:09.871 --> 01:09:12.960
<v Speaker 1>eight years older than they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would then be in there may mid to late</v>

1090
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.170
<v Speaker 1>twenties a time when fecundability</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough sensitivity to male resources is</v>

1091
01:09:16.171 --> 01:09:17.004
<v Speaker 1>at its peak</v>

1092
01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.960
<v Speaker 1>supporting evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that,</v>

1093
01:09:22.961 --> 01:09:25.330
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that women pick men for</v>

1094
01:09:25.331 --> 01:09:28.250
<v Speaker 1>the socioeconomic status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that women pick men for the or</v>

1095
01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:32.680
<v Speaker 1>ability to climb the status hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we forced women in an experiment</v>

1096
01:09:32.681 --> 01:09:35.530
<v Speaker 1>that we never published to choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>between those two things.</v>

1097
01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Wealth versus ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women overwhelmingly chose the</v>

1098
01:09:39.131 --> 01:09:41.470
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just use wealth as a marker of</v>

1099
01:09:41.471 --> 01:09:42.420
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1100
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:48.070
<v Speaker 1>It was an honors thesis and often honors</v>
<v Speaker 1>thesis,</v>

1101
01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:51.430
<v Speaker 1>even if they're publishable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drift into the thing all due next month</v>

1102
01:09:51.431 --> 01:09:54.310
<v Speaker 1>and then they stay there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cause it's a hard,</v>

1103
01:09:54.311 --> 01:09:58.270
<v Speaker 1>it's actually quite hard to turn an</v>
<v Speaker 1>honors thesis into a publishable paper</v>

1104
01:09:58.271 --> 01:10:01.720
<v Speaker 1>and if there isn't some single person</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving that forward,</v>

1105
01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.250
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to happen.</v>

1106
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.530
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the only reason.</v>

1107
01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Trevor's parental investment model</v>

1108
01:10:10.451 --> 01:10:13.420
<v Speaker 1>contends that women are more likely than</v>
<v Speaker 1>men to seek a mate who possesses</v>

1109
01:10:13.421 --> 01:10:16.870
<v Speaker 1>nonphysical characteristics that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximize their survival or reproductive</v>

1110
01:10:16.871 --> 01:10:20.110
<v Speaker 1>prospects of their offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're examining in a Meta analysis</v>

1111
01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:25.111
<v Speaker 1>of mate selection research as pre</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted women accorded more weight</v>

1112
01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:29.560
<v Speaker 1>than men to socioeconomic status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambitiousness character and intelligence</v>

1113
01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:33.940
<v Speaker 1>and the larger differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Largest Jeff gender differences were</v>

1114
01:10:33.941 --> 01:10:38.860
<v Speaker 1>observed for cues to resource equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquisition status and ambitiousness.</v>

1115
01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:42.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll also as predicted gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>preferences were not found in</v>

1116
01:10:42.401 --> 01:10:45.640
<v Speaker 1>preferences for characteristics</v>
<v Speaker 1>unrelated to progeny survival,</v>

1117
01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:48.520
<v Speaker 1>like sense of humor in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality</v>

1118
01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:51.750
<v Speaker 1>were valid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparisons can be made.</v>

1119
01:10:51.751 --> 01:10:54.390
<v Speaker 1>The findings were generally invariant</v>
<v Speaker 1>across generations,</v>

1120
01:10:54.391 --> 01:10:56.100
<v Speaker 1>cultures and research paradigms.</v>

1121
01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what do you think of that?</v>

1122
01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.113
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1123
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:12.440
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

1124
01:11:25.450 --> 01:11:28.600
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that it strongly</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates is that men and women value</v>

1125
01:11:28.601 --> 01:11:33.601
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's worth thinking about because</v>

1126
01:11:33.761 --> 01:11:36.370
<v Speaker 1>the hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is especially strongly</v>

1127
01:11:36.371 --> 01:11:40.960
<v Speaker 1>held among people who are very young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the differences are culture and</v>

1128
01:11:40.961 --> 01:11:43.870
<v Speaker 1>the life cultural and the life course is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

1129
01:11:44.710 --> 01:11:48.100
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that I don't think there's any</v>

1130
01:11:48.101 --> 01:11:51.970
<v Speaker 1>evidence that that's the case at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of experience dealing,</v>

1131
01:11:51.971 --> 01:11:53.800
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with large law firms,</v>

1132
01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:56.680
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>large law firms,</v>

1133
01:11:56.950 --> 01:12:00.520
<v Speaker 1>they're very competitive fee and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are partners are making a</v>

1134
01:12:00.521 --> 01:12:03.460
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would be generally in excess of</v>

1135
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:07.600
<v Speaker 1>300 $400,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in order to do that,</v>

1136
01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:11.890
<v Speaker 1>they have to go through virtual</v>
<v Speaker 1>enslavement during their internship.</v>

1137
01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not called an internship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called an Arctic there articling</v>

1138
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:19.120
<v Speaker 1>and then they have to be on call 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a week.</v>

1139
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:23.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that they lose all their</v>

1140
01:12:23.291 --> 01:12:25.690
<v Speaker 1>women in their thirties they can't keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1141
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:31.390
<v Speaker 1>And it's not because they don't try</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they try and the reason they try</v>

1142
01:12:31.391 --> 01:12:35.590
<v Speaker 1>is that there just aren't that many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are exceptionally able.</v>

1143
01:12:35.591 --> 01:12:39.400
<v Speaker 1>And so the law firms are trying to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single person they possibly can.</v>

1144
01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Who's exceptionally able because those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people produce profits for the law firm.</v>

1145
01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:48.040
<v Speaker 1>It's just in their best interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the women all quit and their</v>

1146
01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:50.380
<v Speaker 1>thirties</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1147
01:12:50.381 --> 01:12:52.180
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1148
01:12:52.181 --> 01:12:53.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first reason is,</v>

1149
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:58.300
<v Speaker 1>is that a woman who's high in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic ladder is going to pick a</v>

1150
01:12:58.301 --> 01:13:00.220
<v Speaker 1>man who's hiring the socioeconomic</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladder.</v>

1151
01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.370
<v Speaker 1>She's gonna marry across or up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the data show.</v>

1152
01:13:03.371 --> 01:13:08.371
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that most female</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential law partners in their early</v>

1153
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:11.110
<v Speaker 1>thirties are married to someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a fair bit of money.</v>

1154
01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:15.430
<v Speaker 1>So the absolute magnitude of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>income is no longer as relevant as it</v>

1155
01:13:15.431 --> 01:13:18.970
<v Speaker 1>would be if they were single.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also one of the factors by the way,</v>

1156
01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:23.950
<v Speaker 1>that's contributing to the polarization</v>
<v Speaker 1>of society and to those who have a lot</v>

1157
01:13:23.951 --> 01:13:27.280
<v Speaker 1>of money in and those who have none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens is that men who are</v>

1158
01:13:27.281 --> 01:13:31.150
<v Speaker 1>rich will marry women who are poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but women who are rich will not marry</v>

1159
01:13:31.151 --> 01:13:34.510
<v Speaker 1>men who are poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens across time is that</v>

1160
01:13:34.511 --> 01:13:37.810
<v Speaker 1>sort of grinds its way through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is that all the rich women are</v>

1161
01:13:37.811 --> 01:13:40.690
<v Speaker 1>with rich men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that increases the probability that</v>

1162
01:13:40.691 --> 01:13:43.300
<v Speaker 1>wealth is going to pool in the hands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer and fewer people.</v>

1163
01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.630
<v Speaker 1>What the women seem to come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the women seem to</v>

1164
01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.450
<v Speaker 1>realize or</v>

1165
01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.460
<v Speaker 1>conclude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's two things.</v>

1166
01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.810
<v Speaker 1>One is that it's just not that much fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work for 80 hours a week.</v>

1167
01:13:59.650 --> 01:14:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

1168
01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:03.460
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to have a life outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of work,</v>

1169
01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:06.130
<v Speaker 1>that's not the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might ask,</v>

1170
01:14:06.131 --> 01:14:08.470
<v Speaker 1>well why would anyone work 80 hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>week?</v>

1171
01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not why some women won't obviously,</v>

1172
01:14:11.801 --> 01:14:12.850
<v Speaker 1>why would you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1173
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:16.030
<v Speaker 1>the answer is well there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>status and there's a lot of money</v>

1174
01:14:16.031 --> 01:14:19.000
<v Speaker 1>associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that status is more</v>

1175
01:14:19.001 --> 01:14:22.840
<v Speaker 1>important to men than it is for women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's individually true and</v>

1176
01:14:22.841 --> 01:14:27.760
<v Speaker 1>also genetically true because for men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>status is associated with how attractive</v>

1177
01:14:27.761 --> 01:14:31.030
<v Speaker 1>they are to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas for women status,</v>

1178
01:14:31.031 --> 01:14:34.420
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic status has nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with how attractive they are to men.</v>

1179
01:14:34.421 --> 01:14:35.890
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything,</v>

1180
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:40.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you find for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that as women are</v>

1181
01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:43.210
<v Speaker 1>segregated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1182
01:14:43.211 --> 01:14:45.680
<v Speaker 1>higher and higher up the Iq</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

1183
01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:48.310
<v Speaker 1>the probability that they'll get married</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes lower and lower.</v>

1184
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:51.010
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder.</v>

1185
01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you're at the 95th percentile of</v>

1186
01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:56.740
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and you're going to marry a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross and up,</v>

1187
01:14:57.010 --> 01:14:59.170
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already limited to one in 20</v>

1188
01:14:59.171 --> 01:15:02.650
<v Speaker 1>people in just as it just maintain the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same level.</v>

1189
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:05.020
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're very intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very educated,</v>

1190
01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.870
<v Speaker 1>and you also have a very high status job</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a woman,</v>

1191
01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:10.600
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bloody intimidating to most men.</v>

1192
01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:12.790
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to</v>

1193
01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:13.830
<v Speaker 1>choose from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1194
01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:16.450
<v Speaker 1>a hot spot in the hierarchy lower than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you is very low.</v>

1195
01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:19.090
<v Speaker 1>You're just not going to be attracted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person.</v>

1196
01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.660
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens to women who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptionally intelligent is that the</v>

1197
01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:26.830
<v Speaker 1>pool of acceptable mating partners</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to become vanishingly small.</v>

1198
01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:32.400
<v Speaker 1>So that combined with the propensity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>women to judge 85% of men in online</v>

1199
01:15:33.191 --> 01:15:37.000
<v Speaker 1>dating services as less attractive than</v>
<v Speaker 1>average,</v>

1200
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.420
<v Speaker 1>makes it that much more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1201
01:15:40.421 --> 01:15:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1202
01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.400
<v Speaker 1>all the prejudice is clearly not on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of women.</v>

1203
01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:48.940
<v Speaker 1>And by no means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you look at male attitudes</v>

1204
01:15:48.941 --> 01:15:52.570
<v Speaker 1>towards women in large online dating</v>
<v Speaker 1>site studies,</v>

1205
01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:57.810
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that their preference for</v>
<v Speaker 1>body configuration is 21 years old.</v>

1206
01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.110
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't change as the males</v>
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

1207
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:06.250
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the selection criteria on both the male</v>

1208
01:16:06.251 --> 01:16:09.850
<v Speaker 1>and the female side are extremely harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1209
01:16:18.230 --> 01:16:22.390
<v Speaker 3>so</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about that.</v>

1210
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.430
<v Speaker 3>See you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1211
01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
