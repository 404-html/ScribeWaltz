1
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.053
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apologies for the delay.</v>

3
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I hope this is all working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking questions from Patriot on </v>
<v Speaker 2>people today.</v>

5
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.120
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 841 questions ready to go.</v>

6
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 2>So hopefully I'm up to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What should teaching and research in the</v>

7
00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:47.084
<v Speaker 2>humanities look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to Grad School for literature </v>

8
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.660
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want my work to serve </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological possession.</v>

9
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>

10
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.540
<v Speaker 2>first of all is that you kind of have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>educate yourself when you go to graduate</v>

11
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you have your courses,</v>

12
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.823
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that you learn more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than about 10% of what graduate school </v>

13
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 2>can teach you by taking the courses you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to read.</v>

14
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.933
<v Speaker 2>And the mistake that most people read is</v>
<v Speaker 2>make is that they only read what's been </v>

15
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 2>published in the last five or six years </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their own narrow field.</v>

16
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 2>And that's increasingly a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

17
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.030
<v Speaker 2>the libraries are full of classic books </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say take your field,</v>

18
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.063
<v Speaker 2>go back to the beginning of the field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least read the people who wrote the </v>

19
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:48.234
<v Speaker 2>classic works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring yourself up to date and then </v>

20
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 2>familiarize yourself with as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

21
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.703
<v Speaker 2>as much history of art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much history of literature and </v>

22
00:01:57.961 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 2>literature as you can possibly manage.</v>

23
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 2>You want to learn as much as you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>about everything.</v>

24
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 2>I would also say you have to ally that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a certain degree of specialization.</v>

25
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 2>You have to pick one topic and really </v>
<v Speaker 2>become expert at it,</v>

26
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 2>but it'll serve as a doorway to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everything's connected.</v>

27
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 2>It'll serve as a doorway to what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind it,</v>

28
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 2>so you focus on one thing and read as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much as you can on that.</v>

29
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 2>That's your specific discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then outside of that,</v>

30
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 2>read as widely as you possibly could </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage.</v>

31
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 2>The other thing I would really </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommend,</v>

32
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 2>and this is also true if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>

33
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:29.994
<v Speaker 2>is it isn't enough to read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also have to write and if you're </v>

34
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 2>going to go to graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should write every day.</v>

35
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a good idea for anyone who wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop themselves intellectually,</v>

36
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 2>but even half an hour a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

37
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 2>that's 180 hours a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of thinking because writing</v>

38
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 2>is thinking and you should be writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>out your understanding of what you wrote</v>

39
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.593
<v Speaker 2>or what you read and the questions you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have about it and trying to formulate </v>

40
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 2>what you regard as clear questions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems and also clear answers.</v>

41
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of those.</v>

42
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I would say you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach graduate school.</v>

43
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

44
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Have you thought about slowing down </v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

45
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:11.014
<v Speaker 2>Are people worried about how hard you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing yourself with the countless </v>

46
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 2>commitments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

47
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:17.134
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that those people worried </v>

48
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 2>about that include,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

49
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I dunno if it's me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly my family,</v>

50
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.873
<v Speaker 2>they're worried about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm putting competent people around </v>

51
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 2>me increasingly to handle the scheduling</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the public events for example.</v>

52
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 2>And I have good agents in a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>publisher and,</v>

53
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm learning how to manage this.</v>

54
00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I think I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really interested,</v>

55
00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:44.084
<v Speaker 2>I suppose in slowing down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it has been a bit much in the </v>

56
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.953
<v Speaker 2>last year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

57
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.363
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do better in some ways when I'm </v>

58
00:03:51.321 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 2>working flat out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

59
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.933
<v Speaker 2>if my health was good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better than it was by a large </v>

60
00:03:59.121 --> 00:04:01.790
<v Speaker 2>margin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's still getting better.</v>

61
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.140
<v Speaker 2>If my health was good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

62
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.040
<v Speaker 2>none of this would be an overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge,</v>

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying to do everything I can to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put my health in order and many,</v>

64
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:16.001
<v Speaker 2>many things have been fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

65
00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:17.204
<v Speaker 2>I thought about slowing down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've decided against it I guess is </v>

66
00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:23.270
<v Speaker 2>really the final answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>

67
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:26.540
<v Speaker 2>You know there are times in your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's not time to slow down,</v>

68
00:04:26.541 --> 00:04:27.374
<v Speaker 2>it's time to</v>

69
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 2>become more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

70
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 2>You can become so efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:33.904
<v Speaker 2>you end up doing things in five minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would otherwise take you a week </v>

72
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 2>might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might seem like an exaggeration,</v>

73
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I suppose it is to some degree,</v>

74
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that much of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>exaggeration.</v>

75
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.403
<v Speaker 2>So as you take on more responsibilities </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you determine that you're going to </v>

76
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:49.084
<v Speaker 2>become more efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the responsibility pushes the </v>

77
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 2>efficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

78
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.580
<v Speaker 2>what do they say too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's time enough to sleep when you're</v>

79
00:04:58.581 --> 00:04:59.414
<v Speaker 2>in the grave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many who respect your work feel your </v>

80
00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:12.120
<v Speaker 2>tweets are often impulsive or even </v>
<v Speaker 2>expedient.</v>

81
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In certain interactions,</v>

82
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.090
<v Speaker 2>would you consider a change in the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>you tweet?</v>

83
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.673
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been considering that for a very </v>

84
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:24.084
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I did in the last </v>

85
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which that I think was productive.</v>

86
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Twitter's a hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard medium to manage because it rewards</v>

87
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:36.891
<v Speaker 2>impulsivity and I have somewhat of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>temper and I suspect that it's maybe I'm</v>

88
00:05:41.281 --> 00:05:44.070
<v Speaker 2>more susceptible to being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

89
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.070
<v Speaker 2>to being tempted to respond in a</v>

90
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.353
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

91
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.093
<v Speaker 2>too forceful manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm more tempted by that than I </v>

92
00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:57.120
<v Speaker 2>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

93
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.503
<v Speaker 2>but twitter is real useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it does keep me updated with </v>

94
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 2>regards to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ongoing,</v>

95
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:05.354
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>war that's raging at the bottom of our </v>

96
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:12.101
<v Speaker 2>culture and it doesn't enable me to stay</v>
<v Speaker 2>in contact with people,</v>

97
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 2>at least to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a great way of communicating,</v>

98
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>

99
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 2>but at least in principle important </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

100
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.263
<v Speaker 2>And also to let people know about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing on youtube and with the tours </v>

101
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>

102
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.033
<v Speaker 2>People seem to</v>
<v Speaker 2>respond positively to those sorts of </v>

103
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:35.774
<v Speaker 2>notifications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I did do in the last month was </v>

104
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 2>to find people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted out one day,</v>

105
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:42.794
<v Speaker 2>I asked people to send me the twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>handles of organizations or individuals </v>

106
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 2>who were reporting on positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>developments in a credible and realistic</v>

107
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.123
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human progress.org seems to be doing </v>

108
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:54.734
<v Speaker 2>that really well.</v>

109
00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I thought it would be good to tilt my </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter feed toward or my twitter,</v>

110
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.603
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my actions towards things that are </v>

111
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.190
<v Speaker 2>positive and also true as much as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

112
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 2>And so I've started doing that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last month.</v>

113
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel somewhat of an obligation to,</v>

114
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.670
<v Speaker 2>if I'm being discussed publicly by </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists or,</v>

115
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.083
<v Speaker 2>or other professors and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>misrepresent me or misrepresent the </v>

116
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:32.690
<v Speaker 2>ideas that they're purporting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss,</v>

117
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 2>then I feel like I have a moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligation to,</v>

118
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.813
<v Speaker 2>I suppose one is to defend myself I </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppose and certainly to object to the </v>

119
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 2>miss utilization of ideas by my fellow </v>
<v Speaker 2>academics.</v>

120
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.173
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's reasonable or </v>

121
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:56.504
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy to figure out in a </v>

122
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:00.860
<v Speaker 2>situation like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much you shut up,</v>

123
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 2>how much you stay patient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much you push back,</v>

124
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 2>how much you fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

125
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 2>how firmly you respond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not to use wet</v>

126
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.900
<v Speaker 2>mean the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to outline in a,</v>

127
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.040
<v Speaker 2>in my book</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 rules for life.</v>

128
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:25.041
<v Speaker 2>There's a chapter called</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't let your children do anything that</v>

129
00:08:25.321 --> 00:08:26.154
<v Speaker 2>makes you dislike them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a philosophy of discipline </v>

130
00:08:27.781 --> 00:08:31.950
<v Speaker 2>in there and it really has two </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensions,</v>

131
00:08:31.951 --> 00:08:33.990
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or two.</v>

132
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.180
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at the juncture of two ideas.</v>

133
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.283
<v Speaker 2>One idea is that you don't want to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>any more rules that necessary because </v>

134
00:08:41.281 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 2>you get tangled up in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So minimum necessary rule.</v>

135
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:44.984
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good guideline for setting </v>
<v Speaker 2>up any structure even in dealing with </v>

136
00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:51.684
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you're going to have rules </v>

137
00:08:54.631 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 2>you have to them because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not rules.</v>

138
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.800
<v Speaker 2>And so how do you enforce them with </v>
<v Speaker 2>minimal necessary force and some of that</v>

139
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 2>has to be played with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

140
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 2>and experimented with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know what minimal force is.</v>

141
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.313
<v Speaker 2>Those are really good principles and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to govern myself by them in my </v>

142
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 2>twitter behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

143
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.940
<v Speaker 2>and I hope that that successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

144
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when I've gone after people I </v>

145
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.620
<v Speaker 2>went to after a couple of journalists in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada last year who</v>

146
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.303
<v Speaker 2>wrote I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would regard as scurrilous and </v>

147
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 2>incompetent articles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad combination.</v>

148
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:38.703
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

149
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of a harsh exchange I would </v>

150
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't clear that it was the wrong</v>

151
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:49.170
<v Speaker 2>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

152
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.040
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to know how much you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>skirt the ragged edge of disaster if you</v>

153
00:09:56.041 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 2>want to do things right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

154
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:01.284
<v Speaker 2>I am changing the way I tweet because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make it the bulk of it </v>

155
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.023
<v Speaker 2>informative and positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I should say something about </v>

156
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:09.121
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

157
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:12.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of really good things </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in the world.</v>

158
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.433
<v Speaker 2>So we have poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute poverty between the year 2000 </v>

159
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:23.370
<v Speaker 2>and 2012 which was three years ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the UN had hoped would happen.</v>

160
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cynics say,</v>

161
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:30.351
<v Speaker 2>well you have absolute poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the cutoff was kind of arbitrary.</v>

162
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.660
<v Speaker 2>It was a dollar 90 a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

163
00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:36.150
<v Speaker 2>which obviously is quite low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

164
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.830
<v Speaker 2>so it's not a real transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a real transformation.</v>

165
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Some number had to be picked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent that absolute poverty.</v>

166
00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:51.541
<v Speaker 2>And I don't suspect the UN erred on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of capitalist over optimism.</v>

167
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.073
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of thousands of people are </v>

168
00:10:57.041 --> 00:10:59.170
<v Speaker 2>being connected to the power grid every </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

169
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Fresh water's available,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to fewer and fewer people,</v>

170
00:11:02.441 --> 00:11:04.930
<v Speaker 2>but to more and more people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's happening extremely rapid,</v>

171
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.003
<v Speaker 2>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No starvation in India and China is a </v>

172
00:11:08.651 --> 00:11:11.320
<v Speaker 2>thing completely of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never hear about that.</v>

173
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's pretty much the case for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world except now.</v>

174
00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:17.950
<v Speaker 2>And then for political reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

175
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's got a cell phone or an oil </v>

176
00:11:20.871 --> 00:11:21.704
<v Speaker 2>on anybody who doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to have one in the next 10 </v>

177
00:11:23.201 --> 00:11:26.650
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that puts in people's hands,</v>

178
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.703
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a degree of communication and access </v>

179
00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:34.450
<v Speaker 2>that would have been absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>incomprehensible even 15 years ago.</v>

180
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.603
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that the reason too that </v>

181
00:11:40.541 --> 00:11:41.374
<v Speaker 2>I changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to me that it was worthwhile </v>

182
00:11:43.721 --> 00:11:44.554
<v Speaker 2>to change the way that I was using </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter because all these good things </v>

183
00:11:48.251 --> 00:11:49.084
<v Speaker 2>are happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just concentrating on this </v>

184
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.153
<v Speaker 2>polarization process that seems to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>gripped us in the West seems </v>

185
00:11:58.401 --> 00:11:59.234
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive given all those good </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are going on in the </v>

186
00:12:01.281 --> 00:12:04.970
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't make what's going on in</v>

187
00:12:04.971 --> 00:12:07.460
<v Speaker 2>the west with regards to political </v>
<v Speaker 2>polarization,</v>

188
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.893
<v Speaker 2>trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does set it inside a much more </v>

189
00:12:11.511 --> 00:12:14.210
<v Speaker 2>positive context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's something to keep in mind.</v>

190
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:30.130
<v Speaker 2>What if a client's need for autonomy </v>
<v Speaker 2>slash identity in therapy,</v>

191
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.600
<v Speaker 2>they would prefer that which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful and therefore under the under</v>

192
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:36.640
<v Speaker 2>their control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this not unhealthy?</v>

193
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure how to meet what to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make of that question.</v>

194
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's try.</v>

195
00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:46.540
<v Speaker 2>What if a client's need for autonomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity in therapy?</v>

196
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.943
<v Speaker 2>That's paramount mean again in my book </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in Chapter Nine assume the person </v>

197
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:57.004
<v Speaker 2>that you're listening to know something </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have so that you can learn </v>

198
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:01.054
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe because you need to learn </v>

199
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:03.370
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause like,</v>

200
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:04.204
<v Speaker 2>what do you know in therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that if you're a good </v>

201
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:11.044
<v Speaker 2>therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to take responsibility for the </v>

202
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:17.470
<v Speaker 2>decisions that your clients make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't take that decision making</v>

203
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:22.471
<v Speaker 2>onto yourself because you have to adopt </v>
<v Speaker 2>a position of radical ignorance.</v>

204
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.600
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person is sitting across from you.</v>

205
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.000
<v Speaker 2>And this is the true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true of every person.</v>

206
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:28.834
<v Speaker 2>You know a person is sitting across from</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and they don't understand </v>

207
00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:36.640
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really don't understand them.</v>

208
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:42.550
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a therapist or maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a friend or a partner for that</v>

209
00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:45.940
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person wants help and so something's</v>

210
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:50.941
<v Speaker 2>wrong as far as they're concerned and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be some way to fix it.</v>

211
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.043
<v Speaker 2>And that's your initial starting place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say both of you have to kind of </v>

212
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:58.930
<v Speaker 2>agree on that in a psychotherapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

213
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know what's wrong.</v>

214
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.713
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know something's wrong because the </v>

215
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:08.680
<v Speaker 2>person is upset enough to come and seek </v>
<v Speaker 2>counseling.</v>

216
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.830
<v Speaker 2>So they want to set their life right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have no idea what's wrong.</v>

217
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:15.350
<v Speaker 2>You don't know anything about the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think or what,</v>

218
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.300
<v Speaker 2>what they value or what their past is </v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

219
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.970
<v Speaker 2>or how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what they're,</v>

220
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.470
<v Speaker 2>what they're like physiologically or </v>
<v Speaker 2>what their temperament is like are,</v>

221
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.173
<v Speaker 2>or what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how things are going in their </v>

222
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:28.990
<v Speaker 2>relationships are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what their career is like.</v>

223
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:29.853
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things you don't know about that </v>

224
00:14:30.881 --> 00:14:31.451
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

225
00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:34.120
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's intersectionality gone mad.</v>

226
00:14:34.121 --> 00:14:34.954
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you got to listen and let the </v>

227
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:44.281
<v Speaker 2>person tell you what it is that's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>as if you don't know,</v>

228
00:14:45.011 --> 00:14:46.670
<v Speaker 2>cause you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

229
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:47.913
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to ask questions of </v>

230
00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:51.190
<v Speaker 2>clarification and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you always have to remember,</v>

231
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.213
<v Speaker 2>not only do you not know what's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the person doesn't know what's </v>

232
00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

233
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.050
<v Speaker 2>It's highly probable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know that something's wrong,</v>

234
00:14:57.051 --> 00:14:57.884
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know exactly what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they certainly don't know what </v>

235
00:14:59.121 --> 00:14:59.954
<v Speaker 2>caused it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you gotta listen radically and </v>

236
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:03.944
<v Speaker 2>clarify now ask questions and make sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not confused so that you do </v>

237
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:07.244
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you can help the person start </v>

238
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:10.670
<v Speaker 2>to understand what they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

239
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or thinking about,</v>

240
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 2>cause talking in thinking are very much </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

241
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.293
<v Speaker 2>And then then well maybe you get some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of what's wrong and maybe some </v>

242
00:15:21.741 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 2>sense of how it came about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows how long that'll take.</v>

243
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 2>And then the next thing you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out is,</v>

244
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:30.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would a solution look like?</v>

245
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Like even hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does the person want?</v>

246
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.540
<v Speaker 2>And do they know what they want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they don't know what they want,</v>

247
00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:37.374
<v Speaker 2>then how can you help them figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they want and how do you help them </v>

248
00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:43.850
<v Speaker 2>figure out what they need and how do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>help them admit to that and all of that.</v>

249
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.310
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a boat load of listening </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

250
00:15:46.311 --> 00:15:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

251
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.720
<v Speaker 2>and it's the same in every relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have.</v>

252
00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:52.970
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to foster that person's</v>
<v Speaker 2>development,</v>

253
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.900
<v Speaker 2>he want to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what's wrong in their lives?</v>

254
00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.840
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have to figure that out because</v>

255
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:00.674
<v Speaker 2>they're the ones that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the ones that will have to bear </v>

256
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:03.614
<v Speaker 2>the responsibility for the decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't want to take that on to </v>

257
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:07.071
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

258
00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:07.904
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to tell you what to do </v>

259
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:09.014
<v Speaker 2>because I don't know what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we can both agree that you should </v>

260
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:18.980
<v Speaker 2>move toward what's better for you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully for the people around you.</v>

261
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Cause we would include that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of better,</v>

262
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because otherwise it's not sustainable.</v>

263
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.270
<v Speaker 2>But we have to talk forever to find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what that is.</v>

264
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:27.104
<v Speaker 2>And you have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be very incautious to think </v>

265
00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:36.770
<v Speaker 2>that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>make decisions for someone.</v>

266
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.183
<v Speaker 2>It's an arrogant move and it's an ill </v>
<v Speaker 2>advised move and you shouldn't do it if </v>

267
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:46.730
<v Speaker 2>you're properly terrified of your errors</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

268
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.290
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

269
00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:49.124
<v Speaker 2>I'll repeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not the one that's going to have </v>

270
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:53.630
<v Speaker 2>to take responsibility for the decisions</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

271
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.860
<v Speaker 2>So it has to be left in their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

272
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:06.170
<v Speaker 2>so autonomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's everything in a clinical practice.</v>

273
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.033
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that you can't help a </v>

274
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:10.880
<v Speaker 2>person strategize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

275
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.163
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well as you're moving towards some </v>

276
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:18.710
<v Speaker 2>formulation of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

277
00:17:18.711 --> 00:17:20.840
<v Speaker 2>well here's five things that it might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

278
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 2>or here's the list of things that might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be bothering you.</v>

279
00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:24.074
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make suggestions but they can't </v>

280
00:17:27.021 --> 00:17:27.854
<v Speaker 2>be baited suggestions either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't overweight the one you hope </v>

281
00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:32.930
<v Speaker 2>they'll choose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

282
00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:33.501
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

283
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:37.640
<v Speaker 2>it's in cautious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of this I would say I learned well</v>

284
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.310
<v Speaker 2>from thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also from reading Carl Rogers,</v>

285
00:17:40.311 --> 00:17:42.170
<v Speaker 2>I'd really recommend Carl Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

286
00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:43.004
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a smart guy when it came to </v>

287
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:45.920
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can really learn a lot from,</v>

288
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.800
<v Speaker 2>and he was also smart in how we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>outlined,</v>

289
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.003
<v Speaker 2>the client's need for autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 2>development and that's the development </v>

290
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:54.240
<v Speaker 2>of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

291
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:01.803
<v Speaker 2>any update on your plans to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>providing independent classes or an </v>

292
00:18:04.211 --> 00:18:05.860
<v Speaker 2>online university?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

293
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm working with some young people right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now who are very,</v>

294
00:18:08.861 --> 00:18:10.250
<v Speaker 2>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first thing we're,</v>

295
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.640
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build modules by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks of things.</v>

296
00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.073
<v Speaker 2>Each module,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully it will stand alone because </v>

297
00:18:16.331 --> 00:18:18.970
<v Speaker 2>then we can test them instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>launching like a whole university.</v>

298
00:18:18.971 --> 00:18:19.804
<v Speaker 2>Which seems to be a crazy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make independent modules </v>

299
00:18:22.631 --> 00:18:25.690
<v Speaker 2>for different purposes and then launch </v>
<v Speaker 2>them probably as quiet,</v>

300
00:18:25.691 --> 00:18:26.590
<v Speaker 2>shy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent.</v>

301
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

302
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Products let's say to see if there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>demand for them.</v>

303
00:18:30.341 --> 00:18:33.070
<v Speaker 2>So the one we're working right now on </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

304
00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:34.390
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to say too much about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

305
00:18:34.391 --> 00:18:39.391
<v Speaker 2>is a competitive writing module where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be able to look at paragraphs and</v>

306
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.650
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

307
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Paragraphs that other people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>written.</v>

308
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

309
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.200
<v Speaker 2>Of a variety of sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

310
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'll tell you about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet her weight.</v>

311
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:49.693
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to write a competitive </v>

312
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.740
<v Speaker 2>writing module and because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>big problems,</v>

313
00:18:54.741 --> 00:18:55.574
<v Speaker 2>the biggest problems that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>solved for any online university is how </v>

314
00:18:57.861 --> 00:18:58.694
<v Speaker 2>do you teach people to write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't want the university </v>

315
00:19:00.171 --> 00:19:02.780
<v Speaker 2>just to be lectures and multiple choice </v>
<v Speaker 2>tests.</v>

316
00:19:02.781 --> 00:19:07.781
<v Speaker 2>Even though that could be done with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree of reasonable competence.</v>

317
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Mostly what you want when you educate </v>
<v Speaker 2>people as to educate them,</v>

318
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:17.770
<v Speaker 2>not so much into like factual knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>but intellectual skill.</v>

319
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.820
<v Speaker 2>They have to be able to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll need a speaking module and they</v>

320
00:19:21.821 --> 00:19:22.654
<v Speaker 2>have to be able to think and we'll have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to develop exercises that are relevant </v>

321
00:19:27.281 --> 00:19:29.530
<v Speaker 2>to critical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Writing is a big part of that.</v>

322
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

323
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:32.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

324
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:33.663
<v Speaker 2>and they have to be able to read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those are the big problems to </v>

325
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:40.050
<v Speaker 2>solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the other problem for an online</v>

326
00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:40.884
<v Speaker 2>university is creditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously we've got some ideas about </v>

327
00:19:43.171 --> 00:19:46.440
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also what you do with regards to the</v>

328
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:47.274
<v Speaker 2>social element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's a huge part of </v>

329
00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:49.344
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to develop an intellectual peer </v>

330
00:19:51.421 --> 00:19:52.530
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

331
00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:55.743
<v Speaker 2>That's really an important part in yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be easy to replace </v>

332
00:19:57.911 --> 00:19:59.890
<v Speaker 2>that online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

333
00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:00.813
<v Speaker 2>the relationships that people make in </v>
<v Speaker 2>college often last while they can last </v>

334
00:20:04.091 --> 00:20:07.060
<v Speaker 2>for decades or maybe they can last a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetime for that matter.</v>

335
00:20:07.061 --> 00:20:07.894
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

336
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:08.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

337
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.433
<v Speaker 2>it's a place where you catalyze your </v>
<v Speaker 2>adult identity and the peers that you </v>

338
00:20:12.441 --> 00:20:15.220
<v Speaker 2>pick are a big part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

339
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.200
<v Speaker 2>of course some of the peers that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick when you go to university should be</v>

340
00:20:18.201 --> 00:20:20.800
<v Speaker 2>the great people of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

341
00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

342
00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.720
<v Speaker 2>that's really what university is for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to make them in some sense your peers</v>

343
00:20:25.721 --> 00:20:26.261
<v Speaker 2>know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

344
00:20:26.261 --> 00:20:27.094
<v Speaker 2>that's pushing it because you'll have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a lot of work before they become </v>

345
00:20:29.021 --> 00:20:32.210
<v Speaker 2>peers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

346
00:20:32.211 --> 00:20:33.760
<v Speaker 2>we're definitely working on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

347
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.590
<v Speaker 2>the part of the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I'm,</v>

348
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

349
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.120
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what's the problem?</v>

350
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.263
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

351
00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

352
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.493
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing enough other things at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment so that finding the time to do </v>

353
00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:50.800
<v Speaker 2>this credibly in addition is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>major challenges.</v>

354
00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:51.973
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

355
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:57.763
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I married young and have had only one </v>

356
00:20:59.421 --> 00:21:00.254
<v Speaker 2>sexual partner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I desire a variety but value of my </v>

357
00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:06.470
<v Speaker 2>marriage and will not cheat any insight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and overcoming this conflict.</v>

358
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.840
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

359
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.370
<v Speaker 2>I would say get the variety with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner.</v>

360
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of</v>

361
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:21.320
<v Speaker 2>games you can play to spice up your </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual life,</v>

362
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

363
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.780
<v Speaker 2>by some lingerie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like buy a hundred pieces,</v>

364
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.753
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy something sexy for your partner to </v>

365
00:21:29.991 --> 00:21:32.460
<v Speaker 2>where maybe multiple things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

366
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.100
<v Speaker 2>by some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by whatever you need that you might want</v>

367
00:21:37.101 --> 00:21:38.920
<v Speaker 2>to experiment with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

368
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.773
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to introduce that spirit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of pretend play that you had when you </v>

369
00:21:44.151 --> 00:21:44.984
<v Speaker 2>were a little kid into your sexual life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have many partners in the </v>

370
00:21:49.011 --> 00:21:49.910
<v Speaker 2>same person</v>

371
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.473
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

372
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.360
<v Speaker 2>you put some thought into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

373
00:21:55.361 --> 00:21:56.194
<v Speaker 2>I mean sex is something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sex is a domain in which expertise </v>

374
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:03.790
<v Speaker 2>can be developed just like any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>domain.</v>

375
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.103
<v Speaker 2>And some of that's play and fantasy play</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that and some of it's sexual </v>

376
00:22:10.091 --> 00:22:11.890
<v Speaker 2>technique and,</v>

377
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.393
<v Speaker 2>and I guess then the other thing I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>say is take stock of each other and see </v>

378
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.123
<v Speaker 2>if there are things that you could do in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life that would make you more </v>

379
00:22:24.461 --> 00:22:26.500
<v Speaker 2>attractive to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

380
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:28.690
<v Speaker 2>those are hard questions because no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to say,</v>

381
00:22:28.691 --> 00:22:29.524
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

382
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:34.450
<v Speaker 2>I'd be more attracted to my wife </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually if she just acted x way.</v>

383
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.860
<v Speaker 2>And the same with regards to how a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife's contemplation of her husband.</v>

384
00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:41.590
<v Speaker 2>But those are the real questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

385
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.453
<v Speaker 2>It's like if your partner isn't acting </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a manner that is sexually attractive </v>

386
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:49.503
<v Speaker 2>than either there's something wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you or there's something wrong with </v>

387
00:22:51.401 --> 00:22:52.234
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course I know people have ill </v>

388
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:55.690
<v Speaker 2>health and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about that.</v>

389
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:56.524
<v Speaker 2>But those harsh judgements that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual attraction makes are also very </v>

390
00:23:00.221 --> 00:23:04.090
<v Speaker 2>useful ways of orienting yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards proper behavior in the world.</v>

391
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:05.883
<v Speaker 2>So I would say</v>
<v Speaker 2>any insight and overcoming this </v>

392
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.180
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I desire variety,</v>

393
00:23:13.181 --> 00:23:15.190
<v Speaker 2>but I value my marriage and will not </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheat.</v>

394
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.473
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>admit to the variety that you want and </v>

395
00:23:20.681 --> 00:23:24.700
<v Speaker 2>see to what degree you can fulfill that </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the confines of the marriage.</v>

396
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.820
<v Speaker 2>It's also part of coming into contact </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the shadow.</v>

397
00:23:27.821 --> 00:23:30.370
<v Speaker 2>I would say if you want to look at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a union perspective,</v>

398
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.120
<v Speaker 2>you might have all sorts of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>desires that are,</v>

399
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 2>that part of you feels should remain </v>
<v Speaker 2>taboo and maybe they should.</v>

400
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.053
<v Speaker 2>I'm not suggesting ag absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually libertine behavior and then </v>

401
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:46.910
<v Speaker 2>with sexuality has to be regulated very </v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully,</v>

402
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.373
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to push yourself with </v>

403
00:23:51.411 --> 00:23:56.411
<v Speaker 2>some time and effort and contemplation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some admission of fantasy.</v>

404
00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:57.344
<v Speaker 2>And all of that into domains of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction that you haven't achieved </v>

405
00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:04.844
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

406
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:29.063
<v Speaker 2>Why do I know what to discuss?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Religious fundamentalism more often and </v>

407
00:24:31.621 --> 00:24:32.454
<v Speaker 2>more in depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many people consider you a religious </v>

408
00:24:34.741 --> 00:24:38.820
<v Speaker 2>apologist as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

409
00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.610
<v Speaker 2>it's okay if people considered me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious apologist.</v>

410
00:24:41.611 --> 00:24:42.444
<v Speaker 2>I am a religious apologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So an apologist is someone who makes an </v>

411
00:24:45.631 --> 00:24:46.464
<v Speaker 2>argument for something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm constantly making arguments for </v>

412
00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:53.970
<v Speaker 2>a religious perspective on life or </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious orientation towards life.</v>

413
00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an orientation that's centered in,</v>

414
00:24:58.650 --> 00:24:59.483
<v Speaker 2>in meaning and orientation that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>centered in desire for all things to </v>

415
00:25:03.811 --> 00:25:08.811
<v Speaker 2>thrive in so far as that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Desire for people to speak the truth and</v>

416
00:25:10.231 --> 00:25:13.200
<v Speaker 2>act out the truth and act </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>

417
00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.090
<v Speaker 2>act responsibly and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that there's something,</v>

418
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:20.610
<v Speaker 2>something transcendently necessary about</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

419
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.760
<v Speaker 2>And I think it is the antidote to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

420
00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.670
<v Speaker 2>that makes me a religious apologists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fundamentalists,</v>

421
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.493
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which fundamentalists you mean if you </v>

422
00:25:32.971 --> 00:25:34.650
<v Speaker 2>mean the Christian fundamentalists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

423
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.590
<v Speaker 2>I understand where they're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

424
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.113
<v Speaker 2>I think the Christian</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity is an ethical framework </v>

425
00:25:45.771 --> 00:25:49.850
<v Speaker 2>above all else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's predicated in a story about the</v>

426
00:25:49.851 --> 00:25:50.684
<v Speaker 2>way the world is constituted and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the story provides the foundation </v>

427
00:25:55.701 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 2>for that ethic and the ethic unites the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community and gives people direction.</v>

428
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:02.330
<v Speaker 2>This is a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

429
00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 2>if the story is challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the foundational stories challenged,</v>

430
00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:06.884
<v Speaker 2>which is certainly what happened as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of the rise of empirical </v>

431
00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:13.190
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the foundation for the ethic starts</v>

432
00:26:13.191 --> 00:26:14.024
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

433
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.920
<v Speaker 2>starts to shake and tremble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that threatens the ethic.</v>

434
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.100
<v Speaker 2>But the ethic is what holds people </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and gives them direction.</v>

435
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:27.390
<v Speaker 2>So you can't just lose the ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fundamentalist Christians are all</v>

436
00:26:27.391 --> 00:26:28.224
<v Speaker 2>short circuited because they know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something to the ethic and they </v>

437
00:26:32.161 --> 00:26:35.100
<v Speaker 2>understand that the foundation has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>shaken,</v>

438
00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.653
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they insist that the foundation has </v>

439
00:26:40.171 --> 00:26:43.770
<v Speaker 2>not been shaken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I that,</v>

440
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 2>so I think the way out of that is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that</v>

441
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.200
<v Speaker 2>the truth that govern ethics and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth that govern the description of the</v>

442
00:26:55.201 --> 00:26:58.440
<v Speaker 2>world as a material place are not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>

443
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.060
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>

444
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.890
<v Speaker 2>they're not of the same kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

445
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.180
<v Speaker 2>how they're related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure,</v>

446
00:27:06.181 --> 00:27:08.520
<v Speaker 2>but there's no simple one to one </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

447
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:13.550
<v Speaker 2>You can't describe the world and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately extract out in ethic.</v>

448
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.610
<v Speaker 2>It's partly because there are just too </v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways of describing the world.</v>

449
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.990
<v Speaker 2>So this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the fundamental point of difference</v>

450
00:27:21.991 --> 00:27:22.824
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell between Sam Harris </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I and hopefully what we'll discuss </v>

451
00:27:26.071 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 2>in the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

452
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:30.503
<v Speaker 2>so that's the Christian fundamentalists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't really see that there are a </v>

453
00:27:33.031 --> 00:27:35.430
<v Speaker 2>particularly threatening group as far as</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell.</v>

454
00:27:35.431 --> 00:27:36.264
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are certainly not in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ascendance by any stretch of the </v>

455
00:27:39.361 --> 00:27:41.640
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

456
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.613
<v Speaker 2>they're not involved in any particularly</v>
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible political behavior unless </v>

457
00:27:46.591 --> 00:27:47.850
<v Speaker 2>you count conservatism.</v>

458
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.620
<v Speaker 2>And it is by no means obvious that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're even holding their ground in the</v>

459
00:27:54.621 --> 00:27:56.960
<v Speaker 2>culture war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not very worried about them.</v>

460
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic fundamentalism,</v>

461
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:03.583
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know enough about it to </v>

462
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.450
<v Speaker 2>discuss it intelligently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand Islam.</v>

463
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.903
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

464
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.250
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned about.</v>

465
00:28:16.251 --> 00:28:21.050
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call compatibility with,</v>

466
00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:23.930
<v Speaker 2>with the Democratic West.</v>

467
00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

468
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:26.703
<v Speaker 2>It isn't obvious to me that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>medium to high functioning Muslim </v>

469
00:28:32.201 --> 00:28:35.200
<v Speaker 2>democracies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose turkeys the closest one,</v>

470
00:28:35.201 --> 00:28:38.500
<v Speaker 2>but Turkey's pretty soon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty shaky at the moment.</v>

471
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that the failure to separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>church and state,</v>

472
00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.573
<v Speaker 2>or even if we don't call it a failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that church and state hasn't </v>

473
00:28:48.581 --> 00:28:49.414
<v Speaker 2>been technically separated in Islam </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes it difficult to understand how </v>

474
00:28:54.191 --> 00:28:55.024
<v Speaker 2>it's possible for Islam and modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>western democratic traditions to </v>

475
00:29:00.401 --> 00:29:02.590
<v Speaker 2>coexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that can be,</v>

476
00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.670
<v Speaker 2>that gap can be bridged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

477
00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.590
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well with goodwill and let's,</v>

478
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.380
<v Speaker 2>let's hope that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

479
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.333
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean I don't think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims can live in a modern western </v>

480
00:29:15.671 --> 00:29:16.990
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are many,</v>

481
00:29:16.991 --> 00:29:20.560
<v Speaker 2>many kinds of Muslims just like there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are many kinds of Jews and Christians.</v>

482
00:29:20.561 --> 00:29:21.394
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the problem of the </v>

483
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:28.523
<v Speaker 2>current proclivity of the extreme end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim fundamentalists world to </v>

484
00:29:32.611 --> 00:29:35.940
<v Speaker 2>become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be very violent in very many ways.</v>

485
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.290
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

486
00:29:40.291 --> 00:29:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a great admirer of the Saudis to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the least.</v>

487
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't appreciate their brand of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Wahhabi Islam.</v>

488
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.953
<v Speaker 2>And I don't appreciate their exports of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that view with their petro dollars to </v>

489
00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:58.800
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

490
00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's what I have to say about </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalists.</v>

491
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson.</v>

492
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:08.800
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to listen to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience,</v>

493
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.260
<v Speaker 2>but I can't tell the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>

494
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.260
<v Speaker 2>willful blindness or genuine conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

495
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.393
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I would say about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it is quite clear that you are in </v>

496
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:18.604
<v Speaker 2>fact trying to listen to your conscience</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's probably the first thing </v>

497
00:30:21.281 --> 00:30:23.950
<v Speaker 2>that you discover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a really good question.</v>

498
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>

499
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the test and you don't want to do</v>

500
00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:34.374
<v Speaker 2>this stupidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think that you should do </v>

501
00:30:38.751 --> 00:30:39.584
<v Speaker 2>something and you think that the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might not be doing it is because </v>

502
00:30:43.371 --> 00:30:45.560
<v Speaker 2>you're afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you should do it.</v>

503
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.730
<v Speaker 2>So that way you can find out if it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>

504
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.760
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think your question is,</v>

505
00:30:52.761 --> 00:30:53.594
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I know my conscience isn't just </v>

506
00:30:54.711 --> 00:30:56.240
<v Speaker 2>masquerading as fear of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

507
00:30:56.241 --> 00:30:59.990
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's rationalizing the real issue,</v>

508
00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:03.170
<v Speaker 2>which is you're afraid of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now see,</v>

509
00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.440
<v Speaker 2>here's a reason that you want to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth.</v>

510
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.513
<v Speaker 2>And I parked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of figured this out when I was </v>

511
00:31:08.811 --> 00:31:11.090
<v Speaker 2>looking deeply into the Pinocchio Story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

512
00:31:11.091 --> 00:31:14.780
<v Speaker 2>in Pinocchio as Pinocchio strives to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become real,</v>

513
00:31:14.781 --> 00:31:17.030
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a conscience to guide him,</v>

514
00:31:17.031 --> 00:31:19.280
<v Speaker 2>but it's jimminy cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this insect.</v>

515
00:31:19.281 --> 00:31:21.860
<v Speaker 2>But Jimmy hasn't really a very good </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience.</v>

516
00:31:21.861 --> 00:31:25.090
<v Speaker 2>He's a bit dogmatic to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dogmatic and inexperienced.</v>

517
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:27.583
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the conscience is an </v>

518
00:31:29.391 --> 00:31:33.230
<v Speaker 2>unerring guide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a partner in discovery.</v>

519
00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:34.603
<v Speaker 2>And as you move forward in your life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you consult your conscience and you </v>

520
00:31:39.321 --> 00:31:43.970
<v Speaker 2>listened to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it gets smarter and so to you.</v>

521
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.493
<v Speaker 2>But there's a code of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is why I've suggested part of </v>

522
00:31:49.251 --> 00:31:53.180
<v Speaker 2>the reason why I've suggested so </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently in my lectures and in my book</v>

523
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.910
<v Speaker 2>that people try not to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

524
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.450
<v Speaker 2>there are many systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have many systems within,</v>

525
00:31:59.451 --> 00:32:01.220
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guide you.</v>

526
00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:05.420
<v Speaker 2>And one of those is your capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational thought.</v>

527
00:32:05.421 --> 00:32:06.254
<v Speaker 2>And then you have a variety of emotional</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems and motivational systems and </v>

528
00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:09.853
<v Speaker 2>internal dramas and intuitions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodily sensations like lots and lots of </v>

529
00:32:15.051 --> 00:32:18.080
<v Speaker 2>and senses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of systems that are guiding you.</v>

530
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.310
<v Speaker 2>And many of them operate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

531
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.850
<v Speaker 2>unconsciously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomously,</v>

532
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:28.970
<v Speaker 2>instinctively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>implicitly,</v>

533
00:32:28.971 --> 00:32:29.804
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

534
00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.393
<v Speaker 2>Now you pr nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you program them like you feed them </v>

535
00:32:35.121 --> 00:32:35.954
<v Speaker 2>content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say just like you feed your body </v>

536
00:32:37.911 --> 00:32:38.744
<v Speaker 2>nourishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feed them and a lot of the content </v>

537
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:42.314
<v Speaker 2>that you feed them pertains directly to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your voluntary thoughts and speech and </v>

538
00:32:46.641 --> 00:32:47.474
<v Speaker 2>your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you pathologize those by </v>

539
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:50.534
<v Speaker 2>lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you say things that you know not </v>

540
00:32:52.461 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 2>to be true or you don't say things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know to be true when you need to,</v>

541
00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:00.320
<v Speaker 2>which is more common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you act in ways that you consider</v>

542
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.590
<v Speaker 2>that act in ways you considered </v>
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible,</v>

543
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.690
<v Speaker 2>then you pathologize all of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous systems that guide you.</v>

544
00:33:08.691 --> 00:33:09.524
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're programming them badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're building an AI system inside </v>

545
00:33:12.261 --> 00:33:13.690
<v Speaker 2>yourself really in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

546
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.510
<v Speaker 2>in some sense that is what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has very bad,</v>

547
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:18.403
<v Speaker 2>it's very bad training data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the output it produces will be </v>

548
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:23.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't guide you properly.</v>

549
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:28.420
<v Speaker 2>And so you don't want to pathologize </v>
<v Speaker 2>your guidance systems.</v>

550
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:33.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a really bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why you have to not lie.</v>

551
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:37.010
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's also why you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say what you have to say.</v>

552
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.590
<v Speaker 2>And you have to say it clearly as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to learn how to do that.</v>

553
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.910
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the ways of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>your conscience straightened out.</v>

554
00:33:43.911 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to have a dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your conscience.</v>

555
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:47.570
<v Speaker 2>And you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

556
00:33:47.571 --> 00:33:49.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what should I do?</v>

557
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.473
<v Speaker 2>Or what should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I do this or should I not do </v>

558
00:33:52.311 --> 00:33:53.540
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you're thinking,</v>

559
00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:55.670
<v Speaker 2>should I not do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the case of a temptation,</v>

560
00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:00.140
<v Speaker 2>maybe you have a chance to develop a new</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

561
00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:01.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>

562
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.353
<v Speaker 2>you're excited about it and apprehensive</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and afraid of it and you don't </v>

563
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:08.990
<v Speaker 2>know how to sort out all those feelings.</v>

564
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:12.470
<v Speaker 2>And the first thing is you really have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to want to sort them out.</v>

565
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.730
<v Speaker 2>That's why you have to orient yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>to something that's a genuine up.</v>

566
00:34:16.731 --> 00:34:18.590
<v Speaker 2>You know that the star above the </v>
<v Speaker 2>horizon,</v>

567
00:34:18.591 --> 00:34:19.424
<v Speaker 2>you have to really want things to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight and you have to have thought </v>

568
00:34:23.301 --> 00:34:24.134
<v Speaker 2>that through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to know what it means for </v>

569
00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:27.464
<v Speaker 2>things not to be straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And really what it means is that you're </v>

570
00:34:29.091 --> 00:34:33.320
<v Speaker 2>headed for hell in one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you understand that it's enough,</v>

571
00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:36.470
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's enough to scare you straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really got to think that through.</v>

572
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Then you've got to think about how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>better it would be if you aimed up and,</v>

573
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.680
<v Speaker 2>and that really has to kind of permeate </v>
<v Speaker 2>your whole being.</v>

574
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:44.143
<v Speaker 2>And so then you're oriented that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're oriented to dop and you're </v>

575
00:34:46.491 --> 00:34:50.270
<v Speaker 2>deciding that it's okay to try to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth and then you can start to rely</v>

576
00:34:50.271 --> 00:34:52.070
<v Speaker 2>on this dialogue with your conscience.</v>

577
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.840
<v Speaker 2>But both of you have to learn and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to make mistakes along the way.</v>

578
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:58.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>

579
00:34:58.551 --> 00:34:59.181
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

580
00:34:59.181 --> 00:35:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try this without being </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain that it's right.</v>

581
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:02.743
<v Speaker 2>You can even say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say this without being </v>

582
00:35:05.331 --> 00:35:07.700
<v Speaker 2>certain that it's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're arguing with your wife or</v>

583
00:35:07.701 --> 00:35:09.620
<v Speaker 2>your husband or your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or your sister,</v>

584
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:12.620
<v Speaker 2>your father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have an idea about what might be</v>

585
00:35:12.621 --> 00:35:13.970
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>

586
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.990
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my idea about what's going on.</v>

587
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.303
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what that idea might be </v>

588
00:35:21.321 --> 00:35:24.950
<v Speaker 2>contaminated with like maybe I'm putting</v>
<v Speaker 2>it forward just because I'm too proud or</v>

589
00:35:24.951 --> 00:35:27.440
<v Speaker 2>arrogant or angry or fearful or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

590
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.920
<v Speaker 2>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if we can figure that out.</v>

591
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:36.590
<v Speaker 2>But you can offer tentatively and both </v>
<v Speaker 2>have added.</v>

592
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.430
<v Speaker 2>That's what you do if it's a hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

593
00:35:38.431 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Speaker 2>You both have at it and see if it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that's worthy of,</v>

594
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:42.743
<v Speaker 2>of keeping you do that with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience and then you were move </v>

595
00:35:46.321 --> 00:35:47.154
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

596
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:49.363
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a technique and behavioral </v>

597
00:35:50.271 --> 00:35:54.080
<v Speaker 2>psychology called psychotherapy called </v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborative empiricism.</v>

598
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:54.943
<v Speaker 2>So let's say that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I have been sitting down and we </v>

599
00:35:57.801 --> 00:36:00.380
<v Speaker 2>decided that you're going to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>something new this week.</v>

600
00:36:00.381 --> 00:36:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe your agoraphobic and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a hard time in a parking lot.</v>

601
00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.620
<v Speaker 2>And so getting out of the car and going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the grocery store.</v>

602
00:36:06.621 --> 00:36:07.454
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you to drive to the grocery store </v>

603
00:36:09.381 --> 00:36:11.180
<v Speaker 2>and you're just going to walk halfway to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

604
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:13.723
<v Speaker 2>halfway from your car to the door and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good enough for like do that </v>

605
00:36:16.461 --> 00:36:19.820
<v Speaker 2>every second day for a week and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>come back and let's talk about it.</v>

606
00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:23.120
<v Speaker 2>So that's collaborative empiricism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're running a little experiments,</v>

607
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:23.963
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well your conscience is guiding you </v>

608
00:36:25.371 --> 00:36:26.204
<v Speaker 2>towards something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take a tentative step in that </v>

609
00:36:27.951 --> 00:36:30.860
<v Speaker 2>direction and then you check and see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

610
00:36:30.861 --> 00:36:31.694
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did what I wanted to have happen or </v>

611
00:36:34.401 --> 00:36:37.250
<v Speaker 2>occur as an outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the crucial question.</v>

612
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.680
<v Speaker 2>And that's the crucial question for </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral truth,</v>

613
00:36:39.681 --> 00:36:41.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the pragmatic perspective.</v>

614
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:42.703
<v Speaker 2>Did what I want to have happened happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of my framework of </v>

615
00:36:46.911 --> 00:36:50.780
<v Speaker 2>interpretation and my action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the answer is yes,</v>

616
00:36:50.781 --> 00:36:54.110
<v Speaker 2>then I have not invalidated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

617
00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:54.973
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the pragmatic philosophy in a </v>

618
00:36:56.301 --> 00:36:57.091
<v Speaker 2>nutshell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

619
00:36:57.091 --> 00:36:58.370
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart.</v>

620
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.530
<v Speaker 2>So you have a dialogue with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience that never ends and hopefully</v>

621
00:37:06.531 --> 00:37:09.200
<v Speaker 2>it gets wiser and you get wiser.</v>

622
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.983
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

623
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:14.103
<v Speaker 2>that's the dialogue that young talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about between the conscious and the </v>

624
00:37:16.241 --> 00:37:18.070
<v Speaker 2>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between your,</v>

625
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:23.580
<v Speaker 2>your fantasy life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the life that sort of underneath you</v>

626
00:37:23.581 --> 00:37:24.414
<v Speaker 2>as a conscious being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the life that's part of your </v>

627
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:27.234
<v Speaker 2>biological platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biological platform that somehow </v>

628
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:32.970
<v Speaker 2>miraculously gives rise to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

629
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.270
<v Speaker 2>If a dialogue with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're always in dialogue,</v>

630
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:39.910
<v Speaker 2>we're always in dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

631
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:40.873
<v Speaker 2>with everything.</v>

632
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:45.330
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue that.</v>

633
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:57.643
<v Speaker 2>I've watched many hours of your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think I've ever heard you </v>

634
00:37:59.631 --> 00:38:00.464
<v Speaker 2>describe yourself on the big five model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could care to tell us how you rank on </v>

635
00:38:03.171 --> 00:38:04.790
<v Speaker 2>each trade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

636
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:05.833
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a problem because I know </v>

637
00:38:07.911 --> 00:38:11.540
<v Speaker 2>the tests and so it's hard for me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take them without being</v>

638
00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:14.660
<v Speaker 2>well because I know the tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

639
00:38:14.661 --> 00:38:15.494
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard for me to take them without</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ever present threat of conscious </v>

640
00:38:19.881 --> 00:38:21.970
<v Speaker 2>manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

641
00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.960
<v Speaker 2>I've gone through them with my family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

642
00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.970
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see if we get a more accurate,</v>

643
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate judgment.</v>

644
00:38:28.251 --> 00:38:29.084
<v Speaker 2>So I can tell you on the big 10 scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the understand myself </v>

645
00:38:32.331 --> 00:38:35.090
<v Speaker 2>personality scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty,</v>

646
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.910
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 75th 80th percentile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

647
00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>99th percentile for assertiveness.</v>

648
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:46.480
<v Speaker 2>So I'm pretty extroverted cause those </v>
<v Speaker 2>two together make extroversion.</v>

649
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.153
<v Speaker 2>And then with neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a hard one because I've had this </v>

650
00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:55.990
<v Speaker 2>problem with chronic depression that </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like it's auto immune related.</v>

651
00:38:55.991 --> 00:39:00.250
<v Speaker 2>And so I felt a lot more negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion then the typical person does.</v>

652
00:39:00.251 --> 00:39:03.390
<v Speaker 2>I would say by a substantial margin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

653
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.351
<v Speaker 2>withdrawal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

654
00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:08.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't seem to shy away from things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

655
00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:09.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from the fact that I do feel </v>

656
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:13.533
<v Speaker 2>anticipatory anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is secondary to this </v>

657
00:39:16.241 --> 00:39:17.500
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

658
00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't seem to shy away from things.</v>

659
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:23.410
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think that temperamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm particularly high and withdrawal,</v>

660
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.530
<v Speaker 2>I am more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

661
00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.350
<v Speaker 2>it's not irritable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>

662
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.510
<v Speaker 2>what's the next one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Volatile.</v>

663
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:35.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm higher in volatility than withdrawal</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a substantial margin.</v>

664
00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I can be quite irritable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

665
00:39:37.331 --> 00:39:39.520
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to dissociate that from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

666
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.970
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my levels of negative emotion are higher</v>

667
00:39:42.971 --> 00:39:46.520
<v Speaker 2>than I would prefer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

668
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.960
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty compassionate,</v>

669
00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:50.794
<v Speaker 2>pretty high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and compassion's like 75 80th </v>

670
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.620
<v Speaker 2>percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

671
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

672
00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:56.973
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

673
00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm relatively low in politeness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think but not,</v>

674
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not fifth percentile,</v>

675
00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:07.330
<v Speaker 2>something like 30th percentile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40% off I remember correctly.</v>

676
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.030
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

677
00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:11.540
<v Speaker 2>that means that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

678
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.350
<v Speaker 2>It means that I'm blunt enough to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's feelings now and then,</v>

679
00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:17.620
<v Speaker 2>and that I really don't like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the compassion thing gets me.</v>

680
00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

681
00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.860
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm moderately orderly,</v>

682
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:24.783
<v Speaker 2>70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>75th percentile and 99th percentile for </v>

683
00:40:27.341 --> 00:40:28.174
<v Speaker 2>industriousness and then openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them intellect and 99th </v>

684
00:40:33.281 --> 00:40:37.030
<v Speaker 2>percentile for intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's like 95th,</v>

685
00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:39.850
<v Speaker 2>something like that for openness or </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher.</v>

686
00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's where I,</v>

687
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:43.750
<v Speaker 2>that's where I rank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

688
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:49.653
<v Speaker 2>my wife and I found out earlier in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>year and we may not be able to have </v>

689
00:40:51.731 --> 00:40:52.564
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then last month I was diagnosed with </v>

690
00:40:54.131 --> 00:40:57.550
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

691
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.833
<v Speaker 2>how do I combat depression?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While the first thing that we should </v>

692
00:41:01.541 --> 00:41:03.820
<v Speaker 2>point out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very sorry to hear about all that.</v>

693
00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:04.654
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of tragedy in a very short </v>

694
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:07.840
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

695
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to give you any casual</v>

696
00:41:10.661 --> 00:41:12.650
<v Speaker 2>advice because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

697
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:16.690
<v Speaker 2>maybe I can make some things clearer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first is you're not depressed.</v>

698
00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.120
<v Speaker 2>You've had terrible things happen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

699
00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.460
<v Speaker 2>That's not the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

700
00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:23.283
<v Speaker 2>I distinguished between them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a client comes to me and they say </v>

701
00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:30.550
<v Speaker 2>they're feeling very sad and down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxious and worried about everything and</v>

702
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:31.384
<v Speaker 2>so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I kind of walked through their </v>

703
00:41:32.381 --> 00:41:34.520
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have friends?</v>

704
00:41:34.521 --> 00:41:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Do they have a family?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have a meaningful job?</v>

705
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:38.343
<v Speaker 2>Is their educational background </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate for their level of </v>

706
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:43.910
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and ability?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they taking care of themselves?</v>

707
00:41:43.911 --> 00:41:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Do they have something to look forward </v>
<v Speaker 2>to?</v>

708
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Do they use their time outside of work </v>
<v Speaker 2>productively and wisely,</v>

709
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:49.623
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think about those as the </v>

710
00:41:50.721 --> 00:41:53.870
<v Speaker 2>dimensions of a good life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more,</v>

711
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.883
<v Speaker 2>or maybe there's fewer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not too bad for a quick and </v>

712
00:41:57.231 --> 00:41:59.120
<v Speaker 2>dirty first pass through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

713
00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the dimensions by the way,</v>

714
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:02.264
<v Speaker 2>that you work on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do the future authoring program </v>

715
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:05.563
<v Speaker 2>in the self authoring suite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're asked to think about all those </v>

716
00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:12.260
<v Speaker 2>dimensions and consider what your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be like if you optimized along all</v>

717
00:42:12.261 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

718
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:19.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

719
00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:20.204
<v Speaker 2>if all of those things are going well </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you and you feel terrible all the </v>

720
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:24.530
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're depressed.</v>

721
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:26.913
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with your </v>

722
00:42:28.031 --> 00:42:29.470
<v Speaker 2>emotional regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

723
00:42:29.471 --> 00:42:30.304
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're having an existential </v>

724
00:42:31.001 --> 00:42:33.190
<v Speaker 2>crisis that's a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

725
00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.340
<v Speaker 2>let's assume we can't see anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>structurally wrong with your life,</v>

726
00:42:36.341 --> 00:42:38.320
<v Speaker 2>but you're feeling terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I would say,</v>

727
00:42:38.321 --> 00:42:39.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have depression.</v>

728
00:42:39.911 --> 00:42:43.210
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's physiological and people like</v>

729
00:42:43.211 --> 00:42:44.380
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my experience,</v>

730
00:42:44.381 --> 00:42:47.020
<v Speaker 2>those are the people who often really </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit from antidepressants.</v>

731
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.600
<v Speaker 2>But then there's other sort of person </v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

732
00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:55.180
<v Speaker 2>who is in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

733
00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:56.590
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

734
00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.340
<v Speaker 2>their educational attainment is not what</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be.</v>

735
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:04.240
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have an alcohol or drug problem.</v>

736
00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:05.403
<v Speaker 2>They have a family that's really not </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning well or they don't have a </v>

737
00:43:08.231 --> 00:43:11.230
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their immediate relationship,</v>

738
00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.930
<v Speaker 2>intimate relationship is nonexistent or </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

739
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their friends are nonexistent.</v>

740
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

741
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:21.610
<v Speaker 2>or worthless and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and destructive.</v>

742
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:22.863
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't get along with their </v>

743
00:43:23.741 --> 00:43:26.980
<v Speaker 2>relatives there in poor mental and </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical health.</v>

744
00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:30.880
<v Speaker 2>You get the picture that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're not feeling good.</v>

745
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.720
<v Speaker 2>There are moods low and they're anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not depression.</v>

746
00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Like it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

747
00:43:36.221 --> 00:43:37.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's a terror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what that is,</v>

748
00:43:37.661 --> 00:43:41.440
<v Speaker 2>is a terrible life and those are </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things they needed to be.</v>

749
00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:43.540
<v Speaker 2>They need to be conceptualized </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

750
00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Now even if you have a terrible life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressant might be able to lift you</v>

751
00:43:49.121 --> 00:43:51.400
<v Speaker 2>up enough so that you can keep fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

752
00:43:51.401 --> 00:43:52.234
<v Speaker 2>assuming that that's what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an antidepressant obviously isn't </v>

753
00:43:55.301 --> 00:43:56.134
<v Speaker 2>going to help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't going to remove the fact of your </v>

754
00:44:01.241 --> 00:44:04.050
<v Speaker 2>terrible life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you,</v>

755
00:44:04.051 --> 00:44:07.750
<v Speaker 2>you've got terrible things happening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you at the moment and,</v>

756
00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:12.610
<v Speaker 2>and there's no simple answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say you could,</v>

757
00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.200
<v Speaker 2>you could take a look at chapter 12 in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my book,</v>

758
00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.240
<v Speaker 2>12 rules for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

759
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.210
<v Speaker 2>it's called a pet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A cat.</v>

760
00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:24.940
<v Speaker 2>When you encounter one on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in part it's a,</v>

761
00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:26.523
<v Speaker 2>it's an autobiography I autobiographical</v>
<v Speaker 2>chapter about how my wife and I and my </v>

762
00:44:29.861 --> 00:44:30.640
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

763
00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:34.800
<v Speaker 2>my son and daughter and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my extended family as well dealt with my</v>

764
00:44:34.801 --> 00:44:37.710
<v Speaker 2>daughter's extremely serious illness </v>
<v Speaker 2>while she,</v>

765
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:40.770
<v Speaker 2>it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still plagues are to some degree,</v>

766
00:44:40.771 --> 00:44:41.604
<v Speaker 2>although not nearly as much as it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was very seriously ill when she was </v>

767
00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:48.720
<v Speaker 2>a teenager and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an ongoing crisis,</v>

768
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:49.763
<v Speaker 2>a continual for years of crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the question is how do you cope </v>

769
00:44:55.951 --> 00:44:58.470
<v Speaker 2>with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>

770
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.730
<v Speaker 2>the first answer is you shrink your </v>
<v Speaker 2>timeframe.</v>

771
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've had these,</v>

772
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.820
<v Speaker 2>especially with regards to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnosis.</v>

773
00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:09.683
<v Speaker 2>So like</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden your future has been </v>

774
00:45:13.621 --> 00:45:18.621
<v Speaker 2>thrown completely into chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know how to deal with that.</v>

775
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.233
<v Speaker 2>And who would you do what you can to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stabilize your medical treatment and do </v>

776
00:45:25.831 --> 00:45:28.020
<v Speaker 2>optimize your quality of life while </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's happening.</v>

777
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.153
<v Speaker 2>Very complicated thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say you live for the </v>

778
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

779
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:37.020
<v Speaker 2>for the week maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a week's too much even,</v>

780
00:45:37.021 --> 00:45:40.320
<v Speaker 2>but for the day it's like you get up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the morning,</v>

781
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:41.453
<v Speaker 2>you think I need to do everything I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make this day as meaningful and and </v>

782
00:45:48.511 --> 00:45:53.511
<v Speaker 2>rich as I possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hopefully I will have had a full day</v>

783
00:45:55.141 --> 00:45:59.190
<v Speaker 2>by this evening and then I'll be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep and then I'll be able to get up in</v>

784
00:45:59.191 --> 00:46:00.024
<v Speaker 2>the morning and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to make this day as </v>

785
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.470
<v Speaker 2>useful and meaningful and engaging as it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be.</v>

786
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:10.800
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe when you're really sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a day,</v>

787
00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:13.410
<v Speaker 2>you have hours and then you do the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing for the hours.</v>

788
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:15.540
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you do the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the minutes.</v>

789
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:21.000
<v Speaker 2>I would also say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

790
00:46:21.001 --> 00:46:21.834
<v Speaker 2>you've been through a lot of shock and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's conceivable that you might need to </v>

791
00:46:25.621 --> 00:46:26.454
<v Speaker 2>talk to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also conceivable that an </v>

792
00:46:28.381 --> 00:46:31.140
<v Speaker 2>antidepressant could help you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

793
00:46:31.141 --> 00:46:31.974
<v Speaker 2>you've got a lot to deal with and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might need your nervous system might </v>

794
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:37.980
<v Speaker 2>need some stabilization with all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress.</v>

795
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:42.810
<v Speaker 2>And so that's something to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Antidepressants are also quite effective</v>

796
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:46.110
<v Speaker 2>as pain medications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially a drug called Cymbalta.</v>

797
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.453
<v Speaker 2>So that's also worth knowing because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to know about effective pain </v>

798
00:46:50.761 --> 00:46:52.830
<v Speaker 2>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very important,</v>

799
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:56.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in extreme situations of pain.</v>

800
00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Opiates of course are the drug of </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice,</v>

801
00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:00.354
<v Speaker 2>but you can use drugs like </v>
<v Speaker 2>methylphenidate that riddle in the Adhd </v>

802
00:47:05.071 --> 00:47:07.140
<v Speaker 2>drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can use them as adjuncts to,</v>

803
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:08.203
<v Speaker 2>to pain medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people need to know that because </v>

804
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:11.340
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

805
00:47:11.341 --> 00:47:13.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there basically amphetamines,</v>

806
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:17.640
<v Speaker 2>amphetamines have analgesic properties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also keep,</v>

807
00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:19.773
<v Speaker 2>they also maintain alertness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the problem with opiates is they </v>

808
00:47:22.561 --> 00:47:25.740
<v Speaker 2>can be sedating but an opiate </v>
<v Speaker 2>amphetamine combination.</v>

809
00:47:25.741 --> 00:47:28.950
<v Speaker 2>And this is for people who are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely intractable pain by the,</v>

810
00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:30.423
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can increase alertness and help </v>

811
00:47:33.431 --> 00:47:34.264
<v Speaker 2>cope with pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really useful to know what you </v>

812
00:47:36.491 --> 00:47:37.324
<v Speaker 2>might need to cope with pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say shrink your time horizon </v>

813
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:45.063
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

814
00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.313
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

815
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks Tim.</v>

816
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Shrink your time horizon and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on the</v>

817
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.560
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that moment happens to be.</v>

818
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.300
<v Speaker 2>Might be the next minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

819
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else to do when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an extreme situation.</v>

820
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:18.340
<v Speaker 2>The other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the final thing I would say with</v>

821
00:48:18.341 --> 00:48:22.180
<v Speaker 2>regards to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we may not be able to have children.</v>

822
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:23.014
<v Speaker 2>Well you need a plan to address that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best that that you can to the best </v>

823
00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:27.183
<v Speaker 2>way that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to give yourself some </v>

824
00:48:28.451 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 2>time to reconceptualize your life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your future.</v>

825
00:48:31.961 --> 00:48:35.860
<v Speaker 2>And I would say news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we may not be able to have children</v>

826
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.250
<v Speaker 2>that probably takes about a year or year</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half to digest.</v>

827
00:48:39.251 --> 00:48:42.580
<v Speaker 2>So don't be too hard on yourself if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't figured it out yet.</v>

828
00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:47.470
<v Speaker 2>It's any major life transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a really major life transformation.</v>

829
00:48:47.471 --> 00:48:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I would say it takes a minimum of a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>to really adapt to</v>

830
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.983
<v Speaker 2>please give your perspective on why </v>
<v Speaker 2>polyamory is bad for the individual and </v>

831
00:49:12.841 --> 00:49:13.674
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

832
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:23.023
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the fundamental reason is </v>

833
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:25.783
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first is society seem to </v>

834
00:49:29.181 --> 00:49:31.880
<v Speaker 2>function better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is less violently,</v>

835
00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:36.260
<v Speaker 2>let's say when there's one woman per </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

836
00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:42.340
<v Speaker 2>If there's many women per man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there aren't many women for every man.</v>

837
00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:49.040
<v Speaker 2>There are a handful of men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say a minority of men,</v>

838
00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:49.903
<v Speaker 2>a predo distribution of men</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have a disproportionate number of </v>

839
00:49:57.081 --> 00:50:02.081
<v Speaker 2>women and a lot of men who have none and</v>
<v Speaker 2>those aren't happy man,</v>

840
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:06.620
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

841
00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:10.010
<v Speaker 2>there are men who are very likely to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to no good,</v>

842
00:50:10.011 --> 00:50:11.990
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's that.</v>

843
00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Then I would say the women who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say a man has many women,</v>

844
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:22.070
<v Speaker 2>and let's say he's a desirable man for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that matter,</v>

845
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:27.140
<v Speaker 2>just for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he has a variety of women,</v>

846
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.153
<v Speaker 2>those women don't have much of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't get to establish a real </v>

847
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:34.490
<v Speaker 2>individual relationship with him because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be fragmentary.</v>

848
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:41.400
<v Speaker 2>And I don't believe that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfying for people.</v>

849
00:50:41.401 --> 00:50:42.234
<v Speaker 2>I think that what you want as much as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you possibly can is to have people </v>

850
00:50:47.041 --> 00:50:52.041
<v Speaker 2>around you with whom you can weave your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life together over the short term,</v>

851
00:50:53.311 --> 00:50:56.910
<v Speaker 2>medium term and long term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It adds depth to your life in a way that</v>

852
00:50:56.911 --> 00:50:59.820
<v Speaker 2>almost nothing else can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

853
00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.393
<v Speaker 2>what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I'd been speaking more about </v>

854
00:51:04.681 --> 00:51:07.840
<v Speaker 2>permanent polyamorous relationships you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might ask,</v>

855
00:51:07.841 --> 00:51:10.380
<v Speaker 2>but what about sequential ones where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

856
00:51:10.381 --> 00:51:13.080
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is in some ways indiscriminate,</v>

857
00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.860
<v Speaker 2>indiscriminate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>indiscriminate from,</v>

858
00:51:15.861 --> 00:51:17.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

859
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:21.290
<v Speaker 2>well from just casual sleeping around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

860
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.823
<v Speaker 2>I think the problem with that is that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep around casually is to imply that </v>

861
00:51:27.211 --> 00:51:31.890
<v Speaker 2>sex is casual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To imply that sexist casual is to assume</v>

862
00:51:31.891 --> 00:51:35.490
<v Speaker 2>implicitly that it can be divorced from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of life,</v>

863
00:51:35.491 --> 00:51:38.070
<v Speaker 2>emotional life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational life values,</v>

864
00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:41.730
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can divorce it,</v>

865
00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:42.564
<v Speaker 2>but you pay a big price for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the price you pay is like the </v>

866
00:51:45.081 --> 00:51:47.790
<v Speaker 2>virtual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

867
00:51:47.791 --> 00:51:48.624
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

868
00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.710
<v Speaker 2>well the word psychopathic keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaking,</v>

869
00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.690
<v Speaker 2>leaping to mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaking to mind.</v>

870
00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good old Freud.</v>

871
00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:58.873
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to reduce a person to the </v>

872
00:52:04.961 --> 00:52:07.270
<v Speaker 2>casual pleasure of a</v>

873
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:13.070
<v Speaker 2>transients sexual interaction in order </v>
<v Speaker 2>to</v>

874
00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:19.030
<v Speaker 2>sleep around casually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that once you establish that</v>

875
00:52:19.031 --> 00:52:23.350
<v Speaker 2>as a habit with sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a deep,</v>

876
00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:27.850
<v Speaker 2>deep experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you'll,</v>

877
00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:31.000
<v Speaker 2>if you'll do that with sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a deep experience then,</v>

878
00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.193
<v Speaker 2>and you learn how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what makes you think that won't </v>

879
00:52:33.941 --> 00:52:37.960
<v Speaker 2>transfer to everything else that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how it can fail too.</v>

880
00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.380
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

881
00:52:41.381 --> 00:52:42.041
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

882
00:52:42.041 --> 00:52:44.440
<v Speaker 2>monogamy isn't a very good solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

883
00:52:44.441 --> 00:52:47.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is a fatal section.</v>

884
00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:48.573
<v Speaker 2>Fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this sexually transmitted </v>

885
00:52:50.081 --> 00:52:53.530
<v Speaker 2>disease with 100% fatality rate too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

886
00:52:53.531 --> 00:52:57.130
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of really complex problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>for which we only have</v>

887
00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:02.190
<v Speaker 2>the best answer we can come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not,</v>

888
00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:05.970
<v Speaker 2>not a utopian answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say,</v>

889
00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:10.350
<v Speaker 2>and I think the evidence supports this </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>

890
00:53:10.351 --> 00:53:13.980
<v Speaker 2>that stable monogamy is the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution that we know of.</v>

891
00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:14.843
<v Speaker 2>And it's also the minimum necessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirement for the stability of </v>

892
00:53:18.841 --> 00:53:21.390
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

893
00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.690
<v Speaker 2>polyamory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's wrong,</v>

894
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.960
<v Speaker 2>it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes men violent.</v>

895
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:31.790
<v Speaker 2>It increases inequality in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

896
00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.020
<v Speaker 2>in the manner that makes things </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

897
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:38.940
<v Speaker 2>It makes it impossible for women to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a deep relationship with men.</v>

898
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:43.170
<v Speaker 2>It makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it facilitates the,</v>

899
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>

900
00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.493
<v Speaker 2>the transformation of sex into something</v>
<v Speaker 2>casual and then that spills out into </v>

901
00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:51.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the rest of the world.</v>

902
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:53.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it deprives the people who engage in it </v>

903
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.830
<v Speaker 2>have the opportunity of establishing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stable,</v>

904
00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.820
<v Speaker 2>longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm,</v>

905
00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:05.040
<v Speaker 2>mutually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

906
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.313
<v Speaker 2>mutually satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more than that mutually beneficial </v>

907
00:54:09.781 --> 00:54:10.800
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

908
00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:12.360
<v Speaker 2>cause a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good marriage.</v>

909
00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:13.643
<v Speaker 2>The people in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay gain more than there are more than </v>

910
00:54:16.531 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 2>twice as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

911
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.960
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

912
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:19.860
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

913
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:20.993
<v Speaker 2>the benefits aren't precisely linear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you lose that destabilizes the </v>

914
00:54:25.291 --> 00:54:27.810
<v Speaker 2>situation for children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go,</v>

915
00:54:27.811 --> 00:54:30.240
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of things that aren't about</v>

916
00:54:30.241 --> 00:54:31.074
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't good,</v>

917
00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:32.243
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

918
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:37.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

919
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.513
<v Speaker 2>How do you think altered state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness or shamonic experiences </v>

920
00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:44.820
<v Speaker 2>can you should be integrated into modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and scientific thought?</v>

921
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:48.743
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are really asking some tough </v>

922
00:54:49.711 --> 00:54:54.711
<v Speaker 2>questions today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

923
00:54:54.871 --> 00:54:55.704
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that we should realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that states of altered consciousness </v>

924
00:54:59.311 --> 00:55:02.550
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have been experimenting with them</v>

925
00:55:02.551 --> 00:55:03.384
<v Speaker 2>forever</v>
<v Speaker 2>and God only knows what the consequence </v>

926
00:55:07.821 --> 00:55:08.654
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly believe that the old Greek </v>

927
00:55:11.121 --> 00:55:11.954
<v Speaker 2>mysteries were</v>
<v Speaker 2>institution induced hallucinogenic </v>

928
00:55:18.091 --> 00:55:18.924
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that most of the religious </v>

929
00:55:21.571 --> 00:55:25.350
<v Speaker 2>stories that we have are a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of psychedelic experience.</v>

930
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:27.143
<v Speaker 2>Most a substantial number of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly seems to be the case with </v>

931
00:55:30.691 --> 00:55:31.920
<v Speaker 2>so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

932
00:55:31.921 --> 00:55:34.080
<v Speaker 2>which looks like it was the flyer </v>
<v Speaker 2>garrick mushroom,</v>

933
00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:36.360
<v Speaker 2>the Amanita,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

934
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:42.250
<v Speaker 2>people have been using hallucinogenics </v>
<v Speaker 2>substances for a very long time and they</v>

935
00:55:42.251 --> 00:55:46.480
<v Speaker 2>produce very incomprehensible sets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

936
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:51.510
<v Speaker 2>most recently documented by the research</v>
<v Speaker 2>teams at Johns Hopkins</v>

937
00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:54.243
<v Speaker 2>where they've shown that if you give </v>
<v Speaker 2>people enough magic mushrooms silicide </v>

938
00:55:57.341 --> 00:56:01.060
<v Speaker 2>been to induce a mystical experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you decrease their death,</v>

939
00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:06.040
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and fear when they have cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnosis,</v>

940
00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:09.580
<v Speaker 2>which is really something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that a single dose of mushrooms that</v>

941
00:56:09.581 --> 00:56:14.230
<v Speaker 2>produces a mystical experience has about</v>
<v Speaker 2>an 85% cure rate for smoking,</v>

942
00:56:14.231 --> 00:56:16.690
<v Speaker 2>which is absolutely beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehension.</v>

943
00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:22.350
<v Speaker 2>So the psychedelic substances seem to </v>
<v Speaker 2>open up another plane of so to speak.</v>

944
00:56:24.161 --> 00:56:24.994
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

945
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:30.160
<v Speaker 2>it's that part of experience that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has an infinite scope.</v>

946
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Why they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they do that,</v>

947
00:56:33.011 --> 00:56:35.320
<v Speaker 2>what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows,</v>

948
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:38.560
<v Speaker 2>God only knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we understand psychedelics</v>

949
00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:42.280
<v Speaker 2>even a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that they what?</v>

950
00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they fit into our current </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview.</v>

951
00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:50.080
<v Speaker 2>So how should they be integrated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

952
00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 2>you're a fool if you play with </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics,</v>

953
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:56.480
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did Carl Young say?</v>

954
00:56:56.481 --> 00:57:01.481
<v Speaker 2>Beware of unearned wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty damn smart.</v>

955
00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:07.550
<v Speaker 2>So you don't play with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're inclined to experiment,</v>

956
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:09.223
<v Speaker 2>then you should treat them with respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should go into the experience with </v>

957
00:57:12.921 --> 00:57:16.610
<v Speaker 2>the expectation and the desire that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life will,</v>

958
00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:17.473
<v Speaker 2>that you will learn something painful as</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be and that your life </v>

959
00:57:21.141 --> 00:57:21.974
<v Speaker 2>will be transformed in a positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction and you should pray to </v>

960
00:57:24.621 --> 00:57:27.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever God's you worship that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't rip you apart.</v>

961
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:31.700
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you'll be sensible enough</v>

962
00:57:31.701 --> 00:57:32.534
<v Speaker 2>to learn something and you build to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it back from the underworld and </v>

963
00:57:35.211 --> 00:57:36.044
<v Speaker 2>you build integrated into your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully and you'll be a better person </v>

964
00:57:38.361 --> 00:57:41.630
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But be careful what you hope for.</v>

965
00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

966
00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't even have the conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sit down and do self authoring.</v>

967
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.110
<v Speaker 2>I bought it over a year ago and haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>opened it.</v>

968
00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.450
<v Speaker 2>What the Hell is wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

969
00:57:52.451 --> 00:57:55.750
<v Speaker 2>lots of things probably because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of things wrong with everybody,</v>

970
00:57:55.751 --> 00:57:58.570
<v Speaker 2>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not go right for the jugular.</v>

971
00:57:58.571 --> 00:58:00.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's assume,</v>

972
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:02.103
<v Speaker 2>let's assume that the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively simple before we assume that </v>

973
00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.613
<v Speaker 2>your character is beyond salvage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also something I would </v>

974
00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:11.920
<v Speaker 2>recommend if you're arguing with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife or your husband or your partner,</v>

975
00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:12.754
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assume that their character can be </v>

976
00:58:14.531 --> 00:58:17.650
<v Speaker 2>salvaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good way to start the argument.</v>

977
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.233
<v Speaker 2>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you have a smaller goal in </v>

978
00:58:24.371 --> 00:58:25.204
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you notice that you're not doing </v>

979
00:58:26.981 --> 00:58:27.814
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing the self authoring </v>

980
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:29.711
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

981
00:58:29.711 --> 00:58:31.750
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's daunting to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

982
00:58:31.751 --> 00:58:33.820
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you're not very disciplined her</v>

983
00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.520
<v Speaker 2>or maybe both or maybe six other things.</v>

984
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:37.480
<v Speaker 2>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

985
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're angry that you spent money </v>
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>

986
00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

987
00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.650
<v Speaker 2>it could be any number of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you don't want a better life.</v>

988
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there are things in your past you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to look into.</v>

989
00:58:46.811 --> 00:58:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're afraid of your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're terrified of the future and</v>

990
00:58:50.951 --> 00:58:52.840
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

991
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:53.703
<v Speaker 2>any of those things can be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what you want to do is first notice </v>

992
00:58:56.831 --> 00:58:58.210
<v Speaker 2>that you're not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

993
00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing this.</v>

994
00:58:59.711 --> 00:59:01.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must be going about it wrong.</v>

995
00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it started the definition of wrong,</v>

996
00:59:03.881 --> 00:59:04.714
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to do something and </v>

997
00:59:05.351 --> 00:59:07.390
<v Speaker 2>you're not doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're doing it wrong.</v>

998
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.480
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure by your own definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say,</v>

999
00:59:10.481 --> 00:59:11.314
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to do something </v>

1000
00:59:12.311 --> 00:59:13.144
<v Speaker 2>difficult and you're not doing it well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be yourself with a stick until </v>

1001
00:59:15.881 --> 00:59:16.330
<v Speaker 2>you do it.</v>

1002
00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Or You could hire someone else to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1003
00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:21.410
<v Speaker 2>metaphorically speaking or even maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>really if you want do it.</v>

1004
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the best,</v>

1005
00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.213
<v Speaker 2>but barring that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next best thing is to aim at </v>

1006
00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:27.974
<v Speaker 2>something lower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously your two useless to do the </v>

1007
00:59:29.541 --> 00:59:31.370
<v Speaker 2>self authoring program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1008
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask yourself,</v>

1009
00:59:34.581 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 2>sit on the edge of your bed and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1010
00:59:36.021 --> 00:59:38.660
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd like to try this self </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoring program.</v>

1011
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Is there some step I could take towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1012
00:59:41.481 --> 00:59:43.400
<v Speaker 2>that I would do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1013
00:59:43.401 --> 00:59:45.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can think what I have to do to</v>

1014
00:59:45.021 --> 00:59:45.681
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1015
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:49.520
<v Speaker 2>I have to find my username and password.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I have to open the web.</v>

1016
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've turned on my computer.</v>

1017
00:59:51.051 --> 00:59:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I have to look in my email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to find my username and password.</v>

1018
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:57.200
<v Speaker 2>I have to find the site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to open the site.</v>

1019
00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.033
<v Speaker 2>Then I have to enter the username and </v>
<v Speaker 2>password and then I have to start </v>

1020
01:00:01.461 --> 01:00:02.271
<v Speaker 2>reading it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1021
01:00:02.271 --> 01:00:05.450
<v Speaker 2>so then you think got to walk through it</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a simulation.</v>

1022
01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Which of those things are you unwilling </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do?</v>

1023
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:11.660
<v Speaker 2>You can ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I willing to go turn my computer on?</v>

1024
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:15.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I willing to open my email?</v>

1025
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:16.843
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I willing to search through my email </v>

1026
01:00:19.401 --> 01:00:20.720
<v Speaker 2>for the username and password?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1027
01:00:20.721 --> 01:00:22.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bit worried about that because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>bought it a year ago.</v>

1028
01:00:22.971 --> 01:00:26.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I'm going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find the username and password.</v>

1029
01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:27.403
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you can handle that </v>

1030
01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.650
<v Speaker 2>potential disappointment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustration?</v>

1031
01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do that for 10 minutes.</v>

1032
01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could always buy it again,</v>

1033
01:00:34.521 --> 01:00:35.690
<v Speaker 2>if you look lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1034
01:00:35.691 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that big a deal.</v>

1035
01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.713
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it looks like I'll turn on the </v>

1036
01:00:40.191 --> 01:00:41.210
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll sit down,</v>

1037
01:00:41.211 --> 01:00:43.100
<v Speaker 2>I'll turn on the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open my email,</v>

1038
01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I'll look for the username and password </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll buy it if I can't find it.</v>

1039
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.820
<v Speaker 2>That's possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you actually do those things?</v>

1040
01:00:49.821 --> 01:00:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Like would you do them right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1041
01:00:51.531 --> 01:00:52.364
<v Speaker 2>I think I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you also put the username and </v>

1042
01:00:54.981 --> 01:00:59.981
<v Speaker 2>password into the program itself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then you feel a little resistance.</v>

1043
01:01:01.371 --> 01:01:02.360
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe,</v>

1044
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:03.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I wouldn't.</v>

1045
01:01:03.741 --> 01:01:04.574
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you put the username and password </v>

1046
01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:08.750
<v Speaker 2>into the program and start reading?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1047
01:01:08.751 --> 01:01:09.920
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's too much.</v>

1048
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:10.783
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1049
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1050
01:01:11.991 --> 01:01:13.910
<v Speaker 2>if I wasn't such a useless son of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

1051
01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:15.950
<v Speaker 2>I just sit down and do the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1052
01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:16.581
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

1053
01:01:16.581 --> 01:01:17.414
<v Speaker 2>but you are exactly that useless kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>son of a bitch and so you can ask </v>

1054
01:01:21.381 --> 01:01:23.750
<v Speaker 2>yourself politely what you're willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1055
01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:24.913
<v Speaker 2>You might find that you're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>open the damn program and put the </v>

1056
01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:27.584
<v Speaker 2>username and password in and like look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the first sentence and that's a big </v>

1057
01:01:30.231 --> 01:01:30.890
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment.</v>

1058
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:31.723
<v Speaker 2>It's like you could take yourself out </v>
<v Speaker 2>for dinner to dinner for managing that </v>

1059
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:39.290
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not being cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like way to be you opened it.</v>

1060
01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:41.900
<v Speaker 2>That means you have to get over your </v>
<v Speaker 2>anticipatory anxiety.</v>

1061
01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:44.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's enough for the day.</v>

1062
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:46.723
<v Speaker 2>If you're find that you're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you know you should be </v>

1063
01:01:49.521 --> 01:01:52.970
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask yourself like seriously.</v>

1064
01:01:52.971 --> 01:01:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Like you would ask someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd ask someone you care about,</v>

1065
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:59.540
<v Speaker 2>like you'd ask someone you'd listened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is that you're willing to do.</v>

1066
01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:01.970
<v Speaker 2>You won't clean up your room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1067
01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:05.240
<v Speaker 2>will you clean up your closet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1068
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:06.523
<v Speaker 2>Will you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you look in your closet and like </v>

1069
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:12.560
<v Speaker 2>think about some things that you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>clean up if you did it the next day.</v>

1070
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:13.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1071
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Well there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Successful negotiation.</v>

1072
01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.253
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta you're not your own slave and </v>

1073
01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:21.060
<v Speaker 2>you're not your own tyrant.</v>

1074
01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.720
<v Speaker 2>You have to deal with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to negotiate with yourself just</v>

1075
01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:26.460
<v Speaker 2>like you'd negotiate with another </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1076
01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:30.240
<v Speaker 2>So that means you've got to take your </v>
<v Speaker 2>stubborn idiocy the way you find it.</v>

1077
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:31.463
<v Speaker 2>You got to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to ask yourself like </v>

1078
01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:34.224
<v Speaker 2>you'd ask a really bratty nine year old </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid what you might be willing to do to </v>

1079
01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:39.684
<v Speaker 2>put another foot forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to do it small as it </v>

1080
01:02:43.891 --> 01:02:46.770
<v Speaker 2>is in humility because you're so damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>useless.</v>

1081
01:02:46.771 --> 01:02:48.540
<v Speaker 2>That was the best you could manage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1082
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:49.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better than nothing,</v>

1083
01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:54.360
<v Speaker 2>so it's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that every day,</v>

1084
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:55.583
<v Speaker 2>if you try that every day or every </v>
<v Speaker 2>second day or once a week for that </v>

1085
01:02:58.051 --> 01:02:58.621
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1086
01:02:58.621 --> 01:03:03.621
<v Speaker 2>if you allow yourself to genuinely step </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward on a reasonably regular basis,</v>

1087
01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:06.420
<v Speaker 2>you'll actually move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1088
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:09.600
<v Speaker 2>even that will do the trick because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits will start to compound.</v>

1089
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.050
<v Speaker 2>So if you're not hitting what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>aiming at,</v>

1090
01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.053
<v Speaker 2>aim lower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move closer to the target until you can </v>

1091
01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:19.883
<v Speaker 2>hit it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until you can hit it with a little bit </v>

1092
01:03:21.571 --> 01:03:25.050
<v Speaker 2>of effort and accept that as your </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting point.</v>

1093
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:26.280
<v Speaker 2>At least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

1094
01:03:26.281 --> 01:03:28.080
<v Speaker 2>You found your starting point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurray.</v>

1095
01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Hurray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're on the path.</v>

1096
01:03:29.851 --> 01:03:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know it really.</v>

1097
01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious about that.</v>

1098
01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1099
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Speaker 2>My wife says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am like you.</v>

1100
01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.513
<v Speaker 2>I he obsessed by ideas and sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Want to talk about much else she wants </v>

1101
01:03:42.001 --> 01:03:44.460
<v Speaker 2>me to ask if your wife has ever annoyed </v>
<v Speaker 2>by it.</v>

1102
01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Ha Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1103
01:03:47.221 --> 01:03:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if she's annoyed by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's worn out by it,</v>

1104
01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:53.070
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1105
01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm amazed that she can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she seems to be able to live with me,</v>

1106
01:03:58.470 --> 01:04:03.270
<v Speaker 2>which is asking quite a lot of someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's always a lot going on,</v>

1107
01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:04.830
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1108
01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:12.020
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think she's annoyed by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's overwhelmed by it</v>

1109
01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:13.643
<v Speaker 2>and fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe sometimes she's annoyed by it </v>

1110
01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:18.900
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be obsessed by ideas like that.</v>

1111
01:04:18.901 --> 01:04:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Well that's part of being high in trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>openness at,</v>

1112
01:04:21.721 --> 01:04:25.230
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're also extroverted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you like.</v>

1113
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're high in openness.</v>

1114
01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.730
<v Speaker 2>You should have your wife take the </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand myself,</v>

1115
01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:32.640
<v Speaker 2>test and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you two and then you can look,</v>

1116
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:34.800
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build this couple's </v>
<v Speaker 2>report pretty soon.</v>

1117
01:04:34.801 --> 01:04:36.810
<v Speaker 2>That will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on the paragraphs now.</v>

1118
01:04:36.811 --> 01:04:37.644
<v Speaker 2>The infrastructure's already in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That will enable people to compare one </v>

1119
01:04:39.721 --> 01:04:40.830
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1120
01:04:40.831 --> 01:04:44.100
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like your extremely high in </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade.</v>

1121
01:04:44.101 --> 01:04:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially on the intellect dimension.</v>

1122
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.710
<v Speaker 2>And perhaps your wife is lower on on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that dimension.</v>

1123
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:50.873
<v Speaker 2>And so take the test and find out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'll both understand that it's </v>

1124
01:04:53.581 --> 01:04:55.560
<v Speaker 2>characterological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1125
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.950
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1126
01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:03.470
<v Speaker 2>you might need to find people that share</v>
<v Speaker 2>your intellectual predilection.</v>

1127
01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:04.803
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're interests are more than your </v>

1128
01:05:09.391 --> 01:05:14.391
<v Speaker 2>wife can easily</v>
<v Speaker 2>and happily,</v>

1129
01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.820
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerate</v>

1130
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:38.840
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi Dr. Peterson.</v>

1131
01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm a member of the translators who </v>
<v Speaker 2>translate your video into Chinese.</v>

1132
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:46.520
<v Speaker 2>How can I speak the truth and survive in</v>
<v Speaker 2>China and protect my family?</v>

1133
01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While the first thing I would say is,</v>

1134
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:55.190
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a hard question.</v>

1135
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.333
<v Speaker 2>Carefully and carefully and attentively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can I speak the truth and survive </v>

1136
01:06:05.741 --> 01:06:07.900
<v Speaker 2>carefully and attentively?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1137
01:06:07.901 --> 01:06:12.850
<v Speaker 2>I would say rule number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rule number one,</v>

1138
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:16.990
<v Speaker 2>don't suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't sully your soul.</v>

1139
01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:19.960
<v Speaker 2>That's like rule number one in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1140
01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:21.873
<v Speaker 2>you got to decide what's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And obviously being persecuted for your </v>

1141
01:06:26.411 --> 01:06:28.780
<v Speaker 2>opinion is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that.</v>

1142
01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:34.380
<v Speaker 2>But being unable to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being forced to live in a web of silence</v>

1143
01:06:38.041 --> 01:06:42.840
<v Speaker 2>and deception is also horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say worse.</v>

1144
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say also horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got Hobson's choice there.</v>

1145
01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:52.470
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to do what you can to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell the truth,</v>

1146
01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.353
<v Speaker 2>then do it with humility and care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start within the confines of your own </v>

1147
01:06:58.081 --> 01:07:01.950
<v Speaker 2>immediate circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And don't get arrogant.</v>

1148
01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Don't get arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think you'll get away with it.</v>

1149
01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.770
<v Speaker 2>You have to be doing it humbly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully.</v>

1150
01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.093
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1151
01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Push on what you can push on that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think might change.</v>

1152
01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:23.570
<v Speaker 2>And don't be contemptuous of small </v>
<v Speaker 2>victories</v>

1153
01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:30.840
<v Speaker 2>and take care of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be careful.</v>

1154
01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:36.683
<v Speaker 2>You want to maintain yourself while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making your attempts so that you </v>

1155
01:07:39.421 --> 01:07:42.120
<v Speaker 2>can be along to around to do it for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

1156
01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:43.643
<v Speaker 2>So see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess we could rephrase the last </v>

1157
01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:48.720
<v Speaker 2>part of your question because we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>also say,</v>

1158
01:07:48.721 --> 01:07:49.554
<v Speaker 2>how can I speak anything but the truth </v>
<v Speaker 2>and survive in China and protect my </v>

1159
01:07:53.551 --> 01:07:54.384
<v Speaker 2>family?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that in the medium to </v>

1160
01:07:56.330 --> 01:08:01.330
<v Speaker 2>longterm and all things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never have a better bet than telling</v>

1161
01:08:02.851 --> 01:08:03.684
<v Speaker 2>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do say that realizing that there </v>

1162
01:08:06.511 --> 01:08:07.344
<v Speaker 2>are places and times where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively safe to do so and places and </v>

1163
01:08:12.241 --> 01:08:15.030
<v Speaker 2>times where it's relatively unsafe to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1164
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:19.400
<v Speaker 2>And if you're in China now and for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very long time,</v>

1165
01:08:19.401 --> 01:08:22.220
<v Speaker 2>you're in a place where it's relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>unsafe to do so.</v>

1166
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Don't take unnecessary risks,</v>

1167
01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.073
<v Speaker 1>dope</v>

1168
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:36.550
<v Speaker 2>but don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have every reason to try to keep</v>

1169
01:08:36.561 --> 01:08:38.540
<v Speaker 2>your soul and your word intact.</v>

1170
01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:40.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1171
01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:53.513
<v Speaker 2>my brother committed suicide and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking care of my sister's kids age </v>

1172
01:08:56.161 --> 01:08:58.950
<v Speaker 2>seven and three until she stables </v>
<v Speaker 2>stable.</v>

1173
01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:01.500
<v Speaker 2>How can I help them cope with the loss </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their uncle?</v>

1174
01:09:14.690 --> 01:09:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you help kids cope?</v>

1175
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:18.703
<v Speaker 2>You</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a stable routine together around </v>

1176
01:09:22.311 --> 01:09:25.160
<v Speaker 2>them so that they don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>additional uncertainty in their life.</v>

1177
01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:31.650
<v Speaker 2>You decide that you're oriented towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>their future.</v>

1178
01:09:31.651 --> 01:09:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1179
01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:36.300
<v Speaker 2>you got to decide that as deeply as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

1180
01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.840
<v Speaker 2>Are you resentful about having to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>care of them?</v>

1181
01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Cause you might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you have your reasons too,</v>

1182
01:09:42.721 --> 01:09:43.554
<v Speaker 2>but I would scour your soul for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility and see if you can rectify </v>

1183
01:09:48.841 --> 01:09:53.841
<v Speaker 2>it by whatever means necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>act responsibly and reliably.</v>

1184
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.903
<v Speaker 2>And that will give them faith in adults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is good because they need some </v>

1185
01:09:59.761 --> 01:10:00.594
<v Speaker 2>faith and they're going to be adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they need to have some faith in </v>

1186
01:10:02.911 --> 01:10:03.744
<v Speaker 2>adults,</v>

1187
01:10:08.530 --> 01:10:09.363
<v Speaker 1>play with them,</v>

1188
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:16.080
<v Speaker 2>pay attention to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play with them.</v>

1189
01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:21.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not a bad idea to teach kids how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come and get a hug.</v>

1190
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:22.423
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1191
01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.400
<v Speaker 2>you can do that in a pretend play mode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1192
01:10:25.401 --> 01:10:26.031
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1193
01:10:26.031 --> 01:10:28.610
<v Speaker 2>let's practice something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you Prac,</v>

1194
01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:29.453
<v Speaker 2>let's pretend that you need a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then let's pretend that you need </v>

1195
01:10:32.451 --> 01:10:34.760
<v Speaker 2>some practice in figuring out how to ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>for what,</v>

1196
01:10:34.761 --> 01:10:35.594
<v Speaker 2>because everybody needs a hug sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the three and the seven year old </v>

1197
01:10:37.991 --> 01:10:38.824
<v Speaker 2>and both should both be able to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>that game and then have them practice </v>

1198
01:10:41.781 --> 01:10:42.614
<v Speaker 2>until they get good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you can play that like every </v>

1199
01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:47.750
<v Speaker 2>day for three weeks until they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1200
01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:48.584
<v Speaker 2>really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that when they're feeling </v>

1201
01:10:49.551 --> 01:10:50.384
<v Speaker 2>lonesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>

1202
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:51.380
<v Speaker 2>and then you tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1203
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:54.920
<v Speaker 2>pretend you're feeling lonesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you come and get a hug?</v>

1204
01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:56.860
<v Speaker 2>And you got to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1205
01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:59.330
<v Speaker 2>maybe they just come on and they look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>your feet and they say,</v>

1206
01:10:59.390 --> 01:11:01.340
<v Speaker 2>I feeling lonesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really need a hug.</v>

1207
01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:03.590
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1208
01:11:03.591 --> 01:11:06.230
<v Speaker 2>you can teach them to come and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention from you when they need it.</v>

1209
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what a kid needs is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have someone there to pay attention when</v>

1210
01:11:09.801 --> 01:11:11.390
<v Speaker 2>the kid needs it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really,</v>

1211
01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 2>that's really a good thing.</v>

1212
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:25.423
<v Speaker 2>The seven year old in particular is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably going to wonder if he or she </v>

1213
01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:35.240
<v Speaker 2>was the cause of the suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That conversation might come up.</v>

1214
01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:36.993
<v Speaker 2>You want it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to watch the kid to see if there's </v>

1215
01:11:38.141 --> 01:11:40.480
<v Speaker 2>any evidence that he or she believes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1216
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:43.603
<v Speaker 2>it's an easy thing for kids to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it actually helps them make a </v>

1217
01:11:45.651 --> 01:11:47.690
<v Speaker 2>little bit of sense out of what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1218
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:49.760
<v Speaker 2>something terrible happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost my dad.</v>

1219
01:11:49.761 --> 01:11:51.580
<v Speaker 2>He went away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't good enough for them.</v>

1220
01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really easy,</v>

1221
01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:56.240
<v Speaker 2>easy thing to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might want to keep your eyes open</v>

1222
01:11:56.241 --> 01:12:01.241
<v Speaker 2>for the necessity of that conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a minority.</v>

1223
01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.293
<v Speaker 2>I kids are mixed or resent the </v>
<v Speaker 2>disempowering narrative of victim hood </v>

1224
01:12:15.811 --> 01:12:18.630
<v Speaker 2>being handed to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's lazy and offensive.</v>

1225
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:23.870
<v Speaker 2>How to arm them against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one.</v>

1226
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first question is,</v>

1227
01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.660
<v Speaker 2>you didn't tell me how old they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that complicates things,</v>

1228
01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:36.410
<v Speaker 2>but I would say you better pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what they're being taught in school.</v>

1229
01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:39.413
<v Speaker 2>My suggestion to parents is that if your</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids are in a class where they talk </v>

1230
01:12:43.321 --> 01:12:47.100
<v Speaker 2>about diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equity,</v>

1231
01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:50.040
<v Speaker 2>inclusivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender,</v>

1232
01:12:51.150 --> 01:12:52.320
<v Speaker 2>white privilege,</v>

1233
01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.810
<v Speaker 2>that's not a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other words too,</v>

1234
01:12:55.811 --> 01:12:56.644
<v Speaker 2>but we'll stick with those that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids should be encouraged to leave the </v>

1235
01:12:59.831 --> 01:13:02.140
<v Speaker 2>class because they're not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>educated.</v>

1236
01:13:02.141 --> 01:13:04.000
<v Speaker 2>They're being indoctrinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1237
01:13:04.001 --> 01:13:04.834
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that there can't be an</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent discussion about any one of </v>

1238
01:13:08.711 --> 01:13:11.080
<v Speaker 2>those topics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when they come together in a group,</v>

1239
01:13:11.081 --> 01:13:11.914
<v Speaker 2>then that's a pretty good marker that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the vicinity of a radical </v>

1240
01:13:15.611 --> 01:13:18.400
<v Speaker 2>leftist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neo Marxist ideology,</v>

1241
01:13:18.401 --> 01:13:21.220
<v Speaker 2>and there's no excuse for that being </v>
<v Speaker 2>foisted on your children.</v>

1242
01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:26.980
<v Speaker 2>You may have to have a serious chat with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your school,</v>

1243
01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:28.840
<v Speaker 2>with your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teachers with the principal.</v>

1244
01:13:28.841 --> 01:13:30.760
<v Speaker 2>You may have to learn how to form your </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>

1245
01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:33.790
<v Speaker 2>formulate your arguments against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice,</v>

1246
01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:36.880
<v Speaker 2>like if you resent it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

1247
01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.453
<v Speaker 2>You're going to put up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get angry and take it </v>

1248
01:13:40.421 --> 01:13:43.720
<v Speaker 2>out on someone else you to do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid because you're resentful.</v>

1249
01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:44.733
<v Speaker 2>It's like those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's likely right or you're going to </v>

1250
01:13:46.281 --> 01:13:48.370
<v Speaker 2>swallow it and get weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1251
01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are dismal options.</v>

1252
01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1253
01:13:51.191 --> 01:13:54.160
<v Speaker 2>you might want to find out if all your </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment is justified.</v>

1254
01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.233
<v Speaker 2>You can talk to someone that you admire </v>
<v Speaker 2>and see if you're just flying off the </v>

1255
01:13:57.521 --> 01:13:59.950
<v Speaker 2>handle because maybe you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're not,</v>

1256
01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:01.323
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if something is happening that you </v>

1257
01:14:03.491 --> 01:14:04.324
<v Speaker 2>really don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a sign that you have to do </v>

1258
01:14:07.301 --> 01:14:10.780
<v Speaker 2>something about it because you're being </v>
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

1259
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:15.600
<v Speaker 2>rebelling against that constraint.</v>

1260
01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:17.723
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1261
01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.230
<v Speaker 2>you have to get more educated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to get more articulate.</v>

1262
01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:24.570
<v Speaker 2>You have to get more politically </v>
<v Speaker 2>oriented,</v>

1263
01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:26.820
<v Speaker 2>politically savvy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically involved.</v>

1264
01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.210
<v Speaker 2>You have to talk to people and make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>coalition.</v>

1265
01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to face down,</v>

1266
01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.930
<v Speaker 2>you're chill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your children's teacher.</v>

1267
01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:41.520
<v Speaker 2>You have to come up with a plan for what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens if when you faced them down,</v>

1268
01:14:41.521 --> 01:14:45.000
<v Speaker 2>nothing changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to lay out a strategy of,</v>

1269
01:14:45.330 --> 01:14:50.330
<v Speaker 2>of idiation war or you have to live with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your resentment and risk.</v>

1270
01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Having your children disempowered by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative of victim hood,</v>

1271
01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:57.600
<v Speaker 2>that seems like a really bad outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1272
01:14:57.990 --> 01:15:02.990
<v Speaker 2>if they see you resisting it actively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you are right then in there</v>

1273
01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:12.650
<v Speaker 2>acting out than the contrary narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't believe that they should</v>

1274
01:15:14.671 --> 01:15:15.504
<v Speaker 2>be described as disempowered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you should act in a manner that </v>

1275
01:15:18.811 --> 01:15:23.811
<v Speaker 2>indicates that your convictions have far</v>
<v Speaker 2>more potency then you might believe,</v>

1276
01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.193
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1277
01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris has accused me of sophistry </v>
<v Speaker 2>and my Bible lectures.</v>

1278
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:35.990
<v Speaker 2>How do you draw the line between </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophistry and a valid reading?</v>

1279
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:37.183
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome to the universe of literary </v>

1280
01:15:38.991 --> 01:15:41.570
<v Speaker 2>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

1281
01:15:41.571 --> 01:15:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's the real question.</v>

1282
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I look for patterns.</v>

1283
01:15:51.330 --> 01:15:53.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I wrote maps of meaning,</v>

1284
01:15:53.130 --> 01:15:58.130
<v Speaker 2>which is my first book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I laid out a description of the way that</v>

1285
01:15:58.561 --> 01:16:03.561
<v Speaker 2>we perceive the world and I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know if it was an accurate perception.</v>

1286
01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:04.883
<v Speaker 2>And so I tested it against multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of analysis and so I wanted to </v>

1287
01:16:08.701 --> 01:16:12.120
<v Speaker 2>see while it did it stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did the story stand up logically?</v>

1288
01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Was it in keeping with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was known at that point in terms of</v>

1289
01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:20.243
<v Speaker 2>functional neuropsychology?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it in keeping with the literary </v>

1290
01:16:25.621 --> 01:16:26.454
<v Speaker 2>tradition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it make sense from the perspective </v>

1291
01:16:28.621 --> 01:16:29.454
<v Speaker 2>of mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things in my supposition </v>

1292
01:16:32.761 --> 01:16:34.830
<v Speaker 2>was that if</v>

1293
01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:40.220
<v Speaker 2>the interpretation remain coherent </v>
<v Speaker 2>across all those levels of analysis,</v>

1294
01:16:40.221 --> 01:16:42.920
<v Speaker 2>the probability that that was spurious </v>
<v Speaker 2>was very low.</v>

1295
01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:44.473
<v Speaker 2>Just like you can think about it as akin</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the way that you detect whether or </v>

1296
01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:49.604
<v Speaker 2>not something's real using your senses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have five qualitatively different </v>

1297
01:16:53.031 --> 01:16:53.864
<v Speaker 2>senses and if one of them reports the </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence of something that might be </v>

1298
01:16:57.981 --> 01:16:58.814
<v Speaker 2>faulty and if if to report the existence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of something maybe even that would be </v>

1299
01:17:02.301 --> 01:17:04.400
<v Speaker 2>faulty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if five of them report it,</v>

1300
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.863
<v Speaker 2>then the probability that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something there is starting to become </v>

1301
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:13.100
<v Speaker 2>high enough so that you don't die by </v>
<v Speaker 2>relying on it,</v>

1302
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:17.750
<v Speaker 2>which is really our fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say it?</v>

1303
01:17:17.751 --> 01:17:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Manifestation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indication of,</v>

1304
01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:22.730
<v Speaker 2>of sufficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1305
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:25.743
<v Speaker 2>you know Sam's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Sam ready accused me of </v>

1306
01:17:28.431 --> 01:17:29.630
<v Speaker 2>software street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>

1307
01:17:29.631 --> 01:17:34.631
<v Speaker 2>What he did was say like the postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 2>is say any text is susceptible,</v>

1308
01:17:36.681 --> 01:17:39.860
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to a very large number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretations.</v>

1309
01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:44.960
<v Speaker 2>How do you know yours is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you could say true,</v>

1310
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:46.423
<v Speaker 2>this is where things get complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it depends on what you mean by </v>

1311
01:17:48.951 --> 01:17:49.784
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another thing that Sam and I </v>

1312
01:17:50.991 --> 01:17:55.190
<v Speaker 2>had a head to head about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1313
01:17:55.191 --> 01:17:56.024
<v Speaker 2>I act out my interpretations of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories that I read and I detect there </v>

1314
01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:02.533
<v Speaker 2>the consequence of that action in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and use that as another means of </v>

1315
01:18:05.841 --> 01:18:10.841
<v Speaker 2>deep determining their validity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So acting in this manner,</v>

1316
01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:12.853
<v Speaker 2>the manner that I believe is appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of the way that I've </v>

1317
01:18:16.461 --> 01:18:17.294
<v Speaker 2>interpreted come to interpret these </v>
<v Speaker 2>great mythological stories has been of </v>

1318
01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:26.140
<v Speaker 2>inestimable [inaudible] bell inestimable</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit in my life.</v>

1319
01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:27.973
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's helped my family a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my immediate family and my broader </v>

1320
01:18:31.821 --> 01:18:34.070
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's helped my friends,</v>

1321
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:34.963
<v Speaker 2>it's helped my students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be helping the broader </v>

1322
01:18:38.601 --> 01:18:43.370
<v Speaker 2>community and it's commensurate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I know scientifically.</v>

1323
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.890
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's sophistry that isn't sophistry</v>

1324
01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:51.950
<v Speaker 2>because it's just too many points of </v>
<v Speaker 2>contact.</v>

1325
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:56.810
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so no,</v>

1326
01:18:59.000 --> 01:18:59.840
<v Speaker 2>besides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1327
01:18:59.841 --> 01:19:00.674
<v Speaker 2>there's other ways of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other ways of protecting </v>

1328
01:19:02.061 --> 01:19:06.080
<v Speaker 2>yourself against Sofa street to one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ways you can tell if you're a social</v>

1329
01:19:06.081 --> 01:19:09.680
<v Speaker 2>scientist and you've actually found </v>
<v Speaker 2>something is that you're not happy about</v>

1330
01:19:09.681 --> 01:19:13.190
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you do a data analysis and you get</v>

1331
01:19:13.191 --> 01:19:15.500
<v Speaker 2>a result and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

1332
01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:19.220
<v Speaker 2>that's the last thing I hope for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's pretty good evidence.</v>

1333
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.113
<v Speaker 2>Not Conclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's pretty good evidence </v>

1334
01:19:21.621 --> 01:19:22.454
<v Speaker 2>that you've actually found something </v>
<v Speaker 2>real that's sorta like the data for the </v>

1335
01:19:25.641 --> 01:19:26.474
<v Speaker 2>data that's being generated by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality theorists lately showing </v>

1336
01:19:28.731 --> 01:19:31.610
<v Speaker 2>that as societies become more </v>
<v Speaker 2>egalitarian,</v>

1337
01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:32.653
<v Speaker 2>the proclivity of men and women to </v>
<v Speaker 2>choose different occupational roots </v>

1338
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.823
<v Speaker 2>increases rather than decreases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be sure that whoever made that </v>

1339
01:19:39.861 --> 01:19:43.100
<v Speaker 2>finding that isn't what they were hoping</v>
<v Speaker 2>for because that's,</v>

1340
01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:43.851
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1341
01:19:43.851 --> 01:19:44.840
<v Speaker 2>who would hope for that?</v>

1342
01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:45.771
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1343
01:19:45.771 --> 01:19:49.520
<v Speaker 2>it's just there isn't an ideology </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting that as a desirable outcome.</v>

1344
01:19:49.690 --> 01:19:50.523
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be a great outcome because it </v>

1345
01:19:51.261 --> 01:19:52.094
<v Speaker 2>means that as you make society's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociologically flat say in terms of </v>

1346
01:19:56.001 --> 01:19:56.834
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women get to choose what they </v>

1347
01:19:59.001 --> 01:19:59.834
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they actually choose different </v>

1348
01:20:00.441 --> 01:20:02.690
<v Speaker 2>things and that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say that,</v>

1349
01:20:02.691 --> 01:20:03.524
<v Speaker 2>but hardly anyone is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's almost no one who's happy </v>

1350
01:20:05.511 --> 01:20:09.960
<v Speaker 2>when they find that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So often when you interpret a story,</v>

1351
01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:12.660
<v Speaker 2>let's say you come up with a self </v>
<v Speaker 2>serving interpretation,</v>

1352
01:20:12.661 --> 01:20:13.494
<v Speaker 2>then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I know I'm going to trust that </v>

1353
01:20:14.611 --> 01:20:17.790
<v Speaker 2>because it's self serving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But often if you,</v>

1354
01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I believe is if you take the union tack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1355
01:20:21.271 --> 01:20:26.040
<v Speaker 2>through the mythological material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't find what you want.</v>

1356
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:28.320
<v Speaker 2>You find the opposite of that young </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1357
01:20:28.321 --> 01:20:32.790
<v Speaker 2>what's his prime d dictum derive from </v>
<v Speaker 2>alchemy in sterk wiliness infinite tour,</v>

1358
01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:36.000
<v Speaker 2>which I'm probably butchering in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of pronunciation.</v>

1359
01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Of course no one knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1360
01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:39.810
<v Speaker 2>cause it's Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1361
01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 2>what you most want will be found where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you least want to look.</v>

1362
01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Well that's hardly a self serving </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation.</v>

1363
01:20:48.181 --> 01:20:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to generate that man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what the,</v>

1364
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:54.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the dragon and the gold right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1365
01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:56.843
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1366
01:20:57.930 --> 01:20:59.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your interpretation makes things more</v>

1367
01:20:59.861 --> 01:21:03.550
<v Speaker 2>difficult for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes things more challenging,</v>

1368
01:21:03.551 --> 01:21:06.790
<v Speaker 2>requires you to be more mature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>requires you to be more responsible.</v>

1369
01:21:06.791 --> 01:21:07.624
<v Speaker 2>All of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I would also say that that's a </v>

1370
01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:10.324
<v Speaker 2>testament to its validity because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not self evidently contaminated by </v>

1371
01:21:14.321 --> 01:21:16.840
<v Speaker 2>impulsive self interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1372
01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:28.283
<v Speaker 2>how is it that society has not learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>from history about the dangers of </v>

1373
01:21:30.391 --> 01:21:31.680
<v Speaker 2>socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxism,</v>

1374
01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:33.450
<v Speaker 2>radiology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

1375
01:21:33.451 --> 01:21:35.850
<v Speaker 2>after years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to Marxists get away with it?</v>

1376
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.313
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1377
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:43.270
<v Speaker 2>let's not go with the dangers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>etiology.</v>

1378
01:21:43.271 --> 01:21:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Let's go with the dangers of like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>call it radical left wing ideology.</v>

1379
01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason for this,</v>

1380
01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:51.004
<v Speaker 2>and this also might buy the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the reason that there's a strange </v>

1381
01:21:54.161 --> 01:21:54.994
<v Speaker 2>thing that the iconography of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of social of communism is still </v>

1382
01:21:58.961 --> 01:21:59.794
<v Speaker 2>acceptable socially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas the iconography of Nazi-ism </v>

1383
01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.640
<v Speaker 2>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1384
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:04.743
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that we should make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>icons of Nazi-ism socially acceptable </v>

1385
01:22:09.221 --> 01:22:10.054
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the communist icon </v>

1386
01:22:12.251 --> 01:22:14.500
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be socially acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are.</v>

1387
01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.870
<v Speaker 2>And there's probably a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1388
01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:21.760
<v Speaker 2>now part of it is that the left has </v>
<v Speaker 2>never taken on.</v>

1389
01:22:21.761 --> 01:22:22.594
<v Speaker 2>The radical left has ne never taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for being on the same </v>

1390
01:22:26.471 --> 01:22:27.304
<v Speaker 2>side as the Stalinists and the Maoists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Cambodian murderers and all of </v>

1391
01:22:30.881 --> 01:22:33.430
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of it.</v>

1392
01:22:33.431 --> 01:22:35.860
<v Speaker 2>But then the next part is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something deeper.</v>

1393
01:22:38.050 --> 01:22:38.883
<v Speaker 1>I think that</v>

1394
01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:40.533
<v Speaker 2>no inequality is a reality and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality that cannot be put at the feet </v>

1395
01:22:45.351 --> 01:22:49.160
<v Speaker 2>of capitalism or at the feet of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>political structure.</v>

1396
01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:53.720
<v Speaker 2>There's a good book you guys might want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to read this called the great leveler by</v>

1397
01:22:53.721 --> 01:22:54.554
<v Speaker 2>Walter Shy Dale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a new book and it's the study </v>

1398
01:22:56.721 --> 01:22:57.554
<v Speaker 2>of inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things he does is do an </v>

1399
01:22:58.851 --> 01:23:02.240
<v Speaker 2>empirical analysis of the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between inequality,</v>

1400
01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:06.250
<v Speaker 2>the Gini Coefficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a measure of inequality and the</v>

1401
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:10.030
<v Speaker 2>ideological position of governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the theory.</v>

1402
01:23:10.031 --> 01:23:11.890
<v Speaker 2>The hypothesis would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1403
01:23:11.891 --> 01:23:14.320
<v Speaker 2>because the left wingers are concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>with inequality,</v>

1404
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.453
<v Speaker 2>if you measured inequality in left wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>under left wing governments and you </v>

1405
01:23:18.641 --> 01:23:20.740
<v Speaker 2>measured inequality under right wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments,</v>

1406
01:23:20.741 --> 01:23:23.950
<v Speaker 2>you'd expect a reduction in inequality </v>
<v Speaker 2>under left wing governments.</v>

1407
01:23:24.670 --> 01:23:28.900
<v Speaker 2>And the results are</v>
<v Speaker 2>no difference.</v>

1408
01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:30.453
<v Speaker 2>And so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that left wings are </v>

1409
01:23:32.111 --> 01:23:32.944
<v Speaker 2>hypocrites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it might mean that because </v>

1410
01:23:34.271 --> 01:23:35.530
<v Speaker 2>people can be hypocrites.</v>

1411
01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:36.363
<v Speaker 2>But what it means is the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality is so intractable that we </v>

1412
01:23:42.281 --> 01:23:43.114
<v Speaker 2>don't know of any appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 2>political sociological or economic </v>

1413
01:23:51.041 --> 01:23:54.610
<v Speaker 2>solutions that actually work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real catastrophe.</v>

1414
01:23:55.150 --> 01:23:55.983
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality in itself might not be a bad </v>

1415
01:23:58.841 --> 01:24:02.050
<v Speaker 2>thing unless it's too extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's extreme.</v>

1416
01:24:02.051 --> 01:24:05.890
<v Speaker 2>When people say start to starve and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly somethings you know it's,</v>

1417
01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:10.920
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone would agree that that's</v>

1418
01:24:10.991 --> 01:24:12.550
<v Speaker 2>a suboptimal outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1419
01:24:12.551 --> 01:24:14.620
<v Speaker 2>we don't need to get all the ideological</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that,</v>

1420
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:16.383
<v Speaker 2>but some degree of inequality is useful </v>
<v Speaker 2>because well it gives people something </v>

1421
01:24:19.511 --> 01:24:21.400
<v Speaker 2>to strive for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives them an op,</v>

1422
01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:23.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means,</v>

1423
01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:24.543
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this sometimes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually want people to be rich because </v>

1424
01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:30.550
<v Speaker 2>if a new product is introduced into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>market,</v>

1425
01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:32.013
<v Speaker 2>the people there have to be people </v>
<v Speaker 2>around who have substantial pools of </v>

1426
01:24:34.451 --> 01:24:35.284
<v Speaker 2>capital to be able to afford it when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still novel and then that market </v>

1427
01:24:39.521 --> 01:24:41.260
<v Speaker 2>brings the price down for everyone else.</v>

1428
01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.900
<v Speaker 2>And so if everyone had exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>income,</v>

1429
01:24:43.901 --> 01:24:44.734
<v Speaker 2>it would be very difficult to introduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive products into the market with </v>

1430
01:24:47.171 --> 01:24:50.350
<v Speaker 2>the hope that their price would plummet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not actually is a big deal.</v>

1431
01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:51.333
<v Speaker 2>You want large pools of capital sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>around too so that people can invest in </v>

1432
01:24:55.031 --> 01:24:56.590
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complex things.</v>

1433
01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:57.753
<v Speaker 2>And you also want large pools of capital</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the hands have to be in the </v>

1434
01:25:00.491 --> 01:25:03.940
<v Speaker 2>hands of private individuals so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's competitive,</v>

1435
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:07.180
<v Speaker 2>there's forces that are powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are competitive with the government</v>

1436
01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:12.600
<v Speaker 2>and with other large organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways though back to the Marxists,</v>

1437
01:25:14.890 --> 01:25:19.890
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that there are reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>for inequality and despite the fact that</v>

1438
01:25:20.201 --> 01:25:21.034
<v Speaker 2>you can't lay the fact of inequality at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the feet of capitalism and despite the </v>

1439
01:25:24.731 --> 01:25:25.564
<v Speaker 2>fact that capitalism also appears to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>making everyone not absolutely poor at </v>

1440
01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:34.840
<v Speaker 2>the same time as it makes some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>very rich,</v>

1441
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:36.993
<v Speaker 2>there's still inequality is still </v>
<v Speaker 2>painful reality and no one really likes </v>

1442
01:25:40.751 --> 01:25:41.560
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1443
01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:42.393
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can lord it over someone I </v>

1444
01:25:43.811 --> 01:25:44.644
<v Speaker 2>suppose and and extract out some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your moral superiority because you </v>

1445
01:25:48.581 --> 01:25:53.380
<v Speaker 2>happen to occupy a hierarchical position</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's higher and sometimes there's some</v>

1446
01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:55.330
<v Speaker 2>validity in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you've earned it.</v>

1447
01:25:55.780 --> 01:26:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Although I would say like glorying in it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is probably a suboptimal outcome.</v>

1448
01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:06.110
<v Speaker 2>It's still the case that that violates a</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral intuition that everyone has.</v>

1449
01:26:06.111 --> 01:26:08.240
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's probably the moral intuitions</v>

1450
01:26:08.241 --> 01:26:10.760
<v Speaker 2>that lie along the agreeable access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1451
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.943
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it be better if everyone had </v>

1452
01:26:12.771 --> 01:26:14.450
<v Speaker 2>enough?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1453
01:26:14.451 --> 01:26:15.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who argues with that?</v>

1454
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:17.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everyone feels that way.</v>

1455
01:26:17.571 --> 01:26:19.700
<v Speaker 2>And so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1456
01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:24.940
<v Speaker 2>a thoughtless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thoughtless compassion makes Marxism</v>

1457
01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:29.693
<v Speaker 2>naively attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not being cynical about that </v>

1458
01:26:33.481 --> 01:26:36.810
<v Speaker 2>because there is some utility in naive </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness,</v>

1459
01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:38.573
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately the world is a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated place and merely wanting to </v>

1460
01:26:44.221 --> 01:26:45.054
<v Speaker 2>be nice about things and wishing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was fair doesn't justify </v>

1461
01:26:49.951 --> 01:26:53.610
<v Speaker 2>imposing an equity outcome and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gerrymandering,</v>

1462
01:26:53.611 --> 01:26:54.444
<v Speaker 2>complex economic systems that will bite </v>
<v Speaker 2>you if you mess with them because your </v>

1463
01:26:57.511 --> 01:26:58.890
<v Speaker 2>idiot logically possessed.</v>

1464
01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.780
<v Speaker 2>I am 46 retired executive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthy,</v>

1465
01:27:13.781 --> 01:27:14.614
<v Speaker 2>competent and full of juice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who could I talk to if I want to invest </v>

1466
01:27:17.381 --> 01:27:21.130
<v Speaker 2>time slash money slash energy in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>university</v>

1467
01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.180
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of people are,</v>

1468
01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:29.500
<v Speaker 2>are asking me such things and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much appreciated.</v>

1469
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:30.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1470
01:27:30.521 --> 01:27:31.354
<v Speaker 2>because you'd think that if people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>offering you time and money that it </v>

1471
01:27:34.811 --> 01:27:36.580
<v Speaker 2>would be a straight forward thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1472
01:27:36.970 --> 01:27:38.920
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please climb aboard and help.</v>

1473
01:27:39.190 --> 01:27:41.740
<v Speaker 2>But it's not that simple because first </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all,</v>

1474
01:27:41.741 --> 01:27:42.574
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to involve people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I can't be sufficiently </v>

1475
01:27:46.361 --> 01:27:48.730
<v Speaker 2>committed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not fair to them.</v>

1476
01:27:49.690 --> 01:27:50.523
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it isn't obvious to me how I can be </v>

1477
01:27:52.481 --> 01:27:54.460
<v Speaker 2>committed to this yet fully committed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1478
01:27:54.461 --> 01:27:58.270
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm sort of playing with it at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the level that I can manage.</v>

1479
01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.113
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a good product in involved or a </v>

1480
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:06.940
<v Speaker 2>good product in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in motion at the moment.</v>

1481
01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:11.530
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the wherewithal to scale at</v>

1482
01:28:11.531 --> 01:28:15.610
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1483
01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:16.773
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people who are developing new </v>

1484
01:28:18.521 --> 01:28:19.354
<v Speaker 2>businesses like to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like let's say I could come up with a </v>

1485
01:28:21.731 --> 01:28:25.690
<v Speaker 2>draft business plan for an online </v>
<v Speaker 2>university and then I can contact people</v>

1486
01:28:25.691 --> 01:28:28.960
<v Speaker 2>like you Paul and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1487
01:28:28.961 --> 01:28:29.794
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to gather investments and </v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say I could raise $20 million or </v>

1488
01:28:32.861 --> 01:28:36.220
<v Speaker 2>let's say I could raise $200 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I have a new problem.</v>

1489
01:28:36.970 --> 01:28:38.410
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well all my God,</v>

1490
01:28:38.411 --> 01:28:40.420
<v Speaker 2>I've got all this money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I have to figure out something to do</v>

1491
01:28:40.421 --> 01:28:41.254
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually a really big </v>

1492
01:28:42.311 --> 01:28:44.740
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Start like,</v>

1493
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:46.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a success catastrophe.</v>

1494
01:28:46.661 --> 01:28:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's a first world problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get all that,</v>

1495
01:28:49.001 --> 01:28:51.550
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

1496
01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:55.930
<v Speaker 2>So I have to do a lot more thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>planning</v>

1497
01:28:57.820 --> 01:28:58.653
<v Speaker 2>and figure out how to disperse my time </v>
<v Speaker 2>most effectively before I dare to take </v>

1498
01:29:04.081 --> 01:29:06.750
<v Speaker 2>on any additional people who would like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to help.</v>

1499
01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once my organization as it is in a place</v>

1500
01:29:11.941 --> 01:29:16.260
<v Speaker 2>where that sort of help would be useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'll make a public announcement and</v>

1501
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:19.920
<v Speaker 2>I would be more than happy for people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>jump on board.</v>

1502
01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's say climb on board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start pushing,</v>

1503
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:24.360
<v Speaker 2>devote resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those things.</v>

1504
01:29:24.361 --> 01:29:25.194
<v Speaker 2>I'd be happy for that to happen then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to do it prematurely </v>

1505
01:29:28.021 --> 01:29:31.440
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want people to,</v>

1506
01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:38.300
<v Speaker 2>to risk their valuable resources in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>endeavor that isn't yet solid.</v>

1507
01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:41.580
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1508
01:29:41.581 --> 01:29:44.730
<v Speaker 2>so I'm only going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one more question.</v>

1509
01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:46.933
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1510
01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:00.873
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1511
01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.730
<v Speaker 2>I am a sober alcoholic slash drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>addict.</v>

1512
01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:04.564
<v Speaker 2>How can I find my way back to belief in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a higher power after 10 years in the </v>

1513
01:30:07.871 --> 01:30:10.510
<v Speaker 2>empty void of atheism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm falling apart.</v>

1514
01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:21.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say your best bet is to actually</v>

1515
01:30:21.551 --> 01:30:26.320
<v Speaker 2>start devoting some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some time to it.</v>

1516
01:30:26.321 --> 01:30:27.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

1517
01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:31.660
<v Speaker 2>I became convinced of the validity of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious viewpoint.</v>

1518
01:30:31.690 --> 01:30:36.690
<v Speaker 2>I think as a consequence of study</v>
<v Speaker 2>read,</v>

1519
01:30:38.901 --> 01:30:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Campbell read Carl Young Young's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

1520
01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Campbell's a good introduction though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richa Ellie Outta as well.</v>

1521
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you can find your way </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to belief,</v>

1522
01:30:52.061 --> 01:30:52.894
<v Speaker 2>but you might be able to find your way </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to meaningful engagement and that </v>

1523
01:30:55.961 --> 01:30:56.794
<v Speaker 2>might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a better way of thinking about </v>

1524
01:30:59.441 --> 01:31:00.460
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1525
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:02.890
<v Speaker 2>the belief thing is a really tricky one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People ask me,</v>

1526
01:31:02.891 --> 01:31:05.290
<v Speaker 2>do you believe in God?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

1527
01:31:05.890 --> 01:31:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I really think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you ask that question.</v>

1528
01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:14.010
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on a more prosaic level,</v>

1529
01:31:15.581 --> 01:31:16.450
<v Speaker 2>I usually think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1530
01:31:16.451 --> 01:31:20.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you mean by belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you mean by belief and</v>

1531
01:31:20.561 --> 01:31:24.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you mean by God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are very,</v>

1532
01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:28.000
<v Speaker 2>these are very difficult questions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>none of that self evident.</v>

1533
01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Now I would say,</v>

1534
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:33.680
<v Speaker 2>do I believe in the crucifixion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1535
01:31:33.681 --> 01:31:34.880
<v Speaker 2>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people,</v>

1536
01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:36.283
<v Speaker 2>the crucifixion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you not believe in it if you </v>

1537
01:31:38.571 --> 01:31:42.680
<v Speaker 2>think symbolically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like human beings are,</v>

1538
01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:45.470
<v Speaker 2>we're eternally crucified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1539
01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Our lives are tragic and they end in </v>
<v Speaker 2>death and were,</v>

1540
01:31:49.130 --> 01:31:51.860
<v Speaker 2>were all betrayed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all betrayed.</v>

1541
01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:54.830
<v Speaker 2>We all experienced betrayal.</v>

1542
01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 2>So you can't not believe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crucifixion.</v>

1543
01:32:00.071 --> 01:32:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe in the resurrection?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1544
01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:07.030
<v Speaker 2>people die and are reborn all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1545
01:32:07.050 --> 01:32:07.960
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go through,</v>

1546
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.823
<v Speaker 2>this is what you're after here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sober drug and alcohol drug </v>

1547
01:32:11.351 --> 01:32:11.861
<v Speaker 2>addict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1548
01:32:11.861 --> 01:32:12.694
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1549
01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:13.713
<v Speaker 2>you had to let a lot of you die when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop being an addict and something new </v>

1550
01:32:16.331 --> 01:32:17.164
<v Speaker 2>be reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what's the ultimate </v>

1551
01:32:18.581 --> 01:32:22.780
<v Speaker 2>significance of that and how is it tied </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the notion of bodily resurrection?</v>

1552
01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:23.643
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the ultimate </v>

1553
01:32:24.701 --> 01:32:25.534
<v Speaker 2>significance is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does seem to be the pathway </v>

1554
01:32:27.311 --> 01:32:32.311
<v Speaker 2>through life</v>
<v Speaker 2>to believe.</v>

1555
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:40.720
<v Speaker 2>I would say you start believing not by </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempting to</v>

1556
01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:47.340
<v Speaker 2>convince yourself that the statement </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a god is true,</v>

1557
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:49.353
<v Speaker 2>like a fact is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to act out the proposition that you </v>

1558
01:32:53.951 --> 01:32:58.480
<v Speaker 2>should shoulder your cross and stumble </v>
<v Speaker 2>uphill towards the city of God.</v>

1559
01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.280
<v Speaker 2>That's belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1560
01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:02.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1561
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:03.430
<v Speaker 2>and you can do that.</v>

1562
01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1563
01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:06.083
<v Speaker 2>right away.</v>

1564
01:33:07.630 --> 01:33:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1565
01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Now you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1566
01:33:09.711 --> 01:33:14.711
<v Speaker 2>do I have any guarantee that that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent and universal significance?</v>

1567
01:33:14.931 --> 01:33:16.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1568
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:21.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bad model for emulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it has universal significance in that</v>

1569
01:33:21.201 --> 01:33:22.034
<v Speaker 2>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We each have to shoulder the tragedy of </v>

1570
01:33:26.581 --> 01:33:27.414
<v Speaker 2>our existence and stumble upwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite that that has universal </v>

1571
01:33:32.061 --> 01:33:32.894
<v Speaker 2>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it have significance outside of </v>

1572
01:33:34.611 --> 01:33:37.760
<v Speaker 2>life and like get the internal eternal </v>
<v Speaker 2>realm?</v>

1573
01:33:41.670 --> 01:33:46.670
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't surprise me if it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it depends on what you mean by</v>

1574
01:33:47.081 --> 01:33:48.210
<v Speaker 2>the eternal realm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

1575
01:33:49.730 --> 01:33:52.870
<v Speaker 2>seems to have significance in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eternal realm of consciousness.</v>

1576
01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:58.150
<v Speaker 2>It seems to have significance in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eternal realm of unconscious fantasy,</v>

1577
01:33:58.210 --> 01:33:59.043
<v Speaker 2>implicit fantasy and mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is it connected with the factual </v>

1578
01:34:05.841 --> 01:34:06.674
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>

1579
01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1580
01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:11.173
<v Speaker 2>that's a hard question because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>factual world in some sense divorced </v>

1581
01:34:14.391 --> 01:34:19.160
<v Speaker 2>itself from that transcendental world </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the development of the scientific</v>

1582
01:34:19.161 --> 01:34:23.900
<v Speaker 2>methodology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so never the twain shall meet.</v>

1583
01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:29.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a methodological issue in part</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you probably have to draw on the</v>

1584
01:34:34.851 --> 01:34:38.780
<v Speaker 2>same forces that enabled you to sober up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and abandoned your drug addiction.</v>

1585
01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:42.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something was guiding you forward.</v>

1586
01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.393
<v Speaker 2>Go forward again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go forward again as if there there is a </v>

1587
01:34:46.341 --> 01:34:49.250
<v Speaker 2>higher power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your manifestation of faith.</v>

1588
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Go forward again as if being is </v>
<v Speaker 2>benevolent and God is good.</v>

1589
01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:01.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the hallmark of courage</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's good place to stop.</v>

1590
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Thank you all for showing up today and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1591
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:12.510
<v Speaker 2>and for all the support and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's enough for March,</v>

1592
01:35:16.170 --> 01:35:20.040
<v Speaker 2>March 4th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2018 bye bye.</v>

1593
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:27.163
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
