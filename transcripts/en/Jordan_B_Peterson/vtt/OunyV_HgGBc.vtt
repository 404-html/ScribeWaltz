00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.943
<v Speaker 1>If</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention to the things that </v>

2
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>shine forth because what you're seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the reality instead of the map,</v>

3
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>you're gaining access to the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that's in the world.</v>

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not pre packaged information </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that can be false.</v>

5
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.763
<v Speaker 1>It's the real information flowing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the ground of being and if you pay </v>

6
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.034
<v Speaker 1>attention to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will help you move towards the goals </v>

7
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>that you've already established for </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself as a good citizen that are,</v>

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>that are part of the inbuilt value </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that you've adopted,</v>

9
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it will do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

10
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.780
<v Speaker 1>It will lead you to transform the nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those goals because as you pursue the</v>

11
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>thing that guides your interest and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more information is revealed.</v>

12
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Then by absorbing that information which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is learning,</v>

13
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>essentially you build yourself into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different person,</v>

14
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>a stronger and more informed person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a more,</v>

15
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.953
<v Speaker 1>a more intact person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person with more integrity and with </v>

16
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:01.074
<v Speaker 1>more straight than with more direction </v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the same time you differentiate </v>

17
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>your map and so you're living more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more in the real world.</v>

18
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.643
<v Speaker 1>So as you approach your specific goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a culturally conditioned </v>

19
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:10.884
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the learning that you do along the way </v>

20
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>transforms you and it transforms the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of your goal.</v>
