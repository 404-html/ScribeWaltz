1
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.010
<v Speaker 1>On Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I wasn't here.</v>

2
00:00:03.011 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>And so I prepared that combination</v>
<v Speaker 1>slideshow,</v>

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>powerpoint thing that took me like 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours to make it.</v>

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>But I'm wondering something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have quite a bit of tape</v>

5
00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>material and I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I'd be taking this courses and</v>

6
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the advantages of doing it that</v>

7
00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:26.761
<v Speaker 1>way was that I could sink the material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the slide material with the lecture</v>

8
00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>much more precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 1>when you can imagine that if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I got good at that,</v>

10
00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I could put a lot more material into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures and I could edit them very</v>

11
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I'm wondering like what did you</v>

12
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:42.031
<v Speaker 1>think of that use of technology compared</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a spontaneous lecture?</v>

13
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.900
<v Speaker 1>What was your attitude towards that?</v>

14
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we could present more,</v>

15
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 2>less responsive and so I prefer the 11</v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures watching the tapes.</v>

16
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

17
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

18
00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:02.921
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

19
00:01:02.921 --> 00:01:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is some mute.</v>

20
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.970
<v Speaker 1>The thing about lecture is that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

21
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:10.690
<v Speaker 1>If it's a good lecture right there</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the lecturers hypothetically</v>

22
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then it's,</v>

23
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.220
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more dynamic.</v>

24
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 1>But you know what if suffers a bit cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as structured.</v>

25
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:19.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody else?</v>

26
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Just we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

27
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Pretty good substitute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll be a say prefer an in person</v>

28
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 2>lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But given the circumstance I thought it</v>

29
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:29.050
<v Speaker 2>was definitely a good substitute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the information.</v>

30
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.060
<v Speaker 1>So I was wondering like what would</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

31
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:37.061
<v Speaker 1>do you think if I prepared like a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>tightly edited half hour presentation</v>

32
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.120
<v Speaker 1>like that and then followed it up with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>looser lecture,</v>

33
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 1>do you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that be a reasonable combination</v>

34
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.990
<v Speaker 1>of the two things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that way I could more,</v>

35
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can be much more certain that I</v>

36
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:50.650
<v Speaker 1>covered a wide range of material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.640
<v Speaker 1>in depth and then hopefully the lecture</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be maybe a little looser and a bit</v>

38
00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you,</v>

39
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 1>do you think that would be a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to try?</v>

40
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.680
<v Speaker 1>So any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody up?</v>

41
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

42
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.061
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

43
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:05.390
<v Speaker 2>you've got to be a really good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because during the lecture</v>

44
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.780
<v Speaker 2>section,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chance to sort of ask some more</v>

45
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:10.730
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas,</v>

46
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know correctly,</v>

47
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of time.</v>

48
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that maybe that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow me to increase the degree to which</v>

51
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:24.260
<v Speaker 1>it was interactive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

52
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did anybody particularly object to that</v>

53
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>mode of presentation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

54
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I know you wouldn't have to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture hall for it,</v>

55
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing,</v>

56
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look,</v>

57
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.900
<v Speaker 1>you could watch it at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some danger in just</v>

58
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:38.840
<v Speaker 1>having the lecture material online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're at home because,</v>

59
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet is full of things you can</v>

60
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:42.950
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.980
<v Speaker 1>so there's gotta be some utility</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing people together by anybody else</v>

62
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>have any other comments?</v>

63
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.083
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

64
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.480
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So today we're going to talk about</v>

65
00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and I'm going to stick</v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to my notes in some parts because</v>

66
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this stuff I'm going to tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about is really only stuff that I've</v>

67
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:09.240
<v Speaker 1>learned in the last year or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I've known,</v>

68
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I've known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely familiar with it yet.</v>

69
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually been a fair bit of</v>

70
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 1>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made an understanding conscientiousness</v>

71
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>and in very surprising ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the stuff that I'm going to talk</v>

72
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>to you about today really shocked me</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I learned it.</v>

73
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see,</v>

74
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in interested in belief</v>

75
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>systems and new technology for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and um,</v>

76
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>the role that I'd never really</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood the role that</v>

77
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness plays in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

78
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>so particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really starting to come</v>

79
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only we're going to talk about</v>

80
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about,</v>

81
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>I think some of the pathologies that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with conscientiousness,</v>

82
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>both at the individual level and at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social level.</v>

83
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tricky topic because act what</v>

84
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>we've discussed this before to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

85
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that intelligence and conscientiousness</v>

86
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>are the best predictors of life success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

87
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:04.490
<v Speaker 1>At least in managerial administrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 1>professions and in academia and also in</v>
<v Speaker 1>professions like the law,</v>

89
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.770
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

90
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>so conscientiousness in many ways seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a very good trait.</v>

91
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you can have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized society without</v>

92
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Wifi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without it,</v>

93
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>without conscientiousness being at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>base of it in some sense because</v>

94
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 1>conscientious people do what they say</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do.</v>

95
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 1>They're industrious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep things in order.</v>

96
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that's the basis for the kind</v>

97
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>of interpersonal trust that's necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>to set up complex trading systems.</v>

98
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as an individual trait,</v>

99
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're conscientious,</v>

100
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 1>not only do you do better in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the time you're middle aged or</v>

101
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.110
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

102
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>your life quality seems to be much</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>

103
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be in conscientious seems to be a</v>

104
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>good longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medium to long term strategy.</v>

105
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>So that all sounds pretty positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then one of the things that multiple</v>

106
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>multitude of labs have been looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last few years,</v>

107
00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 1>including mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what happens if conscientiousness is</v>

108
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:12.601
<v Speaker 1>taken too far and it kind of looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is work that hasn't been published</v>

109
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's based on some of the new</v>

110
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:19.990
<v Speaker 1>personality models that I'd been looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that are,</v>

111
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>that have been derived using a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>technique,</v>

112
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>a semantic analysis technique instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>factor analysis.</v>

113
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:30.610
<v Speaker 1>And what appears to be the case is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of the traits become pathological if</v>

114
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 1>you push them too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

115
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 1>so whatever virtue is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't be identified with a particular</v>

116
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

117
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what virtue would be from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big five perspective,</v>

118
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't look like you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>localize it specifically.</v>

119
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's something like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate situational balance of the</v>

120
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>temperaments or one of the things I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been thinking is that maybe as you</v>

121
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 1>mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

122
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your width of temperament increases,</v>

123
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe your,</v>

124
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>your baseline for a conscientiousness is</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of average.</v>

125
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>But as you mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability to be very conscientious</v>

126
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>when it's necessary and your ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be conscientious when it's necessary</v>

127
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 1>are more thoroughly developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a differentiated so that you can match</v>

128
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>your behavior more particular to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>demands of given situations.</v>

129
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's something like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>development of wisdom.</v>

130
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out,</v>

131
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that it appears that</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness can take a very</v>

132
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>vicious turn if it's pushed beyond a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain point.</v>

133
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>And it also appears that perhaps the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point at which conscientiousness is</v>

134
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>really positively associated with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>success of individuals and maybe the</v>

135
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>success of nations is also relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the point where if you push it</v>

136
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 1>any farther,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts to kick back very badly and</v>

137
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.000
<v Speaker 1>things go downhill.</v>

138
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the sort of thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to discuss today.</v>

139
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

140
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>well put it in its context first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember the highest order</v>

141
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 1>personality traits or plasticity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stability in plasticity is made up of</v>

142
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:02.280
<v Speaker 1>extraversion and openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are good predictors of longterm</v>

143
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 1>creative achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's stability and stability</v>

144
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:09.390
<v Speaker 1>is associated with conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability and agreeableness.</v>

145
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.720
<v Speaker 1>And we're going to concentrate on</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness today,</v>

146
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.450
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously that's industrious in</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness at the big five aspects</v>

147
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:17.480
<v Speaker 1>scale level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

148
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we derived the big five aspect</v>

149
00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 1>scale sold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broke the big five down to 10,</v>

150
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't clear to begin with what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects we're going to be useful for.</v>

151
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Because when you do statistical analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

152
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.620
<v Speaker 1>you're just pulling out a semantic</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and there isn't really any</v>

153
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 1>necessity that those additional</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiation so that you make are</v>

154
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:39.290
<v Speaker 1>going to have practical utility.</v>

155
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 1>But it's turned out that the distinction</v>
<v Speaker 1>between Oh,</v>

156
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 1>orderliness and industriousness is</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely useful.</v>

157
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we know for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

158
00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 1>is that orderly people tend to be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>

159
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Speaker 1>So we know that conservative people tend</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more conscientious,</v>

160
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.740
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to load specifically an</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness.</v>

161
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

162
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 1>that's not so surprising to associate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right wing with orderliness.</v>

163
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.040
<v Speaker 1>But it is surprising because we didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that orderliness was a subset of</v>

164
00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:06.920
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people have been trying since the</v>

165
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:11.600
<v Speaker 1>end of World War II to slop the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the authoritarian personality into</v>

166
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.810
<v Speaker 1>standard personality models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's been extremely difficult to</v>

167
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:15.710
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

168
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:17.990
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one hypothesis is being that</v>

169
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.330
<v Speaker 1>conservative people because they're more</v>
<v Speaker 1>zen,</v>

170
00:08:21.331 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 1>a phobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're more,</v>

171
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more anti-immigration and there</v>

172
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.470
<v Speaker 1>and they're more anti gay rights and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

173
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.600
<v Speaker 1>And one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one primary theories being that that's</v>

174
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:31.510
<v Speaker 1>because they're more afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.080
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>

176
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>is that conservatism isn't associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with neuroticism to any degree at all.</v>

177
00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:39.050
<v Speaker 1>And when it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be reverse.</v>

178
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.580
<v Speaker 1>It seems that the conservatives are less</v>
<v Speaker 1>plagued by neuroticism than liberals are</v>

179
00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:46.100
<v Speaker 1>say so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean you could make the hypothesis</v>

180
00:08:46.101 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Speaker 1>that the conservatives are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative that they're covering up</v>

181
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:52.430
<v Speaker 1>their fear to such a degree that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually reverse it.</v>

182
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really you gotta you gotta be Pretty</v>

183
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Damn convinced of your theory to hold on</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it when the data seemed to indicate</v>

184
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>that the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual opposite is true.</v>

185
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well here,</v>

186
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.920
<v Speaker 1>here's some items you guys can take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

187
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:11.280
<v Speaker 1>So this is how you would distinguish</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness from industriousness.</v>

188
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't worry about the slides.</v>

189
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

190
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to cut them in.</v>

191
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

192
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 1>so if you're ordering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't leave your belongings around.</v>

193
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you like order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While there's a surprise,</v>

194
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 1>you keep things tidy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you follow a schedule,</v>

195
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:30.370
<v Speaker 1>so you order your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

196
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely a good predictor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity.</v>

197
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 1>You're bothered by this and people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bothered is an interesting word,</v>

198
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you're orderly and you're</v>

199
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 1>somewhere messy and it bothers you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

200
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 1>well exactly what it is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing when you're bothered.</v>

201
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know if I go to a place that's in real</v>

202
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 1>disarray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like people have been failing</v>

203
00:09:51.751 --> 00:09:53.880
<v Speaker 1>to live up to their responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say it,</v>

204
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a visceral sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't like it.</v>

205
00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm very strongly compelled to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in order,</v>

206
00:09:58.770 --> 00:09:59.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

207
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

208
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's obviously a negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the kind of negative</v>

209
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 1>emotion that seems to load on</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

210
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't seem to be fear or anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 1>or emotional pain or frustration or</v>

211
00:10:09.271 --> 00:10:11.970
<v Speaker 1>disappointment or any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might ask,</v>

212
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 1>what's left bothered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants everything to be just right.</v>

214
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dislikes,</v>

215
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:20.760
<v Speaker 1>routine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite,</v>

216
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 1>obviously orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like routine.</v>

217
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.770
<v Speaker 1>They see that rules are observed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want every detail taken care of.</v>

218
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:28.020
<v Speaker 1>While you can see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways,</v>

219
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.470
<v Speaker 1>orderliness is the soul of bureaucracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

220
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Because everything in its place and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>place for everything is basically the</v>

221
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 1>sort of hallmark of an orderly person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well in my clinical practice,</v>

222
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I've certainly observed that people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really disorderly and really high in</v>

223
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:44.820
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

224
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.130
<v Speaker 1>they're just never improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

225
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.640
<v Speaker 1>they're because they're their fear and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their anxiety sort of paralyze them into</v>

226
00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:55.320
<v Speaker 1>an immobility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that they're low in</v>

227
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:58.830
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness are low in orderliness</v>
<v Speaker 1>means they will never do anything and</v>

228
00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:02.250
<v Speaker 1>then disorder grows round and then that</v>
<v Speaker 1>exacerbates their anxiety and their</v>

229
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.710
<v Speaker 1>theorists like it's a real catastrophe.</v>

230
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then on theirs,</v>

231
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 1>so that's where the conservatives are</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

232
00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>They're more orderly that liberals are</v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness.</v>

233
00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Liberals and conservatives seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the same.</v>

234
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 1>So industrious person carries out their</v>
<v Speaker 1>plans.</v>

235
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 1>They don't waste time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't find it difficult to get down</v>

236
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:21.240
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't miss things up.</v>

237
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:25.200
<v Speaker 1>They finish what they start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put their mind on the task at hand</v>

238
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 1>to get things done quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is an efficiency element to it.</v>

239
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't postpone decisions and they</v>

240
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:34.320
<v Speaker 1>aren't easily distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so industrious people tend not to</v>

241
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Speaker 1>procrastinate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And procrastination actually seems to be</v>

242
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 1>something like low industriousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>high neuroticism.</v>

243
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.380
<v Speaker 1>So I know it's a very pernicious</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>

244
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.210
<v Speaker 1>And procrastination can really drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

245
00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:50.211
<v Speaker 1>Start branding now</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reversed.</v>

246
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.140
<v Speaker 1>So the ones that don't make sense or</v>
<v Speaker 1>every post,</v>

248
00:11:55.141 --> 00:11:58.690
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now it isn't exactly obvious why</v>

249
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:02.520
<v Speaker 1>orderliness and industriousness are</v>
<v Speaker 1>related so tightly or why there's</v>

250
00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 1>somewhat differentiable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out that that is the case</v>

251
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.843
<v Speaker 1>statistically.</v>

252
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Now I thought a lot about why</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness and industriousness really</v>

253
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:17.680
<v Speaker 1>is a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started to associate ordering with</v>

254
00:12:17.681 --> 00:12:20.680
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity to discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to elaborate on that quite</v>

255
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:22.330
<v Speaker 1>a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Industriousness,</v>

256
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 1>we haven't been able to get a handle on</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

257
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.050
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

258
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>and so conscientiousness is somewhat of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mystery because up until maybe a year</v>

259
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:32.620
<v Speaker 1>ago or two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it was a really good</v>

260
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 1>predictor of longterm life success and</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>

261
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have any models for it because</v>

262
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 1>it just came out of this statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of,</v>

263
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:42.700
<v Speaker 1>of the semantic structure language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

264
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:45.430
<v Speaker 1>So it was atheoretical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no theoretical model.</v>

265
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.950
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are people conscientious?</v>

266
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea.</v>

267
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 1>There's no neuropsychological model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea what part of the brain</v>

268
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is associated with conscientiousness.</v>

269
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.290
<v Speaker 1>And weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of things that are associated</v>

270
00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 1>with conscientiousness are very close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what theorists have identified as the</v>

271
00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:06.640
<v Speaker 1>function of the dorsolateral prefrontal</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex say,</v>

272
00:13:06.641 --> 00:13:10.360
<v Speaker 1>which is the part of the brain that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deals with the highest order of</v>

273
00:13:10.361 --> 00:13:13.180
<v Speaker 1>abstractions and the whole prefrontal</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex.</v>

274
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.960
<v Speaker 1>People have associated with the ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to plan and the ability to inhibit</v>

275
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:19.630
<v Speaker 1>impulses and the ability to think in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm.</v>

276
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.880
<v Speaker 1>And that all sounds like</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

277
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.120
<v Speaker 1>but if you assess people's dorsal</v>
<v Speaker 1>lateral prefrontal function with tests,</v>

278
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.280
<v Speaker 1>cognitive tests that she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are characterized by activation,</v>

279
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 1>when when people are doing those tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their prefrontal Cortex is activated in</v>

280
00:13:36.521 --> 00:13:40.000
<v Speaker 1>say functional Mri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between the prefrontal</v>

281
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.260
<v Speaker 1>ability assessed cognitively and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness itself is zero.</v>

282
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Speaker 1>So it's really weird because this also</v>
<v Speaker 1>means to me that most theories of</v>

283
00:13:48.071 --> 00:13:52.180
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal function or wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can think about it this way,</v>

284
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:55.540
<v Speaker 1>is that in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prefrontal cortex does seem to be</v>

285
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:59.800
<v Speaker 1>good at manipulating abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by definition an abstraction is</v>

286
00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:01.870
<v Speaker 1>something that's obstructed from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>real world,</v>

287
00:14:01.871 --> 00:14:03.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no longer connected to the real</v>

288
00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:05.770
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're thinking about your</v>

289
00:14:05.771 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you've pulled abstract</v>

290
00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:12.280
<v Speaker 1>representations of the world up into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this space where you're,</v>

291
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.520
<v Speaker 1>where you're doing your thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a disembodied space,</v>

292
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.560
<v Speaker 1>obviously you're not acting it out.</v>

293
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.210
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to be able to dissociate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abstractions from the real world in</v>

294
00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:25.780
<v Speaker 1>order to manipulate the abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is thinking without acting them</v>

295
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:28.420
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about conscientious people</v>

296
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.320
<v Speaker 1>isn't that they make plants so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that if they make a plan,</v>

297
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.680
<v Speaker 1>then they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that there's this</v>

298
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.750
<v Speaker 1>ability to take the abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

299
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:40.150
<v Speaker 1>while I promise to do x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

300
00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:42.400
<v Speaker 1>well that means you've been able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think up acts.</v>

301
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 1>But the next question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you promise to do it,</v>

302
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.160
<v Speaker 1>will you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that could easily be</v>

303
00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:51.070
<v Speaker 1>no and that it is the answer generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not conscientious.</v>

304
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't seem to be associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with prefrontal function at all.</v>

305
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And you see these weird dissociations in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of clinical cases.</v>

306
00:14:58.011 --> 00:15:00.940
<v Speaker 1>So borderline people with borderline</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality disorder,</v>

307
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.400
<v Speaker 1>a good example because they're very</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscientious and very high in</v>

308
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:05.234
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

309
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.170
<v Speaker 1>And they're often very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there are these people,</v>

310
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:10.340
<v Speaker 1>you talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:12.410
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're perfectly capable of</v>

312
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:15.800
<v Speaker 1>identifying what their problems are and</v>
<v Speaker 1>even telling you what the causal</v>

313
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:18.920
<v Speaker 1>pathways and even telling you about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should do in the future.</v>

314
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 1>But they absolutely will not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ability to think and the,</v>

315
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.540
<v Speaker 1>and the willingness to put those</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts into operations seem to be set</v>

316
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:29.020
<v Speaker 1>completely separable phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

317
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.020
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know much about the system</v>
<v Speaker 1>that motivates people to put their plans</v>

318
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:36.320
<v Speaker 1>into action or to keep a promise or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not procrastinate.</v>

319
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.210
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what that's associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

320
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.420
<v Speaker 1>So there's no psychological model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no pharmacological model.</v>

321
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to increase</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

322
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that when you give kids</v>

323
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 1>with attention deficit disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

324
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Ritalin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

325
00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:54.260
<v Speaker 1>that that might make them more</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>

326
00:15:54.261 --> 00:15:54.831
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

327
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:57.860
<v Speaker 1>first there's no evidence for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Ritalin is an amphetamine and</v>

328
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:00.290
<v Speaker 1>that would make them more extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

329
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:01.970
<v Speaker 1>because it's a dopaminergic agent.</v>

330
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.950
<v Speaker 1>And plus there's no evidence whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you follow up people who have</v>

331
00:16:06.951 --> 00:16:09.350
<v Speaker 1>adhd who were on Ritalin in the long</v>
<v Speaker 1>run,</v>

332
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:11.210
<v Speaker 1>that the Ritalin does them any good</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

333
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.460
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the evidence is actually the</v>

334
00:16:13.461 --> 00:16:17.690
<v Speaker 1>reverse is that the longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of Ritalin user negative</v>

335
00:16:17.691 --> 00:16:21.710
<v Speaker 1>rather than positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now it's worse in our lab,</v>

336
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 1>like we've done all sorts of things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to measure conscientiousness.</v>

337
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we did for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we thought of it as kind of</v>

338
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:28.430
<v Speaker 1>persistence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

339
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:33.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe like conscientious people will</v>
<v Speaker 1>persist at boring tasks longer than non</v>

340
00:16:33.411 --> 00:16:35.360
<v Speaker 1>conscientious people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds reasonable.</v>

341
00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know it,</v>

342
00:16:36.661 --> 00:16:40.850
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like you're kind of grabbing</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself at saying focus on this and</v>

343
00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:43.100
<v Speaker 1>don't be distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with whether you're</v>

344
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 1>interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had people do things like we made</v>

345
00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:50.981
<v Speaker 1>lines and lines of ends and amps and use</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had people count the use,</v>

346
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.610
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

347
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:56.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's also difficult because ends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ams and use look a lot the same.</v>

348
00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:00.020
<v Speaker 1>And all that we found was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence predicted it smarter people</v>

349
00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:02.000
<v Speaker 1>could do it more accurately and faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

350
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.610
<v Speaker 1>No correlation whatsoever with</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

351
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.640
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't get a correlation with any</v>
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal tests,</v>

352
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.910
<v Speaker 1>no Iq tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we test use tests that were</v>

353
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:13.610
<v Speaker 1>associated with the orbital frontal</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cortex,</v>

354
00:17:13.611 --> 00:17:16.400
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of lower and a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>more hooked into the limbic system.</v>

355
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.360
<v Speaker 1>And we couldn't find any correlation</v>
<v Speaker 1>between conscientiousness and</v>

356
00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 1>performance on those tests either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We looked at like 200 different</v>

357
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 1>performance measures and conscientious</v>
<v Speaker 1>did conscientiousness didn't predict any</v>

358
00:17:28.461 --> 00:17:30.560
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't get people who are</v>

359
00:17:30.561 --> 00:17:34.220
<v Speaker 1>conscientious to do something better in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lab and people who aren't</v>

360
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:35.300
<v Speaker 1>conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

361
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a real puzzle because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

362
00:17:37.551 --> 00:17:41.000
<v Speaker 1>because it's such an important predictor</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things like longterm life success and</v>

363
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:44.060
<v Speaker 1>performance and political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the political affiliation,</v>

364
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 1>you'd think that you'd be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminate between people who are</v>

365
00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:49.920
<v Speaker 1>conscientious and people who aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious the lab.</v>

366
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that,</v>

367
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:58.430
<v Speaker 1>that the chair of our department has</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently used some attentional tasks to</v>

368
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.470
<v Speaker 1>and showed a differentiation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious people and hit</v>

369
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.280
<v Speaker 1>unconscientious people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm hoping that I'm going to</v>

370
00:18:05.281 --> 00:18:08.370
<v Speaker 1>follow up with her to find out exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that is.</v>

371
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:09.780
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it's been deadly different.</v>

372
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

373
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.740
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert's the references for all this or</v>

374
00:18:18.741 --> 00:18:20.490
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the slides by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>

375
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to go through the complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>references,</v>

376
00:18:22.971 --> 00:18:27.590
<v Speaker 1>but research a researcher named Roberts</v>
<v Speaker 1>has defined conscientiousness is the</v>

377
00:18:27.591 --> 00:18:30.830
<v Speaker 1>tendency to be planful organized task</v>
<v Speaker 1>and goal oriented,</v>

378
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:34.790
<v Speaker 1>self control and to delay gratification</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to follow the norms and rules.</v>

379
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.180
<v Speaker 1>So we looked at things too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like future discounting,</v>

380
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so future discounting would be,</v>

381
00:18:40.941 --> 00:18:44.270
<v Speaker 1>can play a future discounting game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll do that with you very quickly.</v>

382
00:18:44.271 --> 00:18:46.730
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to point at you and ask you</v>
<v Speaker 1>a question so you can,</v>

383
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not a trick by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to worry about your</v>

384
00:18:49.971 --> 00:18:51.140
<v Speaker 1>answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I might say,</v>

385
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.340
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal.</v>

386
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:56.540
<v Speaker 1>I can give you $10 today or I can give</v>
<v Speaker 1>you $15 in a month.</v>

387
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.750
<v Speaker 1>What would you take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

388
00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.261
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

389
00:19:00.261 --> 00:19:04.640
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give you $50 today or $50 in a year.</v>

390
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.830
<v Speaker 1>15 today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 today.</v>

391
00:19:06.831 --> 00:19:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you $5 today or $50 a year.</v>

392
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now imagine that I played that game</v>

393
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.890
<v Speaker 1>with one of you a hundred times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say or 200 times using different</v>

394
00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:21.200
<v Speaker 1>amounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small and big over different timeframes.</v>

395
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:26.120
<v Speaker 1>And what you can calculate is how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>people value the present compared to the</v>

396
00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:29.000
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you should value the present a bit</v>

397
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.470
<v Speaker 1>more than the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

398
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.633
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

399
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.370
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The future is uncertain,</v>

400
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.140
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to discount it.</v>

401
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:40.320
<v Speaker 1>So because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some probability that it isn't</v>

402
00:19:40.321 --> 00:19:42.960
<v Speaker 1>just going to occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe something will happen or</v>

403
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:44.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't be here.</v>

404
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.250
<v Speaker 1>And then the farther out you go into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

405
00:19:47.251 --> 00:19:50.790
<v Speaker 1>the more you have to discount it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes really unpredictable.</v>

406
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my experience,</v>

407
00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.530
<v Speaker 1>and I don't really know of any data to</v>
<v Speaker 1>support this,</v>

408
00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:59.370
<v Speaker 1>but my experience has been that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty hard to plan in your life.</v>

409
00:19:59.371 --> 00:20:03.150
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty hard to plan more than three</v>
<v Speaker 1>to five years into the future because,</v>

410
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>because there's so many variables that</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to the effect of the variables</v>

411
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.530
<v Speaker 1>that you're not accounting for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start to,</v>

412
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.770
<v Speaker 1>it starts to become exponential as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>move out into the future.</v>

413
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:19.310
<v Speaker 1>So you should discount the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the present is more certain.</v>

414
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Plus if you have $5 now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do something with it right now</v>

415
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 1>instead of waiting for two years to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>your 50 and so that might be useful.</v>

416
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:31.470
<v Speaker 1>But we thought that maybe conscientious</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would discount the future less</v>

417
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:33.120
<v Speaker 1>than unconscientious people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

418
00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like they would because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like delay of gratification.</v>

419
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Can you wait for your $50 and we found</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was no correlation whatsoever</v>

420
00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:44.490
<v Speaker 1>with conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people were extroverted or if you</v>

421
00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:47.100
<v Speaker 1>made them happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they just counted the future.</v>

422
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.290
<v Speaker 1>And w w the way we interpreted that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

423
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.340
<v Speaker 1>well if things are going well now you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might as well capitalize on,</v>

424
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:55.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

425
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:57.280
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if all the signals that are</v>

426
00:20:57.281 --> 00:21:00.130
<v Speaker 1>coming towards you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is a good time,</v>

427
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.350
<v Speaker 1>why not take the resources now and use</v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

428
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.710
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

429
00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 1>that's just an example of how tricky</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

430
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.950
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will notice if you know anything</v>

431
00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:12.970
<v Speaker 1>about prefrontal cortical function</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories that all of these descriptions,</v>

432
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:13.960
<v Speaker 1>planful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized,</v>

433
00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:17.800
<v Speaker 1>task oriented and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been attributed to the prefrontal</v>

434
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:20.410
<v Speaker 1>cortex butter that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>

435
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.710
<v Speaker 1>that research haven't found any evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that even though it's the prime</v>

436
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:26.650
<v Speaker 1>theory of prefrontal function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

437
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is conscientiousness associated</v>

438
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:29.830
<v Speaker 1>with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

439
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.480
<v Speaker 1>denise and Heller have showed that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you measure it over any reasonable</v>

440
00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:37.060
<v Speaker 1>amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's associated with life satisfaction</v>

441
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:39.550
<v Speaker 1>and happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might want to ask yourself,</v>

442
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:41.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is life satisfaction or happiness?</v>

443
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Which is a really good question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you measured with the</v>

444
00:21:44.651 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire because we've already</v>
<v Speaker 1>established that if you measure with a</v>

445
00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:51.430
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire or something like emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>or personality,</v>

446
00:21:51.431 --> 00:21:54.550
<v Speaker 1>you get the Big Five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not obvious that you can derive</v>

447
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:57.520
<v Speaker 1>something like a life satisfaction or</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness questionnaire and have it</v>

448
00:21:57.521 --> 00:21:59.710
<v Speaker 1>measured something separate from the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

449
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.460
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who report that they're satisfied with</v>

450
00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:08.290
<v Speaker 1>life or happy are high in extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're happy and low in neuroticism.</v>

451
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.860
<v Speaker 1>They're not unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that eats up a big chunk of the</v>

452
00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:14.110
<v Speaker 1>various and unsurprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

453
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.560
<v Speaker 1>And so that sort of puts whether you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy or satisfied with your life firmly</v>

454
00:22:17.561 --> 00:22:19.900
<v Speaker 1>in the domain of temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does turn out the</v>

455
00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness also influences that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially over longer spans of time.</v>

456
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:29.670
<v Speaker 1>So hard work pays off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's tricky too because you also</v>

457
00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:32.980
<v Speaker 1>have to understand that hard work only</v>
<v Speaker 1>pays off in a society that's very</v>

458
00:22:32.981 --> 00:22:34.940
<v Speaker 1>stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe that's part of their,</v>

459
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.590
<v Speaker 1>the reason for the association between</v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness and orderliness,</v>

460
00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:40.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe you work really hard to</v>

461
00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:42.680
<v Speaker 1>gather up your little pile of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

462
00:22:42.681 --> 00:22:44.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call acquisitions and</v>

463
00:22:44.951 --> 00:22:46.840
<v Speaker 1>assets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you need obviously.</v>

464
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.070
<v Speaker 1>And then the whole society collapses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

465
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.680
<v Speaker 1>the thugs come in and steal it all.</v>

466
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you stupid?</v>

467
00:22:52.061 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Because you should have just spent all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that money before the thugs could steal</v>

468
00:22:55.451 --> 00:22:57.580
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's obviously the case in very</v>

469
00:22:57.581 --> 00:23:01.270
<v Speaker 1>many human societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous to be industrious because</v>

470
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.420
<v Speaker 1>you'll gather up property that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable and then that just makes you a</v>

471
00:23:04.421 --> 00:23:07.030
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it might be that industriousness</v>

472
00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:09.790
<v Speaker 1>doesn't pay off without order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

473
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've also wondered too,</v>

474
00:23:12.431 --> 00:23:13.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

475
00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:15.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to you about that a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

476
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now recently a researcher face guard,</v>

477
00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:22.960
<v Speaker 1>also working with Roberts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was looking at the emotions that might</v>

478
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:27.340
<v Speaker 1>be associated with conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is rather a new approach</v>

479
00:23:27.341 --> 00:23:31.060
<v Speaker 1>because we kind of thought that we had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emotions tied up already in the big</v>

480
00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:31.571
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

481
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:34.450
<v Speaker 1>There were the positive emotions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they loaded on extroversion.</v>

482
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.940
<v Speaker 1>That's nice and simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were the negative emotions and</v>

483
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 1>they loaded gun neuroticism and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

484
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.030
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that that's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are emotions that fall</v>

485
00:23:43.031 --> 00:23:48.031
<v Speaker 1>outside of the rubric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply negative neuroticism and simply</v>

486
00:23:48.741 --> 00:23:51.680
<v Speaker 1>positive extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they seem to be what people have</v>

487
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:53.840
<v Speaker 1>often called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like social emotions.</v>

488
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:59.140
<v Speaker 1>And so those would be guilt and shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are two of them because like you</v>

489
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Speaker 1>feel guilty maybe when you haven't lived</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to an obligation.</v>

490
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 1>And so an obligation is usually</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that occurs because it's,</v>

491
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:10.940
<v Speaker 1>you're embedded in the social context</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you feel ashamed.</v>

492
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.620
<v Speaker 1>That distinction between guilt and shame</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a tricky one.</v>

493
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.230
<v Speaker 1>You feel guilt for yourself and shame in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of other people.</v>

494
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

495
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.960
<v Speaker 1>guilt won't necessarily make you turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>red,</v>

496
00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:25.760
<v Speaker 1>but shame will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>

497
00:24:25.761 --> 00:24:28.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actual behavioral displays that</v>

498
00:24:28.161 --> 00:24:32.180
<v Speaker 1>are associated with these emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that conscientiousness is</v>

499
00:24:32.181 --> 00:24:37.181
<v Speaker 1>associated with guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proneness but not the experience of</v>

500
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:39.260
<v Speaker 1>guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tricky thing.</v>

501
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:42.860
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're prone to guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that'll make you conscientious and</v>

502
00:24:42.861 --> 00:24:45.380
<v Speaker 1>if you're conscientious and now if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the things you're supposed to do,</v>

503
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.620
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to feel guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see why that would be rather</v>

504
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 1>tricky to discover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So guilt seems to be associated with</v>

505
00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:55.520
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and although this</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been assessed yet,</v>

506
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.000
<v Speaker 1>we think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be particularly associated with</v>

507
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.580
<v Speaker 1>industriousness rather than ordering</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

508
00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.120
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm pausing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not demonstrated yet.</v>

509
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.140
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm positing that is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that orderliness is associated</v>

510
00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:11.600
<v Speaker 1>with something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with sensitivity to</v>

511
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:16.601
<v Speaker 1>discussed and discussed as a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>different emotion than fear or,</v>

512
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.920
<v Speaker 1>or pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

513
00:25:18.921 --> 00:25:21.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's tricky because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

514
00:25:21.201 --> 00:25:23.390
<v Speaker 1>think of a horror movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

515
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:26.330
<v Speaker 1>so what exactly constitutes horror?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

516
00:25:26.331 --> 00:25:27.830
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

517
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.340
<v Speaker 1>what's that movie called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The witches of Blair witch project.</v>

518
00:25:32.341 --> 00:25:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the Blair witch project?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

519
00:25:34.281 --> 00:25:38.060
<v Speaker 1>The Blair witch project is all fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing ever happens in the movie.</v>

520
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.000
<v Speaker 1>It's just this horrible sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>something awful is going to happen at</v>

521
00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:42.470
<v Speaker 1>any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pure fear.</v>

522
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.020
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a horror movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the other kind of</v>

523
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:47.660
<v Speaker 1>horror movies where people get like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sought up with chainsaws.</v>

524
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.490
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well those,</v>

525
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 1>those both come under the horror rubric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the one is almost pure fear.</v>

526
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 1>And then the other is what is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly?</v>

527
00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Is it fear and disgust?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like the splatter film,</v>

528
00:26:00.481 --> 00:26:03.290
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalize on disgust and horror.</v>

529
00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:04.160
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

530
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.030
<v Speaker 1>the sense of horror is partly fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also partly discussed.</v>

531
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:13.190
<v Speaker 1>And so does disgust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sensitivity system looks very old,</v>

532
00:26:13.191 --> 00:26:16.100
<v Speaker 1>evolutionarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it looks particularly well</v>

533
00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:18.320
<v Speaker 1>developed in human beings because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that obvious.</v>

534
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:23.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not that obvious that animals show</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss the same way human beings do.</v>

535
00:26:23.961 --> 00:26:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about dogs,</v>

536
00:26:25.161 --> 00:26:25.821
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

537
00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:26.500
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

538
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.700
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything smells good to a dog,</v>

539
00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll eat virtually anything too.</v>

540
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.620
<v Speaker 1>But humans aren't like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're very picky.</v>

541
00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because we're on numerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly know.</v>

542
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:40.460
<v Speaker 1>We're very picky and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also specific facial expressions</v>

543
00:26:40.461 --> 00:26:42.140
<v Speaker 1>that are associated with disgust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

544
00:26:42.141 --> 00:26:45.690
<v Speaker 1>they're like that me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's partly an expulsion facial</v>

545
00:26:45.691 --> 00:26:47.440
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're closing your eyes so you don't</v>

546
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.140
<v Speaker 1>have to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're closing your nose so you don't</v>

547
00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:52.370
<v Speaker 1>have to smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like repulsion and re repugnant or</v>

548
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.440
<v Speaker 1>associated with disgust sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

549
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.510
<v Speaker 1>so here's the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

550
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.373
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any questions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

551
00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people that have eating disorders,</v>

552
00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 3>do you think that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you said orderliness,</v>

553
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:05.480
<v Speaker 3>you don't think that's related to deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>with as much as the</v>

554
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:11.550
<v Speaker 3>are high guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that they have any sort of,</v>

555
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:14.130
<v Speaker 3>because of sensitivity to discuss where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the video where I feel</v>

556
00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.013
<v Speaker 3>fields?</v>

557
00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:15.831
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

558
00:27:15.831 --> 00:27:18.530
<v Speaker 1>my experience has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty sensitive to discuss.</v>

559
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:22.000
<v Speaker 1>And part of that seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is this constellation that I want</v>

560
00:27:22.001 --> 00:27:24.740
<v Speaker 1>to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So being sensitive to discuss it seems</v>

561
00:27:24.741 --> 00:27:28.340
<v Speaker 1>to go along with a lot of other things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like black and white moral thinking.</v>

562
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like things are either good or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

563
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:36.010
<v Speaker 1>And there's no gray area in between him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like anorexics are like that too</v>

564
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.600
<v Speaker 1>to a great degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's black or white,</v>

565
00:27:38.601 --> 00:27:41.140
<v Speaker 1>there's no gray at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

566
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.790
<v Speaker 1>they're also very judgmental people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are orderly.</v>

567
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.610
<v Speaker 1>And I think the black and white thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes along with the,</v>

568
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.350
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the judgment.</v>

569
00:27:48.351 --> 00:27:50.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like while you read they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>well or you're not,</v>

570
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.640
<v Speaker 1>there isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no mucking about in the middle.</v>

571
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.370
<v Speaker 1>And so they're hard on themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly people,</v>

572
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.110
<v Speaker 1>but they're also hard on other people.</v>

573
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.970
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we know for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

574
00:27:58.971 --> 00:28:01.940
<v Speaker 1>is that if you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it predicts workplace success</v>

575
00:28:01.941 --> 00:28:04.100
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of thing and general</v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing,</v>

576
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.250
<v Speaker 1>if you're conscientious and you become</v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployed,</v>

577
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.440
<v Speaker 1>you're in real trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

578
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe because you're conservative in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fundamental orientation,</v>

579
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:16.330
<v Speaker 1>you think all those people without jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just fundamentally useless.</v>

580
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:18.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they just tried harder,</v>

581
00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.740
<v Speaker 1>they would get to where they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course has some truth to it,</v>

582
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.940
<v Speaker 1>but not completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you fall into that category and</v>

583
00:28:25.941 --> 00:28:28.910
<v Speaker 1>well then you're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say hoist with your own Fitara,</v>

584
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because now you're among the,</v>

585
00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.710
<v Speaker 1>the great unwashed and because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust sensitive,</v>

586
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:37.880
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to make you very happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So conscientious people suffer a lot</v>

587
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:42.830
<v Speaker 1>when things happened to them that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad because they also assume because</v>

588
00:28:42.831 --> 00:28:46.460
<v Speaker 1>they seem to be very fond of willpower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also assume that well,</v>

589
00:28:46.461 --> 00:28:49.190
<v Speaker 1>with just enough effort and with just</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough willpower,</v>

590
00:28:49.191 --> 00:28:51.680
<v Speaker 1>you can get yourself out of out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

591
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.200
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of true.</v>

592
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.600
<v Speaker 1>If you put a lot of effort into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

593
00:28:56.601 --> 00:28:58.870
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you'll do well</v>
<v Speaker 1>increases.</v>

594
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.060
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't the same as if you try</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard enough,</v>

595
00:29:02.061 --> 00:29:03.470
<v Speaker 1>you can get out of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

596
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.150
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I need and the is they're</v>

597
00:29:05.151 --> 00:29:06.200
<v Speaker 1>really matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

598
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause there's lots of things that hard</v>

599
00:29:08.331 --> 00:29:12.830
<v Speaker 1>work isn't going to get you up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes persisting and per separating</v>

600
00:29:12.831 --> 00:29:16.340
<v Speaker 1>if something is actually the wrong thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do rather than the right thing to do.</v>

601
00:29:16.341 --> 00:29:20.450
<v Speaker 1>So it's very tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the orderly types are conservative.</v>

602
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.210
<v Speaker 1>To make you conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be high in order to be this</v>

603
00:29:23.211 --> 00:29:26.750
<v Speaker 1>and low in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the more creative element of</v>

604
00:29:26.751 --> 00:29:29.000
<v Speaker 1>openness say rather than the intellect</v>
<v Speaker 1>element.</v>

605
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's interesting too because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course people tend to think that their</v>

606
00:29:33.111 --> 00:29:35.690
<v Speaker 1>political preferences established by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality,</v>

607
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a liberal because being a liberal is</v>

608
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.530
<v Speaker 1>the right way to be.</v>

609
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.740
<v Speaker 1>And here's a bunch of reasons why that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to be.</v>

610
00:29:41.741 --> 00:29:43.930
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've thought that through and that's why</v>

611
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm a liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like turns out that's probably</v>

612
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:48.490
<v Speaker 1>completely wrong or at least mostly</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

613
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.660
<v Speaker 1>You have your temperament and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament makes you intrinsically</v>

614
00:29:52.661 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 1>value certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then because you intrinsically</v>

615
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:58.600
<v Speaker 1>valued them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arguments about why those things are</v>

616
00:29:58.601 --> 00:30:01.690
<v Speaker 1>good or attractive to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you remember those arguments.</v>

617
00:30:01.691 --> 00:30:05.710
<v Speaker 1>And so liberals for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are much more concerned with harm and</v>

618
00:30:05.711 --> 00:30:09.610
<v Speaker 1>care than conservatives are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And conservatives are more concerned</v>

619
00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:12.160
<v Speaker 1>about things like purity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

620
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.360
<v Speaker 1>and those are basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

621
00:30:13.361 --> 00:30:16.300
<v Speaker 1>those are basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be concerned about both of</v>

622
00:30:16.301 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the purity issue,</v>

623
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:22.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what happens if your living</v>

624
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.270
<v Speaker 1>quarters are filthy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your hygiene habits are terrible.</v>

625
00:30:25.271 --> 00:30:28.030
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that is your house gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of parasites,</v>

626
00:30:28.031 --> 00:30:31.570
<v Speaker 1>rats and mice and bugs and you get sick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you die.</v>

627
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.150
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe people around you do too.</v>

628
00:30:34.151 --> 00:30:37.090
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purity issue really matters.</v>

629
00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:39.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to eat rotten meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to make sure it's stored</v>

630
00:30:39.521 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 1>property?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to have the rats eat all</v>

631
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:42.710
<v Speaker 1>your grain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're grading.</v>

632
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.230
<v Speaker 1>These have to be in really good order</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

633
00:30:44.231 --> 00:30:45.820
<v Speaker 1>there can't be any holes in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>

634
00:30:45.821 --> 00:30:49.730
<v Speaker 1>And so like orderliness and food</v>
<v Speaker 1>preservation and,</v>

635
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:53.530
<v Speaker 1>and preservation from illnesses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>contamination and all those sorts of</v>

636
00:30:53.531 --> 00:30:54.364
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

637
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.001
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

638
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:57.040
<v Speaker 1>that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

639
00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you can't just push that away and say</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's irrelevant.</v>

640
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:03.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not irrelevant at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

641
00:31:03.011 --> 00:31:04.900
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make it to relevant,</v>

642
00:31:04.901 --> 00:31:06.790
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you see with the</v>

643
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:09.070
<v Speaker 1>anorexics is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

644
00:31:09.071 --> 00:31:12.220
<v Speaker 1>they're so sensitive to discuss that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't stand their own bodies.</v>

645
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:14.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

646
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Because like as a body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good thing or a bad thing.</v>

647
00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Well here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>

648
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.750
<v Speaker 1>So here's an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have,</v>

649
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.680
<v Speaker 1>you give someone a sterilized cup and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

650
00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:25.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.870
<v Speaker 1>put some saliva in the cop and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it sit for 10 seconds and then you</v>

652
00:31:28.871 --> 00:31:29.531
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well drake,</v>

653
00:31:29.531 --> 00:31:32.740
<v Speaker 1>that right now in La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you record like this?</v>

654
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's discussed,</v>

655
00:31:34.131 --> 00:31:35.350
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you won't do that.</v>

656
00:31:35.351 --> 00:31:36.190
<v Speaker 1>But then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

657
00:31:36.191 --> 00:31:38.800
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you do that?</v>

658
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in your mouth like 10 seconds</v>

659
00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:43.120
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like what's the big problem while</v>

660
00:31:43.121 --> 00:31:44.410
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people won't do it.</v>

661
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.960
<v Speaker 1>And you can see a heuristic at work</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

662
00:31:46.961 --> 00:31:49.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The heuristic is don't drink saliva.</v>

663
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:55.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like moderated by any sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trivial situational determinants.</v>

664
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:58.240
<v Speaker 1>You're just not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I suspect that you do kiss your</v>

665
00:31:58.241 --> 00:32:00.940
<v Speaker 1>partner for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

666
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:01.721
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

667
00:32:01.721 --> 00:32:03.490
<v Speaker 1>well that's kind of a weird exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

668
00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:05.800
<v Speaker 1>oh well my partner turns out not to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting.</v>

669
00:32:05.801 --> 00:32:07.090
<v Speaker 1>At least that's what you hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

670
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:08.741
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

671
00:32:08.741 --> 00:32:10.120
<v Speaker 1>there's this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

672
00:32:10.121 --> 00:32:14.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's also this weird inhibitory</v>

673
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.980
<v Speaker 1>process that goes on between sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction and discuss to,</v>

674
00:32:17.981 --> 00:32:18.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

675
00:32:18.431 --> 00:32:20.880
<v Speaker 1>and the psychoanalysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

676
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.630
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought of that as something that</v>

677
00:32:22.631 --> 00:32:25.330
<v Speaker 1>was perhaps somewhat pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual guilt,</v>

678
00:32:25.331 --> 00:32:27.190
<v Speaker 1>sexual shame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust and all that.</v>

679
00:32:27.191 --> 00:32:29.080
<v Speaker 1>But far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

680
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a biological moderating factor in</v>

681
00:32:32.321 --> 00:32:34.210
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason for that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

682
00:32:34.211 --> 00:32:38.320
<v Speaker 1>just how many sexually transmitted</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases do you actually want to have,</v>

683
00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.760
<v Speaker 1>especially that many of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

684
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:42.920
<v Speaker 1>syphilis in the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man That was,</v>

685
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 1>that was deadly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was transmissible from generation to</v>

686
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:47.024
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

687
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 1>It acted like every other kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease and there wasn't any cure for</v>

688
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:52.400
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course we had aids in the</v>

689
00:32:52.401 --> 00:32:55.740
<v Speaker 1>1980s we kind of got a handle on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just bloody lock,</v>

690
00:32:55.741 --> 00:32:59.000
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a very transmissible and so</v>

691
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.530
<v Speaker 1>sexual contamination is a big issue and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it always has been for the human race</v>

692
00:33:03.531 --> 00:33:06.200
<v Speaker 1>because it turns out that sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>activities really good way of</v>

693
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:08.900
<v Speaker 1>transmitting disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

694
00:33:08.901 --> 00:33:11.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the borderline between discussed as</v>

695
00:33:11.391 --> 00:33:15.950
<v Speaker 1>something that protects you in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and discussed as something that turns</v>

696
00:33:15.951 --> 00:33:17.600
<v Speaker 1>you off of life completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

697
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a really tight and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and contradictory set of like mutual</v>

698
00:33:23.571 --> 00:33:25.970
<v Speaker 1>inhibiting forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real problem for people.</v>

699
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:29.570
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

700
00:33:29.571 --> 00:33:30.141
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

701
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:32.030
<v Speaker 1>so what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you have orderliness?</v>

702
00:33:32.031 --> 00:33:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orderly people are black and white</v>

703
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:35.210
<v Speaker 1>thinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're judgmental.</v>

704
00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.910
<v Speaker 1>If you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you show orderly,</v>

705
00:33:37.911 --> 00:33:41.900
<v Speaker 1>people imagine that you have them dis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you described to them some kind of</v>

706
00:33:41.901 --> 00:33:45.860
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe it's living off the fruits of</v>

707
00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:46.670
<v Speaker 1>prostitution.</v>

708
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.860
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you talk to them about a pimp</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

709
00:33:48.861 --> 00:33:50.840
<v Speaker 1>you give them a little story about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pimp and then you say,</v>

710
00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:53.330
<v Speaker 1>how long should this pimp you thrown in</v>
<v Speaker 1>jail?</v>

711
00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like the orderly people think you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just lock them up,</v>

712
00:33:55.971 --> 00:33:57.110
<v Speaker 1>throw away the key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

713
00:33:57.111 --> 00:33:57.820
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

714
00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.110
<v Speaker 1>they judged moral transgressions very</v>
<v Speaker 1>harshly.</v>

715
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.810
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the aspect that's</v>

716
00:34:02.811 --> 00:34:05.210
<v Speaker 1>judgmental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're nodding Galitary and either they</v>

717
00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:07.940
<v Speaker 1>don't think that everybody should have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same amount all the time.</v>

718
00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:10.520
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty interested in hierarchy</v>

719
00:34:10.521 --> 00:34:12.230
<v Speaker 1>and structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

720
00:34:12.231 --> 00:34:14.150
<v Speaker 1>there's some real advantages to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

721
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think that they'd be happier in</v>

722
00:34:17.521 --> 00:34:21.200
<v Speaker 1>an egalitarian situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with the egalitarian</v>

723
00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:23.840
<v Speaker 1>situations is people are always arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

724
00:34:23.841 --> 00:34:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Because no one's right in an egalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

725
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:28.370
<v Speaker 1>There just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody gets to have their opinion and</v>

726
00:34:28.371 --> 00:34:29.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

727
00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.810
<v Speaker 1>when are we going to stop with all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions and do something.</v>

728
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:37.070
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about a hierarchy is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage to a hierarchy is there are</v>

729
00:34:37.071 --> 00:34:40.250
<v Speaker 1>things you are responsible for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also things you're not</v>

730
00:34:40.251 --> 00:34:42.650
<v Speaker 1>responsible for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big advantage.</v>

731
00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:45.740
<v Speaker 1>And then you also know who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for those things.</v>

732
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:49.910
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like people are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable in hierarchies then they</v>

733
00:34:49.911 --> 00:34:53.000
<v Speaker 1>think even if they're liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting to be.</v>

734
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.510
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things seem to chunk together.</v>

735
00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Now the industrious people also seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to climb up the hierarchy,</v>

736
00:35:00.081 --> 00:35:02.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know that industrious people</v>

737
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.790
<v Speaker 1>become more successful as they move</v>
<v Speaker 1>through life.</v>

738
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:06.740
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's sort of a motivation.</v>

739
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.280
<v Speaker 1>But then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the investment is person trying to</v>

740
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:14.570
<v Speaker 1>get to the top or is the industrious</v>
<v Speaker 1>person trying to get the hell away from</v>

741
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:17.390
<v Speaker 1>the bottom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my suspicions are that the</v>

742
00:35:17.391 --> 00:35:20.060
<v Speaker 1>industrious person is trying like hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get away from the bottom.</v>

743
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:21.910
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be down there with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

744
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:22.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

745
00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:25.940
<v Speaker 1>the unemployed and the great unwashed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now why?</v>

746
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a bunch of reasons.</v>

747
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.520
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know pretty clearly that if you're in</v>

748
00:35:31.521 --> 00:35:35.330
<v Speaker 1>a dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the closer you are to the bottom of the</v>

749
00:35:35.331 --> 00:35:37.650
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you to die.</v>

750
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.070
<v Speaker 1>So when that's independent of absolute</v>
<v Speaker 1>income,</v>

751
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.950
<v Speaker 1>like obviously if you're poor enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to make a difference cause</v>

752
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:45.210
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to starve to death.</v>

753
00:35:45.211 --> 00:35:48.660
<v Speaker 1>But assuming you have enough money to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of your basic needs,</v>

754
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.450
<v Speaker 1>then dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy position is a big determinant</v>

755
00:35:51.451 --> 00:35:54.030
<v Speaker 1>of mortality even in heart disease and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

756
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:59.120
<v Speaker 1>and more if you look at songbirds or any</v>
<v Speaker 1>other kind of animal that lives in the</v>

757
00:35:59.221 --> 00:36:01.350
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty much the case for all</v>

758
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you have a garment in Turkey</v>

759
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:07.560
<v Speaker 1>of songbirds in your neighborhood and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the high dominant songbirds.</v>

760
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.120
<v Speaker 1>So there may be industrious songbirds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get the best nest and then you</v>

761
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:13.710
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what is the best nest mean?</v>

762
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's close to nesting material so they</v>

763
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:19.160
<v Speaker 1>don't have to like exert a lot of energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>building the nest and it,</v>

764
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dry when it rains,</v>

765
00:36:20.881 --> 00:36:23.670
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good thing because then</v>
<v Speaker 1>their eggs don't get wet and get cold</v>

766
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.340
<v Speaker 1>and there aren't a lot of predators look</v>
<v Speaker 1>lurking around and it's well hidden and,</v>

767
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:30.000
<v Speaker 1>and it's well ventilated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a bunch of things that make</v>

768
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.380
<v Speaker 1>an optimal nesting site really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of birds and some of</v>

769
00:36:34.381 --> 00:36:36.450
<v Speaker 1>them have great nesting sites and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them have like,</v>

770
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slum nesting sites.</v>

771
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:41.640
<v Speaker 1>And then some kind of epidemic comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

772
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Guess what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The birds die from the bottom of the</v>

773
00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:46.860
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy upwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

774
00:36:46.861 --> 00:36:48.690
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the ones at the bottom are</v>

775
00:36:48.691 --> 00:36:52.050
<v Speaker 1>chronically stressed and stress shuts</v>
<v Speaker 1>off your immune system.</v>

776
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:55.590
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like poof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Epidemic comes through dead.</v>

777
00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:00.740
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that may well</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been built into human beings as the</v>

778
00:37:00.781 --> 00:37:04.770
<v Speaker 1>biological basis of industriousness is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the desire to get the hell away from the</v>

779
00:37:04.771 --> 00:37:07.950
<v Speaker 1>bottom of a dormant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Harkey as fast as possible because</v>

780
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:10.450
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to die if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>

781
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.620
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that your trait preferences have</v>

782
00:37:13.621 --> 00:37:16.110
<v Speaker 1>emerged as a consequence of evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

783
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.410
<v Speaker 1>And if the bottom of the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy happens to be the place where</v>

784
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:20.470
<v Speaker 1>diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

785
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly how it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course you should be motivated</v>

786
00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:28.650
<v Speaker 1>to get the hell out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think a lot of the class</v>

787
00:37:28.651 --> 00:37:33.570
<v Speaker 1>distinctions that people draw and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to have markers of status and so</v>

788
00:37:33.571 --> 00:37:38.571
<v Speaker 1>on are are a reflection of their high</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation to be associated with the</v>

789
00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:43.500
<v Speaker 1>high levels of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the economic classes.</v>

790
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Here's something interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

791
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:48.840
<v Speaker 1>you know that names go down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

792
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what are you gonna name your</v>

793
00:37:50.671 --> 00:37:54.570
<v Speaker 1>children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the origin nater of names are the</v>

794
00:37:54.571 --> 00:37:57.180
<v Speaker 1>people at the top of the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard and you know,</v>

795
00:37:57.181 --> 00:38:01.890
<v Speaker 1>and then once they established the names</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the next group starts to copy them</v>

796
00:38:01.891 --> 00:38:04.890
<v Speaker 1>and then the next group copies them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time the name gets</v>

797
00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:07.350
<v Speaker 1>common at the bottom of the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

798
00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:09.180
<v Speaker 1>the people at the top are no longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>using it.</v>

799
00:38:09.181 --> 00:38:10.620
<v Speaker 1>They've got some other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave's figured out.</v>

800
00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:15.000
<v Speaker 1>And so names get not only generated that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way but also recycled that way.</v>

801
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:17.700
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you never want to underestimate the</v>

802
00:38:17.701 --> 00:38:21.420
<v Speaker 1>motivation of people to not be at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the dominance hierarchy.</v>

803
00:38:21.421 --> 00:38:24.030
<v Speaker 1>And so it's kind of the reverse of</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement motivation,</v>

804
00:38:24.031 --> 00:38:25.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like getting away.</v>

805
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:30.300
<v Speaker 1>But if conscientiousness is mostly</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with these kind of negative</v>

806
00:38:30.301 --> 00:38:31.290
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt,</v>

807
00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:32.970
<v Speaker 1>shame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and disgust,</v>

808
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 1>then those are all getting away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

809
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

810
00:38:37.271 --> 00:38:38.890
<v Speaker 1>it's good to go that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emotions.</v>

811
00:38:38.891 --> 00:38:41.740
<v Speaker 1>But those would be more associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion and openness.</v>

812
00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.190
<v Speaker 1>So when conscientious people seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>dutiful,</v>

813
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.280
<v Speaker 1>so they're not doing things because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're interested in them.</v>

814
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.290
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would say,</v>

815
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.270
<v Speaker 1>who the hell cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested in it,</v>

816
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.180
<v Speaker 1>do it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a good citizen does.</v>

817
00:38:55.181 --> 00:38:56.500
<v Speaker 1>And of course there's some truth in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

818
00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:57.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do your damn duty.</v>

819
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:59.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

820
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:02.530
<v Speaker 1>so you kind of get the sense of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is,</v>

821
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.400
<v Speaker 1>is structured now that's often be called</v>
<v Speaker 1>a behavioral immune system.</v>

822
00:39:06.401 --> 00:39:10.150
<v Speaker 1>So the other thing we know about orderly</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and conservatives is there,</v>

823
00:39:10.151 --> 00:39:11.950
<v Speaker 1>anti-immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

824
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.580
<v Speaker 1>and their aunt and their xenophobics or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're much more pro in group and</v>

825
00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.550
<v Speaker 1>they're quite harshly judgmental in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their attitudes towards nonstandard</v>

826
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.590
<v Speaker 1>sexual behavior.</v>

827
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.100
<v Speaker 1>And you can explain that all in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>contamination fear.</v>

828
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:26.410
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think to,</v>

829
00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

830
00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.430
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what happened to the native</v>

831
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Americans when the European showed out</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay because the Europeans,</v>

832
00:39:32.711 --> 00:39:34.780
<v Speaker 1>they lived in these like filthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filthy cities.</v>

833
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.810
<v Speaker 1>They're just crammed together and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived with their animals too.</v>

834
00:39:37.811 --> 00:39:40.390
<v Speaker 1>So like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were parasite written and they had</v>

835
00:39:40.391 --> 00:39:43.270
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of diseases but they got it</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

836
00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:45.790
<v Speaker 1>good immune systems functioning as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>

837
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:46.780
<v Speaker 1>And over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

838
00:39:46.781 --> 00:39:50.620
<v Speaker 1>a period of a long period of time they</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed immunity to things that would</v>

839
00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:51.730
<v Speaker 1>have otherwise killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

840
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.310
<v Speaker 1>well chicken pox and measles and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>

841
00:39:54.311 --> 00:39:57.460
<v Speaker 1>So the Europeans came over to North</v>
<v Speaker 1>America and they shook hands with the</v>

842
00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:58.600
<v Speaker 1>natives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like Poof,</v>

843
00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:02.500
<v Speaker 1>95% of them died in the next 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>

844
00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:05.410
<v Speaker 1>by the time the settlers came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plymouth Rock,</v>

845
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pilgrims,</v>

846
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.570
<v Speaker 1>there are so few native Americans</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughed that they were happy to see them</v>

847
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:12.370
<v Speaker 1>cause they couldn't get the damn crops</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

848
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:15.940
<v Speaker 1>There were enough people left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the reason that North America</v>

849
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:19.930
<v Speaker 1>looked empty when the European showed up</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because three successive waves of</v>

850
00:40:19.931 --> 00:40:24.840
<v Speaker 1>absolutely catastrophic plagues had</v>
<v Speaker 1>decimated the entire population of the,</v>

851
00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.590
<v Speaker 1>of the continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

852
00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:28.480
<v Speaker 1>in the same thing still happens when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

853
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.570
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

854
00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:34.990
<v Speaker 1>when in places like Brazil and Peru when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find isolated native groups in the</v>

855
00:40:34.991 --> 00:40:37.720
<v Speaker 1>jungle because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that still happens now and then it's</v>

856
00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:38.351
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

857
00:40:38.351 --> 00:40:40.030
<v Speaker 1>some natives shake your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>

858
00:40:40.031 --> 00:40:43.120
<v Speaker 1>they're all dead in like a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

859
00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:48.320
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foreign person is a danger has,</v>

860
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:54.900
<v Speaker 1>has been like critically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>critically correct for much of human</v>

861
00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:57.340
<v Speaker 1>developmental history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real problem,</v>

862
00:40:57.341 --> 00:40:59.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously in the modern world we</v>

863
00:40:59.501 --> 00:41:02.830
<v Speaker 1>better get along with everybody because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we're all powerful enough to</v>

864
00:41:02.831 --> 00:41:04.290
<v Speaker 1>wipe each other out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

865
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.900
<v Speaker 1>the problem is is you might think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like xenophobia,</v>

866
00:41:07.901 --> 00:41:10.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preference for your own group and out</v>

867
00:41:10.161 --> 00:41:11.170
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

868
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.230
<v Speaker 1>prejudice and that kind of thing as like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cognitive issue.</v>

869
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.570
<v Speaker 1>While you could just sort it out if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it properly,</v>

870
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.840
<v Speaker 1>but this is all this research indicates</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot worse than that.</v>

871
00:41:19.841 --> 00:41:23.950
<v Speaker 1>It's some sense because it's grounded in</v>
<v Speaker 1>something much deeper and nor reason</v>

872
00:41:23.951 --> 00:41:26.500
<v Speaker 1>grounded in something much deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be grounded in something</v>

873
00:41:26.501 --> 00:41:28.330
<v Speaker 1>that's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

874
00:41:28.331 --> 00:41:31.300
<v Speaker 1>If you're not disgust sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then your hygiene habits aren't</v>

875
00:41:31.301 --> 00:41:32.980
<v Speaker 1>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you get sick more.</v>

876
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Plus you don't work as hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your life isn't as good,</v>

877
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:36.820
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

878
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:41.430
<v Speaker 1>it's another one of those examples where</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the virtue is and where the vices</v>

879
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.310
<v Speaker 1>is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to tell.</v>

880
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to read this.</v>

881
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:50.090
<v Speaker 1>This is from a paper that I wrote with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with one of my students named Jacob</v>

882
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Hersch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't published this paper yet.</v>

883
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I want to read it to you because like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

884
00:41:53.481 --> 00:41:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't have this information at hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>point as well as I would like to.</v>

885
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.900
<v Speaker 1>So this way I can get the information to</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

886
00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Disgust is considered to be one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic human emotions defined by a strong</v>

887
00:42:03.981 --> 00:42:07.290
<v Speaker 1>revulsion and desire to withdraw from</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlisting stimulus or event.</v>

888
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Darwin noted this fact that 1872 so he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the first person to note that</v>

889
00:42:11.271 --> 00:42:14.120
<v Speaker 1>discussed was a basic emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically disgust.</v>

890
00:42:14.121 --> 00:42:17.900
<v Speaker 1>It's accompanied by a distinct facial</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression involving constriction of the</v>

891
00:42:17.901 --> 00:42:19.850
<v Speaker 1>oral and nasal cavities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

892
00:42:19.851 --> 00:42:21.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's a really good way to insult</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

893
00:42:21.681 --> 00:42:24.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do to really insult</v>

894
00:42:24.021 --> 00:42:25.750
<v Speaker 1>someone's making discussed face at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mar.</v>

895
00:42:25.751 --> 00:42:28.370
<v Speaker 1>It's something they said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really do not like that because</v>

896
00:42:28.371 --> 00:42:32.090
<v Speaker 1>basically what you're saying is you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a parasite or an infectious</v>

897
00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:36.150
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evolutionary models of discuss propose</v>

898
00:42:36.151 --> 00:42:40.100
<v Speaker 1>that this emotion involved to help us</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid contaminated or harmful foods or</v>

899
00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:44.540
<v Speaker 1>other potential sources of diseases such</v>
<v Speaker 1>as sexual content in addition to its</v>

900
00:42:44.541 --> 00:42:48.710
<v Speaker 1>role in directly helping to expel</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmful foods from the body discussed</v>

901
00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:51.950
<v Speaker 1>also forms an important component of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral immune system.</v>

902
00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:56.510
<v Speaker 1>The suite of psychological mechanisms</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aid in the detection and avoidance</v>

903
00:42:56.511 --> 00:43:00.650
<v Speaker 1>of potential contaminants before they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can make contact with the body means</v>

904
00:43:00.651 --> 00:43:02.570
<v Speaker 1>obsessive compulsive disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

905
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.090
<v Speaker 1>people will touch something that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>regard as contaminated,</v>

906
00:43:05.091 --> 00:43:08.450
<v Speaker 1>then rush off to wash their hands and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wash and wash and wash.</v>

907
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.610
<v Speaker 1>If some of them are washed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delete the soaps,</v>

908
00:43:10.611 --> 00:43:12.470
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll have showers until they run out</v>

909
00:43:12.471 --> 00:43:14.990
<v Speaker 1>of hot water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they just can't stop.</v>

910
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.850
<v Speaker 1>That's part of obsessive compulsive</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>

911
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:19.190
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's a disorder of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>

912
00:43:19.191 --> 00:43:21.620
<v Speaker 1>even though it's classified with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorders,</v>

913
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.810
<v Speaker 1>harsh inducing disgust responses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether via a foul order,</v>

914
00:43:26.811 --> 00:43:30.350
<v Speaker 1>a disgusting work environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or we calling it disgusting experience</v>

915
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.100
<v Speaker 1>leads individuals to assign harsher</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishments to others who had committed</v>

916
00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:35.730
<v Speaker 1>moral transgressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>

917
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Here's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if your judges,</v>

918
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:41.960
<v Speaker 1>if your judge is easily disgusted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've done something relatively</v>

919
00:43:41.961 --> 00:43:42.530
<v Speaker 1>disgusting.</v>

920
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe if the court room doesn't smell</v>
<v Speaker 1>so good that day,</v>

921
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.850
<v Speaker 1>well then you're going to end up in jail</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

922
00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.980
<v Speaker 1>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the worst situation.</v>

923
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.860
<v Speaker 1>You go into cart and you're applying for</v>
<v Speaker 1>parole.</v>

924
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just before lunch and the court</v>

925
00:43:55.901 --> 00:43:58.280
<v Speaker 1>room doesn't smell good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're not gonna get parole</v>

926
00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:02.060
<v Speaker 1>because Hungary judges are much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to deny you parole.</v>

927
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:06.740
<v Speaker 1>And then of course judges who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive to discuss are going to regard</v>

928
00:44:06.741 --> 00:44:09.410
<v Speaker 1>your moral transgression as harsher and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can prime that.</v>

929
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.460
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the data showed that judges</v>

930
00:44:13.461 --> 00:44:17.210
<v Speaker 1>after lunch or like 70% more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grant parole.</v>

931
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:20.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's whether or not the judge</v>
<v Speaker 1>is hungry is more,</v>

932
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:23.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a bigger determinant of whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not you get parole than what you've</v>

933
00:44:23.751 --> 00:44:25.280
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really quite,</v>

934
00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.620
<v Speaker 1>it's really quite funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

935
00:44:27.621 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 1>unless you're up for parole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harsher moral judgments can even be</v>

936
00:44:32.131 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 1>induced following the consumption of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter drink because people are often</v>

937
00:44:35.611 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 1>disgusted by bitterness and addition the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same disgust related facial expressions</v>

938
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:42.480
<v Speaker 1>or observed in response to unpleasant</v>
<v Speaker 1>tastes,</v>

939
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:46.920
<v Speaker 1>disgusting photographs and receiving</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfair treatment in an economic game.</v>

940
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.580
<v Speaker 1>So our sense of justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird thing.</v>

941
00:44:50.581 --> 00:44:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Our sense of justice seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would guess that day that it's,</v>

942
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.670
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's centered in our,</v>

943
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a biological perspective in the</v>

944
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:03.300
<v Speaker 1>systems that mediate discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've seen this,</v>

945
00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:04.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among people who've,</v>

946
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.930
<v Speaker 1>who've received an injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

947
00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:08.910
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some things being done to them that's</v>

948
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:11.970
<v Speaker 1>not good and they're often unable to let</v>
<v Speaker 1>it go,</v>

949
00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.420
<v Speaker 1>partly because they're disgusted with</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves for not responding to it</v>

950
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:16.770
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

951
00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:19.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone throws a dark at you and then</v>

952
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 1>it's like you have a moral obligation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>respond to that,</v>

953
00:45:22.021 --> 00:45:24.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about it as anger or</v>

954
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.720
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But part of it also seems to be that</v>

955
00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:31.350
<v Speaker 1>you're ashamed if you don't respond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that sort of thing</v>

956
00:45:31.351 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 1>happening in cultures of honor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

957
00:45:33.451 --> 00:45:36.030
<v Speaker 1>where if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if purity is violated,</v>

958
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:38.130
<v Speaker 1>you see these in these situations where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

959
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:41.430
<v Speaker 1>a father maybe kills his daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which happens reasonably often because</v>

960
00:45:41.431 --> 00:45:43.260
<v Speaker 1>she's violating some sort of social</v>
<v Speaker 1>norm.</v>

961
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Part of the idea is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

962
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:50.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't respond harshly to</v>

963
00:45:50.101 --> 00:45:52.110
<v Speaker 1>something that's associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>

964
00:45:52.111 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 1>then you bring dishonor on your entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and maybe your own,</v>

965
00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:56.700
<v Speaker 1>your entire community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

966
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.710
<v Speaker 1>we don't like that sort of thinking in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the west,</v>

967
00:45:58.711 --> 00:46:00.270
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

968
00:46:00.271 --> 00:46:04.200
<v Speaker 1>but the reasons that we don't approve of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thinking,</v>

969
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:08.040
<v Speaker 1>we think it's because we're liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think the evidence suggests that</v>

970
00:46:08.041 --> 00:46:11.280
<v Speaker 1>the reason that we don't approve of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of behaviors is because we</v>

971
00:46:11.281 --> 00:46:13.950
<v Speaker 1>live in a very clean environment and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have plumbing.</v>

972
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And so there's all sorts of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do that reduced the probability that</v>

973
00:46:18.091 --> 00:46:22.140
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be contaminated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>parasites or infectious diseases.</v>

974
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.560
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that we don't feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's necessary to respond as</v>

975
00:46:25.561 --> 00:46:27.960
<v Speaker 1>harshly to moral transgressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

976
00:46:27.961 --> 00:46:29.310
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I doubt it,</v>

977
00:46:29.311 --> 00:46:31.650
<v Speaker 1>but let me show you the evidence because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

978
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.180
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievable.</v>

979
00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Concerns about cleanliness and feelings</v>
<v Speaker 1>of disgust have likewise been related to</v>

980
00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:40.710
<v Speaker 1>political attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>situational reminders of the importance</v>

981
00:46:40.711 --> 00:46:44.160
<v Speaker 1>of physical cleanliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as asking participants to wipe</v>

982
00:46:44.161 --> 00:46:47.910
<v Speaker 1>their hands with antiseptic wipes tends</v>
<v Speaker 1>to increase self reported political</v>

983
00:46:47.911 --> 00:46:51.390
<v Speaker 1>conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a finding is consistent with the</v>

984
00:46:51.391 --> 00:46:54.870
<v Speaker 1>notion that purity tends to be valued</v>
<v Speaker 1>more by conservatives than by liberals.</v>

985
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Individuals who report being disgusted</v>
<v Speaker 1>more easily also tend to hold more</v>

986
00:46:59.251 --> 00:47:02.010
<v Speaker 1>conservative political views on topics</v>
<v Speaker 1>including abortion,</v>

987
00:47:02.011 --> 00:47:03.210
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tax cuts,</v>

988
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:06.570
<v Speaker 1>and affirmative action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition to the effects that have</v>

989
00:47:06.571 --> 00:47:09.420
<v Speaker 1>emerged when using self report disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity,</v>

990
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:13.050
<v Speaker 1>more conservative political views have</v>
<v Speaker 1>also been associated with stronger</v>

991
00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:15.630
<v Speaker 1>physiological reactivity to disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 1>images.</v>

992
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:20.900
<v Speaker 1>We've found that conservatives are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only more aroused by disgusting</v>

993
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:24.330
<v Speaker 1>stimulant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more aroused by any stimuli.</v>

994
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

995
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.840
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name it,</v>

996
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 1>it affects the conservative than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal.</v>

997
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Speaker 1>And then we've also found that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>put,</v>

998
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.770
<v Speaker 1>you take undergraduates and you expose</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to videos,</v>

999
00:47:36.771 --> 00:47:39.160
<v Speaker 1>but induced various physiological</v>
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>

1000
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.600
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sadness,</v>

1001
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.040
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust.</v>

1002
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:45.220
<v Speaker 1>And then we also asked people how long</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was since the last eight.</v>

1003
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put people in one of those</v>

1004
00:47:48.461 --> 00:47:51.820
<v Speaker 1>emotional or motivational states and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you show them political speeches,</v>

1005
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 1>the more emotional they are or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hungrier,</v>

1006
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:57.340
<v Speaker 1>the more they like conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches.</v>

1007
00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.880
<v Speaker 1>So that was actually very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1008
00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.200
<v Speaker 1>a large literature is converged on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>notion that there are two core</v>

1009
00:48:05.201 --> 00:48:07.330
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of conservative political</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology,</v>

1010
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:10.750
<v Speaker 1>resistance to change and tolerance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality.</v>

1011
00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Resistance to change reflects the extent</v>

1012
00:48:14.351 --> 00:48:16.600
<v Speaker 1>to which people wish to maintain the</v>
<v Speaker 1>status quo.</v>

1013
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.870
<v Speaker 1>While tolerance of inequality reflects</v>
<v Speaker 1>the acceptance of an unequal</v>

1014
00:48:19.871 --> 00:48:23.500
<v Speaker 1>distribution of resources and</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities within society.</v>

1015
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:26.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's the sort of the idea that the</v>

1016
00:48:26.321 --> 00:48:31.321
<v Speaker 1>bash rise to the top and the best is</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral judgment and the top is the right</v>

1017
00:48:31.721 --> 00:48:33.310
<v Speaker 1>place for the best people to be.</v>

1018
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.570
<v Speaker 1>And then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1019
00:48:34.571 --> 00:48:37.300
<v Speaker 1>why is the top the best?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1020
00:48:37.301 --> 00:48:38.740
<v Speaker 1>why did we assume that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1021
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:40.630
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of a dominance hierarchy is the</v>

1022
00:48:40.631 --> 00:48:41.670
<v Speaker 1>right place to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1023
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:45.220
<v Speaker 1>part of it is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the closer you are to the top of</v>

1024
00:48:45.221 --> 00:48:46.930
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a male,</v>

1025
00:48:46.931 --> 00:48:48.760
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1026
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:49.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1027
00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.870
<v Speaker 1>be attractive to people of the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

1028
00:48:52.871 --> 00:48:54.100
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly it,</v>

1029
00:48:54.101 --> 00:48:56.770
<v Speaker 1>but then this other thing seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1030
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.650
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a better place to be at the top</v>

1031
00:48:59.651 --> 00:49:02.650
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cleaner and safer and there are</v>

1032
00:49:02.651 --> 00:49:06.250
<v Speaker 1>more resources there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that accounts,</v>

1033
00:49:06.251 --> 00:49:09.130
<v Speaker 1>at least in part for the judgment of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were at the bottom of the</v>

1034
00:49:09.131 --> 00:49:12.790
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these two dimensions of you're</v>

1035
00:49:12.791 --> 00:49:16.330
<v Speaker 1>roughly aligned with social and economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism as expressed in the</v>

1036
00:49:16.331 --> 00:49:19.360
<v Speaker 1>constructs of right wing</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism and social dominance</v>

1037
00:49:19.361 --> 00:49:20.820
<v Speaker 1>orientation respectable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you,</v>

1038
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.260
<v Speaker 1>which you could measure hypothetically</v>
<v Speaker 1>with questionnaires.</v>

1039
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:28.620
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>these core facets of conservatism are</v>

1040
00:49:28.881 --> 00:49:32.510
<v Speaker 1>also closely related to to higher order</v>
<v Speaker 1>value dimensions described in moral</v>

1041
00:49:32.511 --> 00:49:35.450
<v Speaker 1>foundations theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which reflect preferences for order and</v>

1042
00:49:35.451 --> 00:49:39.080
<v Speaker 1>tradition on the one hand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>preferences for egalitarianism on the</v>

1043
00:49:39.081 --> 00:49:39.914
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1044
00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:43.931
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll,</v>

1045
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:47.090
<v Speaker 1>we'll leave that part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Political conservatives conservatism</v>

1046
00:49:47.091 --> 00:49:51.500
<v Speaker 1>confess be thought of as a social immune</v>
<v Speaker 1>system reflecting the extension of</v>

1047
00:49:51.501 --> 00:49:55.550
<v Speaker 1>pathogen avoidance mechanisms to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity of the social system.</v>

1048
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Just as the behavioral immune system has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been conceptualized as helping to</v>

1049
00:49:59.331 --> 00:50:02.330
<v Speaker 1>maintain the purity and integrity of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual body.</v>

1050
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:06.350
<v Speaker 1>So to May the same pathogen avoidance</v>
<v Speaker 1>system help to maintain the abstract</v>

1051
00:50:06.351 --> 00:50:10.040
<v Speaker 1>integrity of the social order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In particular,</v>

1052
00:50:10.041 --> 00:50:13.490
<v Speaker 1>the social immune system would help to</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain order by suppressing any</v>

1053
00:50:13.491 --> 00:50:18.170
<v Speaker 1>actions or individuals to deviate from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group's accepted social traditions.</v>

1054
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:22.190
<v Speaker 1>So it has been reported,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

1055
00:50:22.191 --> 00:50:26.420
<v Speaker 1>that regions with higher levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease preference prevalence tend to be</v>

1056
00:50:26.421 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 1>associated higher levels of social</v>
<v Speaker 1>conformity and autocratic rule.</v>

1057
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Individuals who feel more vulnerable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease likewise report higher levels of</v>

1058
00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:36.470
<v Speaker 1>ethnocentrism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>xenophobia.</v>

1059
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Such basic concerns about pathogen</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoidance be does contribute to the</v>

1060
00:50:40.611 --> 00:50:44.540
<v Speaker 1>desire for order and tradition among</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives along with the harsh moral</v>

1061
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:47.270
<v Speaker 1>judgements associated with violations of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social order.</v>

1062
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:50.510
<v Speaker 1>In particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>severe moral judgements may be a key</v>

1063
00:50:50.511 --> 00:50:54.320
<v Speaker 1>mechanism by which the social immune</v>
<v Speaker 1>system instantiated in conservative</v>

1064
00:50:54.321 --> 00:50:58.820
<v Speaker 1>practices and policies aims to eliminate</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure to deviate social elements that</v>

1065
00:50:58.821 --> 00:51:02.810
<v Speaker 1>may increase the risk pathogen exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1066
00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.510
<v Speaker 1>now we wrote that about two years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1067
00:51:05.511 --> 00:51:08.420
<v Speaker 1>There was a paper published about three</v>
<v Speaker 1>months ago in plause one which you can</v>

1068
00:51:08.421 --> 00:51:10.250
<v Speaker 1>look up online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got the reference for it here.</v>

1069
00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This paper is absolutely mind boggling,</v>

1070
00:51:12.741 --> 00:51:15.830
<v Speaker 1>so I told you guys what effect sizes are</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

1071
00:51:15.831 --> 00:51:19.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 0.2 that's pretty good 0.3 that's</v>

1072
00:51:19.071 --> 00:51:23.420
<v Speaker 1>larger than about two thirds of social</v>
<v Speaker 1>science studies published 0.5 it's like,</v>

1073
00:51:23.421 --> 00:51:25.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dancing on moon because you just</v>

1074
00:51:25.491 --> 00:51:28.430
<v Speaker 1>don't get a correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To a 0.5 between two things.</v>

1075
00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're extraordinarily lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 95th percentile effect size.</v>

1076
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this paper was published about three</v>

1077
00:51:34.881 --> 00:51:37.370
<v Speaker 1>months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to read you the abstract.</v>

1078
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to show you briefly</v>

1079
00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:42.380
<v Speaker 1>show you the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the parasite stress</v>

1080
00:51:42.381 --> 00:51:44.840
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governments are more</v>

1081
00:51:44.841 --> 00:51:48.800
<v Speaker 1>likely to emerge in regions</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by high prevalence of</v>

1082
00:51:48.801 --> 00:51:52.460
<v Speaker 1>disease causing pathogens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recent cross national evidence is</v>

1083
00:51:52.461 --> 00:51:56.150
<v Speaker 1>consistent with this hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are inferential limitations</v>

1084
00:51:56.151 --> 00:51:58.490
<v Speaker 1>associated with the evidence because</v>
<v Speaker 1>salad,</v>

1085
00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what direction that</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction relationship is.</v>

1086
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:04.920
<v Speaker 1>We report to studies that address some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those limitations and provide further</v>

1087
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:09.970
<v Speaker 1>tests of the hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Study one revealed that parasite</v>

1088
00:52:10.641 --> 00:52:12.770
<v Speaker 1>prevalence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's parasites or infectious</v>

1089
00:52:12.771 --> 00:52:17.771
<v Speaker 1>diseases predicted strongly predicted</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross national differences on measures</v>

1090
00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:21.960
<v Speaker 1>assessing individual's authoritarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities and this effect</v>

1091
00:52:21.961 --> 00:52:25.460
<v Speaker 1>statistically mediated the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>between parasite prevalence and</v>

1092
00:52:25.461 --> 00:52:28.010
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

1093
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:33.560
<v Speaker 1>More infectious diseases in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more likely the individuals in that</v>

1094
00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:38.270
<v Speaker 1>area are to have authoritarian political</v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs and it's the authoritarian,</v>

1095
00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.940
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian political beliefs of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1096
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:44.600
<v Speaker 1>the individuals in the area that</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces the authoritarian government.</v>

1097
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:47.960
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't pathogen prevalence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian government,</v>

1098
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a top down thing.</v>

1099
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:55.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a bottom up thing and it's driven</v>
<v Speaker 1>by individuals and that seems to be</v>

1100
00:52:55.371 --> 00:52:58.550
<v Speaker 1>driven by just how likely they are to</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch something that's nasty and</v>

1101
00:52:58.551 --> 00:53:00.530
<v Speaker 1>infectious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>

1102
00:53:00.531 --> 00:53:02.890
<v Speaker 1>well in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the probability you're going</v>

1103
00:53:02.891 --> 00:53:05.330
<v Speaker 1>to catch something nasty and infectious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1104
00:53:05.331 --> 00:53:06.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>

1105
00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.180
<v Speaker 1>So you're liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1106
00:53:08.181 --> 00:53:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that be something if that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the case,</v>

1107
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:13.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the west is liberal because it</v>

1108
00:53:13.131 --> 00:53:17.270
<v Speaker 1>has plumbing or could easily be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean plumbing is no trivial thing,</v>

1109
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That mean you think of all the things</v>

1110
00:53:19.011 --> 00:53:21.620
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do without.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like in Canada,</v>

1111
00:53:21.621 --> 00:53:24.820
<v Speaker 1>plumbing would be number one and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he would be number two more.</v>

1112
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you would reverse those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's way the hell up their</v>

1113
00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:32.940
<v Speaker 1>study to have tested the parasite stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis on a sample of traditional</v>

1114
00:53:32.941 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 1>small scale studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>results revealed that parasite</v>

1115
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:40.110
<v Speaker 1>prevalence predicted measures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governance and did so even</v>

1116
00:53:40.111 --> 00:53:43.500
<v Speaker 1>when statistically controlling for other</v>
<v Speaker 1>threats to human welfare.</v>

1117
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.750
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pathogen prevalence,</v>

1118
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:50.910
<v Speaker 1>particularly one additional threat</v>
<v Speaker 1>famine also uniquely predicted</v>

1119
00:53:50.911 --> 00:53:51.930
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1120
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:55.800
<v Speaker 1>so it's famine and disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Together these results further</v>

1121
00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:59.580
<v Speaker 1>substantiate the parasite stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis of authoritarianism and</v>

1122
00:53:59.581 --> 00:54:03.090
<v Speaker 1>suggested societal differences in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governance result in part</v>

1123
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.240
<v Speaker 1>from cultural differences in</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual's authoritarian</v>

1124
00:54:06.241 --> 00:54:08.520
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the data.</v>

1125
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Now you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just,</v>

1126
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:12.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look at this.</v>

1127
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 1>So one is authoritarian governance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1128
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:20.400
<v Speaker 1>There's the correlation with pathogen</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevalence 0.42.</v>

1129
00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:23.570
<v Speaker 1>So there's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1130
00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:28.890
<v Speaker 1>failure that I didn't show here that</v>
<v Speaker 1>chosen either,</v>

1131
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:32.790
<v Speaker 1>this is from study to study one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correlation was 0.65.</v>

1132
00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:34.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

1133
00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:38.520
<v Speaker 1>isn't that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the reason that there are</v>

1134
00:54:38.521 --> 00:54:42.090
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian countries in the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's too many infectious</v>

1135
00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:44.190
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the waiting to get rid of</v>

1136
00:54:44.191 --> 00:54:47.610
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism is to get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious diseases.</v>

1137
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.760
<v Speaker 1>So God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would have ever guessed that,</v>

1138
00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look at the it warfare was negative</v>

1139
00:54:54.601 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 1>0.11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1140
00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that might be associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with authoritarian?</v>

1141
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Melik?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malnutrition wasn't even very big</v>

1142
00:54:59.881 --> 00:55:00.960
<v Speaker 1>predictor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1143
00:55:00.961 --> 00:55:04.200
<v Speaker 1>famine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually men hit the hit the hit the</v>

1144
00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:05.730
<v Speaker 1>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Feminine,</v>

1145
00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:10.560
<v Speaker 1>the probability of disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now let's look at this from a</v>

1146
00:55:10.561 --> 00:55:15.090
<v Speaker 1>sociocultural perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I spend a lot of time studying Hitler</v>

1147
00:55:15.091 --> 00:55:17.220
<v Speaker 1>because I'm interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological possession.</v>

1148
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:19.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tinder is a great example of that</v>

1149
00:55:19.621 --> 00:55:20.850
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1150
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.300
<v Speaker 1>because his ideology was so harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was also so attractive to people,</v>

1151
00:55:24.301 --> 00:55:26.830
<v Speaker 1>it was so unbelievably attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1152
00:55:26.831 --> 00:55:29.520
<v Speaker 1>when you're going to ask how the hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you account for something like that.</v>

1153
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:30.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1154
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to dim the lights a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>here because you guys have to be able to</v>

1155
00:55:33.721 --> 00:55:35.160
<v Speaker 1>see this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1156
00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:39.180
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you look on the right theory.</v>

1157
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:43.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the Nuremberg parade ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hope you can see this a little bit,</v>

1158
00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:45.270
<v Speaker 1>that the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all people,</v>

1159
00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:46.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1160
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 1>So the Nazis built this parade ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Nuremberg that was like the biggest</v>

1161
00:55:49.651 --> 00:55:53.700
<v Speaker 1>parade ground ever built on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'd have hundreds of thousands of</v>

1162
00:55:53.701 --> 00:55:55.440
<v Speaker 1>people at these rallies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1163
00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:58.290
<v Speaker 1>And so you look at the order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a line down the middle there</v>

1164
00:55:58.291 --> 00:56:00.870
<v Speaker 1>where the leaders walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's at Nuremberg,</v>

1165
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.440
<v Speaker 1>and then it's just surrounded by these</v>
<v Speaker 1>masses and masses and masses of people</v>

1166
00:56:04.441 --> 00:56:07.650
<v Speaker 1>in lines and all these orderly displays</v>
<v Speaker 1>of power.</v>

1167
00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:11.040
<v Speaker 1>And then there's Hitler there like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things Hitler was really</v>

1168
00:56:11.041 --> 00:56:13.950
<v Speaker 1>proud of was the fact that he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand like that for like eight hours.</v>

1169
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.710
<v Speaker 1>And that was willpower as far as he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

1170
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:20.640
<v Speaker 1>And he was a worshiper of willpower and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he bathed four times a day.</v>

1171
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So he's also somebody who was very much</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with cleanliness,</v>

1172
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:26.680
<v Speaker 1>cleanliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and willpower and order.</v>

1173
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:27.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's Hitler.</v>

1174
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:32.980
<v Speaker 1>So now we'll look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that's Nurburg again,</v>

1175
00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:34.840
<v Speaker 1>so this is called the cathedral of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights.</v>

1176
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:37.240
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the parade ground Darragh at the</v>

1177
00:56:37.241 --> 00:56:39.610
<v Speaker 1>bottom that I just showed you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was full of people.</v>

1178
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:43.960
<v Speaker 1>So you get some idea of how big that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now all those lights around that which</v>

1179
00:56:43.961 --> 00:56:46.780
<v Speaker 1>they called the cathedral of likes was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Luftwaffe,</v>

1180
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:51.640
<v Speaker 1>gave the Nazis all their antiaircraft</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights and then they arranged them</v>

1181
00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:54.460
<v Speaker 1>around the parade grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the whole thing was enclosed by this</v>

1182
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:59.170
<v Speaker 1>perfectly orderly cathedral of lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was part of the spectacle that</v>

1183
00:56:59.171 --> 00:57:03.010
<v Speaker 1>went along with the Nazi with the Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Nazi party rallies at</v>

1184
00:57:03.011 --> 00:57:03.844
<v Speaker 1>Nuremberg.</v>

1185
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.770
<v Speaker 1>And then so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the top left when they are,</v>

1186
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:10.720
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are soldiers,</v>

1187
00:57:10.721 --> 00:57:13.120
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember at the Nuremberg</v>

1188
00:57:13.121 --> 00:57:14.950
<v Speaker 1>rallies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had all sorts of people there.</v>

1189
00:57:14.951 --> 00:57:17.770
<v Speaker 1>They had like the shovel brigade and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all standing there with their</v>

1190
00:57:17.771 --> 00:57:21.700
<v Speaker 1>shovels ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shovel for Germany and and athletes and</v>

1191
00:57:21.701 --> 00:57:24.660
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of people arrayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that you know,</v>

1192
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.900
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this massive display of order in</v>

1193
00:57:26.901 --> 00:57:29.170
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you look at the top left hand corner,</v>

1194
00:57:29.171 --> 00:57:33.070
<v Speaker 1>you see all those people are lined up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely perfect.</v>

1195
00:57:33.071 --> 00:57:34.810
<v Speaker 1>And then you see the same thing when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>

1196
00:57:34.811 --> 00:57:37.570
<v Speaker 1>And Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the organization of that,</v>

1197
00:57:37.571 --> 00:57:40.960
<v Speaker 1>everything's square and perfect and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's in line and you know,</v>

1198
00:57:40.961 --> 00:57:43.750
<v Speaker 1>they're all in uniforms and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>going like this the same way.</v>

1199
00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:46.540
<v Speaker 1>And then when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they marched the soldiers,</v>

1200
00:57:46.541 --> 00:57:48.430
<v Speaker 1>they were in perfect lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect squares,</v>

1201
00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:49.510
<v Speaker 1>and they're all going like this.</v>

1202
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:50.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1203
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:53.830
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly perfection.</v>

1204
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.950
<v Speaker 1>And so the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Germans tend to be conscientious,</v>

1205
00:57:56.951 --> 00:57:58.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the reason why they</v>

1206
00:57:58.631 --> 00:58:01.630
<v Speaker 1>have excellent engineers and part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why their economies so damn</v>

1207
00:58:01.631 --> 00:58:03.760
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the downsides of</v>

1208
00:58:03.761 --> 00:58:06.340
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1209
00:58:06.341 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 1>And so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1210
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:11.710
<v Speaker 1>people think the Nazis were uncivilized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the new evidence seems to suggest</v>

1211
00:58:11.711 --> 00:58:14.320
<v Speaker 1>that they weren't down civilized at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were really,</v>

1212
00:58:14.321 --> 00:58:16.120
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really civilized.</v>

1213
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:19.120
<v Speaker 1>And that if you get too civilized to</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly,</v>

1214
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:22.540
<v Speaker 1>to conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then things go to hell in a handbasket</v>

1215
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.590
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

1216
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.010
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>now this,</v>

1217
00:58:27.011 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 1>some of this stuff is awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to read it to you anyways</v>

1218
00:58:29.681 --> 00:58:32.980
<v Speaker 1>because you need to know how this sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things work now.</v>

1219
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.550
<v Speaker 1>No Hitler emerged into power in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>1930s when,</v>

1220
00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:38.920
<v Speaker 1>when Germany was in a real state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>

1221
00:58:38.921 --> 00:58:39.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1222
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Cause it was after the second world war</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the first world war.</v>

1223
00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:45.100
<v Speaker 1>You have to remember what happened at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the first world war,</v>

1224
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:49.570
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish flu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish flu epidemic,</v>

1225
00:58:49.571 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 1>which was generated in the trenches</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can generate really intense,</v>

1226
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:56.540
<v Speaker 1>intentionally deadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1227
00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:00.370
<v Speaker 1>illnesses if the owners can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted from one person to another</v>

1228
00:59:00.371 --> 00:59:01.930
<v Speaker 1>very quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1229
00:59:01.931 --> 00:59:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay for the organism to kill you</v>

1230
00:59:04.721 --> 00:59:07.660
<v Speaker 1>as long as you last long enough to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eldest to the next person.</v>

1231
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:10.300
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're all crammed together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it filthy conditions.</v>

1232
00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:12.490
<v Speaker 1>The illness can just hop from person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1233
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:15.160
<v Speaker 1>And so it can breed particularly deadly</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms.</v>

1234
00:59:15.161 --> 00:59:18.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened with Spanish flu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the Spanish flu went all around</v>

1235
00:59:18.371 --> 00:59:20.800
<v Speaker 1>the world and it killed more people than</v>
<v Speaker 1>World War One did.</v>

1236
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was world war one.</v>

1237
00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Then there was the Spanish flu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the Germany economy fell completely</v>

1238
00:59:26.481 --> 00:59:28.610
<v Speaker 1>apart and there was hyper inflation.</v>

1239
00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:31.370
<v Speaker 1>And so there was complete chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the Germans were worried that</v>

1240
00:59:31.371 --> 00:59:33.230
<v Speaker 1>the communists were going to take over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was like,</v>

1241
00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:36.980
<v Speaker 1>it was like a little bit of hell on</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth and so long came Hitler.</v>

1242
00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Now Hector was one of these orderly</v>
<v Speaker 1>types.</v>

1243
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:41.810
<v Speaker 1>And so here's the kind of language he</v>
<v Speaker 1>used.</v>

1244
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:47.530
<v Speaker 1>This is from a pamphlet from 1936 the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jew as world parasite,</v>

1245
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:52.040
<v Speaker 1>the people in the world will recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jew as world parasite and there will</v>

1246
00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:55.580
<v Speaker 1>be a time when there will be one united</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of all people against the Jewish</v>

1247
00:59:55.581 --> 00:59:58.340
<v Speaker 1>world parasite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it depends with vans and humanity</v>

1248
00:59:58.341 --> 01:00:01.560
<v Speaker 1>will be freed from the most severe</v>
<v Speaker 1>illness for much it's suffered through</v>

1249
01:00:01.561 --> 01:00:04.700
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can think about this as metaphor</v>

1250
01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.870
<v Speaker 1>and of course it is metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a weird because it's not</v>

1251
01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>precisely conscious metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What seems to be happening is because</v>

1252
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Hitler's one of these people who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypersensitive to discussed an extremely</v>

1253
01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:17.710
<v Speaker 1>orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1254
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:21.580
<v Speaker 1>it's natural for his mind to conceive of</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories in this way.</v>

1255
01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Hidden there was always talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the area and people as like pure and</v>

1256
01:00:25.611 --> 01:00:27.170
<v Speaker 1>perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also as a body.</v>

1257
01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:32.590
<v Speaker 1>So the area in race was a body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem that the area in Ray's</v>

1258
01:00:32.691 --> 01:00:36.200
<v Speaker 1>faced was that there was all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>parasites that were attacking it and it</v>

1259
01:00:36.201 --> 01:00:40.580
<v Speaker 1>was the moral obligation of the Germans</v>
<v Speaker 1>to push back against those parasitical</v>

1260
01:00:40.581 --> 01:00:41.930
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1261
01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:45.560
<v Speaker 1>so here's what happened in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Hitler,</v>

1262
01:00:45.561 --> 01:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>when he came to power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that happened to</v>

1263
01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's first started a public health</v>

1264
01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he had these vans that had</v>

1265
01:00:52.971 --> 01:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>doctors in the Max ray machines and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1266
01:00:54.681 --> 01:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>And they went all over Germany screening</v>
<v Speaker 1>people for tuberculosis,</v>

1267
01:00:57.561 --> 01:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was infectious disease and also a</v>

1268
01:00:59.991 --> 01:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>particularly terrible one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually knocked down the rates of</v>

1269
01:01:02.751 --> 01:01:05.360
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis in Germany quite a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>

1270
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.313
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

1271
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.710
<v Speaker 1>let's embark on a public health and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleanliness campaigns.</v>

1272
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:10.281
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1273
01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:12.170
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get rid of tuberculosis that</v>

1274
01:01:12.171 --> 01:01:13.220
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

1275
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:15.740
<v Speaker 1>then the next thing that he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or one of the next things that he did</v>

1276
01:01:15.741 --> 01:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>was he was kind of irritated about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>messy and ugly the German factories</v>

1277
01:01:19.521 --> 01:01:20.420
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1278
01:01:20.421 --> 01:01:21.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they're kind of dirty and they've</v>

1279
01:01:21.801 --> 01:01:23.870
<v Speaker 1>got rats in them and mice and bugs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

1280
01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>And so the next thing that they decided</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do was to clean up the factory.</v>

1281
01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:28.330
<v Speaker 1>So they had people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1282
01:01:28.331 --> 01:01:32.060
<v Speaker 1>a sweeping them all up and fixing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>grounds in front and planting flowers</v>

1283
01:01:32.061 --> 01:01:35.150
<v Speaker 1>and that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were fumigating them to get rid</v>

1284
01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:37.760
<v Speaker 1>of the parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fumigation agent they used,</v>

1285
01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:42.500
<v Speaker 1>was it insecticide called Zyklon B and</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] was the gas that was</v>

1286
01:01:42.501 --> 01:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>eventually used in the concentration</v>
<v Speaker 1>camps.</v>

1287
01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can see the connection there,</v>

1288
01:01:47.691 --> 01:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1289
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:50.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like a logical progression of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

1290
01:01:50.261 --> 01:01:52.640
<v Speaker 1>So the next thing that happened was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1291
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:54.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided their clean up the mental</v>

1292
01:01:54.891 --> 01:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>asylums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1293
01:01:56.361 --> 01:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1294
01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:01.070
<v Speaker 1>do you really want those sorted</v>
<v Speaker 1>defective people being parasites on</v>

1295
01:02:01.071 --> 01:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>everyone else and should they really be</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to reproduce?</v>

1296
01:02:04.131 --> 01:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>If Navy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be just better to,</v>

1297
01:02:05.411 --> 01:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>euthanize them because they are useless</v>

1298
01:02:07.551 --> 01:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>and they're suffering anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that seemed to go pretty well.</v>

1299
01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you know,</v>

1300
01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>what happened next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1301
01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.680
<v Speaker 1>then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extension,</v>

1302
01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>the next extension was well to anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was foreign,</v>

1303
01:02:19.501 --> 01:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>like a foreign body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this showed up in all sorts of</v>

1304
01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>weird ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1305
01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not see as the most who grew to some</v>

1306
01:02:27.031 --> 01:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>degree out of like nature worship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how else to describe it.</v>

1307
01:02:31.801 --> 01:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>There were kind of nature cults in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany in the 1930s and they went way</v>

1308
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>back and one of the things the nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>coats were concerned about in Germany</v>

1309
01:02:39.421 --> 01:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>with the presence of invasive species in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German,</v>

1310
01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1311
01:02:44.341 --> 01:02:46.650
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the German ecological system.</v>

1312
01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we complained about that now too,</v>

1313
01:02:48.661 --> 01:02:49.171
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1314
01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>you get plants coming over from China</v>
<v Speaker 1>and places like that,</v>

1315
01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1316
01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>spread through ecosystems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically disrupt them.</v>

1317
01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that seems like a reasonable thing</v>

1318
01:02:58.681 --> 01:02:59.910
<v Speaker 1>to be concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1319
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.810
<v Speaker 1>but the reason I'm pointing out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection is because you never know</v>

1320
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.850
<v Speaker 1>where these systems of ideas are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lead.</v>

1321
01:03:05.851 --> 01:03:06.451
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1322
01:03:06.451 --> 01:03:07.680
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contamination.</v>

1323
01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

1324
01:03:08.971 --> 01:03:12.990
<v Speaker 1>You know what contaminations real well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's responsible for the contamination?</v>

1325
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where things start to get tricky.</v>

1326
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Nazis just kept pushing them,</v>

1327
01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.590
<v Speaker 1>pushing the limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll show you some of the things</v>

1328
01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:25.080
<v Speaker 1>that come from Hitler speeches or right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1329
01:03:25.081 --> 01:03:29.160
<v Speaker 1>this is from my end comp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So since the state did not possess the</v>

1330
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>power to master the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the menacing decay of the right was</v>

1331
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:33.570
<v Speaker 1>manifest.</v>

1332
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:34.470
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all disgust,</v>

1333
01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:35.850
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contamination.</v>

1334
01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:39.450
<v Speaker 1>The masses feel that the mere fact of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jews existence is as bad as the</v>

1335
01:03:39.451 --> 01:03:42.450
<v Speaker 1>plague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politicians tinkering around on the</v>

1336
01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:45.900
<v Speaker 1>German national body saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the forms of our general</v>

1337
01:03:45.901 --> 01:03:49.620
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but blindly ignored the virus at the</v>

1338
01:03:49.621 --> 01:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>time of the unification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The inner decay was already in full</v>

1339
01:03:53.491 --> 01:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>swing and the general situation was</v>
<v Speaker 1>deteriorating from year to year.</v>

1340
01:03:57.011 --> 01:03:57.844
<v Speaker 1>So it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1341
01:03:57.870 --> 01:04:00.930
<v Speaker 1>decay and disgust and contamination</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphor.</v>

1342
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.790
<v Speaker 1>The symptoms of decay of the prewar</v>
<v Speaker 1>period can be reduced to racial causes.</v>

1343
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:08.250
<v Speaker 1>The Nation did not grow inwardly</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthier,</v>

1344
01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:12.900
<v Speaker 1>but obviously language more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who wants to cure this era,</v>

1345
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:17.550
<v Speaker 1>which is inwardly sick and rotten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>must first of all summon up the courage</v>

1346
01:04:17.551 --> 01:04:20.790
<v Speaker 1>to make clear the causes of the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1347
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:24.660
<v Speaker 1>they think that they must demonstrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are ready for appeasement so</v>

1348
01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:29.460
<v Speaker 1>as to stay the deadly cancerous ulcer</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a policy of moderation.</v>

1349
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:32.730
<v Speaker 1>The Jew must take care that the plague</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not die.</v>

1350
01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.420
<v Speaker 1>If this battle should not come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany would decay and at best would</v>

1351
01:04:36.421 --> 01:04:40.410
<v Speaker 1>sync to ruin like a rotting corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see in the right today an</v>

1352
01:04:40.411 --> 01:04:45.270
<v Speaker 1>example of mortal decay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 1st of May can only be the</v>

1353
01:04:45.271 --> 01:04:49.080
<v Speaker 1>liberation of the nation spirit from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>infection of internationalism,</v>

1354
01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:53.370
<v Speaker 1>the restoration to health of peoples</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the infection of materialism</v>

1355
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.070
<v Speaker 1>against the Jewish pestilence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must hold a loft,</v>

1356
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.000
<v Speaker 1>a flaming ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's interesting because hidden,</v>

1357
01:04:59.001 --> 01:05:01.110
<v Speaker 1>they're reading light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The use of fire.</v>

1358
01:05:01.111 --> 01:05:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Fire was a really primary element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fire and light.</v>

1359
01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:07.530
<v Speaker 1>We're real primary elements in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nuremberg rallies and you know,</v>

1360
01:05:07.531 --> 01:05:09.960
<v Speaker 1>fire has this purification element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1361
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:12.450
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why they used to burn</v>
<v Speaker 1>heretics at the state.</v>

1362
01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:14.910
<v Speaker 1>It was like that's how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you purify things with fire.</v>

1363
01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:17.040
<v Speaker 1>And of course you do purify things with</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

1364
01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason that we cook things</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because if you cook them,</v>

1365
01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.110
<v Speaker 1>then the pathogens die and then that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>purification.</v>

1366
01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:28.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's not illogical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave orders to burn out,</v>

1367
01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:30.370
<v Speaker 1>burn out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the raw flesh,</v>

1368
01:05:30.371 --> 01:05:32.860
<v Speaker 1>the ulcers of this poisoning of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>

1369
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Really unbelievably harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>harsh language.</v>

1370
01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>The only permanent way to cure disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions is to disclose their causes.</v>

1371
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

1372
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:47.650
<v Speaker 1>This is the battle against a veritable</v>
<v Speaker 1>world sickness which threatens to infect</v>

1373
01:05:47.651 --> 01:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>the peoples of plague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which devastates whole peoples and</v>

1374
01:05:50.771 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>international pestilence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The international carrier of the</v>

1375
01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:57.580
<v Speaker 1>bacillus must be fought if within this</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

1376
01:05:57.581 --> 01:06:01.090
<v Speaker 1>one state is infected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that infection is decisive for all</v>

1377
01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:03.610
<v Speaker 1>alike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so,</v>

1378
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:06.460
<v Speaker 1>and he doesn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also doesn't just address this sort</v>

1379
01:06:06.461 --> 01:06:11.410
<v Speaker 1>of language towards the sorts of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he ended up eradicating or trying</v>

1380
01:06:11.411 --> 01:06:14.680
<v Speaker 1>to eradicate in the camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also used that with regards to</v>

1381
01:06:14.681 --> 01:06:15.190
<v Speaker 1>communists.</v>

1382
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:20.190
<v Speaker 1>So we have very real interest in seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it that this bullshit is plague shall</v>

1383
01:06:20.531 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Speaker 1>not spread over Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>National Socialism has made our people</v>

1384
01:06:24.431 --> 01:06:27.530
<v Speaker 1>and therefore the right immune from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolshevik infection.</v>

1385
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Saturday.</v>

1386
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:34.990
<v Speaker 1>You get the point</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's some more language from this</v>

1387
01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.510
<v Speaker 1>metaphor from a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you the book in a minute.</v>

1388
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:41.620
<v Speaker 1>This is the man who wrote this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzed Hitler's writings and his</v>

1389
01:06:41.621 --> 01:06:44.350
<v Speaker 1>speeches looking for metaphorical</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundations.</v>

1390
01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spider was slowly beginning to suck</v>

1391
01:06:47.801 --> 01:06:50.460
<v Speaker 1>the blood out of the people's pores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1392
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:52.960
<v Speaker 1>here are we face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have the list eating like</v>

1393
01:06:52.961 --> 01:06:57.070
<v Speaker 1>poisonous abscesses into the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all this like you can hardly read</v>

1394
01:06:57.071 --> 01:06:59.020
<v Speaker 1>these things without being disgusted by</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1395
01:06:59.021 --> 01:07:01.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all language that's associated with</v>

1396
01:07:01.421 --> 01:07:04.570
<v Speaker 1>disgust at not with fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that seemed to be very,</v>

1397
01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:08.020
<v Speaker 1>very appealing to the Germans have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1398
01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Horrible language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you a bit of a film</v>

1399
01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:12.560
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1400
01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a lot of time for it</v>

1401
01:07:15.201 --> 01:07:16.100
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll,</v>

1402
01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you a little bit of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

1403
01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't we use this?</v>

1404
01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.440
<v Speaker 1>It kind kinda shows you how this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how this,</v>

1405
01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:30.010
<v Speaker 1>how these ideas were portrayed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like</v>

1406
01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:35.680
<v Speaker 1>call</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda and effective propaganda</v>

1407
01:07:35.681 --> 01:07:37.220
<v Speaker 1>means might affect the prompt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1408
01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:23.990
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political route</v>

1409
01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:21.873
<v Speaker 2>shovel.</v>

1410
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:48.030
<v Speaker 1>So you get the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1411
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:53.270
<v Speaker 1>you could hardly get a more compelling</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of perfect orders and</v>

1412
01:11:54.061 --> 01:11:55.110
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1413
01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:57.240
<v Speaker 1>how many thousands of people do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think there are?</v>

1414
01:11:57.470 --> 01:12:02.460
<v Speaker 1>They're all nicely arranged into perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>squares,</v>

1415
01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:07.760
<v Speaker 1>all moving at exactly the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like war against pestilence.</v>

1416
01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:11.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange way of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Second World War,</v>

1417
01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:16.380
<v Speaker 1>but the evidence is increasingly strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's the right way to look at.</v>

1418
01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.440
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll see you guys on Tuesday.</v>
