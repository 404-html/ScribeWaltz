1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a so people are taking it </v>

2
00:00:02.431 --> 00:00:03.450
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

3
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that.</v>

4
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>But you're the one who has to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain and the pressure.</v>

5
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:09.910
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

6
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.743
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm in a permanent state of being </v>

7
00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 2>freaked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

8
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 2>when I woke up this morning with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas that I wanted to talk to you</v>

9
00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:20.950
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

10
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me pull up the emails that I sent</v>

11
00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:25.700
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things,</v>

13
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>did you want to talk first just to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to get her ideas to or what maybe I</v>

14
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:40.914
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also want to comment on some of the </v>

15
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>things you wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

16
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 1>One of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the difficulties,</v>

17
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you recording this already?</v>

18
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I can always edit it afterwards.</v>

19
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

20
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you should,</v>

21
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should speak first because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way when I talk about the,</v>

22
00:00:58.341 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

23
00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.691
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of,</v>

24
00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 1>the questions that I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in regard to the cross.</v>

25
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>The Cross is really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a complicated.</v>

26
00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:10.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's meant to be a to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery and so the way it's presented to</v>

27
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:12.704
<v Speaker 1>us it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of breaks all the categories in </v>

28
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.374
<v Speaker 1>a way and so or it unites them together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can rather see it that way and so </v>

29
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult to,</v>

30
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:25.400
<v Speaker 1>to talk about the cross because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>both totally on the inside,</v>

31
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.323
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the center of the world at the </v>

32
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:28.670
<v Speaker 1>access of the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all those things,</v>

33
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 1>at the edge of the world because even in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story it's brought outside.</v>

35
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:35.930
<v Speaker 1>His crucifixion happens outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

36
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>It happens on the mountain of the skull </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also there's a,</v>

37
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:44.060
<v Speaker 1>there's a verse in the Psalm that says </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the just will never hang on a cross</v>

38
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 1>and so I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will never hang on a tree.</v>

39
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:47.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say cross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

40
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will never hang on a tree.</v>

41
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.713
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an area in the cross which is </v>

42
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:56.210
<v Speaker 1>that Christ is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just who's hanging on a tree.</v>

43
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.353
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>why Jews have never accepted Christ as </v>

44
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:01.420
<v Speaker 1>the Messiah because they can't deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

45
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absolute,</v>

46
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a paradox of having,</v>

47
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

48
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perfect man hanging on a tree.</v>

49
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.850
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like how do those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

50
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:14.900
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a Christian,</v>

51
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>it's really bringing together that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extremes.</v>

52
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about that before.</v>

53
00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that Christ really isn't the top</v>

54
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:22.844
<v Speaker 1>of the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's really the stretching out of </v>

55
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.350
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the top to the bottom.</v>

56
00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:28.184
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

58
00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:30.214
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

59
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll get to that.</v>

60
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.090
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

61
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that's,</v>

62
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.153
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting way of </v>

63
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.380
<v Speaker 2>conceptualizing the potential solution </v>
<v Speaker 2>to this problem.</v>

64
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

65
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.420
<v Speaker 2>So Derrick had this concept of </v>
<v Speaker 2>undecidability,</v>

66
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.883
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were these things that existed on </v>

67
00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:54.160
<v Speaker 2>the margins that didn't fit into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>category system.</v>

68
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

69
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about that before and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to me to be very much associated with</v>

70
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 2>the idea that I developed in maps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning of anomaly.</v>

71
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.123
<v Speaker 2>The anomalous is the monster and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason the anomalous is the monster is </v>

72
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:10.414
<v Speaker 2>because there's a very large number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that won't fit into any category </v>

73
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:15.544
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter what the category system </v>

74
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.314
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the things inside the category </v>

75
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:20.674
<v Speaker 2>system or the category and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>things outside and there's a </v>

76
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 2>multiplicity of the things outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

77
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.003
<v Speaker 2>And so the monster images,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate image to represent that </v>

78
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 2>because monster is a camera that's made </v>
<v Speaker 2>up of parts.</v>

79
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.663
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

80
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.623
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you always have to confront what </v>

81
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:37.970
<v Speaker 2>stands outside the category system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

82
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 2>and it looks to me like we use our </v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator a detection and defense systems</v>

83
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.014
<v Speaker 2>as the first defense against that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first reaction against that because </v>

84
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.624
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an archetypal reality that there </v>

85
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 2>are things outside the category system.</v>

86
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually,</v>

87
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I think that in terms of phenomenology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

88
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

89
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.343
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can eliminate this in terms of </v>

90
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.370
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biology because I'm not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>expert in that at all,</v>

91
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.990
<v Speaker 1>but it seems that there is both the </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory aspect where it's,</v>

92
00:04:08.991 --> 00:04:10.490
<v Speaker 1>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

93
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.333
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monster or the anomaly is seen as </v>

94
00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:14.930
<v Speaker 1>something to defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also,</v>

95
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.190
<v Speaker 1>there's also an aspect which is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desiring.</v>

96
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

97
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.680
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the dragon with the,</v>

98
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.153
<v Speaker 2>with the gold.</v>

99
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.041
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

100
00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:23.600
<v Speaker 1>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the siren,</v>

101
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.880
<v Speaker 1>the siren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noah.</v>

102
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.443
<v Speaker 1>The monster itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's something about the siren </v>

103
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.080
<v Speaker 1>and about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

104
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.630
<v Speaker 1>the idea of Lilith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

105
00:04:32.631 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>in Jewish mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this notion of like the or the um,</v>

106
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.693
<v Speaker 1>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

107
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.860
<v Speaker 1>the incubus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

108
00:04:39.861 --> 00:04:42.380
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the female demon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

109
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.393
<v Speaker 1>which lures and brings you out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and kind of makes you kind of </v>

110
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 1>waste your seed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a Christian and religious,</v>

111
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea where it says if there's a,</v>

112
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.133
<v Speaker 1>there's something about the outside or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the foreign or the which elicits a </v>

113
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.580
<v Speaker 1>desire to move out towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you kind of talk about that when</v>

114
00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:04.100
<v Speaker 1>you talk about this notion of the snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>that appears,</v>

115
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.930
<v Speaker 1>let's say about a amongst a group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees get on one hand.</v>

116
00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

117
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fascination of the unknown </v>

118
00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 2>and neuro biologically that's associated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the positive aspect of exploration.</v>

119
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

120
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

121
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.323
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a paradoxical situation because if </v>

122
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 2>it's unknown you want to be afraid of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it might eat you,</v>

123
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:28.210
<v Speaker 2>but because it contains new information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you also want to approach it.</v>

124
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

125
00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:29.930
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really,</v>

126
00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially now in our and like our,</v>

127
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.020
<v Speaker 1>our situation to understand the desiring</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect.</v>

128
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.003
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you can explain a lot of the </v>

129
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.190
<v Speaker 1>strange phenomena that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.253
<v Speaker 1>the turnaround sexuality in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the strange fetishization of </v>

131
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.000
<v Speaker 1>sexuality into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

132
00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:47.781
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:49.040
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:49.874
<v Speaker 1>like the weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weird scatological fetishes that </v>

135
00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.084
<v Speaker 1>people have in the strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's as if there's something about </v>

136
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.803
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the or the monster ious or the </v>

137
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 1>discarded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can also in a certain instance,</v>

138
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:06.070
<v Speaker 1>if people let themselves go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll pull them into a,</v>

139
00:06:06.071 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>a desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a relationship with that.</v>

140
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.973
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you do find is that </v>

141
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.770
<v Speaker 2>sexual release like orgasm is </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentiated by novelty.</v>

142
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.670
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

143
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

144
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.870
<v Speaker 1>And if you kind of go down that route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can lead you into,</v>

145
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.690
<v Speaker 1>there is no limit kind of to where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can lead you and,</v>

146
00:06:25.691 --> 00:06:27.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it can explain it.</v>

147
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.233
<v Speaker 1>I think it can also explain kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're in this weird paradoxical </v>

148
00:06:31.481 --> 00:06:32.314
<v Speaker 1>situation in terms of society where </v>
<v Speaker 1>since the sixties people have been </v>

149
00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:37.050
<v Speaker 1>telling us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.073
<v Speaker 1>that in emphasizing that aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that novelty will increase </v>

151
00:06:42.311 --> 00:06:43.144
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say bring you further into </v>

152
00:06:44.531 --> 00:06:45.364
<v Speaker 1>pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then realizing that if you go down </v>

153
00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:49.390
<v Speaker 1>that road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're kind of realizing,</v>

154
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

155
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.823
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're surrounded by sexual perverts </v>

156
00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:55.060
<v Speaker 1>and we're wondering why we're surrounded</v>
<v Speaker 1>by sexual perverts.</v>

157
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.721
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

158
00:06:55.721 --> 00:06:56.554
<v Speaker 1>maybe you lead them down that road and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that road doesn't necessarily lead to </v>

159
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:00.604
<v Speaker 1>just sunshine and rainbows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it leads to very dark places which </v>

160
00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:06.010
<v Speaker 1>include a lot of violence and a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

161
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an exploration of,</v>

162
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:09.400
<v Speaker 1>of animosity and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>

163
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 1>and a mixture of desire and hatred and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those,</v>

164
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.460
<v Speaker 1>those very strange things that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of let themselves fall into.</v>

165
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you might say that that's in some </v>

166
00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:20.250
<v Speaker 2>sense the story of food life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

167
00:07:20.251 --> 00:07:20.920
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

168
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

169
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:24.630
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about that before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you look at full codes,</v>

170
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.593
<v Speaker 1>if you look at [inaudible] life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's almost like a microcosm of what's </v>

171
00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:29.044
<v Speaker 1>happening today in terms of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like radical exploration of power </v>

172
00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:33.814
<v Speaker 1>and sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also like the idea of the constant </v>

173
00:07:36.371 --> 00:07:38.980
<v Speaker 1>stranger and the constant anonymous </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymity of,</v>

174
00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:40.980
<v Speaker 1>of sexual encounters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

175
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I think that for sure I see him really </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

176
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.590
<v Speaker 1>as someone to look at in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the,</v>

177
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:48.490
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

178
00:07:48.491 --> 00:07:50.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tone of what's happening</v>

179
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.050
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me to be the case.</v>

180
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Foodco dirt,</v>

181
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.670
<v Speaker 2>I didn't care for each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

182
00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

183
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.290
<v Speaker 2>foodco basically regarded dared as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>trickster,</v>

184
00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:05.440
<v Speaker 2>as a wordy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

185
00:08:05.441 --> 00:08:09.240
<v Speaker 2>as a wordy trickster and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

186
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.223
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their ideas fall into alignment with </v>

187
00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:15.160
<v Speaker 2>regards to the notion of the excluded as</v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I can tell.</v>

188
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

189
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that,</v>

190
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 1>the difference I would say with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

191
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:22.450
<v Speaker 1>I find that more useful in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.493
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this in my different </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about this notion that what's </v>

193
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:29.260
<v Speaker 1>upside down can be turned back on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head back on its feet.</v>

194
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.273
<v Speaker 1>And I think that data is more useful to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play that game where you can use him </v>

195
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.920
<v Speaker 1>and some of these categories to include </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a larger frame,</v>

196
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:42.190
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that his ideas are included in a more</v>

197
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.160
<v Speaker 1>complete vision of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

198
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:48.250
<v Speaker 1>because he has like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really shows the real,</v>

199
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.693
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his way of thinking really shows the </v>

200
00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:53.140
<v Speaker 1>real danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem of postmodernism.</v>

201
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:54.873
<v Speaker 1>you talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how is it that there's this </v>

203
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 1>contradiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

204
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 1>his philosophy has been described as </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the philosophy of hesitation,</v>

205
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes total sense because,</v>

206
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your face he,</v>

207
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.160
<v Speaker 1>he has this notion that you're faced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this slipping and sliding a </v>

209
00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 1>analysis of the world where all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

210
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is,</v>

211
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 1>multiplies itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is deferred,</v>

212
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

213
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

214
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 1>things always point towards the future.</v>

215
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.193
<v Speaker 1>So you never know exactly what something</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because it keeps changing and it </v>

216
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 1>keeps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps slipping into something else.</v>

217
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.190
<v Speaker 1>And so that actually leads to which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>true things.</v>

218
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And would that actually leads to this,</v>

219
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

220
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.333
<v Speaker 1>this hesitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you've ever seen an interview </v>

221
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:38.370
<v Speaker 1>with Dr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see it in his,</v>

222
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 1>in his demeanor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's constantly hesitating.</v>

223
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.600
<v Speaker 1>He's hesitating to speak because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>always kind of like,</v>

224
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

225
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.860
<v Speaker 1>he realized that he doesn't know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>total implications of what he's about to</v>

226
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:51.800
<v Speaker 1>say all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's always like,</v>

227
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.720
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

228
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.590
<v Speaker 1>he's constantly cautious and conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cautious.</v>

229
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.553
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it seems like that's actually </v>

230
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.440
<v Speaker 1>what should be normally derived out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of postmodern idea that,</v>

231
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that meaning cannot be contained.</v>

232
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Fuko,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really,</v>

233
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 1>he really used the kind of inverted idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of truth,</v>

234
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.433
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the truth of the marginal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can use marginality as a </v>

235
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 1>weapon to destroy the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

236
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.070
<v Speaker 1>let's say that the current order data</v>

237
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:23.641
<v Speaker 2>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

238
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:26.720
<v Speaker 2>so you think that's more attributable to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Foodco them to Teradata?</v>

239
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he do that does it too,</v>

240
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 1>but when he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because he,</v>

241
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 1>he'll use the marginal to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>deconstruct the,</v>

242
00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:34.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the center,</v>

243
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:35.694
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he'll also kind of in a set in </v>

244
00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:40.360
<v Speaker 1>the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll also say he'll also heal,</v>

245
00:10:40.361 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 1>like reverse it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then an ilet his reversal.</v>

246
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.213
<v Speaker 1>So he ended up really in this slippery </v>
<v Speaker 1>slope where you don't even know where </v>

247
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're standing.</v>

248
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

249
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:53.480
<v Speaker 1>and so in my opinion that's useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it helps you to see the,</v>

250
00:10:53.481 --> 00:10:54.314
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actually it kind of Indiana did </v>

251
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:56.603
<v Speaker 1>points back towards logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It pointed back towards logos in the </v>

252
00:10:59.161 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 1>sense that we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we talked about,</v>

253
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 1>you can't live in a world like that.</v>

254
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.433
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

255
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.293
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what I want to develop </v>

256
00:11:05.781 --> 00:11:06.980
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

257
00:11:06.981 --> 00:11:09.170
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing that I thought of </v>
<v Speaker 2>today is that,</v>

258
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.243
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have this issue of undecidability </v>

259
00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:13.484
<v Speaker 2>from daredevil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that doesn't fit in the </v>

260
00:11:14.511 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

261
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.401
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

262
00:11:16.401 --> 00:11:17.234
<v Speaker 2>And we know that if you have a category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's way more outside the category </v>

263
00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:20.804
<v Speaker 2>then there is inside the category </v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise the category isn't </v>

264
00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 2>very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

265
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if Derek talks about that as an,</v>

266
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I think food co two at least alludes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

267
00:11:29.901 --> 00:11:34.520
<v Speaker 2>is that they kind of make the case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of the category system is to</v>

268
00:11:34.521 --> 00:11:38.720
<v Speaker 2>exclude and then they make a political </v>
<v Speaker 2>case out of that as well.</v>

269
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.873
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the purpose of a category is to </v>

270
00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:42.404
<v Speaker 2>exclude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to exclude an infinite multitude </v>

271
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.740
<v Speaker 2>because you can't deal with an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 2>multitude,</v>

272
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.633
<v Speaker 2>and so you have to simplify the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to categorize the world in </v>

273
00:11:52.131 --> 00:11:53.750
<v Speaker 2>order to act on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

274
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

275
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.813
<v Speaker 1>then the ultimate question has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like by what principle do you </v>

276
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 1>or what principal guides your </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization of the world,</v>

277
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.453
<v Speaker 1>and that seems to me to point back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the logo in exactly the way that you </v>

278
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:06.604
<v Speaker 1>just described because I would say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>logos is the divine principle of </v>

279
00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:12.300
<v Speaker 1>categorization or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

280
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two.</v>

281
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.140
<v Speaker 1>There are actually two ways to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

282
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I think that I talked about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about how.</v>

283
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Talking about this in Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's either.</v>

284
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.620
<v Speaker 1>There's three possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's either the logos,</v>

285
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:31.100
<v Speaker 1>there is either absolute dissemination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this kind of the,</v>

286
00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:31.934
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that something will just kind </v>

287
00:12:32.821 --> 00:12:33.654
<v Speaker 1>of dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It dissolves into uncertainty and and </v>

288
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 1>it's important to understand the result </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

289
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 1>The result of that isn't that it'll just</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in this kind of shaky uncertainty.</v>

290
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.250
<v Speaker 1>The result of that is that something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else from the outside,</v>

291
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.233
<v Speaker 1>which has solidity is going to ran </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it and I think that's something </v>

292
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:52.030
<v Speaker 1>that Dickie that didn't account for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.310
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Dick and die accounted for</v>

294
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Islam for example.</v>

295
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

296
00:12:56.861 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Speaker 1>if we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we all,</v>

297
00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.133
<v Speaker 1>if we're all kind of in this slippery </v>
<v Speaker 1>slidey situation without from </v>

298
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:05.290
<v Speaker 1>identities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we have no reason to fight.</v>

299
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.513
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of like the positive </v>

300
00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:10.090
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of reasons to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

301
00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

302
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe we have an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons to fight,</v>

303
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.643
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't see that something on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside which has strength will just </v>

304
00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:20.470
<v Speaker 1>then just come right through that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

305
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

306
00:13:22.481 --> 00:13:23.314
<v Speaker 1>Well I think he thought he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was probably Eurocentric in his </v>

307
00:13:26.351 --> 00:13:27.400
<v Speaker 1>outlook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

308
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.700
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

309
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.030
<v Speaker 1>It's really hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hilarious.</v>

310
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.103
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

311
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've talked about that.</v>

312
00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Decide to build it or thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>undecidability that we need to mention,</v>

313
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:41.404
<v Speaker 1>which makes it more complicated is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>undecidability also has to do with time </v>

314
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.543
<v Speaker 1>and so it has to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is something actually that you </v>

315
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:49.120
<v Speaker 1>have in common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

316
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:53.290
<v Speaker 1>with which you might be funny to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that you,</v>

317
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.260
<v Speaker 1>that something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you talked about that,</v>

318
00:13:56.261 --> 00:13:57.880
<v Speaker 1>an example of you said like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

319
00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:02.690
<v Speaker 1>when Ford created the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know what it was because that,</v>

320
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.520
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

321
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

322
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:04.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the totality of what the car </v>

323
00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:07.990
<v Speaker 1>represents it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

324
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:08.973
<v Speaker 1>is manifesting itself in time </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting itself in like urban </v>

325
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 1>landscape in the way we understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy and in a way.</v>

326
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.260
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

327
00:14:16.261 --> 00:14:17.094
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the ramifications were so big that </v>

328
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:23.281
<v Speaker 1>you could never know what a car is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called talks about in terms of,</v>

329
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.340
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

330
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.280
<v Speaker 1>the deferral of meaning in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

331
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.250
<v Speaker 1>in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that idea of,</v>

332
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 1>of difference in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of um,</v>

333
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that there's categories in debt,</v>

334
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.390
<v Speaker 1>they're defined by their opposites and </v>
<v Speaker 1>either their outer categories,</v>

335
00:14:40.391 --> 00:14:43.270
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also this idea of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes it more complicated to.</v>

336
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

337
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.033
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that what it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends to some degree on the spatial </v>

338
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:51.260
<v Speaker 1>and temporal context within which you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreting it.</v>

339
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say that way.</v>

340
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.983
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

341
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I had a dream about that at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's a digression,</v>

342
00:14:57.921 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

343
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

344
00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.990
<v Speaker 2>so I dreamt this is such a strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>

345
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I dreamt that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

346
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:05.893
<v Speaker 2>there was this ball</v>
<v Speaker 2>floating above the Atlantic Ocean and </v>

347
00:15:10.061 --> 00:15:12.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just zooming log about,</v>

348
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six feet above the surface just cruising</v>

349
00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:15.554
<v Speaker 2>along and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so powerful that it was </v>

350
00:15:18.741 --> 00:15:19.574
<v Speaker 2>accompanied by four hurricanes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one in each quadrant surrounding the </v>

351
00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:24.570
<v Speaker 2>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was only a little ball.</v>

352
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.990
<v Speaker 2>And that was the first part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>

353
00:15:26.991 --> 00:15:30.710
<v Speaker 2>The second part of the dream was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a view of satellites and a bunch of</v>

354
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:33.260
<v Speaker 2>scientists who are monitoring the hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of this thing,</v>

355
00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:35.500
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

356
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.230
<v Speaker 2>the third scene was this thing was </v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped in a room.</v>

357
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.540
<v Speaker 2>It was like in a Victorian Museum case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

358
00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:42.374
<v Speaker 2>what would case with glass and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting up there like suspended in </v>

359
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:48.890
<v Speaker 2>midair are inside the case and the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball.</v>

360
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

361
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.430
<v Speaker 2>So they captured it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then,</v>

362
00:15:51.431 --> 00:15:54.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in the room,</v>

363
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 2>the room had no doors or windows in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

364
00:15:57.411 --> 00:16:02.411
<v Speaker 2>there was the president of the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States and Stephen Hawking and so that,</v>

365
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 2>and then the room was made out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>titanium dioxide.</v>

366
00:16:06.711 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I remember that from the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which turns out to be the stuff that the</v>

367
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.530
<v Speaker 2>hall of the starship enterprise is made </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of.</v>

368
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.490
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

369
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was something like that.</v>

370
00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:17.534
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea was that this intensely </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful thing had been put inside a </v>

371
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:22.460
<v Speaker 2>category system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

372
00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:26.330
<v Speaker 2>So the inside a museum display case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there was the president,</v>

373
00:16:26.331 --> 00:16:30.020
<v Speaker 2>there are sort of representation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social order and Stephen Hawking,</v>

374
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.230
<v Speaker 2>he was a representation of disembodied </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellect.</v>

375
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.310
<v Speaker 2>And then there was the room itself which</v>
<v Speaker 2>had impenetrable walls.</v>

376
00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:39.220
<v Speaker 2>They were like six feet thick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

377
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.063
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got this thing and then then I was </v>

378
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:44.990
<v Speaker 2>watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turned into a Chrysalis.</v>

379
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.860
<v Speaker 2>So obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something that can transform.</v>

380
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:49.694
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

381
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.080
<v Speaker 2>And then it turned into a mere sean </v>
<v Speaker 2>pipe.</v>

382
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.670
<v Speaker 2>It took me about a year to figure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

383
00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.770
<v Speaker 2>It was an illusion to a famous painting </v>
<v Speaker 2>by Magritte.</v>

384
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a pipe.</v>

385
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.351
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a pipe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

386
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:04.370
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

387
00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:05.330
<v Speaker 2>like quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

388
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it shot out of the broom,</v>

389
00:17:07.101 --> 00:17:09.500
<v Speaker 2>like there was nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

390
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great dream.</v>

391
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.520
<v Speaker 2>It was a great dream man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

392
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.040
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

393
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.873
<v Speaker 2>it does allude to this idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't capture the thing in permanently </v>

394
00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 2>in a category system because it shifts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and turns.</v>

395
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

396
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:21.980
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

397
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.900
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fine.</v>

398
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.130
<v Speaker 2>So we're on board with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

399
00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.053
<v Speaker 2>So now the category has to exclude </v>
<v Speaker 2>because reality is so complex that you </v>

400
00:17:30.231 --> 00:17:32.810
<v Speaker 2>have to categorize it because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're swamped.</v>

401
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a good metaphor for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

402
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.523
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's something that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern is our you that didn't </v>

403
00:17:37.341 --> 00:17:40.250
<v Speaker 2>totally see the extent to which that </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be.</v>

404
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

405
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

406
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>

407
00:17:44.111 --> 00:17:44.810
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

408
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:45.643
<v Speaker 2>he put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he thought that order was a lot </v>

409
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:49.720
<v Speaker 2>more solid than it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

410
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.520
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

411
00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:54.300
<v Speaker 3>or then it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I was thinking,</v>

412
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.130
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now in with identity politics,</v>

413
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:03.450
<v Speaker 3>you have the politics of the excluded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

414
00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:06.480
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then you have people excluded because</v>

415
00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:10.320
<v Speaker 3>of race or because of gender or because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of sexual identity or whatever.</v>

416
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 3>And one of the problems we've seen with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is that the number of excluded keep</v>

417
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 3>multiplying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you get that extension of the</v>

418
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:19.410
<v Speaker 3>letters in the lgbt acronym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

419
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.540
<v Speaker 3>And there doesn't seem to be any limit </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

420
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:22.374
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is there is no </v>
<v Speaker 3>limit to the number or excluded because </v>

421
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:29.570
<v Speaker 3>it's the category of excluded is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>category of all things that don't fit in</v>

422
00:18:29.571 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 3>the category system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's an infinite set,</v>

423
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.453
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

424
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

425
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.010
<v Speaker 3>but then I woke up this morning and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

426
00:18:35.011 --> 00:18:37.650
<v Speaker 3>well we could do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could calculate that mathematically.</v>

427
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.080
<v Speaker 3>So because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was thinking about the rise of</v>

428
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:46.400
<v Speaker 3>intersectionality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the rise of intersectionality,</v>

429
00:18:46.401 --> 00:18:47.234
<v Speaker 3>is that actually the reoccurrence of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual within the collective ideas </v>

430
00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:53.460
<v Speaker 3>of postmodern neo Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you might say,</v>

431
00:18:53.461 --> 00:18:54.294
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm excluded because I'm black or I'm </v>

432
00:18:56.491 --> 00:18:57.324
<v Speaker 3>excluded because I'm a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then someone puts up their hand and </v>

433
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:00.480
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

434
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.690
<v Speaker 3>those two categories don't include black</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>

435
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.480
<v Speaker 3>They don't include the intersection of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

436
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.433
<v Speaker 3>of the two categories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that there's no reason that black </v>

437
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:13.200
<v Speaker 3>and woman is more important than black </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>

438
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I thought,</v>

439
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:17.340
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's fine.</v>

440
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:18.174
<v Speaker 3>So the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you start to get smaller and </v>

441
00:19:20.551 --> 00:19:25.440
<v Speaker 3>smaller numbers of people as exemplars </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the categories that are excluded.</v>

442
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.540
<v Speaker 3>So then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

443
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.183
<v Speaker 3>how many categories do you need to add </v>
<v Speaker 3>in an intersectional analysis before </v>

444
00:19:32.491 --> 00:19:34.470
<v Speaker 3>you're actually down to one in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>billion?</v>

445
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Because you do fractionated down to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

446
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.340
<v Speaker 3>So now it's kind of screwy </v>
<v Speaker 3>mathematically because it depends on the</v>

447
00:19:44.341 --> 00:19:47.100
<v Speaker 3>grid nations of your category system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

448
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could call you old or young,</v>

449
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.670
<v Speaker 3>that'd be binary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

450
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.590
<v Speaker 3>But I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

451
00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:55.080
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on a scale from zero to 100,</v>

452
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.450
<v Speaker 3>so that would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be,</v>

453
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.433
<v Speaker 3>that would give you a point zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one probability of there'll be 100 </v>

454
00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:03.174
<v Speaker 3>groups that you could belong to in age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought well let's just use 100 as </v>

455
00:20:07.141 --> 00:20:10.440
<v Speaker 3>an example because it could be two or it</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be 10,000.</v>

456
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.390
<v Speaker 3>It's arbitrary because we could say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

457
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.900
<v Speaker 3>well I'm 41 and there's advantages and </v>
<v Speaker 3>disadvantages that go along with that.</v>

458
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.403
<v Speaker 3>But someone else could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm 41 in six months and there's a </v>

459
00:20:21.991 --> 00:20:25.650
<v Speaker 3>slightly different set of advantages and</v>
<v Speaker 3>disadvantages that go along with that.</v>

460
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.473
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have six categories with a </v>

461
00:20:29.071 --> 00:20:32.520
<v Speaker 3>probability of point one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're one in a billion,</v>

462
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.073
<v Speaker 3>so you just need six dimensions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>intersectionality before you </v>

463
00:20:37.331 --> 00:20:40.350
<v Speaker 3>fractionated the population down to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>level of the individual.</v>

464
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.390
<v Speaker 3>So just so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means the individual comes sneaking</v>

465
00:20:45.391 --> 00:20:46.224
<v Speaker 3>back into the collective ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism once you hit six </v>

466
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:52.950
<v Speaker 3>intersectional categories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

467
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.610
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was really.</v>

468
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous music.</v>

469
00:20:56.921 --> 00:20:57.754
<v Speaker 3>So I said this will do the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're multiracial woman who's </v>

470
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.980
<v Speaker 3>bisexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>27 years old,</v>

471
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.370
<v Speaker 3>smart 30th percentile for </v>
<v Speaker 3>attractiveness,</v>

472
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.990
<v Speaker 3>10th percentile for familial wealth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>80th percentile for education.</v>

473
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.730
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is the.</v>

474
00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:16.564
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the only one in the world like </v>

475
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:18.484
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

476
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.720
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

477
00:21:25.721 --> 00:21:27.220
<v Speaker 3>So then I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

478
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 3>so now then I was also thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this from a scientific perspective.</v>

479
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:31.534
<v Speaker 3>So the reason you assigned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to do an experiment on </v>

480
00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:35.524
<v Speaker 3>two groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you do something to one group </v>

481
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:42.130
<v Speaker 3>but not to the other group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to make the control group proper,</v>

482
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:42.964
<v Speaker 3>you have to assign randomly to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>group and the reason you do random </v>

483
00:21:46.691 --> 00:21:47.524
<v Speaker 3>association is because there's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite number of variables you can't </v>

484
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:50.704
<v Speaker 3>control for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you assigned randomly so that </v>

485
00:21:53.501 --> 00:21:54.334
<v Speaker 3>infinity cancels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cancels itself out and the only </v>

486
00:21:56.921 --> 00:22:00.970
<v Speaker 3>difference you're left with is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>experimental condition.</v>

487
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 3>And then scientists sometimes try to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>around that.</v>

488
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:05.913
<v Speaker 3>Like we used to study people who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>sons of alcoholics and multi and they </v>

489
00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Speaker 3>had a multigenerational family history </v>
<v Speaker 3>of alcoholism.</v>

490
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.373
<v Speaker 3>And then we were trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>what might distinguish them from a </v>

491
00:22:16.361 --> 00:22:17.740
<v Speaker 3>normal person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

492
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.220
<v Speaker 3>So we try to get a control group to </v>
<v Speaker 3>contrast them with,</v>

493
00:22:21.221 --> 00:22:22.054
<v Speaker 3>so we bring them into the lab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say and give them alcohol and give the </v>

494
00:22:24.041 --> 00:22:24.874
<v Speaker 3>control group alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem was we didn't know what </v>

495
00:22:27.251 --> 00:22:29.470
<v Speaker 3>to control for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

496
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.160
<v Speaker 3>because alcoholism goes along with </v>
<v Speaker 3>antisocial personality disorder.</v>

497
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.580
<v Speaker 3>So do you control for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

498
00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Speaker 3>do you control for education?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you control for Icu?</v>

499
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.433
<v Speaker 3>Do you control for socioeconomic status?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the answer is you don't know </v>

500
00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:48.310
<v Speaker 3>because you don't know how those are </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with the alcoholism,</v>

501
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.713
<v Speaker 3>you can't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you gas and then you do an </v>

502
00:22:51.641 --> 00:22:53.700
<v Speaker 3>analysis of covariance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is,</v>

503
00:22:53.701 --> 00:22:55.310
<v Speaker 3>is that you don't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 3>covariate,</v>

504
00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.060
<v Speaker 3>which is why you need random assigned to</v>
<v Speaker 3>groups.</v>

505
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.550
<v Speaker 3>It's the only way of solving that </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

506
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the same problem of undecidability in</v>

507
00:23:03.731 --> 00:23:07.180
<v Speaker 3>some sense pops up very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very frequently in clinical research.</v>

508
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.153
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing happens if you're trying to </v>

509
00:23:08.951 --> 00:23:11.170
<v Speaker 3>figure out schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need a control group.</v>

510
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about siblings?</v>

511
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.580
<v Speaker 3>The siblings who don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia?</v>

512
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:16.631
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

513
00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:19.220
<v Speaker 3>except they have a different geno type,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

514
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.103
<v Speaker 3>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an impossible problem to solve </v>

515
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.470
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is why you need random association</v>

516
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.760
<v Speaker 3>to groups because you can't control for </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the variables.</v>

517
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.370
<v Speaker 3>You can't know in advance what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>relevant.</v>

518
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.520
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I had this.</v>

519
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.043
<v Speaker 3>So I thought that was very funny that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of individuality comes back </v>

520
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.600
<v Speaker 3>with intersectionality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

521
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:41.523
<v Speaker 3>it's just you just push </v>
<v Speaker 3>intersectionality to six dimensions and </v>

522
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're down to the individual.</v>

523
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.560
<v Speaker 3>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I had this little vision,</v>

524
00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:50.240
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to tell You the vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

525
00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:51.280
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

526
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:55.610
<v Speaker 3>So imagine a pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like imagine a plane first,</v>

527
00:23:55.611 --> 00:23:59.990
<v Speaker 3>like at a place in a place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a land but flat,</v>

528
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:04.640
<v Speaker 3>and then imagine a pyramid and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the pyramid,</v>

529
00:24:04.641 --> 00:24:08.330
<v Speaker 3>some distance from it is a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

530
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:11.420
<v Speaker 3>So think about that just as the basic </v>
<v Speaker 3>scheme of a walled city.</v>

531
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.063
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the pyramid is the group that's in </v>

532
00:24:15.231 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

533
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.010
<v Speaker 3>and the value structure that that group </v>
<v Speaker 3>orients itself by.</v>

534
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now outside that wall,</v>

535
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.733
<v Speaker 3>there's a very large number of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramids and that's basically the </v>

536
00:24:26.661 --> 00:24:27.494
<v Speaker 3>postmodern world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that's kind of the world </v>

537
00:24:28.821 --> 00:24:31.580
<v Speaker 3>that they're described and is set </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable.</v>

538
00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

539
00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean could continue or example I </v>

540
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.270
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that for sure that he did,</v>

541
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.163
<v Speaker 1>he would say would say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about the problem of the </v>

542
00:24:48.081 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 1>contain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the contained space,</v>

543
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

544
00:24:50.871 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the wall and the pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

545
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:55.220
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have,</v>

546
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.083
<v Speaker 1>he would have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have a problem with that </v>

547
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.260
<v Speaker 1>structure itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for him that would be,</v>

548
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:01.363
<v Speaker 1>that would be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be a solid structure would </v>

549
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.510
<v Speaker 1>have been flooded with time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

550
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.321
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay,</v>

551
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:07.860
<v Speaker 1>we'll get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

552
00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.270
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that is</v>

553
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.360
<v Speaker 3>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

554
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you added another dimension to it.</v>

555
00:25:12.371 --> 00:25:15.070
<v Speaker 3>The problem is there's an insight and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wall and an outside.</v>

556
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.070
<v Speaker 3>That's problem number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outside excludes,</v>

557
00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:18.983
<v Speaker 3>we could call that problem number two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Problem number three is that the center </v>

558
00:25:22.481 --> 00:25:24.100
<v Speaker 3>will not hold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

559
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.473
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the same problem as far as </v>

560
00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:28.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned as the serpent in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>garden of Eden.</v>

561
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

562
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

563
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:31.810
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

564
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.220
<v Speaker 3>so let's say that really is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean fundamentally</v>

565
00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:37.403
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually if you go back to the garden of </v>

566
00:25:38.101 --> 00:25:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Eden and you find the problem somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

567
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.630
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now imagine that outside the,</v>

568
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside the wall,</v>

569
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:47.953
<v Speaker 3>all those pyramids fragment and fragment</v>
<v Speaker 3>down to the level of individual people </v>

570
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:52.963
<v Speaker 3>so they decompose to the level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual people because that's how </v>

571
00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:56.954
<v Speaker 3>much variability there actually is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because those groups were artificial </v>

572
00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:04.190
<v Speaker 3>constructions and so you can fragment </v>
<v Speaker 3>them down to the individual.</v>

573
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:05.623
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now the question is you want to let </v>

574
00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:09.650
<v Speaker 3>some of those people into the enclosed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

575
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.090
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next part of the vision,</v>

576
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:15.740
<v Speaker 3>the pyramid grows across on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a church,</v>

577
00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:17.643
<v Speaker 3>it's the center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the cross represents whatever the </v>

578
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.450
<v Speaker 3>ordering principle of that center is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

579
00:26:23.451 --> 00:26:24.284
<v Speaker 3>So then I would say an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to add to this because </v>

580
00:26:27.891 --> 00:26:29.660
<v Speaker 3>you did at the beginning of the talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>already,</v>

581
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.630
<v Speaker 3>the cross is the center point of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

582
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.260
<v Speaker 3>It's the axis of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the world tree.</v>

583
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:41.980
<v Speaker 3>It's also the place of suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the place of suffering,</v>

584
00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 3>excepted voluntarily and transcended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all of those things.</v>

585
00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

586
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:49.074
<v Speaker 3>And so that it crosses also assemble of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hero and the hero is the person who </v>

587
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:58.860
<v Speaker 3>confronts chaos and gain something of </v>
<v Speaker 3>value from it.</v>

588
00:26:58.861 --> 00:26:59.694
<v Speaker 3>So that's voluntary and the hero is also</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person who recasts the archaic </v>

589
00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:06.780
<v Speaker 3>structure of the structure when it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary.</v>

590
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.573
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you see those hero themes </v>

591
00:27:10.951 --> 00:27:15.951
<v Speaker 3>developed quite regularly across any </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable historical span of time.</v>

592
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.650
<v Speaker 3>So that's the redeemer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Messiah,</v>

593
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.123
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that makes order out of chaos and </v>

594
00:27:21.901 --> 00:27:26.640
<v Speaker 3>then takes order when it's too rigid and</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaks it apart.</v>

595
00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:27.700
<v Speaker 3>And recasts yeah.</v>

596
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that in the story of King David,</v>

597
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.990
<v Speaker 1>you see that actually really well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like very,</v>

598
00:27:31.991 --> 00:27:33.290
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

599
00:27:33.291 --> 00:27:35.980
<v Speaker 1>he breaks like he acts as the pool and </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

600
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.023
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as someone who is actually a kind of </v>

601
00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:39.693
<v Speaker 1>thief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trickster figure while the tyrant is in </v>

602
00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:44.880
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when that tire and fall,</v>

603
00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:49.510
<v Speaker 1>then he comes in and creates a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>centralized order by bringing the Ark to</v>

604
00:27:49.511 --> 00:27:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Jerusalem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has that whole arc and his story.</v>

605
00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good version of it.</v>

606
00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll keep that in mind for when I get to</v>

607
00:27:56.411 --> 00:27:59.050
<v Speaker 3>that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my biblical lectures,</v>

608
00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.153
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now you have to open the door on on </v>

609
00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:07.570
<v Speaker 3>the on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the question is who do you let in?</v>

610
00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.190
<v Speaker 3>So here's the idea,</v>

611
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.923
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you need to have a center and the </v>

612
00:28:13.791 --> 00:28:14.624
<v Speaker 3>center has to hold because things are </v>
<v Speaker 3>too complex without a center and a </v>

613
00:28:17.211 --> 00:28:20.450
<v Speaker 3>category system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the question is,</v>

614
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.823
<v Speaker 3>let's say that your category system has </v>
<v Speaker 3>to exist in accordance with the process </v>

615
00:28:25.611 --> 00:28:26.444
<v Speaker 3>that creates it and revitalizes it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because otherwise it can't maintain its </v>

616
00:28:30.711 --> 00:28:31.544
<v Speaker 3>stability across time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It degenerates into chaos or it </v>

617
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.010
<v Speaker 3>rigidified into too much order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

618
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.383
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the only people that you lead into </v>

619
00:28:39.711 --> 00:28:40.544
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inside the wall or those who agree </v>

620
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:49.060
<v Speaker 3>to live by the rule ethic at the ethic </v>
<v Speaker 3>that symbolized by the cross.</v>

621
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:50.083
<v Speaker 3>That's two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the willingness to abide by a </v>

622
00:28:53.271 --> 00:28:56.870
<v Speaker 3>certain level of social organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's more importantly,</v>

623
00:28:56.871 --> 00:28:57.704
<v Speaker 3>it's also the ability to transcend that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to participate in the process by </v>

624
00:29:01.761 --> 00:29:04.310
<v Speaker 3>which chaos has confronted and </v>
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily,</v>

625
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.353
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily confronted and reordered and</v>
<v Speaker 3>also to participate in the process by </v>

626
00:29:08.961 --> 00:29:12.860
<v Speaker 3>which order is</v>
<v Speaker 3>broken.</v>

627
00:29:12.861 --> 00:29:13.694
<v Speaker 3>When it's too rigid and brought back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the death and resurrection </v>

628
00:29:17.301 --> 00:29:18.134
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

629
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:18.973
<v Speaker 3>So those are the only people that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can let inside the structure without </v>

630
00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.373
<v Speaker 3>pose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without imposing a fatal threat to the </v>

631
00:29:25.281 --> 00:29:28.640
<v Speaker 3>structure itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if the walls fall,</v>

632
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:33.050
<v Speaker 3>then the infinite multitudes stream in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're done.</v>

633
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>

634
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.370
<v Speaker 1>it ceases to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you just cease to exist.</v>

635
00:29:37.371 --> 00:29:38.960
<v Speaker 1>That's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that that's all.</v>

636
00:29:38.961 --> 00:29:40.470
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

637
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd also say that that's,</v>

638
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.933
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem that's being thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>about in some sense with regards to the </v>

639
00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:51.670
<v Speaker 3>border issue in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we have a right to have a border?</v>

640
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.253
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was thinking today about a </v>

641
00:29:54.191 --> 00:29:55.024
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just take your typical grocery </v>

642
00:29:57.491 --> 00:29:59.790
<v Speaker 3>store and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's a,</v>

643
00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:00.803
<v Speaker 3>it's a category system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only those with money are allowed to </v>

644
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.880
<v Speaker 3>bring food out of this place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

645
00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:08.290
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>

646
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:13.560
<v Speaker 3>that's a terrible imposition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalist a patriarchy on and an unfair</v>

647
00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:16.414
<v Speaker 3>imposition of capitalist patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you throw the doors open and you say </v>

648
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.230
<v Speaker 3>everybody come and take what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

649
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:23.950
<v Speaker 3>And that works really well until the </v>
<v Speaker 3>store is empty.</v>

650
00:30:23.951 --> 00:30:24.784
<v Speaker 3>And then that's the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if everyone could do anything </v>

651
00:30:27.911 --> 00:30:28.744
<v Speaker 3>they want whenever they want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then not then it's complete and utter </v>

652
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:33.550
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>

653
00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is what happens in</v>

654
00:30:37.021 --> 00:30:37.854
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've lived in a place that is </v>

655
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:41.530
<v Speaker 1>absolute and utter chaos and chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>

656
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:42.693
<v Speaker 1>cannot sustain itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so usually what happens is the rise </v>

657
00:30:45.701 --> 00:30:46.534
<v Speaker 1>of a warlord of a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rise of someone who will by sheer </v>

658
00:30:50.711 --> 00:30:53.140
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by sheer physical forest,</v>

659
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:57.100
<v Speaker 1>impose their will on others because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>others will be,</v>

660
00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.650
<v Speaker 1>will have nothing to unite them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not,</v>

661
00:30:59.651 --> 00:31:01.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That know a lot of,</v>

662
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:01.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you unique anarchists and people who </v>

663
00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:06.040
<v Speaker 1>think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is such a thing as like a,</v>

664
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just kind of free anarchy where </v>

665
00:31:08.261 --> 00:31:11.230
<v Speaker 1>everybody's equal and everybody can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they want.</v>

666
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.410
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't exist because the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that anarchy comes a tyrant,</v>

667
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.590
<v Speaker 1>inevitably there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no stopping it right</v>

668
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.710
<v Speaker 3>into anarchy comes a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

669
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.450
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

670
00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:25.050
<v Speaker 3>And that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem with that is that the</v>

671
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.550
<v Speaker 3>fundamental organizing principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tyrant is tyranny.</v>

672
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pure,</v>

673
00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.270
<v Speaker 1>pure power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure power.</v>

674
00:31:32.271 --> 00:31:35.540
<v Speaker 1>And pure also a personality cult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

675
00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:40.630
<v Speaker 1>it's that it's that person instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being an ideal onto which we,</v>

676
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.200
<v Speaker 1>we serve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

677
00:31:42.201 --> 00:31:42.551
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

678
00:31:42.551 --> 00:31:45.440
<v Speaker 1>our mythic figure or a or a divine </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure.</v>

679
00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.570
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

680
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.450
<v Speaker 1>it'd become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become Hitler or it becomes a,</v>

681
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a napoleon or it becomes </v>

682
00:31:52.721 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 1>solid or become whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

683
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:55.403
<v Speaker 1>it's that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is embodied in their </v>

684
00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.050
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I always say,</v>

685
00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:02.630
<v Speaker 1>like I always have this image of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

686
00:32:02.631 --> 00:32:07.631
<v Speaker 1>of a functional system is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the person who in some manner is able</v>

687
00:32:09.291 --> 00:32:10.124
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to at least symbolically stepped down </v>

688
00:32:12.201 --> 00:32:14.270
<v Speaker 1>from their power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always say that,</v>

689
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.280
<v Speaker 1>that George Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what made him so great is that he,</v>

690
00:32:18.281 --> 00:32:19.850
<v Speaker 1>he really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stopped being president.</v>

691
00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.480
<v Speaker 1>What created the impetus for the system </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work and in the same,</v>

692
00:32:23.481 --> 00:32:26.000
<v Speaker 1>in the Roman empire like Augustus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

693
00:32:26.001 --> 00:32:27.080
<v Speaker 1>people will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

694
00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:31.010
<v Speaker 1>will say that he didn't really do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when Augustus became emperor,</v>

695
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:36.190
<v Speaker 1>he stepped into the city as a citizen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he gave away all his power.</v>

696
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.280
<v Speaker 1>And by giving away all his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a strange way,</v>

697
00:32:40.281 --> 00:32:43.100
<v Speaker 1>he actually became the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>person in Rome,</v>

698
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:46.160
<v Speaker 1>but his power was not illegal power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a,</v>

699
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:51.200
<v Speaker 1>it was like there was something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>his capacity to not be the tyrant,</v>

700
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.213
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

701
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.430
<v Speaker 1>which stabilized the empire and made him</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful,</v>

702
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:56.690
<v Speaker 1>but in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a strain,</v>

703
00:32:56.691 --> 00:32:59.080
<v Speaker 1>in a very kind of strange way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>

704
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

705
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.083
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like a legitimate ruler has to be </v>

706
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.190
<v Speaker 3>bound by proper sovereign authority.</v>

707
00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

708
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I can give themselves to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

709
00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:10.180
<v Speaker 1>to the Senate and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at your service.</v>

710
00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.073
<v Speaker 1>And so it made him very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also kind of bound his power in </v>

711
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.170
<v Speaker 1>the Senate,</v>

712
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:15.711
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

713
00:33:15.711 --> 00:33:16.544
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see that emerging as early as </v>

714
00:33:17.631 --> 00:33:18.464
<v Speaker 3>Mesopotamia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where Martech or where the emperor had </v>

715
00:33:21.261 --> 00:33:22.094
<v Speaker 3>to act out his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his embodiment of Marduk in the New </v>

716
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.230
<v Speaker 3>Year's festival in Martech was the go </v>
<v Speaker 3>out hero who went out and confronted the</v>

717
00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:31.064
<v Speaker 3>dragon of chaos and made the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the reason that the emperor had </v>

718
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:37.460
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not sovereignty legitimacy,</v>

719
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.633
<v Speaker 3>that legitimacy is because he was acting</v>
<v Speaker 3>out in architectural pattern that </v>

720
00:33:42.261 --> 00:33:45.650
<v Speaker 3>transcended his own personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the question is,</v>

721
00:33:45.651 --> 00:33:47.180
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that archetipal pattern?</v>

722
00:33:47.181 --> 00:33:48.014
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hero who recasts the tyrannical state </v>

723
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:53.624
<v Speaker 3>and who confronts chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the structure that the answer to the </v>

724
00:33:57.081 --> 00:34:00.260
<v Speaker 3>problem of how you maintain a structure </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

725
00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:01.383
<v Speaker 3>in the flow of time is that you make the</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure itself subordinate to the </v>

726
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:09.380
<v Speaker 3>principle by which the structure is </v>
<v Speaker 3>generated.</v>

727
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:14.660
<v Speaker 3>And that means that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sovereign needs to be responsible to</v>

728
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:15.740
<v Speaker 3>the word essentially.</v>

729
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.300
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how you would think about it from</v>

730
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:20.300
<v Speaker 3>a Judeo Christian perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's above everything.</v>

731
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.410
<v Speaker 3>And it's the thing that does the </v>
<v Speaker 3>categorization initially.</v>

732
00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:27.260
<v Speaker 3>That's when God creates the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the word.</v>

733
00:34:27.261 --> 00:34:29.450
<v Speaker 3>And when Adam named the animals and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

734
00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:30.733
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also maintains that across time </v>

735
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:35.770
<v Speaker 3>because it does slip and slide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

736
00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.720
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

737
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.593
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See we've been talking about a post </v>

738
00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:42.560
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

739
00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:44.390
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and about a logo centrism.</v>

740
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.810
<v Speaker 3>And we've been kind of laughing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that too,</v>

741
00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:47.653
<v Speaker 3>because of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of it's referenced to Derrida's </v>

742
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.840
<v Speaker 3>fellow go centrism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

743
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:55.040
<v Speaker 3>but it's funny too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

744
00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:59.000
<v Speaker 3>because if you look at Hindu </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations of the center,</v>

745
00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:00.223
<v Speaker 3>they're not fellow go centric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fellows is embodied in the Lingam </v>

746
00:35:03.951 --> 00:35:07.970
<v Speaker 3>and the Yoni,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Fellas is conjoined with the Yoni.</v>

747
00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:08.804
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a masculine female duality that's </v>

748
00:35:11.391 --> 00:35:13.580
<v Speaker 3>at the center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just the masculine.</v>

749
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.840
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea that that center is </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily fell logo centric is,</v>

750
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.420
<v Speaker 3>is also wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

751
00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:20.930
<v Speaker 3>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

752
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is that,</v>

753
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:23.683
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

754
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.450
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to get explicit I guess,</v>

755
00:35:25.451 --> 00:35:28.720
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is foul logocentric,</v>

756
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

757
00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.570
<v Speaker 1>even if you imagine the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

758
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:32.290
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

759
00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:34.410
<v Speaker 1>the fallis inside the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

760
00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman,</v>

761
00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:36.603
<v Speaker 1>the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foulest is the center and the woman </v>

762
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.620
<v Speaker 1>envelops the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

763
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:42.810
<v Speaker 1>the center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Phallic Center,</v>

764
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that that would,</v>

765
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:45.744
<v Speaker 1>I have been trying to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think what we've all been trying </v>

766
00:35:47.701 --> 00:35:49.290
<v Speaker 1>to get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've been trying to get to too,</v>

767
00:35:49.291 --> 00:35:50.124
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to be able to speak of a logo </v>

768
00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:56.670
<v Speaker 1>centrism as in the proper manner that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

769
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.593
<v Speaker 1>to understand that to say logo sent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logo centrist means that we also </v>

770
00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:04.010
<v Speaker 1>understand like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

771
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.630
<v Speaker 1>the power of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

772
00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:07.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

773
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.360
<v Speaker 1>the power of the frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

774
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:12.960
<v Speaker 1>So the image I have of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of local centrism is really,</v>

775
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.180
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an image of the mother of God,</v>

776
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Mary with our hands up like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in her center there's a,</v>

777
00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:20.454
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a circle and out of her </v>

778
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.590
<v Speaker 1>colleagues coming the Christ child and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside that,</v>

779
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that circle,</v>

780
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 1>you see the stars as if it's like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire cosmos,</v>

781
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.360
<v Speaker 1>which is the frame for the logos to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself in.</v>

782
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.390
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that</v>

783
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:40.530
<v Speaker 3>nose open virgin to 14th century where </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mary is holding a globe,</v>

784
00:36:42.131 --> 00:36:42.964
<v Speaker 3>I think generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then she opens up and inside you </v>

785
00:36:45.221 --> 00:36:48.580
<v Speaker 3>have God the father and he's holding </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christ on the cross.</v>

786
00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:50.070
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

787
00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.500
<v Speaker 3>it's a similar sort of similar sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>notion,</v>

788
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:54.523
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that if we understand it </v>

789
00:36:55.731 --> 00:36:56.640
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

790
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:57.583
<v Speaker 1>there's like an implicit in the notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the law of logo centrism there's an </v>

791
00:37:01.521 --> 00:37:02.354
<v Speaker 1>implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of secret mentioned of the power </v>

792
00:37:06.201 --> 00:37:10.720
<v Speaker 1>of the feminine in that very term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we understand it fully as the,</v>

793
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the need for the kind of,</v>

794
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:15.223
<v Speaker 1>the kind of chaotic outside or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic potentiality which frames the </v>

795
00:37:20.331 --> 00:37:21.164
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of the logos and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that those two things need </v>

796
00:37:24.291 --> 00:37:25.910
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

797
00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:26.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the logos doesn't manifest themselves </v>

798
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.650
<v Speaker 1>without a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

799
00:37:30.651 --> 00:37:32.900
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a question for there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be an answer.</v>

800
00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.600
<v Speaker 1>And the question is a frame for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

801
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.510
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely one that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

802
00:37:38.511 --> 00:37:39.344
<v Speaker 1>That's like super important and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows how powerful the feminine is </v>

803
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.800
<v Speaker 1>because it actually acts as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

804
00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:45.963
<v Speaker 1>the category that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the frame in which the answer </v>

805
00:37:47.721 --> 00:37:48.554
<v Speaker 1>is given.</v>

806
00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

807
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.130
<v Speaker 3>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's develop that for a minute.</v>

808
00:37:52.131 --> 00:37:53.540
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

809
00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.460
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me see.</v>

810
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.333
<v Speaker 3>I had made me think of something that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>also wanted to tell to talk to you </v>

811
00:37:59.691 --> 00:38:00.524
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

812
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:01.543
<v Speaker 3>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you said the frame is determined by </v>

813
00:38:03.291 --> 00:38:05.230
<v Speaker 3>the question that's answered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

814
00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.430
<v Speaker 3>if it's asked that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good,</v>

815
00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.160
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

816
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:07.993
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

817
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:13.340
<v Speaker 3>so this is where I'd been butting heads </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Sam Harrison,</v>

818
00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.340
<v Speaker 3>where you butted heads with Weinstein </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

819
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:16.820
<v Speaker 3>In Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

820
00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because the question is,</v>

821
00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.340
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to have a category system.</v>

822
00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:28.190
<v Speaker 3>Now Harris basically claims that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>derive the category system from the,</v>

823
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:30.830
<v Speaker 3>from the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

824
00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.693
<v Speaker 3>But the objection to that is there's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite number of facts and they don't </v>

825
00:38:33.981 --> 00:38:35.760
<v Speaker 3>tell you what to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

826
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.813
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would say instead that you derive </v>

827
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:44.431
<v Speaker 3>the category system from your aims </v>
<v Speaker 3>because categories are there to,</v>

828
00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.490
<v Speaker 3>to help you fulfill your goals.</v>

829
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:52.040
<v Speaker 3>That's how category systems work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I think of the mess.</v>

830
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 3>Pragmatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

831
00:38:53.381 --> 00:38:56.640
<v Speaker 3>So now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given that your,</v>

832
00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.520
<v Speaker 3>your category system includes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>excludes and defines the world,</v>

833
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.820
<v Speaker 3>what should be the aim of the category </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

834
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.073
<v Speaker 3>and so I think that's what the sermon on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mount talks about because it </v>

835
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:10.900
<v Speaker 3>basically says what you should aim at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the highest possible good.</v>

836
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.410
<v Speaker 3>You should aim at union with God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say whatever that might mean,</v>

837
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.340
<v Speaker 3>that you aim at the highest possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>good with fully right,</v>

838
00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:20.590
<v Speaker 3>fully right down to the bottom of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>soul.</v>

839
00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:25.591
<v Speaker 3>If you could manage it so that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not broken and band top and twisted in a</v>

840
00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:26.584
<v Speaker 3>bunch of different subpersonalities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you try to unify yourself as a force </v>

841
00:39:30.581 --> 00:39:31.414
<v Speaker 3>for the highest good and you do that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>large part by deciding that being is </v>

842
00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:36.550
<v Speaker 3>worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

843
00:39:36.551 --> 00:39:40.090
<v Speaker 3>So you pledge allegiance to the concept </v>
<v Speaker 3>of being so you're not.</v>

844
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:45.150
<v Speaker 3>You're not like Cain and then you speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth in the service of that Ba and then</v>

845
00:39:46.121 --> 00:39:49.030
<v Speaker 3>that from that your category system </v>
<v Speaker 3>flows.</v>

846
00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.173
<v Speaker 3>So that's another reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramid with the cross is the center of </v>

847
00:39:53.231 --> 00:39:54.064
<v Speaker 3>the category system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because then you get a category system </v>

848
00:39:56.831 --> 00:39:57.664
<v Speaker 3>that includes what it should include,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the goal is the establishment of the </v>

849
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.740
<v Speaker 3>Kingdom of God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

850
00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:07.030
<v Speaker 3>which is the highest of possible goals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and excludes what it should exclude.</v>

851
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things too that that kind of </v>

852
00:40:09.651 --> 00:40:14.240
<v Speaker 1>differentiates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say Christian a ontology or like a</v>

853
00:40:14.241 --> 00:40:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Christian cosmology,</v>

854
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.713
<v Speaker 1>is that we have this idea that there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>an intimate relationship also between </v>

855
00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:25.010
<v Speaker 1>let's say the highest and the lowest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a.</v>

856
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:29.330
<v Speaker 1>There is something which which unites </v>
<v Speaker 1>them together completely so that.</v>

857
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.880
<v Speaker 1>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that even beyond,</v>

858
00:40:31.881 --> 00:40:34.940
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's this capacity to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

859
00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:40.420
<v Speaker 1>How can I say this to to unite things </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and so there was this idea,</v>

860
00:40:41.321 --> 00:40:45.430
<v Speaker 1>let's say like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an idea like the idea of a,</v>

861
00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.100
<v Speaker 1>of a normal of a Christian family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the,</v>

862
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the father is the head of the household,</v>

863
00:40:49.751 --> 00:40:52.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this idea that people hate today,</v>

864
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.950
<v Speaker 1>but there's this really this sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

865
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.520
<v Speaker 1>the head or the or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the king or the chief</v>

866
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:59.540
<v Speaker 3>exists</v>

867
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:00.843
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the benefit of those that are </v>

868
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.180
<v Speaker 1>dolores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are the lowest,</v>

869
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:07.851
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

870
00:41:07.851 --> 00:41:11.900
<v Speaker 3>So that's continually insisted upon in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Old Testament.</v>

871
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:12.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the prophets always come up and </v>

872
00:41:13.821 --> 00:41:17.150
<v Speaker 3>say to the king,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not attending sufficiently to the</v>

873
00:41:17.151 --> 00:41:17.984
<v Speaker 3>widows and the orphans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that means that you've become </v>

874
00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:21.044
<v Speaker 3>corrupt.</v>

875
00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in a way you can kind of see the </v>

876
00:41:22.821 --> 00:41:27.380
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy moving up in the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things looking up towards,</v>

877
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the hierarchy.</v>

878
00:41:28.821 --> 00:41:33.200
<v Speaker 1>But then there's also a really important</v>
<v Speaker 1>men in which the hierarchy moves down.</v>

879
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.183
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is that the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy exists for the bottom of the </v>

880
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:38.270
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

881
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:39.303
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the top of the hierarchy and in a </v>

882
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:44.210
<v Speaker 1>really important way as a sac is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificial existence.</v>

883
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.690
<v Speaker 1>So the highest thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

884
00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.593
<v Speaker 1>is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest street is the one that </v>

885
00:41:48.771 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those that are,</v>

886
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:52.090
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

887
00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:52.923
<v Speaker 3>think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think about that practically as </v>

888
00:41:54.611 --> 00:41:56.950
<v Speaker 3>the willingness of a father to care for </v>
<v Speaker 3>an infant.</v>

889
00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

890
00:41:58.331 --> 00:42:01.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because the infant's obviously the.</v>

891
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.840
<v Speaker 3>And of course the infant also has that </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential,</v>

892
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.600
<v Speaker 3>which is why the infant is made sacred </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

893
00:42:07.601 --> 00:42:09.850
<v Speaker 3>And in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that symbolic rail,</v>

894
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:12.520
<v Speaker 3>so the highest disserving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lowest,</v>

895
00:42:12.521 --> 00:42:15.260
<v Speaker 3>the lowest is the infant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say because it's most helpless.</v>

896
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.520
<v Speaker 3>But the infant is also the future of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>

897
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:21.150
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that that really,</v>

898
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.660
<v Speaker 1>and we've talked about this before </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly,</v>

899
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.920
<v Speaker 1>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

900
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:27.890
<v Speaker 1>the notion that the Christian hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

901
00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I is slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually slightly different from the,</v>

902
00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:34.010
<v Speaker 1>the pagan hero for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the night,</v>

903
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:37.550
<v Speaker 1>let's say in western Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the night would be the,</v>

904
00:42:37.551 --> 00:42:40.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the archetipal image of the Christian,</v>

905
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.190
<v Speaker 1>a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the notion of an Aristocrat,</v>

906
00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:45.200
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a warrior.</v>

907
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:50.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a soldier whose purpose is not to.</v>

908
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:51.583
<v Speaker 1>It is not only to gain honor on himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a way he gains on or on himself </v>

909
00:42:56.481 --> 00:42:59.600
<v Speaker 1>by sacrificing himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those who can't do it,</v>

910
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.110
<v Speaker 1>and so he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his honor is based on the fact that he's</v>

911
00:43:03.111 --> 00:43:05.030
<v Speaker 1>willing to fight for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the widow,</v>

912
00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:05.903
<v Speaker 1>the orphan for those that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't have the strength to fight </v>

913
00:43:08.841 --> 00:43:12.170
<v Speaker 1>for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so obviously in reality that doesn't</v>

914
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 1>always play out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

915
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:14.143
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ideal is there and the ideal is </v>

916
00:43:15.921 --> 00:43:20.600
<v Speaker 1>real and it's the basis of all our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all our hero movies,</v>

917
00:43:20.601 --> 00:43:21.434
<v Speaker 1>all our hero stories always had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the hero is the person who is </v>

918
00:43:25.131 --> 00:43:28.900
<v Speaker 1>willing to use their strength and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>power to defend.</v>

919
00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To sacrifice themselves for the,</v>

920
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.293
<v Speaker 1>for the week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very different from the pagan </v>

921
00:43:33.921 --> 00:43:34.880
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

922
00:43:34.881 --> 00:43:36.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Achilles.</v>

923
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.433
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weakness was contemptible under those </v>

924
00:43:38.621 --> 00:43:38.980
<v Speaker 3>circles.</v>

925
00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:39.813
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also it's like the only purpose was </v>

926
00:43:41.651 --> 00:43:42.484
<v Speaker 1>to attain honor on ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Achilles is sitting in his tent and </v>

927
00:43:46.151 --> 00:43:51.151
<v Speaker 1>he's moping and whining because we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken away his sex slave and he won't go</v>

928
00:43:51.701 --> 00:43:54.880
<v Speaker 1>back to fight until it affects him </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

929
00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:56.020
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

930
00:43:56.021 --> 00:43:56.940
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's actually not,</v>

931
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:59.440
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't care that much about helping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

932
00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.990
<v Speaker 1>the Greeks in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's really doing that,</v>

933
00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:06.070
<v Speaker 1>doing things for his own honor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's perfectly heroic and sitting</v>

934
00:44:06.071 --> 00:44:08.650
<v Speaker 1>in his tent and moping and not going </v>
<v Speaker 1>back into,</v>

935
00:44:08.651 --> 00:44:09.950
<v Speaker 1>into battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

936
00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:13.120
<v Speaker 1>because his honor has been attained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in Christianity,</v>

937
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:14.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

938
00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.430
<v Speaker 1>in stories like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

939
00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.850
<v Speaker 1>like if you see Sergei one and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

940
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:18.611
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read,</v>

941
00:44:18.611 --> 00:44:19.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

942
00:44:19.931 --> 00:44:20.490
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

943
00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.090
<v Speaker 1>the night and a cart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

944
00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:26.380
<v Speaker 1>that idea of Lancelot who is willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be seen as a,</v>

945
00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:27.820
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a criminal,</v>

946
00:44:27.821 --> 00:44:28.720
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

947
00:44:28.721 --> 00:44:33.721
<v Speaker 1>as the worst kind of person in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save the helpless Damsel in distress.</v>

948
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:34.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

949
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:37.750
<v Speaker 1>he's willing to sacrifice all his honor </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to help that,</v>

950
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:40.320
<v Speaker 1>that person who is in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a really,</v>

951
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a very different way of seeing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

952
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:49.001
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

953
00:44:49.001 --> 00:44:52.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to say after all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that fit into the whole thing,</v>

954
00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.170
<v Speaker 3>but he did have the cross that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

955
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:57.520
<v Speaker 3>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

956
00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:01.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm not suggesting at all that that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>not relevant to the,</v>

957
00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:03.250
<v Speaker 3>to what we've been discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dead relevant.</v>

958
00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:04.323
<v Speaker 3>I really liked the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know we've talked about the fact that </v>

959
00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:08.080
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

960
00:45:08.081 --> 00:45:12.430
<v Speaker 3>I've been conceptualized Christ as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the apex of the hierarchy,</v>

961
00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.353
<v Speaker 3>symbolically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the apex to such a degree that it </v>

962
00:45:15.701 --> 00:45:17.890
<v Speaker 3>actually detaches itself from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>

963
00:45:17.891 --> 00:45:19.420
<v Speaker 3>sort of like horus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

964
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:20.380
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

965
00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.340
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

966
00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Osprey or the what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is he a falcon in Egyptian</v>

967
00:45:26.861 --> 00:45:27.611
<v Speaker 3>symbolism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

968
00:45:27.611 --> 00:45:28.444
<v Speaker 3>He's the thing that flies above </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that can see or the Egyptian </v>

969
00:45:30.581 --> 00:45:31.414
<v Speaker 3>I add.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your correction was that it's not </v>

970
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.393
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you're detached in some sense </v>

971
00:45:37.541 --> 00:45:38.374
<v Speaker 3>you're not at the top anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're everywhere spread throughout the </v>

972
00:45:41.351 --> 00:45:42.380
<v Speaker 3>entire structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

973
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.410
<v Speaker 3>which is a very good way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

974
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the story of Christ is his story and</v>

975
00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:49.110
<v Speaker 1>his symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that he,</v>

976
00:45:49.111 --> 00:45:49.944
<v Speaker 1>he's at the top of the Dome that say in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the church where he's really exactly </v>

977
00:45:53.011 --> 00:45:54.490
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of,</v>

978
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:57.150
<v Speaker 1>this kind of detached a top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

979
00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:01.320
<v Speaker 1>but then he also stretches all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>down into death,</v>

980
00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:03.180
<v Speaker 1>into Haiti's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into chaos.</v>

981
00:46:03.181 --> 00:46:05.780
<v Speaker 1>And the cross is the other side where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

982
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:06.623
<v Speaker 1>he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's outside of the city being being </v>

983
00:46:08.671 --> 00:46:10.830
<v Speaker 1>killed by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by his friends,</v>

984
00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:11.730
<v Speaker 1>by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

985
00:46:11.731 --> 00:46:12.990
<v Speaker 1>he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outcasts,</v>

986
00:46:12.991 --> 00:46:14.220
<v Speaker 1>he's all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he,</v>

987
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:15.173
<v Speaker 1>he unites the two extremes of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy together and fills the </v>

988
00:46:18.331 --> 00:46:20.840
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy with logo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea</v>

989
00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.610
<v Speaker 3>that he transcends depth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

990
00:46:22.611 --> 00:46:23.444
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to take this from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological perspective because the </v>

991
00:46:26.211 --> 00:46:29.000
<v Speaker 3>theological waters are getting too deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me here.</v>

992
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:30.933
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are because I don't understand it </v>

993
00:46:32.091 --> 00:46:34.340
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really trying to work it out,</v>

994
00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.320
<v Speaker 3>but I don't understand it well enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>

995
00:46:36.321 --> 00:46:37.154
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that Christ descends into </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell and rescues people from hell and </v>

996
00:46:40.641 --> 00:46:41.474
<v Speaker 3>death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be quite straightforwardly </v>

997
00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:48.110
<v Speaker 3>psychologically because the consequence </v>
<v Speaker 3>of not of erecting a,</v>

998
00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:49.523
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our category structure that isn't </v>

999
00:46:51.561 --> 00:46:55.370
<v Speaker 3>predicated on the hero is that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be inhale and die.</v>

1000
00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:57.231
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1001
00:46:57.231 --> 00:46:59.840
<v Speaker 3>that's what happened in the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as I'm concerned.</v>

1002
00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:03.740
<v Speaker 3>And so those health stories are real </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough as far as I'm concerned about,</v>

1003
00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.070
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't speak to their potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent reality.</v>

1004
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:08.690
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a whole different issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1005
00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:09.673
<v Speaker 3>here's something else that's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been bugging me and I'm just </v>

1006
00:47:12.771 --> 00:47:13.880
<v Speaker 3>starting to think this through.</v>

1007
00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that there's,</v>

1008
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:19.370
<v Speaker 3>there's an idea that if you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right place at the right time,</v>

1009
00:47:19.371 --> 00:47:21.290
<v Speaker 3>that everything comes together and lines</v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1010
00:47:21.291 --> 00:47:22.880
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was wondering,</v>

1011
00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.013
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how a story like the story of Christ is </v>

1012
00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.533
<v Speaker 3>told many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many ways like from the cosmic to the </v>

1013
00:47:32.051 --> 00:47:33.080
<v Speaker 3>microcosmic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1014
00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:34.043
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the macrocosmic stories is </v>

1015
00:47:36.071 --> 00:47:36.904
<v Speaker 3>the relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>astrological speculations and Christ </v>

1016
00:47:39.551 --> 00:47:42.370
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there are 12 constellations,</v>

1017
00:47:42.371 --> 00:47:46.420
<v Speaker 3>like there are 12 disciples and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden is Christ essentially.</v>

1018
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:50.290
<v Speaker 3>And that story really works and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>maps onto the calendar properly.</v>

1019
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:51.603
<v Speaker 3>And so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's because people have one </v>

1020
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:54.274
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of that is that's because</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have retold the story at each </v>

1021
00:47:57.731 --> 00:47:58.564
<v Speaker 3>level of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But another possible reason for that is </v>

1022
00:48:02.381 --> 00:48:03.214
<v Speaker 3>that it's synchronous in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the fact that everything comes </v>

1023
00:48:06.941 --> 00:48:09.280
<v Speaker 3>together around that central access in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1024
00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a real way,</v>

1025
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:12.343
<v Speaker 3>and that the story can't help but be </v>
<v Speaker 3>represented at multiple levels of </v>

1026
00:48:14.981 --> 00:48:16.350
<v Speaker 3>reality simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1027
00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what the story is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

1028
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.860
<v Speaker 1>that that's exactly what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is about this,</v>

1029
00:48:22.861 --> 00:48:25.200
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this lining up of everything,</v>

1030
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:26.940
<v Speaker 1>of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1031
00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1032
00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to see that.</v>

1033
00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:33.420
<v Speaker 1>It'd be hard to see the fullness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1034
00:48:33.421 --> 00:48:34.254
<v Speaker 1>When you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it always kind of jars you because it's </v>

1035
00:48:35.911 --> 00:48:36.840
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1036
00:48:36.841 --> 00:48:39.180
<v Speaker 1>the story of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people like,</v>

1037
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.313
<v Speaker 1>if you pay attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will constantly be knocking you down </v>

1038
00:48:42.691 --> 00:48:43.770
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1039
00:48:43.771 --> 00:48:44.604
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems even at a first glance </v>

1040
00:48:46.831 --> 00:48:47.664
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it seems like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictory because Christ is all </v>

1041
00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:50.850
<v Speaker 1>these things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1042
00:48:50.851 --> 00:48:52.620
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the teacher,</v>

1043
00:48:52.621 --> 00:48:54.420
<v Speaker 1>he's the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the shepherd,</v>

1044
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the outcast.</v>

1045
00:48:55.921 --> 00:48:56.890
<v Speaker 1>He's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1046
00:48:56.891 --> 00:48:57.571
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the,</v>

1047
00:48:57.571 --> 00:48:58.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1048
00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technician,</v>

1049
00:48:59.101 --> 00:49:00.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the artist.</v>

1050
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.140
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like,</v>

1051
00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:03.080
<v Speaker 1>how is it that a story can income?</v>

1052
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:06.000
<v Speaker 1>And the more you look in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the why he's a fisherman,</v>

1053
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

1054
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:07.483
<v Speaker 1>And so all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did all these things can fit in one </v>

1055
00:49:10.021 --> 00:49:12.330
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to glance over it because it's</v>

1056
00:49:12.331 --> 00:49:13.530
<v Speaker 1>so short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're read a gospel,</v>

1057
00:49:13.531 --> 00:49:14.364
<v Speaker 1>you kind of go through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then if you really look at all the </v>

1058
00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:19.200
<v Speaker 1>aspects and you understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional categories,</v>

1059
00:49:19.201 --> 00:49:21.570
<v Speaker 1>let's say that in the normal world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1060
00:49:21.571 --> 00:49:22.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the,</v>

1061
00:49:22.621 --> 00:49:25.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shepherd and the,</v>

1062
00:49:25.891 --> 00:49:27.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the agriculturalists usually are not the</v>

1063
00:49:27.841 --> 00:49:30.900
<v Speaker 1>same person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Christ they're the same person.</v>

1064
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.840
<v Speaker 1>He's able to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1065
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.060
<v Speaker 1>but we're fish exact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's finished,</v>

1066
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:38.730
<v Speaker 1>but he's a fisherman and he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's the stumbling stone,</v>

1067
00:49:38.731 --> 00:49:41.250
<v Speaker 1>but he's also the capstone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's stretched like,</v>

1068
00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.380
<v Speaker 1>we talk about this idea of stretching </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the entire hierarchy.</v>

1069
00:49:43.381 --> 00:49:44.840
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1070
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.750
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1071
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:46.310
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1072
00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:48.930
<v Speaker 1>he's the stone that doesn't fit that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>builder.</v>

1073
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:49.920
<v Speaker 1>So here's.</v>

1074
00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1075
00:49:50.401 --> 00:49:51.990
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The builder rejected.</v>

1076
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:52.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1077
00:49:52.831 --> 00:49:53.664
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've come to understand about tyrannies </v>

1078
00:49:56.881 --> 00:50:00.120
<v Speaker 3>is that if you have a tear tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 3>person at the top,</v>

1079
00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:01.643
<v Speaker 3>the top isn't just at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tyranny is mirrored the entire </v>

1080
00:50:05.701 --> 00:50:06.630
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1081
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

1082
00:50:08.431 --> 00:50:10.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are those three d,</v>

1083
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:12.210
<v Speaker 3>holographic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hologram.</v>

1084
00:50:12.211 --> 00:50:15.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like a Hologram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every part is a reflection of the whole.</v>

1085
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:20.670
<v Speaker 3>And so I wonder if that's analogous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a pyramid,</v>

1086
00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.670
<v Speaker 3>say with the principle of the divine </v>
<v Speaker 3>hero at the top,</v>

1087
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 3>then what happens is that's reflected at</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single level of the,</v>

1088
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.250
<v Speaker 1>of the hierarchy would be with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>

1089
00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1090
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:33.590
<v Speaker 1>it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except that.</v>

1091
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that the,</v>

1092
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1093
00:50:37.161 --> 00:50:38.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tyranny is,</v>

1094
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:42.620
<v Speaker 1>will be just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of up down like that top down,</v>

1095
00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:43.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light that shines down and kind of puts </v>

1096
00:50:45.741 --> 00:50:48.470
<v Speaker 1>everything in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when it reaches the things that</v>

1097
00:50:48.471 --> 00:50:51.170
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it can't absorb,</v>

1098
00:50:51.171 --> 00:50:53.630
<v Speaker 1>it'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll completely cut them off,</v>

1099
00:50:53.631 --> 00:50:54.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it'll kill them,</v>

1100
00:50:54.621 --> 00:50:55.490
<v Speaker 1>it'll burn them off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1101
00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:56.324
<v Speaker 1>it will just destroy them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas there's something about </v>

1102
00:50:58.371 --> 00:51:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Christianity or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like a traditional,</v>

1103
00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.790
<v Speaker 1>a hierarchy which is a stretching out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1104
00:51:05.791 --> 00:51:08.580
<v Speaker 1>so you could imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say in terms of,</v>

1105
00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:10.160
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all of Christianity.</v>

1106
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:14.480
<v Speaker 1>It isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're really,</v>

1107
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:15.820
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a,</v>

1108
00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:16.790
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1109
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.060
<v Speaker 1>a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say for,</v>

1110
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:24.530
<v Speaker 1>at least in in the world there's a play </v>
<v Speaker 1>until the last judgment,</v>

1111
00:51:24.531 --> 00:51:25.580
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the last judgment.</v>

1112
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 1>There's a place for that buffer to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and to be slowly assimilated.</v>

1113
00:51:29.661 --> 00:51:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1114
00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.670
<v Speaker 1>so it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

1115
00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:34.880
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't totally shut itself off a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1116
00:51:34.881 --> 00:51:35.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1117
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:37.730
<v Speaker 1>there's room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a gate,</v>

1118
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

1119
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.823
<v Speaker 1>and there's always people that can come </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the gate and that are always </v>

1120
00:51:41.961 --> 00:51:46.690
<v Speaker 1>kind of entering and slowly being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>signified assimilated.</v>

1121
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:48.920
<v Speaker 1>But I've just assimilated but also </v>
<v Speaker 1>transforming it.</v>

1122
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:49.783
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's going to be into what it's </v>

1123
00:51:50.961 --> 00:51:52.410
<v Speaker 1>going to become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a,</v>

1124
00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a radical process.</v>

1125
00:51:54.321 --> 00:51:56.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like this organic transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

1126
00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:59.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge part of what we're arguing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about right now.</v>

1127
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1128
00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:02.003
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you handled the </v>

1129
00:52:03.801 --> 00:52:05.180
<v Speaker 1>integration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1130
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:08.310
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is no integration?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1131
00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:11.900
<v Speaker 1>because what that does is rigidified the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure because if you,</v>

1132
00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:15.170
<v Speaker 1>if you close it off completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also rigidified inside.</v>

1133
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is the chaos is </v>

1134
00:52:17.841 --> 00:52:18.674
<v Speaker 1>going to break forth inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because you can't get rid of the </v>

1135
00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:21.740
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1136
00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.580
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1137
00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:25.550
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

1138
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:26.503
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now there's the excluded are </v>

1139
00:52:29.031 --> 00:52:31.250
<v Speaker 1>included.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the question is well,</v>

1140
00:52:31.251 --> 00:52:32.084
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is then the responsibility of the </v>

1141
00:52:34.041 --> 00:52:34.874
<v Speaker 1>get included and the responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the included is to not break the </v>

1142
00:52:39.561 --> 00:52:41.540
<v Speaker 1>structure of the system that included </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1143
00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:42.970
<v Speaker 1>You'd set that yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1144
00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:43.853
<v Speaker 1>that's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good way of seeing that </v>

1145
00:52:45.591 --> 00:52:48.410
<v Speaker 1>because that's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually probably the best way of</v>

1146
00:52:48.411 --> 00:52:53.270
<v Speaker 1>understanding a understanding it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of how it works itself out in real</v>

1147
00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:54.110
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1148
00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you come in,</v>

1149
00:52:55.490 --> 00:53:00.320
<v Speaker 1>if you come in as an assimilated margin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1150
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:01.333
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a margin that wants to participate </v>

1151
00:53:02.571 --> 00:53:03.404
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a country or in an identity or in a </v>

1152
00:53:04.671 --> 00:53:06.470
<v Speaker 1>group or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in a club,</v>

1153
00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.380
<v Speaker 1>like your responsibility is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

1154
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:13.100
<v Speaker 1>is to not break what makes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

1155
00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:15.740
<v Speaker 1>do you know if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be a,</v>

1156
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:17.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to join a,</v>

1157
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.220
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1158
00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.113
<v Speaker 1>a baseball group and a baseball team and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come into the team and you're the </v>

1159
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Newbie on the team and you and you all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden expect everybody to,</v>

1160
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 1>to play basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play basketball.</v>

1161
00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:30.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then why,</v>

1162
00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.460
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it destroyed?</v>

1163
00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 1>It destroyed the club itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1164
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that's a very simple way?</v>

1165
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.511
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1166
00:53:39.511 --> 00:53:42.300
<v Speaker 3>we talked about that a little bit with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the abrahamic stories,</v>

1167
00:53:42.301 --> 00:53:43.134
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there was the problem in the </v>

1168
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:47.730
<v Speaker 3>abrahamic stories of how to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the marginal.</v>

1169
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1170
00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.280
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>

1171
00:53:52.281 --> 00:53:57.090
<v Speaker 3>I can't recreate that on the flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had to do with hospitality,</v>

1172
00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.940
<v Speaker 3>hospitality behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1173
00:53:58.941 --> 00:54:03.470
<v Speaker 3>So the rule is I show you hospitality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's my rule by obligation,</v>

1174
00:54:03.471 --> 00:54:04.304
<v Speaker 3>but your obligation is not to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to make passes at my wife and </v>

1175
00:54:07.311 --> 00:54:08.300
<v Speaker 3>disrupt my household.</v>

1176
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:09.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a relationship builds with the </v>

1177
00:54:12.481 --> 00:54:16.050
<v Speaker 1>stranger and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then slowly the stranger,</v>

1178
00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1179
00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:19.230
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1180
00:54:19.231 --> 00:54:21.540
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you then maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stranger,</v>

1181
00:54:21.541 --> 00:54:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Mary's your daughter at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1182
00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:24.391
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1183
00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:25.350
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

1184
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.273
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of creating a </v>

1185
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:31.710
<v Speaker 1>relationship which will integrate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two identities together,</v>

1186
00:54:31.711 --> 00:54:35.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's a gradual process and one which</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be done,</v>

1187
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1188
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:37.770
<v Speaker 1>with mutual respect.</v>

1189
00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:38.561
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1190
00:54:38.561 --> 00:54:39.394
<v Speaker 3>even the proper spirit that would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that would be the spirit of </v>

1191
00:54:42.131 --> 00:54:46.750
<v Speaker 3>the logos because the logo's is also the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that goes outside the boundaries.</v>

1192
00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:48.093
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's say you have a person from </v>

1193
00:54:49.511 --> 00:54:51.970
<v Speaker 3>group a here in person from Group B </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1194
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.133
<v Speaker 3>and then they decided to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both of them have to go outside their </v>

1195
00:54:55.301 --> 00:54:59.440
<v Speaker 3>group and meet in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the junction between the two groups,</v>

1196
00:54:59.441 --> 00:55:02.410
<v Speaker 3>which is a different place and they have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make peace,</v>

1197
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.250
<v Speaker 3>but they make peace there under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guise of themselves as individual.</v>

1198
00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:07.093
<v Speaker 3>It's exploratory individuals and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the groups can integrate as a </v>

1199
00:55:09.641 --> 00:55:10.474
<v Speaker 3>consequence of that and they've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>without falling apart and without </v>

1200
00:55:14.201 --> 00:55:14.900
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>

1201
00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:19.110
<v Speaker 1>And if something appears like something </v>
<v Speaker 1>will manifest itself as whatever is,</v>

1202
00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.810
<v Speaker 1>is holding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1203
00:55:20.811 --> 00:55:21.644
<v Speaker 1>the two groups together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two families are the two people and </v>

1204
00:55:23.841 --> 00:55:25.430
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that logos will,</v>

1205
00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:29.000
<v Speaker 1>with the coming together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say to families is a good example.</v>

1206
00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.710
<v Speaker 1>You have two families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1207
00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they and then people in the two</v>

1208
00:55:33.111 --> 00:55:38.111
<v Speaker 1>families intermarried and so there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that unites them together,</v>

1209
00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:39.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1210
00:55:39.341 --> 00:55:44.341
<v Speaker 1>and it's the coming together that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that logos will appear and will hold,</v>

1211
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:47.330
<v Speaker 1>hold the relationships in place.</v>

1212
00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:51.770
<v Speaker 3>That marriage is a recreation of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>masculine feminine une.</v>

1213
00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1214
00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:57.210
<v Speaker 3>that's associated sometimes with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Androgyny of Christ in sometimes with.</v>

1215
00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:00.120
<v Speaker 3>There's an old idea and I can't remember</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it comes from that,</v>

1216
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:05.580
<v Speaker 3>that Adam before eve was a for right?</v>

1217
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or androgynous.</v>

1218
00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.950
<v Speaker 3>You draw or Androgynous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1219
00:56:08.951 --> 00:56:09.784
<v Speaker 3>And that Christ as the second Adam </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreates that androgyny in the proper </v>

1220
00:56:14.021 --> 00:56:14.670
<v Speaker 3>manner.</v>

1221
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1222
00:56:15.591 --> 00:56:16.940
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1223
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:18.023
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1224
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:19.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1225
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:20.083
<v Speaker 1>there are some use funded in some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>church fathers where they'll say things </v>

1226
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:23.733
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to help you to understand it and </v>

1227
00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.260
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say things that like,</v>

1228
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:30.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that God separated Adam and Eve,</v>

1229
00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:35.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam into two in view of the fall,</v>

1230
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.190
<v Speaker 1>right in the sense that it wasn't the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall,</v>

1231
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.860
<v Speaker 1>but it was the idea that it had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1232
00:56:41.861 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 1>it has to do with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of living outside the garden,</v>

1233
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:46.521
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1234
00:56:46.521 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1235
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:51.980
<v Speaker 1>and having them to come back together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that coming back together in,</v>

1236
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:56.320
<v Speaker 1>in terms of sexual union and in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>procreation then is,</v>

1237
00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.350
<v Speaker 1>becomes a little microcosm of what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the garden,</v>

1238
00:56:59.351 --> 00:57:00.650
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1239
00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:02.290
<v Speaker 1>and that's why also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1240
00:57:02.291 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

1241
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:06.270
<v Speaker 2>Adam and I wondered to what degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually.</v>

1242
00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:07.133
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say neurophysiologically </v>

1243
00:57:10.171 --> 00:57:12.270
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to say something like that</v>

1244
00:57:12.271 --> 00:57:15.510
<v Speaker 2>because it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I made allusions to this when we did</v>

1245
00:57:15.511 --> 00:57:16.344
<v Speaker 2>that talk about logos meant people maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that it wasn't the most </v>

1246
00:57:19.201 --> 00:57:22.770
<v Speaker 2>appropriate thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sexual union produces this,</v>

1247
00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:26.010
<v Speaker 2>this brief union in paradise.</v>

1248
00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's.</v>

1249
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:28.683
<v Speaker 1>That's the highest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the highest point of sexuality </v>

1250
00:57:31.161 --> 00:57:31.994
<v Speaker 1>and that's why sexuality is used as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>image for the Union of the soul with </v>

1251
00:57:36.351 --> 00:57:37.184
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's used as an image of the Union </v>

1252
00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:42.740
<v Speaker 1>of the church with Christ because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that that the unit,</v>

1253
00:57:42.741 --> 00:57:46.820
<v Speaker 1>that the Union of the masculine and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine is a glimpse of eternity.</v>

1254
00:57:46.821 --> 00:57:47.654
<v Speaker 1>It's a glimpse of.</v>

1255
00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:50.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just an idea.</v>

1256
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:52.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think that that's.</v>

1257
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:53.660
<v Speaker 1>That actually happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1258
00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it actually happened.</v>

1259
00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:56.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1260
00:57:57.330 --> 00:57:57.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1261
00:57:57.691 --> 00:57:58.830
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why also,</v>

1262
00:57:58.831 --> 00:58:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Christianity,</v>

1263
00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:04.800
<v Speaker 1>the idea of taking that lightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very dangerous.</v>

1264
00:58:04.801 --> 00:58:05.634
<v Speaker 1>The idea of uniting yourself with with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of people and is very </v>

1265
00:58:08.611 --> 00:58:11.880
<v Speaker 1>dangerous because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you unite yourself with someone,</v>

1266
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.860
<v Speaker 1>you're actually creating a very powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual unity,</v>

1267
00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:17.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if you kind of wonder that </v>

1268
00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.153
<v Speaker 1>shallow then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1269
00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:23.221
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1270
00:58:23.221 --> 00:58:24.420
<v Speaker 2>you're devaluing it.</v>

1271
00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:25.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also will rip you apart because </v>

1272
00:58:26.411 --> 00:58:30.670
<v Speaker 1>you leave a part of yourself with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>other person and you leave a part of.</v>

1273
00:58:30.671 --> 00:58:33.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like you leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of still attached to someone</v>

1274
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:35.530
<v Speaker 1>and you're leaving a part of your soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was</v>

1275
00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.413
<v Speaker 2>that person and they ripped apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you ended up making it might say it </v>

1276
00:58:40.351 --> 00:58:41.720
<v Speaker 2>makes you cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1277
00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:42.773
<v Speaker 2>Which I would say I think that sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>with 100 women would leave you cynical </v>

1278
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.280
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how it couldn't turn it on.</v>

1279
00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:51.730
<v Speaker 2>See how it went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1280
00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the question.</v>

1281
00:58:54.871 --> 00:58:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Do I think that's a very good way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about that?</v>

1282
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we</v>

1283
00:58:58.830 --> 00:59:01.260
<v Speaker 1>sleeve you in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a position of,</v>

1284
00:59:01.261 --> 00:59:02.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1285
00:59:02.341 --> 00:59:02.941
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1286
00:59:02.941 --> 00:59:06.240
<v Speaker 1>like the person who only eats caviar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1287
00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.093
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't understand how precious </v>

1288
00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:09.310
<v Speaker 1>things are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1289
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:12.180
<v Speaker 1>and to not understand how precious </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are as to devalue them.</v>

1290
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1291
00:59:13.561 --> 00:59:14.394
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1292
00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:17.330
<v Speaker 2>if that's the highest thing that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>devaluing,</v>

1293
00:59:17.331 --> 00:59:21.050
<v Speaker 2>then you end up like Cain with Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kills Abel is highest,</v>

1294
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:23.990
<v Speaker 2>and then he says the punishment is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than he can bear.</v>

1295
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:27.800
<v Speaker 2>So if you take what actually is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest value and devalue it,</v>

1296
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:30.380
<v Speaker 2>that you're left without hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1297
00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:32.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1298
00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:33.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1299
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:35.030
<v Speaker 2>that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>

1300
00:59:35.031 --> 00:59:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1301
00:59:36.501 --> 00:59:38.540
<v Speaker 2>but it's like the people that I've known</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my life who,</v>

1302
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:39.381
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1303
00:59:39.381 --> 00:59:41.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who sleep around a lot,</v>

1304
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:45.560
<v Speaker 2>they tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a kind of nihilistic tendency,</v>

1305
00:59:45.561 --> 00:59:49.350
<v Speaker 2>let's say you have a tendency to not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1306
00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things can be discarded.</v>

1307
00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:52.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1308
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.771
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1309
00:59:52.771 --> 00:59:53.604
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1310
00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.550
<v Speaker 2>and that moment of union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1311
00:59:55.551 --> 00:59:59.420
<v Speaker 2>is also pretty much devalued to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>brief pleasure.</v>

1312
01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:02.540
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualized.</v>

1313
01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:03.983
<v Speaker 2>You know what it is the case too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you look at early promiscuity </v>

1314
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.843
<v Speaker 2>and teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's associated with antisocial </v>

1315
01:00:09.501 --> 01:00:10.334
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

1316
01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:12.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a strong predictor or a strong </v>

1317
01:00:12.831 --> 01:00:15.230
<v Speaker 2>correlate of anti social behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

1318
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:16.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not saying there was a causal </v>

1319
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.153
<v Speaker 2>relationship there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I am saying it's part of the same </v>

1320
01:00:21.111 --> 01:00:23.150
<v Speaker 2>constellation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's quite clear.</v>

1321
01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.140
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1322
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Well that's probably enough of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1323
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1324
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that was good man.</v>

1325
01:00:32.781 --> 01:00:35.390
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about these things when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>woke up this morning,</v>

1326
01:00:35.391 --> 01:00:37.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for about an hour they were just</v>

1327
01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.520
<v Speaker 2>around in my mind like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got that six.</v>

1328
01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:44.660
<v Speaker 2>I did look on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

1329
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I can kind of discern it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1330
01:00:46.881 --> 01:00:48.010
<v Speaker 2>well it's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1331
01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:48.973
<v Speaker 2>it's too much is sort of thing really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like Christ I'd like to get up </v>

1332
01:00:54.741 --> 01:00:58.160
<v Speaker 2>in the morning and think about raking </v>
<v Speaker 2>the backyard or something like that.</v>

1333
01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.180
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well that was really good.</v>

1334
01:01:02.181 --> 01:01:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take things that you think that's good.</v>

1335
01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Like you think that we've got to what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to go farther than we have.</v>

1336
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:13.640
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want like think about it,</v>

1337
01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:14.663
<v Speaker 2>I mean because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a whole bunch of things that we </v>

1338
01:01:16.281 --> 01:01:18.320
<v Speaker 2>said we wanted to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1339
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.453
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe we could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could make it like a whatever every </v>

1340
01:01:22.341 --> 01:01:23.174
<v Speaker 2>two months or every month or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So while I'm sure that all have the way </v>

1341
01:01:26.721 --> 01:01:27.554
<v Speaker 2>my mind is working right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that they'll have some ideas </v>

1342
01:01:30.351 --> 01:01:33.590
<v Speaker 2>that you will be the right person to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to about.</v>

1343
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:34.583
<v Speaker 2>So like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see you're one of these weird </v>

1344
01:01:36.981 --> 01:01:38.390
<v Speaker 2>intersection people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

1345
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:39.463
<v Speaker 2>you're a Greek Orthodox rabbi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a French Canadian icon carver who </v>

1346
01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:46.730
<v Speaker 2>knows a lot about postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1347
01:01:46.731 --> 01:01:49.430
<v Speaker 2>I think there's probably exactly one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you in the world.</v>

1348
01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure I'm pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1349
01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:57.230
<v Speaker 2>that is why like I've always been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>marginal person.</v>

1350
01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:00.400
<v Speaker 2>That's why I understand it so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that the,</v>

1351
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:01.243
<v Speaker 2>the key,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key to my situation right now is </v>

1352
01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:04.850
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of saw it,</v>

1353
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.260
<v Speaker 2>but now I also see how it conserve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>center,</v>

1354
01:02:09.261 --> 01:02:11.840
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's my job in life.</v>

1355
01:02:11.841 --> 01:02:14.440
<v Speaker 2>I think that's pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what I'm supposed to be.</v>

1356
01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:15.453
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good way of ending because the </v>

1357
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:19.910
<v Speaker 2>postmodern claim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the postmodern Neil Marx's claim is that</v>

1358
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.753
<v Speaker 2>the center should serve the margin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the counterclaim is the margin </v>

1359
01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:27.660
<v Speaker 2>should serve the center and both those </v>
<v Speaker 2>claims are right?</v>

1360
01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:28.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's associated with that idea </v>

1361
01:02:30.301 --> 01:02:31.134
<v Speaker 2>that you already described of of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>image of Christ as the perfect man </v>

1362
01:02:34.381 --> 01:02:36.270
<v Speaker 2>saturating the entire hierarchy.</v>

1363
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1364
01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.633
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first will be the last and the </v>

1365
01:02:39.801 --> 01:02:40.634
<v Speaker 1>last will be the first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that in </v>

1366
01:02:41.871 --> 01:02:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely true,</v>

1367
01:02:44.001 --> 01:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>that there that there is even something </v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

1368
01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:47.383
<v Speaker 1>There's even something weird that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens at the end or at the bottom </v>

1369
01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:51.163
<v Speaker 1>where there's a mirror reflection </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the bottom and the top where </v>

1370
01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.840
<v Speaker 1>like the lowest thing would be the fool </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1371
01:02:57.110 --> 01:02:59.600
<v Speaker 1>and the highest thing would be the holy </v>
<v Speaker 1>fool,</v>

1372
01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:04.460
<v Speaker 1>and so there's this strange completion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens in the whole thing,</v>

1373
01:03:04.461 --> 01:03:06.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's really a very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes very mystical at that point.</v>

1374
01:03:06.801 --> 01:03:09.260
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to describe in in straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>

1375
01:03:09.261 --> 01:03:13.160
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marlow was kind of a good example of</v>

1376
01:03:13.161 --> 01:03:16.520
<v Speaker 1>that while I'm asking myself and asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself that for months,</v>

1377
01:03:16.521 --> 01:03:17.354
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that interview with Dr Rachel and </v>

1378
01:03:19.431 --> 01:03:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Brown about Milo and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she really liked.</v>

1379
01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:27.020
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to talk to you anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

1380
01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>that the thing I'm wondering about him </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that in the,</v>

1381
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:30.733
<v Speaker 1>in the holy fool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually there's a lot of self </v>

1382
01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>depreciation and so St Francis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1383
01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:37.370
<v Speaker 1>he would go out into the public space </v>
<v Speaker 1>and strip naked,</v>

1384
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:38.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would,</v>

1385
01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.750
<v Speaker 1>he would pass for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a beggar and all those things.</v>

1386
01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:46.010
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that that might be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement for the holy pool is,</v>

1387
01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:47.490
<v Speaker 1>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1388
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.020
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1389
01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:48.853
<v Speaker 1>the humor is not only against the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>around them but also it turns back on </v>

1390
01:03:52.491 --> 01:03:55.190
<v Speaker 1>themselves constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what makes them,</v>

1391
01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.850
<v Speaker 1>the holy fool is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you can't criticize them because</v>

1392
01:03:58.851 --> 01:04:01.490
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as they're criticizing the ruler</v>

1393
01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.473
<v Speaker 1>or the structure or the order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns back on them and then they act </v>
