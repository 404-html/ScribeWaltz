1
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm here today with in a new place </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying out something new.</v>

2
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to Charlie Kirk and Charlie </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a native of Chicago and he's been </v>

3
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.091
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>building an organization in the US to </v>

4
00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>promote free speech on campuses for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for how long now?</v>

5
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>It's been six years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:36.321
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm gonna let you take it away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell people exactly what you've been up </v>

7
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:36.321
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

8
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:36.321
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

9
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:39.190
<v Speaker 2>started this organization called turning</v>
<v Speaker 2>point USA when I was 18 years old.</v>

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took a very unusual path to it.</v>

11
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I decided to start this movement instead</v>
<v Speaker 2>of going to college.</v>

12
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I saw something brewing in the states </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I felt more instinctual than </v>

13
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 2>anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was a countercultural kind of</v>

14
00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 2>revolution that needed to happen on our </v>
<v Speaker 2>college and high school campuses.</v>

15
00:00:56.591 --> 00:01:01.591
<v Speaker 2>And I saw it through social media and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw it from my local high school </v>

16
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:05.191
<v Speaker 2>community that my generation was being </v>
<v Speaker 2>so inundated with cultural Marxism and </v>

17
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 2>also economic Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even worse,</v>

18
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:12.001
<v Speaker 2>it was a cultural side of it and that my</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation was yearning for a different </v>

19
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 2>perspective and political viewpoint or </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least ideological diversity.</v>

20
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.860
<v Speaker 2>And the capacity to have your viewpoints</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenged.</v>

21
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.030
<v Speaker 2>So it started as kind of a whim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

22
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.830
<v Speaker 2>has ended up to be a quite large success</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started this organization,</v>

23
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what I was doing.</v>

24
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.430
<v Speaker 2>I had no political connections and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

25
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

26
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.630
<v Speaker 2>that was a good start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

28
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you started thinking about this when you</v>

29
00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 2>were in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

30
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened in high school and how </v>

31
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.930
<v Speaker 2>did you come to these conclusions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what motivated you?</v>

32
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Always loved history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economics,</v>

33
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.170
<v Speaker 2>and of the more conservative persuasion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My lifelong ambition.</v>

34
00:01:47.171 --> 00:01:49.810
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to go to the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>Military Academy at West Point,</v>

35
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.360
<v Speaker 2>which is a very difficult school to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into in the states.</v>

36
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:58.361
<v Speaker 2>So I got my congressional nomination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the first of a two step </v>

37
00:01:58.361 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I ended up being waitlisted and</v>

38
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.140
<v Speaker 2>denied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

39
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.440
<v Speaker 2>my senior year of high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which totally shattered me,</v>

40
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.810
<v Speaker 2>but ended up being the best thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever happened to me,</v>

41
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it really made me reflect on who</v>

42
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:13.471
<v Speaker 2>I was and what I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I realized is my motivation to </v>

43
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:16.891
<v Speaker 2>go to the military academy was that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a patriot and I love my country and </v>

44
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:20.341
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to serve in some capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I felt like the west was under </v>

45
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:20.740
<v Speaker 2>attack and I still feel that to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

46
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so why do you think you develop</v>

47
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.690
<v Speaker 1>the sense of patriotism and in say </v>
<v Speaker 1>junior high and high school when,</v>

48
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>when that is increasingly lacking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say not only locking,</v>

49
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 1>but seriously criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What made you different?</v>

50
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely love my country based on my</v>

51
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 2>upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my,</v>

52
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.050
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

53
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.050
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents are generally center,</v>

54
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 2>right people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're always taught,</v>

55
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patriotic values from a young age.</v>

56
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Read the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

57
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:48.060
<v Speaker 2>around the dinner table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

58
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 2>But I'm disagreeable by nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when my parents,</v>

59
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 2>when my teachers would go out of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to make anti American or anti </v>

60
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.201
<v Speaker 2>patriotic statements and only made me </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaffirm my own beliefs and dig in </v>

61
00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 2>deeper and want to challenge that even </v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

62
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 2>which I then sought out the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinkers of the American founding,</v>

63
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.950
<v Speaker 2>the federalist papers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the US Constitution,</v>

64
00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:11.951
<v Speaker 2>and down that rabbit hole I went to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great thinkers that created Western </v>

65
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 2>civilization both intentionally and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unintentionally,</v>

66
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.680
<v Speaker 2>whether it be aristotle and all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great enlightened,</v>

67
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years of writings that the </v>

68
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 2>founding fathers drew inspiration from.</v>

69
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 2>And did you do that on your own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

70
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:27.061
<v Speaker 2>It was autodidactic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was self taught in middle school </v>

71
00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:27.061
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

72
00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:31.921
<v Speaker 2>it was driven by this inspiration of I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want it to be able to effectively </v>

73
00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 2>articulate my beliefs and values and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas to a core of teachers that felt as</v>

74
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 2>if they had to indoctrinate me to hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

75
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 2>hate free enterprise and hate free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

76
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 2>So I grew up in a rather generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal area.</v>

77
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>The northwest suburbs of Chicago and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher community for the most part,</v>

78
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>they were not trying to allow a free </v>
<v Speaker 2>flow of ideas.</v>

79
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to impose a specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctrine upon their students and being a</v>

80
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.940
<v Speaker 2>disagreeable contrarian by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would always debate them and I would </v>

81
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 2>find satisfaction and proving them wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

82
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 2>as wrong or right is that might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just who I was.</v>

83
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 2>So we always have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then by doing so I sought out these </v>

84
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sat out these ideas and I found Milton</v>

85
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Friedman and I found individuals that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that articulated what I knew to be true </v>

86
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 2>and I only went down that path even </v>
<v Speaker 2>further.</v>

87
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 2>So what did that do for your social </v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

88
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Just out of curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how were your,</v>

89
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 2>how were your peers reacting to this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

90
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.660
<v Speaker 2>so it's quite interesting you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned that throughout high </v>

91
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.001
<v Speaker 2>school I was heavily involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>football and basketball and it </v>

92
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 2>generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well liked individual,</v>

93
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever since my graduation of high school </v>

94
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 2>in my entrance into political and social</v>
<v Speaker 2>activism,</v>

95
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.310
<v Speaker 2>the hostility towards my from my high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school community towards me has been </v>

96
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 2>extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not trying to play a victim.</v>

97
00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really.</v>

98
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.720
<v Speaker 2>Those people were never my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just pretended to be them to be,</v>

99
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 2>to be as such.</v>

100
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.690
<v Speaker 2>But it's amazing to me that you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a different viewpoint on how the </v>

101
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.690
<v Speaker 2>world should work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That people on the left will immediately</v>

102
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 2>ostracize you and categorize you </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

103
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 2>And I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:04.141
<v Speaker 2>I'm a conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at people that are on the </v>

105
00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:06.691
<v Speaker 2>left any differently than I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at who they are as a character </v>

106
00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:07.690
<v Speaker 2>and as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the politics are just layered on top</v>

107
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left is completely different,</v>

108
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.950
<v Speaker 2>is if you disagree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's who you become.</v>

109
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancerous and divisive aspects of modern</v>

110
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:20.190
<v Speaker 2>political culture today is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

111
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 2>especially my generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you dare not be a leftist or dare not</v>

112
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 2>be a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're somehow less human or you're</v>

113
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:32.401
<v Speaker 2>somehow less acceptable to them or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're immediately intolerant or racist </v>

114
00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 2>or bigoted or homophobic.</v>

115
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Which of course is untrue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's almost as if they view you as a</v>

116
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:42.871
<v Speaker 2>subspecies of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm experiencing every day and </v>

117
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:43.090
<v Speaker 2>some of the categorizations thrown </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards you.</v>

118
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:46.470
<v Speaker 2>It seems that in popular culture that </v>
<v Speaker 2>remains consistent.</v>

119
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.850
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

120
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell me about your organization.</v>

121
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Tell me its scope now and in what should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be doing and then we can talk about how </v>

122
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 2>you built it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

123
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>So we're on 1300 college in high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>campuses across the states.</v>

124
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.370
<v Speaker 2>We have 115 people on full time staff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and last year we raised 10 and a half </v>

125
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 2>million dollars a with 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>active donors and some big ones,</v>

126
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 2>some small ones with some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>largest,</v>

127
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 2>most successful American business people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had been investing in us.</v>

128
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 2>And I just started it from nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just I traveled 340 days a year,</v>

129
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and meeting with investors and business </v>

130
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 2>people and entrepreneurs that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>worried that America is in grave decline</v>

131
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.150
<v Speaker 2>and I'm able to present them with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy and a plan and a vision that </v>

132
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 2>can help turn that around.</v>

133
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.820
<v Speaker 2>No Pun intended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a organization's called turning point </v>

134
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.161
<v Speaker 2>USA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we host the nations largest </v>

135
00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:36.161
<v Speaker 2>annual gathering of young conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 2>will have 5,000</v>

136
00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:41.081
<v Speaker 2>students there this upcoming December,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of which you're the most requested </v>

137
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 2>speaker off the charts I might add.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

138
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 2>and the scope of the organization is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatic and immense.</v>

139
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Will we have a young women's leadership </v>
<v Speaker 2>summit in June.</v>

140
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 2>We'll have 1200 young ladies from across</v>
<v Speaker 2>from all 50 states attend,</v>

141
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 2>that's in June in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>

142
00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we will host over 100 events a </v>

143
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.951
<v Speaker 2>year off campus with over 250 student </v>
<v Speaker 2>activists and leaders that we train </v>

144
00:07:02.951 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 2>towards what I like to call more </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle based activism things that,</v>

145
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>created the West free speech dialogue,</v>

146
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.690
<v Speaker 2>a free enterprise private property </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>

147
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 2>natural rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really diving into the deep ideas,</v>

148
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:19.571
<v Speaker 2>not this sort of social justice left </v>
<v Speaker 2>this activism that is taught from our </v>

149
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:19.571
<v Speaker 2>lecture halls.</v>

150
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the scope of the organization has </v>

151
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.790
<v Speaker 2>really grown dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're on a $15,000,000</v>

152
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:25.270
<v Speaker 2>budget this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

153
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.310
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been quite an experience and a </v>

154
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 2>blessing to say the least right place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right time with a great group of people.</v>

155
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 2>And how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many campuses now a 1300 college and</v>

156
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 2>high school campuses represented </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the states.</v>

157
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 2>And so what's happening at the high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school level,</v>

158
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 2>chapter development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite interesting.</v>

159
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.760
<v Speaker 2>We have seen an explosion of high school</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest and chapter development over </v>

160
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.391
<v Speaker 2>the last couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because the activism that is </v>

161
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:53.441
<v Speaker 2>so prevalent in our colleges has now </v>
<v Speaker 2>stepped down into our high schools and </v>

162
00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 2>so students that are finding my videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>are finding Dave and or Ben Shapiro,</v>

163
00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Prager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your content there are now 14,</v>

164
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 2>15 and 16 and they seek out that content</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have to,</v>

165
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:08.741
<v Speaker 2>if they want to be able to defend their </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs because it used to be that </v>

166
00:08:08.741 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 2>college used to be the only place that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas were really.</v>

167
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the only place I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

168
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

169
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 2>the main focus of the left was colleges </v>
<v Speaker 2>no more.</v>

170
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean they are teaching the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning stages of postmodernism as</v>

171
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:24.580
<v Speaker 2>early as freshman year in high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there is no such thing.</v>

172
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

173
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Stereo is early as grade one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

174
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

175
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.800
<v Speaker 1>So in Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elementary teachers association,</v>

176
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:36.070
<v Speaker 1>that's not quite the right name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

177
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 1>so Ontario Teachers' federation and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't remember at the moment,</v>

178
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:45.011
<v Speaker 1>but they've put in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put together a social justice </v>

179
00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:45.290
<v Speaker 1>curriculum from grade one to grade </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

180
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:49.730
<v Speaker 1>which even bends the study of literature</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in a social justice direction.</v>

181
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:54.731
<v Speaker 1>So there so shameless that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to bend art to the purposes </v>

182
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>political propaganda.</v>

183
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.560
<v Speaker 2>It's stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

184
00:08:57.561 --> 00:09:02.561
<v Speaker 2>It's quite remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you expect from the high </v>

185
00:09:02.561 --> 00:09:02.561
<v Speaker 2>school chapters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

186
00:09:02.561 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 2>what is it that they're doing that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is good and useful?</v>

187
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.830
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different strategy and it's </v>

188
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 2>different implementation that are staff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Staff goes about when they deal with </v>

189
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.871
<v Speaker 2>high school students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number one thing with high school </v>

190
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:17.421
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the high school chapters that we deal </v>

191
00:09:17.421 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 2>with is trying to make it culturally </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable to believe these conservative</v>

192
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:20.610
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if they meet weekly and bring in</v>

193
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:23.050
<v Speaker 2>a guest speaker of a local,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

194
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.160
<v Speaker 2>political nature or they watch video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much more of a comradery building </v>

195
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.181
<v Speaker 2>activity in high school than in college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say that because in the mindset of</v>

196
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 2>being in high school is quite different </v>
<v Speaker 2>in college,</v>

197
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're entering into kind of that rugged</v>

198
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:40.290
<v Speaker 2>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to rebel or conform to my parents</v>

199
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:45.291
<v Speaker 2>ideology in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still are still very much anchored </v>

200
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:49.100
<v Speaker 2>to your local and cultural institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your high school football team or </v>

201
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.620
<v Speaker 2>basketball team.</v>

202
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've here.</v>

203
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas College,</v>

204
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 2>by the time the dynamic of the geography</v>
<v Speaker 2>of college you break,</v>

205
00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 2>you try to break out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

206
00:09:59.281 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

207
00:09:59.941 --> 00:10:04.941
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we try to hold them the high school </v>

208
00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 2>chapters to a specific standard of at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least meeting weekly,</v>

209
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 2>trying to go to some of our big national</v>
<v Speaker 2>events,</v>

210
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.310
<v Speaker 2>hosting guest speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>debates and lectures.</v>

211
00:10:10.311 --> 00:10:14.250
<v Speaker 2>So a great example is in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was that horrific shooting down in</v>

212
00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:19.251
<v Speaker 2>Parkland high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go down and I'm actually </v>

213
00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:19.500
<v Speaker 2>going down to MSD,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

214
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

215
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:25.041
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the school where the shooting took </v>

216
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:25.041
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give a speech on the second</v>

217
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:25.041
<v Speaker 2>amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural rights.</v>

218
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:29.240
<v Speaker 2>They're not allowing me on campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm doing it right across the </v>

219
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:29.240
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the groups,</v>

220
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 2>we have a Tuesday coming up this </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday.</v>

221
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 2>They say it's highly controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't consider it to be.</v>

222
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second amendment is,</v>

223
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.120
<v Speaker 2>some would say a controversial thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that aren't in the states by the </v>

224
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.150
<v Speaker 2>first amendment is controverted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly,</v>

225
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.480
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was going to say is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of natural rights doesn't,</v>

226
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.940
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't offend anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately it does.</v>

227
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:52.941
<v Speaker 2>So that's one example of an event that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have on a high school kind of arena that</v>

228
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing coming on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

229
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.430
<v Speaker 2>And then at the university level you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

230
00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 2>you said 1,513,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so 1300 is the number of high school and</v>

231
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:03.420
<v Speaker 2>college combined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's divided about 900 college,</v>

232
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:08.510
<v Speaker 2>400 high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any estimate for total </v>

233
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:08.510
<v Speaker 2>membership?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to say.</v>

234
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:13.311
<v Speaker 2>So to give you an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had 3000 students attend our annual </v>

235
00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 2>meeting last year and we had over 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>applications.</v>

236
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so membership as well beyond that.</v>

237
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely the tens of </v>

238
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.110
<v Speaker 2>thousands are total data list is in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands.</v>

239
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.340
<v Speaker 2>We have over million facebook followers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either half a million followers on </v>

240
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.390
<v Speaker 2>twitter memberships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A very difficult thing to pinpoint.</v>

241
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.160
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to define.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

242
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:37.161
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to be like the arp where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have 7 million people on your </v>

243
00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:37.161
<v Speaker 2>mailing list and you pretend they're all</v>
<v Speaker 2>members,</v>

244
00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:41.900
<v Speaker 2>but I were very much more into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality of leadership than the quantity </v>

245
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:41.900
<v Speaker 2>of leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the one thing.</v>

246
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.940
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have 100 dedicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>principled,</v>

247
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:50.220
<v Speaker 2>a movement driven student leaders than a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand that are just kind of </v>

248
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:55.010
<v Speaker 2>lackluster and are there for the free </v>
<v Speaker 2>pizza or pop [inaudible] and what are </v>

249
00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 2>you hoping for from the university </v>
<v Speaker 2>chapters,</v>

250
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 2>so that's much more disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to challenge the status quo,</v>

251
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:05.671
<v Speaker 2>head on and do everything we possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>can to try to change the trajectory of </v>

252
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:09.940
<v Speaker 2>our organ of our generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so our organization offers that in a</v>

253
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.520
<v Speaker 2>lot of different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be offering guest speakers on</v>

254
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 2>campus such as myself.</v>

255
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:18.630
<v Speaker 2>So this last week I spoke at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of California Berkeley and </v>

256
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:18.630
<v Speaker 2>University of California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles,</v>

257
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.250
<v Speaker 2>a UC Berkeley and Ucla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One day after the other,</v>

258
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:24.130
<v Speaker 2>we had a packed house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a every seat filled.</v>

259
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:26.320
<v Speaker 2>We had a lot of protestors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of opposition,</v>

260
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.840
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of people watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>the live stream.</v>

261
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 2>That live stream will hit a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on.</v>

262
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of going a retroactive views </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening right now throughout this next</v>

263
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.400
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you said you were there with Ruben </v>

264
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.140
<v Speaker 2>and that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there with Dave Rubin and Candice </v>

265
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Owens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Candice Owens works for us.</v>

266
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:43.780
<v Speaker 2>She's our communications director.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

267
00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

268
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:45.910
<v Speaker 2>so candice is a superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

269
00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 2>she just got a nice shout out from Kanye</v>
<v Speaker 2>West saying,</v>

270
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:52.980
<v Speaker 2>I love the way candace owens thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which honestly is a.</v>

271
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.340
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to even put into words the </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of a rap.</v>

272
00:12:57.341 --> 00:13:02.341
<v Speaker 2>Artists like him singling out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative minded pundant like </v>

273
00:13:02.341 --> 00:13:07.051
<v Speaker 2>candice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a seismic shift </v>

274
00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:08.941
<v Speaker 2>happening in American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the black community that is going to be </v>

275
00:13:08.941 --> 00:13:10.370
<v Speaker 2>a generational ideological civil war in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the words of Canada.</v>

276
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.880
<v Speaker 2>So and so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went to UC Berkeley and Ucla,</v>

277
00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:17.881
<v Speaker 2>and what's interesting about Candice </v>
<v Speaker 2>Owens is she uses identity politics </v>

278
00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:21.331
<v Speaker 2>against the left and so truth is truth </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be colorblind and any individuals</v>

279
00:13:22.681 --> 00:13:25.050
<v Speaker 2>should be able to say what they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say despite their skin color,</v>

280
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.580
<v Speaker 2>their gender unfortunately is not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case on a college campus.</v>

281
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 2>So I'll say something that might trigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience,</v>

282
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:34.951
<v Speaker 2>but candace will say that and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly okay with that and that </v>

283
00:13:34.951 --> 00:13:38.311
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that just shows how it must be </v>

284
00:13:38.311 --> 00:13:41.911
<v Speaker 2>harder for her on the contrary side to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be conservative and block without a </v>

285
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:43.540
<v Speaker 2>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

286
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the societal punishment she receives for</v>

287
00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:48.670
<v Speaker 2>that is horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

288
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.440
<v Speaker 2>what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the things that they see?</v>

289
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.960
<v Speaker 2>The words they call her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even repeat on camera,</v>

290
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nice ones are uncle Tom Coon,</v>

291
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:57.400
<v Speaker 2>things of that nature.</v>

292
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has a very,</v>

293
00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.460
<v Speaker 2>just the harsh backlash for what she </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes in,</v>

294
00:14:03.461 --> 00:14:08.461
<v Speaker 2>what she feels because how dare she </v>
<v Speaker 2>stray away from the ideological monopoly</v>

295
00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:11.200
<v Speaker 2>that the left has on the black </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

296
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:12.550
<v Speaker 2>And for those that people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

297
00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 2>that might be watching internationally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Democrat Party receives 90,</v>

298
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:19.030
<v Speaker 2>sixth and 97 percent of all black voters</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America,</v>

299
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.670
<v Speaker 2>despite the Democrat policies having </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

300
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:26.500
<v Speaker 2>the worst impact on the black community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so candice is trying to wake up that</v>

301
00:14:26.501 --> 00:14:31.501
<v Speaker 2>community and so we're happy to have her</v>
<v Speaker 2>as our communications director and help </v>

302
00:14:31.501 --> 00:14:31.501
<v Speaker 2>enhance her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

303
00:14:31.501 --> 00:14:35.611
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her vision to try to a least get people </v>

304
00:14:35.611 --> 00:14:35.611
<v Speaker 2>to think differently.</v>

305
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to Warren Farrell </v>
<v Speaker 1>later today.</v>

306
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:41.020
<v Speaker 1>And he just wrote a book called the boy </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

307
00:14:41.021 --> 00:14:46.021
<v Speaker 1>And in there he talks a fair bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pernicious effects of </v>

308
00:14:46.021 --> 00:14:49.351
<v Speaker 1>fatherlessness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that I'm very </v>

309
00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:49.351
<v Speaker 1>interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

310
00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:49.351
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Ontario,</v>

311
00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:54.271
<v Speaker 1>we have as part of standard political </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy that all families are equal,</v>

312
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea there is that respect </v>

313
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 1>should be given to familial units </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of their structure.</v>

314
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:08.410
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to be said for that </v>

315
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:08.410
<v Speaker 1>because people have to struggle through </v>
<v Speaker 1>life the best they can,</v>

316
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.690
<v Speaker 1>whether they're single parents are or </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of how they put their family </v>

317
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.921
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the empirical data on the </v>

318
00:15:17.921 --> 00:15:20.440
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe of fatherlessness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily solid in deep and it </v>

319
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.701
<v Speaker 1>seems to be something in principle </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a particular place for the black </v>

320
00:15:24.701 --> 00:15:25.610
<v Speaker 1>community that's currently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm wondering too,</v>

321
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.190
<v Speaker 1>like with the conservative approach to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

322
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.270
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you guys focused on the problems of</v>

323
00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:34.110
<v Speaker 1>fatherlessness and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

324
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.420
<v Speaker 1>what's your take on that?</v>

325
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and without a,</v>

326
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.580
<v Speaker 2>without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had to pinpoint one,</v>

327
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>societal trend that has harmed the black</v>

328
00:15:42.671 --> 00:15:45.270
<v Speaker 2>community most who'd be the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 2>single motherhood in the US.</v>

329
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:50.510
<v Speaker 2>So to give a number just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to so people understand the single </v>

330
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.751
<v Speaker 2>motherhood rate in the 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 18 percent in the black community </v>

331
00:15:54.751 --> 00:15:58.140
<v Speaker 2>now 77 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>77 percent of us blacks will grow up </v>

332
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.000
<v Speaker 2>never knowing their father if there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

333
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.030
<v Speaker 2>there's no rational argument that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is healthy for a society.</v>

334
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:09.300
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an article in the Atlantic </v>

335
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:09.490
<v Speaker 2>monthly just two weeks ago showing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

336
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.230
<v Speaker 2>which is more notable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

337
00:16:11.231 --> 00:16:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Because it's not like the Atlantic is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>right leaning magazine anything,</v>

338
00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:15.450
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

339
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.500
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

340
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.090
<v Speaker 2>they can be</v>

341
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:22.170
<v Speaker 1>and handed when they're at their best </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they reviewed the new evidence that </v>

342
00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:27.601
<v Speaker 1>was presented in this research paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I also read showing that if you </v>

343
00:16:27.601 --> 00:16:32.401
<v Speaker 1>look at those few locales where poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>black people and poor white people do </v>

344
00:16:32.501 --> 00:16:37.501
<v Speaker 1>approximately as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you track them over as a reasonable </v>

345
00:16:37.501 --> 00:16:37.920
<v Speaker 1>amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

346
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:43.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that characterizes the high </v>

347
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.980
<v Speaker 1>functioning poor poorer places is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of fathers.</v>

348
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.120
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

349
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 2>exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said that not only the researchers </v>

350
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.170
<v Speaker 2>claim that not only was that good in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate family,</v>

351
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:58.310
<v Speaker 2>so they have your father around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in neighborhoods where having </v>

352
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:02.301
<v Speaker 2>fathers around is the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every boy in particular does better in </v>

353
00:17:02.301 --> 00:17:04.170
<v Speaker 2>the neighborhood since right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every single crime goes down,</v>

354
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:09.240
<v Speaker 2>the likelihood of not going to prison </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously goes down.</v>

355
00:17:09.241 --> 00:17:11.370
<v Speaker 2>But the interesting questions we have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask why?</v>

356
00:17:11.371 --> 00:17:13.410
<v Speaker 2>So we as conservatives always try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask,</v>

357
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.590
<v Speaker 2>what is the reason this is happening at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the left,</v>

358
00:17:16.591 --> 00:17:19.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't always think they go through </v>
<v Speaker 2>that or they ignore it willingly.</v>

359
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.550
<v Speaker 2>The reason is because the great society </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was passed by Lyndon Baines Johnson</v>

360
00:17:23.551 --> 00:17:28.551
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 sixties where the US </v>
<v Speaker 2>government literally subsidized single </v>

361
00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:33.411
<v Speaker 2>motherhood where if you got married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lost your government check and it </v>

362
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:37.671
<v Speaker 2>still exists to this day in the states </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the idea and the intention was,</v>

363
00:17:37.861 --> 00:17:39.510
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's try to help single mothers.</v>

364
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

365
00:17:40.951 --> 00:17:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't want to help single mothers.</v>

366
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.970
<v Speaker 2>The problem is as soon as you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>married,</v>

367
00:17:44.971 --> 00:17:49.971
<v Speaker 2>you lose that checked because it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>program designed for single motherhood </v>

368
00:17:49.971 --> 00:17:51.210
<v Speaker 2>and so you incentivize bad behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get more of it,</v>

369
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.700
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly what you've seen in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the states.</v>

370
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:58.701
<v Speaker 2>You couple that with a disastrous public</v>
<v Speaker 2>education system run by public sector </v>

371
00:17:58.701 --> 00:18:01.290
<v Speaker 2>teacher unions that have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>accountability protected by tenure,</v>

372
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.500
<v Speaker 2>and I'm really embrace mediocrity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's highest form with I'm failing urban</v>

373
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:12.831
<v Speaker 2>cities with Democrat mayors that have no</v>
<v Speaker 2>grasp of free enterprise or how to </v>

374
00:18:12.831 --> 00:18:16.701
<v Speaker 2>properly run any sort of organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone a massive municipality or </v>

375
00:18:16.701 --> 00:18:20.900
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you have the black community </v>

376
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:20.900
<v Speaker 2>failing so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The final point I'll say is this,</v>

377
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.580
<v Speaker 2>in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two poorest communities by race,</v>

378
00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:24.530
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

379
00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.300
<v Speaker 2>are the two communities that receive the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most government assistance per capita,</v>

380
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:29.820
<v Speaker 2>the native American community and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>African American community.</v>

381
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:35.120
<v Speaker 2>And so we can draw a direct correlation </v>
<v Speaker 2>in distinction between the rise of the </v>

382
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.730
<v Speaker 2>welfare state in America and actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>the decline of the black community,</v>

383
00:18:38.731 --> 00:18:43.731
<v Speaker 2>native American community and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the solution to that is black </v>

384
00:18:43.731 --> 00:18:46.911
<v Speaker 2>fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we always say black fathers </v>

385
00:18:46.911 --> 00:18:46.911
<v Speaker 2>matter whether it seems</v>

386
00:18:46.911 --> 00:18:49.650
<v Speaker 1>to be an employment issue too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that's a complicated problem </v>

387
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:53.411
<v Speaker 1>because you know that the employment </v>
<v Speaker 1>market for people who are less skilled </v>

388
00:18:53.411 --> 00:18:53.750
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been,</v>

389
00:18:53.751 --> 00:18:54.710
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in decline,</v>

390
00:18:54.711 --> 00:18:56.670
<v Speaker 1>especially on the male end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

391
00:18:56.671 --> 00:19:01.671
<v Speaker 1>And one of the stats that feral sites is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that three quarters of women will not </v>

392
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.560
<v Speaker 1>consider seriously dating and unemployed</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

393
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Whereas one third of men would have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem dating an unemployed woman.</v>

394
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.300
<v Speaker 1>So there's obviously a gender bias </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

395
00:19:14.301 --> 00:19:19.301
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's grounded and it's </v>

396
00:19:19.301 --> 00:19:21.560
<v Speaker 1>grounded in both rationality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biology.</v>

397
00:19:21.561 --> 00:19:26.561
<v Speaker 1>The evolutionary biology element is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>women across cultures tend to mate </v>

398
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.480
<v Speaker 1>across and up hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

399
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.660
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that I think is that </v>

400
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.690
<v Speaker 1>there are logically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the logic comes in as </v>

401
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.561
<v Speaker 1>well as the biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for a partner that can </v>

402
00:19:41.561 --> 00:19:44.620
<v Speaker 1>be of substantial economic utility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical utility when they put </v>

403
00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.460
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the vulnerable position of</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a child.</v>

404
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:51.910
<v Speaker 1>So then you also have this additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is if the employment situation </v>

405
00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:56.530
<v Speaker 1>tanks in any serious way than men become</v>
<v Speaker 1>less desirable as partners and your </v>

406
00:19:56.721 --> 00:20:01.721
<v Speaker 1>claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess in part is that by filling that </v>

407
00:20:01.721 --> 00:20:03.941
<v Speaker 1>void,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government actually contributes to </v>

408
00:20:03.941 --> 00:20:04.010
<v Speaker 1>the problem rather than than addressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

409
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.070
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tied in I suppose too,</v>

410
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.930
<v Speaker 1>with the high rates of incarceration for</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people in the united</v>

411
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.990
<v Speaker 2>given negative feedback loop where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get more of that bad behavior.</v>

412
00:20:11.991 --> 00:20:15.440
<v Speaker 2>So the black fathers go to prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're not there to raise the kids.</v>

413
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:19.450
<v Speaker 2>The kids go to gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they'll end up either dead in prison,</v>

414
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:24.490
<v Speaker 2>hopeless or completely directionless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The black single mothers who want to </v>

415
00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.980
<v Speaker 2>continue to do what's right for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

416
00:20:27.981 --> 00:20:29.870
<v Speaker 2>they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're left with very few choices,</v>

417
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.840
<v Speaker 2>have more kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a negative feedback loop,</v>

418
00:20:32.841 --> 00:20:34.610
<v Speaker 2>so you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have bad behavior,</v>

419
00:20:34.611 --> 00:20:37.190
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing bad behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidized by the government.</v>

420
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Then you have the complete destruction </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what used to be a somewhat civilized </v>

421
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 2>portion of American life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which if you look at the worst areas in </v>

422
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the inner cities,</v>

423
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 2>predominantly with the African American </v>
<v Speaker 2>community and so that the final,</v>

424
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.600
<v Speaker 2>the interesting point is how on earth is</v>
<v Speaker 2>it that black people today,</v>

425
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:58.600
<v Speaker 2>their grandfathers lived a better life </v>
<v Speaker 2>than their fathers was?</v>

426
00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:02.290
<v Speaker 2>America is America is more racist today </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it was in the 19 sixties.</v>

427
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:07.291
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>America's become significantly less </v>

428
00:21:07.291 --> 00:21:10.531
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look to the American left or </v>

429
00:21:10.531 --> 00:21:11.320
<v Speaker 2>the social justice warriors of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>academic and the Neo Marxist,</v>

430
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:16.590
<v Speaker 2>they pinpoint racism as the significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving force to why black people are </v>

431
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.230
<v Speaker 2>doing poorly in America.</v>

432
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

433
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:23.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem too that I've talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about with regards to gender inequality </v>

434
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.400
<v Speaker 1>in pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you've been wonderful.</v>

435
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

436
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:31.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of different reasons for </v>

437
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.780
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you analyze differences in important </v>

438
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.020
<v Speaker 1>attributes by group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever your group measure is,</v>

439
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.140
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dozen contributors,</v>

440
00:21:39.141 --> 00:21:44.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to pick a multivariate analysis to </v>

441
00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:44.141
<v Speaker 1>use your quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

442
00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:44.141
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is,</v>

443
00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:48.341
<v Speaker 1>is that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can attribute a certain amount of </v>

444
00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:49.250
<v Speaker 1>the difference in success between groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

445
00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:55.150
<v Speaker 1>let's call it racial attitudes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnocentrism on the part of the </v>

446
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.090
<v Speaker 1>dominant group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated because in the U,</v>

447
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:02.190
<v Speaker 1>s Asians do rebel spectacularly well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews do well.</v>

448
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Nigerians do pretty damn well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black immigrants do quite well.</v>

449
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.690
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

450
00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.590
<v Speaker 1>so it's much more complex than a simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>racial analysis would indicate.</v>

451
00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:17.860
<v Speaker 1>And the problem I guess in part with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>group fostered analysis is that people </v>

452
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.841
<v Speaker 1>make the claim that a single factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice essentially is the cause of </v>

453
00:22:23.751 --> 00:22:24.830
<v Speaker 1>all the problems.</v>

454
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:29.830
<v Speaker 1>And then that has the additionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>pernicious effect of blanketing everyone</v>

455
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:34.870
<v Speaker 1>who isn't in the oppressed group that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being spoken for at the moment as </v>

456
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.500
<v Speaker 1>oppressors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

457
00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.930
<v Speaker 1>and this is an even more pernicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>element,</v>

458
00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:44.020
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that this is part of </v>

459
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:44.020
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental motivation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological left,</v>

460
00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.500
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a war on the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence itself,</v>

461
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you take someone who's worked</v>

462
00:22:51.171 --> 00:22:56.171
<v Speaker 1>hard and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being productive and being useful </v>

463
00:22:56.171 --> 00:22:57.770
<v Speaker 1>and admirable in all the ways that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might hope someone was,</v>

464
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.640
<v Speaker 1>and then you tell them that the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that they've been successful is </v>

465
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.280
<v Speaker 1>because of their skin color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

466
00:23:04.281 --> 00:23:09.281
<v Speaker 1>and this systemic racism next </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized as the society than what </v>

467
00:23:09.281 --> 00:23:12.821
<v Speaker 1>you do is undermine the entire idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>competence itself might be the basis of </v>

468
00:23:12.821 --> 00:23:16.250
<v Speaker 1>a hierarchy and that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really think that,</v>

469
00:23:16.251 --> 00:23:21.251
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that desire to undermine the idea that </v>

470
00:23:21.251 --> 00:23:24.281
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies can be based on competence </v>
<v Speaker 1>is associated with the deep Marxism </v>

471
00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:27.410
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with the radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can't think of an idea that's more</v>

472
00:23:27.411 --> 00:23:28.300
<v Speaker 1>pernicious than that.</v>

473
00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.650
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have to tell you,</v>

474
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing this for a long time,</v>

475
00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:35.350
<v Speaker 2>but I've been doing it for at least an </v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent,</v>

476
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:40.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years of college activism and </v>

477
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.841
<v Speaker 2>organizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your video on postmodernism and neo </v>

478
00:23:42.841 --> 00:23:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember exactly where I was.</v>

479
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.800
<v Speaker 2>I was driving to the University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michigan just a couple months ago and I,</v>

480
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I literally my car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said I finally get it.</v>

481
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 2>I finally understand what is motivating </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

482
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.360
<v Speaker 2>the philosophy behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was an hour and a half video </v>

483
00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.060
<v Speaker 2>where you really dissected postmodernism</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's exactly,</v>

484
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.760
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly what you just said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

485
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:05.960
<v Speaker 2>they want the death of the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the death of logos,</v>

486
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.560
<v Speaker 2>that any sort of success can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>attributed to some sort of red</v>

487
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.380
<v Speaker 1>prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

488
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.790
<v Speaker 1>The equation of success with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally purchased.</v>

489
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't explain to you how significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>

490
00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:21.190
<v Speaker 1>I also think that's tied in with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might describe as the,</v>

491
00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the decline of boys,</v>

492
00:24:23.441 --> 00:24:26.140
<v Speaker 1>assuming that that sort of thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is reasonable.</v>

493
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you tell boys that the pay,</v>

494
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.320
<v Speaker 1>first of all that society is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy,</v>

495
00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.190
<v Speaker 1>which it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you tell them that and then you say,</v>

496
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:41.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only is it a patriarchy to corrupt </v>

497
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:41.220
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a corrupt,</v>

498
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:41.220
<v Speaker 1>destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

499
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.700
<v Speaker 1>prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy,</v>

500
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.980
<v Speaker 1>and that anyone who succeeds and it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore a corrupt prejudice and racist</v>

501
00:24:47.981 --> 00:24:50.590
<v Speaker 1>because that's how you would succeed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hierarchy like that.</v>

502
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Then what you do is you associate in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds of people who might participate in</v>

503
00:24:55.901 --> 00:25:00.901
<v Speaker 1>the project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that any success whatsoever is </v>

504
00:25:00.901 --> 00:25:03.661
<v Speaker 1>actually a moral flaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen that happen to lots of </v>

505
00:25:03.661 --> 00:25:06.691
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a friend in particular who bought </v>

506
00:25:06.691 --> 00:25:06.691
<v Speaker 1>that line and he had other problems as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

507
00:25:06.691 --> 00:25:10.720
<v Speaker 1>but he really believed that active </v>
<v Speaker 1>engagement with the world,</v>

508
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:15.990
<v Speaker 1>any pursuit of success on his part for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and for his family and for his </v>

509
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:20.341
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's say for him to begin with was </v>

510
00:25:20.341 --> 00:25:20.341
<v Speaker 1>merely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

511
00:25:20.341 --> 00:25:24.840
<v Speaker 1>was merely engagement in the process by </v>
<v Speaker 1>which the entire world is being </v>

512
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.750
<v Speaker 1>destroyed and brought to its knees.</v>

513
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.890
<v Speaker 1>He really believed that and it really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many things destroyed him.</v>

514
00:25:29.891 --> 00:25:32.470
<v Speaker 1>But that was certainly one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that destroyed him.</v>

515
00:25:32.471 --> 00:25:35.650
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no differentiation in history is</v>

516
00:25:35.651 --> 00:25:38.140
<v Speaker 1>obviously a bloody nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no way around that,</v>

517
00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:43.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's necessary to differentiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>between activity that is good and </v>

518
00:25:45.911 --> 00:25:50.911
<v Speaker 1>activity that is evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to state that all activity that </v>

519
00:25:50.911 --> 00:25:55.861
<v Speaker 1>supports the patriarch in God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't stand it that we even have to </v>

520
00:25:55.861 --> 00:25:55.861
<v Speaker 1>use that language,</v>

521
00:25:55.861 --> 00:26:00.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is more widespread and universities </v>

522
00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.390
<v Speaker 2>than people realize you understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for most parents,</v>

523
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:06.930
<v Speaker 2>there is a concerted effort to de </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimize and I wouldn't say destroy </v>

524
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.030
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the white Christian male in </v>
<v Speaker 2>North American school,</v>

525
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:16.090
<v Speaker 2>especially the male aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're taught from the beginning stages </v>

526
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.270
<v Speaker 2>that there is a patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rigged against women.</v>

527
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.630
<v Speaker 2>When in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers show men are far more likely</v>

528
00:26:22.631 --> 00:26:25.390
<v Speaker 2>to commit suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men are not living as long as women.</v>

529
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Men are much more likely to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison,</v>

530
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:30.910
<v Speaker 2>much more likely to declare bankruptcy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more likely to be killed at work.</v>

531
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.940
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women are graduating in college in </v>

532
00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.140
<v Speaker 2>record numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women 14 or 15 years have a dominated in</v>

533
00:26:38.141 --> 00:26:43.141
<v Speaker 2>the math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got more master's degrees and more phds </v>

534
00:26:43.141 --> 00:26:43.141
<v Speaker 2>than men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

535
00:26:43.141 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 2>and there's another interesting stat to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

536
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.100
<v Speaker 1>you never hear discussed by feminists </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it actually drives me.</v>

537
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:52.050
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the many things that drives </v>
<v Speaker 1>me to distraction,</v>

538
00:26:52.051 --> 00:26:54.660
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that man,</v>

539
00:26:55.410 --> 00:27:00.410
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for a moment that all that on </v>

540
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:01.470
<v Speaker 1>average men make more money than women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the reasons for that,</v>

541
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.020
<v Speaker 1>as we've already discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are extraordinarily complicated.</v>

542
00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Women spend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last time I looked something </v>

543
00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 1>approximating 75 to 80 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer dollar.</v>

544
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.390
<v Speaker 1>It's exact and you can make a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least you can pose it as a question.</v>

545
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:15.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

546
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:21.110
<v Speaker 1>who has the economic upper hand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it the person who makes the money or </v>

547
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:25.401
<v Speaker 1>is it the person who spends the money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a real question </v>

548
00:27:25.401 --> 00:27:28.170
<v Speaker 1>because most of the men that I know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are worth their salt,</v>

549
00:27:28.171 --> 00:27:33.171
<v Speaker 1>it's like the competitive guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often they're out for money because </v>

550
00:27:33.171 --> 00:27:33.830
<v Speaker 1>that's the way they keep score.</v>

551
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:38.870
<v Speaker 1>The competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really see that in places like law </v>

552
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.181
<v Speaker 1>firms where it's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's heavily competitive and </v>

553
00:27:41.181 --> 00:27:44.000
<v Speaker 1>they're always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always have an eye on the bonus </v>

554
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.251
<v Speaker 1>because they're trying to climb up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and in large part from a </v>

555
00:27:46.251 --> 00:27:47.880
<v Speaker 1>biological perspective that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make them attractive to women.</v>

556
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>

557
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:55.310
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if men are generally men or are </v>

558
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.090
<v Speaker 1>motivated to earn heavily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be attractive in part,</v>

559
00:27:57.091 --> 00:28:02.091
<v Speaker 1>which is certainly part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to take their place in the male </v>

560
00:28:02.091 --> 00:28:02.091
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to succeed there,</v>

561
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.400
<v Speaker 1>then it also means that a huge part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their motivation is to distribute the </v>

562
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.820
<v Speaker 1>money and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to distribute it to who?</v>

563
00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:13.821
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle to their wife and </v>

564
00:28:13.821 --> 00:28:13.821
<v Speaker 1>their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean if you,</v>

565
00:28:13.821 --> 00:28:18.350
<v Speaker 1>if you're a man of any utility and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet another man who's fundamentally </v>

566
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.510
<v Speaker 1>oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is selfish direction.</v>

567
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Who's hoarding his money without any </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern for how it might be utilized?</v>

568
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Who's spending it all on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call them juvenile adolescent </v>

569
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.710
<v Speaker 1>impulsive pleasures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Refusing to share.</v>

570
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:39.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone that you admire in someone you </v>

571
00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:39.860
<v Speaker 1>have contempt for right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

572
00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:44.570
<v Speaker 1>And so if you ever meet someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the stereotype of the successful </v>

573
00:28:45.031 --> 00:28:50.031
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he's not somebody that fills you </v>

574
00:28:50.031 --> 00:28:51.180
<v Speaker 1>with admiration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking for someone who.</v>

575
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.430
<v Speaker 1>And the people I know that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful financially that I've admired</v>

576
00:28:56.431 --> 00:28:59.040
<v Speaker 1>and there's been many of them have done </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing things.</v>

577
00:28:59.041 --> 00:29:02.820
<v Speaker 1>They've produced technologies that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>world changing often,</v>

578
00:29:02.821 --> 00:29:07.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and but they're hyper concerned with </v>

579
00:29:07.821 --> 00:29:11.780
<v Speaker 1>what it is that they're going to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their money and how it should be well </v>

580
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:11.780
<v Speaker 1>spent and where it would do the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

581
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.050
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to whitewash,</v>

582
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:19.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to whitewash our society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that people are </v>

583
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.301
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally motivated by the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish motivations that only accrue </v>

584
00:29:24.091 --> 00:29:27.840
<v Speaker 1>benefit to them and no one else is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a preposterous claim.</v>

585
00:29:27.841 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see any evidence whatsoever</v>

586
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:32.340
<v Speaker 1>that that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

587
00:29:32.341 --> 00:29:35.760
<v Speaker 1>And one of the other components of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is taught in our schools,</v>

588
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:40.761
<v Speaker 1>which one of the top things I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispel is the idea that just because </v>

589
00:29:40.761 --> 00:29:41.710
<v Speaker 1>someone gets rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone got poor,</v>

590
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:47.330
<v Speaker 3>the zero sum game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's an idea that has </v>

591
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 3>penetrated the minds of youth in America</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I can't believe.</v>

592
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:49.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

593
00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:52.600
<v Speaker 3>this guy has a million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He must have stole it from someone else.</v>

594
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:53.840
<v Speaker 3>Wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

595
00:29:53.841 --> 00:29:56.320
<v Speaker 3>you had to create value in order to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>that money,</v>

596
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:58.390
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least some people do that,</v>

597
00:29:58.391 --> 00:30:01.960
<v Speaker 3>like you could say and should say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

598
00:30:01.961 --> 00:30:05.500
<v Speaker 3>in every hierarchical enterprise of any </v>
<v Speaker 3>scale,</v>

599
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.490
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be a fractional </v>
<v Speaker 3>criminal element without maybe you could</v>

600
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:09.850
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

601
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 3>it's five percent of the sum total of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the activity.</v>

602
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.360
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with the criminal part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it is that it tends not to be very </v>

603
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:18.360
<v Speaker 3>self sustaining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

604
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.740
<v Speaker 3>So you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's lots of psychopaths in </v>

605
00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:22.740
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

606
00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:22.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can eat,</v>

607
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.040
<v Speaker 3>they get pushed out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>

608
00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:29.041
<v Speaker 3>And they otherwise they have to move </v>
<v Speaker 3>from place to place because their </v>

609
00:30:29.041 --> 00:30:29.041
<v Speaker 3>reputations followed them around.</v>

610
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.600
<v Speaker 3>And your reputation is actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>fragile.</v>

611
00:30:31.601 --> 00:30:32.710
<v Speaker 3>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

612
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.400
<v Speaker 3>amongst the pool of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealthy,</v>

613
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:41.530
<v Speaker 3>there's a element that have obtained </v>
<v Speaker 3>that wealth through,</v>

614
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through means that aren't admirable.</v>

615
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:49.260
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For reasons that aren't socially </v>

616
00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:49.260
<v Speaker 3>beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to then say then say,</v>

617
00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.760
<v Speaker 3>because of that existence of that small </v>
<v Speaker 3>fraction of people,</v>

618
00:30:51.761 --> 00:30:53.770
<v Speaker 3>which is actually ineradicable right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

619
00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:58.780
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have a certain amount of </v>

620
00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:58.780
<v Speaker 3>freedom without a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>criminality.</v>

621
00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.980
<v Speaker 3>I think the American America is a really</v>
<v Speaker 3>good example of that.</v>

622
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.060
<v Speaker 3>To say that that means that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's been successful is a thief.</v>

623
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:09.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have to be very careful </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you make a claim like chef because </v>

624
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 3>it also means that if you're successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're a thief and that's a hell of</v>

625
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:15.730
<v Speaker 3>a value structure to adopt and I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>make the argument that the mark,</v>

626
00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.160
<v Speaker 3>the free market system forces you to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a better person.</v>

627
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:23.430
<v Speaker 3>It forces you to tell the truth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>create a better product and treat your </v>

628
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.581
<v Speaker 3>customers well and to be responsive when</v>
<v Speaker 3>something goes wrong or to lower your </v>

629
00:31:26.581 --> 00:31:30.430
<v Speaker 3>price or to improve the mechanism of </v>
<v Speaker 3>which you are interacting with.</v>

630
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:35.410
<v Speaker 3>The customers aren't demanding that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have choice,</v>

631
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's another.</v>

632
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.530
<v Speaker 3>That's another example of a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of cognitive problem,</v>

633
00:31:41.531 --> 00:31:44.080
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that people are taught,</v>

634
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.550
<v Speaker 3>people aren't taught that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comparing what we have to.</v>

635
00:31:48.551 --> 00:31:51.820
<v Speaker 3>They're hypothetical politically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>politically,</v>

636
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.510
<v Speaker 3>ideologically motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Utopia is actually a bad idea,</v>

637
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

638
00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:01.600
<v Speaker 3>it just isn't difficult to take a look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at a system like our system and say,</v>

639
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:06.930
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at all the problems that has </v>

640
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:07.300
<v Speaker 3>compared to a hypothetical system that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have any problems at all.</v>

641
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

642
00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:09.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's problems.</v>

643
00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.360
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

644
00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:15.361
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've taken like 99 percent of the fish </v>

645
00:32:15.361 --> 00:32:16.060
<v Speaker 3>out of the ocean and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

646
00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:21.061
<v Speaker 3>the degree to which our current level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>economic activity is truly sustainable </v>

647
00:32:21.061 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 3>without alteration is at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>debatable.</v>

648
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Even though I don't think it's nearly as</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible as people make out,</v>

649
00:32:25.961 --> 00:32:30.961
<v Speaker 3>make it out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think it's disputable that </v>

650
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:36.120
<v Speaker 3>our current socioeconomic structures are</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most productive and the most free </v>

651
00:32:36.401 --> 00:32:39.830
<v Speaker 3>structures that have ever been produced </v>
<v Speaker 3>by people anywhere in the world.</v>

652
00:32:39.831 --> 00:32:44.831
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things you can say about </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalism and free enterprise and and </v>

653
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:50.650
<v Speaker 3>the western stress on individuality is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that even though it does produce </v>

654
00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.370
<v Speaker 3>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a all systems produce inequality and and</v>

655
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.570
<v Speaker 3>without any real distinction between the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right and the left,</v>

656
00:32:56.571 --> 00:33:01.571
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm so new book called the Great</v>

657
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:07.330
<v Speaker 3>Leveler by Walter Shadelle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I'm going to be talking to later </v>

658
00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:07.330
<v Speaker 3>this month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did an analysis,</v>

659
00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.570
<v Speaker 3>empirical analysis trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

660
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:13.930
<v Speaker 3>if you grouped governments by right wing</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy say or by left wing </v>

661
00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:18.230
<v Speaker 3>philosophy and then you calculated </v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality coefficient.</v>

662
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.180
<v Speaker 3>Would that left wing organizations be </v>
<v Speaker 3>characterized by reduced inequality?</v>

663
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.210
<v Speaker 3>And the answer was no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence that they are.</v>

664
00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.390
<v Speaker 3>And what that points to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is something very fundamental,</v>

665
00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.450
<v Speaker 3>it's far more fundamental than that </v>
<v Speaker 3>political,</v>

666
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:37.720
<v Speaker 3>is that inequality is the rule in </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooperative slash competitive </v>

667
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.780
<v Speaker 3>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't pause it,</v>

668
00:33:40.781 --> 00:33:43.560
<v Speaker 3>a value without producing a hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

669
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:44.620
<v Speaker 3>Because you pause it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>devalues,</v>

670
00:33:44.621 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 3>say this is worth doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone says,</v>

671
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:47.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is worth doing.</v>

672
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:52.780
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then what happens automatically is that </v>

673
00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.090
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that some people are better</v>
<v Speaker 3>at doing it than other people.</v>

674
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:58.240
<v Speaker 3>No matter what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get better and better at </v>

675
00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.641
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the cradle plus you're talking </v>

676
00:34:00.641 --> 00:34:02.080
<v Speaker 3>about too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they start getting better at </v>

677
00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.821
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the problem is is that without you </v>

678
00:34:03.821 --> 00:34:04.160
<v Speaker 3>with if you're going to pause it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>value which you have to do,</v>

679
00:34:04.161 --> 00:34:09.161
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to act and immediately </v>
<v Speaker 3>you create a hierarchy and you also </v>

680
00:34:09.161 --> 00:34:12.260
<v Speaker 3>build into the value claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the claim that a is better than b.</v>

681
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:16.820
<v Speaker 3>You also build into that the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>if a is better than B,</v>

682
00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:21.821
<v Speaker 3>than people who are doing better at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be differentially rewarded </v>

683
00:34:21.821 --> 00:34:25.571
<v Speaker 3>compared to people who who aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way around that if you're </v>

684
00:34:25.571 --> 00:34:26.900
<v Speaker 3>going to play the game and so you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuck with an equality,</v>

685
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:32.080
<v Speaker 3>but there isn't any evidence that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>social engineering policies are really </v>

686
00:34:32.661 --> 00:34:36.440
<v Speaker 3>very good at dispensing with inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a fundamental political problem</v>

687
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.300
<v Speaker 3>and no one really knows what to do about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

688
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.740
<v Speaker 3>But criticizing the entire society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

689
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:46.070
<v Speaker 3>the thing about the west and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasingly true all over the world,</v>

690
00:34:46.071 --> 00:34:51.071
<v Speaker 3>is that it's generating our approach </v>
<v Speaker 3>generates a tremendous amount of wealth </v>

691
00:34:51.071 --> 00:34:51.800
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it even happened in China,</v>

692
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:55.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite their exceptionally totalitarian</v>

693
00:34:55.671 --> 00:35:00.671
<v Speaker 3>leanings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what happens with the lefties is </v>

694
00:35:00.671 --> 00:35:00.890
<v Speaker 3>that they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

695
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:04.250
<v Speaker 3>inequality as a consequence of the west </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the consequence of capitalism,</v>

696
00:35:04.251 --> 00:35:08.030
<v Speaker 3>which is palpably false claim and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

697
00:35:08.031 --> 00:35:10.760
<v Speaker 3>because it produces inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's a corrupt system.</v>

698
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

699
00:35:11.301 --> 00:35:15.020
<v Speaker 3>every system produces inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but hardly any also produce wealth.</v>

700
00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:20.260
<v Speaker 3>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Mobility and and reward for </v>

701
00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.231
<v Speaker 3>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurial activity and risk </v>

702
00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:23.231
<v Speaker 3>taking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

703
00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:26.550
<v Speaker 3>that's something that the free market </v>
<v Speaker 3>system is quite unique at and whereas a </v>

704
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.760
<v Speaker 3>more neo Marxist view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you get rich and a socialist?</v>

705
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.890
<v Speaker 3>You run for political office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

706
00:35:30.891 --> 00:35:35.891
<v Speaker 3>Exploitation is you run on the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>intentions of the public while </v>

707
00:35:35.891 --> 00:35:38.670
<v Speaker 3>implementing what you believe to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best socially engineered construct.</v>

708
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Look at Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the leaders are doing just fine.</v>

709
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are dying on the streets,</v>

710
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>13,000</v>

711
00:35:45.421 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 3>percent inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so on and so forth.</v>

712
00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:52.491
<v Speaker 3>So I have a question for you and I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>watched hundreds of hours of your </v>

713
00:35:52.491 --> 00:35:57.201
<v Speaker 3>content on the Internet and you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>opened up my mind in ways I cannot </v>

714
00:35:57.201 --> 00:35:57.420
<v Speaker 3>describe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've made me a better speaker.</v>

715
00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:59.160
<v Speaker 3>You've made me a better lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a better person,</v>

716
00:35:59.161 --> 00:36:04.161
<v Speaker 3>more organized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more I can draw a direct corollary to </v>

717
00:36:04.161 --> 00:36:08.061
<v Speaker 3>our organization's budget and everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>from when I first interacted with your </v>

718
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:13.070
<v Speaker 3>content because I'd never heard anyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>describe the reality of life.</v>

719
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Life is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do about it?</v>

720
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:19.350
<v Speaker 3>Just so bluntly and so directly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with struggle up the.</v>

721
00:36:19.351 --> 00:36:19.990
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

722
00:36:19.991 --> 00:36:24.991
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With a roadmap to deal with that </v>

723
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:28.940
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you something cool and </v>

724
00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:28.940
<v Speaker 3>then I'll get the other question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

725
00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:28.940
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

726
00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:28.940
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

727
00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.891
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have this program and it might be </v>

728
00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:34.670
<v Speaker 3>something in the future off your </v>
<v Speaker 3>pronunciation.</v>

729
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've used it with people that have done </v>

730
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:39.680
<v Speaker 3>that with drug problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

731
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a fairly new study that came out</v>

732
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.300
<v Speaker 3>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm from Mohawk College.</v>

733
00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.750
<v Speaker 3>She's a junior college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

734
00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:53.580
<v Speaker 3>with the vocational element.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the kids came in during the summer </v>

735
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:57.720
<v Speaker 3>in their orientation and spent an hour </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing out their life plan,</v>

736
00:36:57.721 --> 00:36:58.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

737
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:04.040
<v Speaker 3>how they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they would like to have in their </v>

738
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.670
<v Speaker 3>life across six standard dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intimate relationship,</v>

739
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.880
<v Speaker 3>family education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>care of their own mental and physical </v>

740
00:37:12.091 --> 00:37:17.040
<v Speaker 3>health strategies for dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>temptation like drug and alcohol use,</v>

741
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:22.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>useful application of their time outside</v>

742
00:37:22.111 --> 00:37:25.560
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of their obligations.</v>

743
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.440
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's,</v>

744
00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:33.540
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of predicated on a new </v>

745
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:33.540
<v Speaker 3>testament principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say in part,</v>

746
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:37.350
<v Speaker 3>which is know if you could have what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted by asking what,</v>

747
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:40.720
<v Speaker 3>what would you ask asking you shall </v>
<v Speaker 3>receive knock and you will answer it.</v>

748
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.000
<v Speaker 3>It's in Matthew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

749
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.590
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in Matthew and,</v>

750
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.500
<v Speaker 3>and the idea there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think from a psychological perspective</v>

751
00:37:46.501 --> 00:37:49.770
<v Speaker 3>is that while you're not going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you want,</v>

752
00:37:49.771 --> 00:37:52.200
<v Speaker 3>unless you know what it is and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to hit target lists,</v>

753
00:37:52.201 --> 00:37:57.201
<v Speaker 3>you aim for it course and you can't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>organize your perceptions in </v>

754
00:37:57.201 --> 00:37:58.170
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the world unless you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a goal.</v>

755
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you write down what you think you </v>

756
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.781
<v Speaker 3>might want and need in order to stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life and then you write for awhile </v>

757
00:38:05.781 --> 00:38:07.890
<v Speaker 3>about how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what your life could be like in three to</v>

758
00:38:07.891 --> 00:38:10.170
<v Speaker 3>five years if you put your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

759
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:13.020
<v Speaker 3>what your vision would be for your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three to five years.</v>

760
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:18.020
<v Speaker 3>And then you read a counter vision which</v>
<v Speaker 3>is an analysis of where you might be in </v>

761
00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.801
<v Speaker 3>three to five years if you let all your </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad habits take the upper hand and then </v>

762
00:38:21.801 --> 00:38:22.080
<v Speaker 3>you write a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

763
00:38:22.081 --> 00:38:25.380
<v Speaker 3>And it takes a long time to do a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good job of that.</v>

764
00:38:25.381 --> 00:38:28.260
<v Speaker 3>But it turns out that you can do a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>job of it in about an hour.</v>

765
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:33.590
<v Speaker 3>And so we had kids at Mohawk do it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>an hour when they came in for their </v>

766
00:38:34.771 --> 00:38:39.771
<v Speaker 3>summer orientation and it knocked the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dropout rate for young men down 50 </v>

767
00:38:39.771 --> 00:38:43.831
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I thought it just just blew me </v>

768
00:38:43.831 --> 00:38:46.240
<v Speaker 3>away because it's sad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.490
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just look at that.</v>

770
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:53.520
<v Speaker 3>If you get young guys to sit down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>think for an hour about what they would </v>

771
00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:59.461
<v Speaker 3>like their life to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it decreases the probability that </v>

772
00:38:59.461 --> 00:39:00.010
<v Speaker 3>they'll drop out of college by 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

773
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a kind of hell man kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation.</v>

774
00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:03.460
<v Speaker 3>It's just stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

775
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.760
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have three studies demonstrating that</v>

776
00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:07.360
<v Speaker 3>was the biggest effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it.</v>

777
00:39:07.361 --> 00:39:07.870
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

778
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:13.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm dealing currently with one of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>best high school buddies that was an </v>

779
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.400
<v Speaker 3>opioid since a huge problem in America </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm guessing here in Canada it is as</v>

780
00:39:15.401 --> 00:39:16.540
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not as well versed in it.</v>

781
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:21.930
<v Speaker 3>And I sat him down and I did the future </v>
<v Speaker 3>authoring program and it changed his </v>

782
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 3>life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I made him watch all your videos and</v>

783
00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:26.360
<v Speaker 3>became hooked on it and it saved no </v>
<v Speaker 3>opiates.</v>

784
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saved his life.</v>

785
00:39:28.031 --> 00:39:30.220
<v Speaker 3>I can say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you changed my life.</v>

786
00:39:30.221 --> 00:39:33.130
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say you say it because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't in that same dire condition,</v>

787
00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:36.160
<v Speaker 3>but the number one thing I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

788
00:39:36.161 --> 00:39:41.161
<v Speaker 3>listen buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can use his name to protect his </v>

789
00:39:41.161 --> 00:39:41.161
<v Speaker 3>privacy.</v>

790
00:39:41.161 --> 00:39:41.161
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your whole life,</v>

791
00:39:41.161 --> 00:39:41.860
<v Speaker 3>you've been seeking freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

792
00:39:41.861 --> 00:39:42.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I've been told.</v>

793
00:39:42.941 --> 00:39:47.941
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things in life that give you meaning </v>

794
00:39:47.941 --> 00:39:47.941
<v Speaker 3>will come from responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

795
00:39:47.941 --> 00:39:52.340
<v Speaker 3>That's what click.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that you said that </v>

796
00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:52.340
<v Speaker 3>really clicked with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good thing to know,</v>

797
00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.400
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have inundated,</v>

798
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.190
<v Speaker 3>especially young men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go seek freedom.</v>

799
00:39:57.191 --> 00:39:59.290
<v Speaker 3>Go do you want how you want to do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you want to do,</v>

800
00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:02.590
<v Speaker 3>which is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing inherently wrong to that</v>

801
00:40:02.591 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 3>when you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you really want meaning,</v>

802
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 3>if you want satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want direction,</v>

803
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.350
<v Speaker 3>it's the stuff that has consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's family work.</v>

804
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:12.970
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freedom is.</v>

805
00:40:12.971 --> 00:40:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Freedom is not teaching young millnet </v>
<v Speaker 3>intentionally.</v>

806
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:17.020
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing I wanted to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

807
00:40:17.021 --> 00:40:19.270
<v Speaker 3>but go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's intentional.</v>

808
00:40:19.271 --> 00:40:24.271
<v Speaker 3>I think it is too because it's part and </v>
<v Speaker 3>parcel of the idea that the productive </v>

809
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:29.610
<v Speaker 3>activity of young men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this also goes for the masculine </v>

810
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:31.060
<v Speaker 3>symbolically masculine activity of young</v>
<v Speaker 3>women by the way,</v>

811
00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:36.061
<v Speaker 3>but the productive activity of a young </v>
<v Speaker 3>man is indistinguishable from the </v>

812
00:40:36.061 --> 00:40:36.061
<v Speaker 3>forest.</v>

813
00:40:36.061 --> 00:40:40.290
<v Speaker 3>That gives rise to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the crushing tyranny of the </v>

814
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:40.290
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

815
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:41.830
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that also gives young men at a moral</v>

816
00:40:41.831 --> 00:40:43.840
<v Speaker 3>excuse not to engage in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

817
00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:44.530
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

818
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.950
<v Speaker 3>productive activities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See it all the time.</v>

819
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:49.000
<v Speaker 3>I've been told I'm a horrible person my </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole life.</v>

820
00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.500
<v Speaker 3>W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w what uses this to me?</v>

821
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go play video games in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>basement.</v>

822
00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:58.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been told from all my teachers and </v>

823
00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:58.140
<v Speaker 3>my parents that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

824
00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:01.441
<v Speaker 3>it's rigged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that I'm a horrible individual </v>

825
00:41:01.441 --> 00:41:05.011
<v Speaker 3>just because I'm a man and it really </v>
<v Speaker 3>diminishes a men that might want to </v>

826
00:41:05.591 --> 00:41:07.330
<v Speaker 3>succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I see it happen all the time.</v>

827
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it gives them an excuse to the </v>

828
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.120
<v Speaker 3>useless part of men that don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>succeed because it's easy to sit around.</v>

829
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:18.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't because the longterm </v>

830
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.150
<v Speaker 3>consequences of that are just absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 3>devastating.</v>

831
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.760
<v Speaker 3>Start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See.</v>

832
00:41:18.761 --> 00:41:21.070
<v Speaker 3>So when we have a discussion about </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom,</v>

833
00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might also say,</v>

834
00:41:22.391 --> 00:41:23.290
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the freedom is.</v>

835
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:26.110
<v Speaker 3>I think this is right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it's freedom to pick your poison.</v>

836
00:41:26.111 --> 00:41:28.240
<v Speaker 3>It's freedom to pick your </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

837
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.140
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might say,</v>

838
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:29.690
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

839
00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:34.730
<v Speaker 3>there's a set of weights in front of you</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to pick up in order to </v>

840
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:38.231
<v Speaker 3>stand yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's the other thing I think </v>

841
00:41:38.231 --> 00:41:38.231
<v Speaker 3>about human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

842
00:41:38.231 --> 00:41:42.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we conscientiousness is a trait and it </v>

843
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.700
<v Speaker 3>we don't have an animal model for </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness.</v>

844
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:45.590
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't understand conscientiousness at</v>

845
00:41:45.591 --> 00:41:46.370
<v Speaker 3>all from a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a,</v>

846
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:48.790
<v Speaker 3>from a psychological or Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

847
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:53.830
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's more complicated because I'm </v>

848
00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:57.430
<v Speaker 3>conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men tend to do better and so they're </v>

849
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.430
<v Speaker 3>going to be more successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

850
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:59.120
<v Speaker 3>But we don't have a model for what </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness is,</v>

851
00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:04.460
<v Speaker 3>but but conscientiousness is at least in</v>
<v Speaker 3>part this the the necessity to carry a </v>

852
00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:12.281
<v Speaker 3>load for yourself and for other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>or to suffer guilt and shame as a </v>

853
00:42:12.281 --> 00:42:12.320
<v Speaker 3>consequence.</v>

854
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:17.710
<v Speaker 3>And so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems built in especially to </v>

855
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.710
<v Speaker 3>conscientious people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

856
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:22.271
<v Speaker 3>conscientious people didn't more tend to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be more conservative because that's one </v>

857
00:42:22.271 --> 00:42:25.901
<v Speaker 3>of the predictors of conservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it could easily be that freedom is </v>

858
00:42:25.901 --> 00:42:28.220
<v Speaker 3>the freedom to choose your yoke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

859
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:33.460
<v Speaker 3>and you and then you choose the weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to carry so that you can </v>

860
00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:38.141
<v Speaker 3>justify your miserable existence to </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself so that you can go to bed at </v>

861
00:42:38.141 --> 00:42:38.720
<v Speaker 3>the end of the night and you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

862
00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:43.721
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did what I needed to do to set things </v>

863
00:42:43.721 --> 00:42:46.181
<v Speaker 3>right today and I don't have to carry </v>
<v Speaker 3>the existential wait around of my </v>

864
00:42:46.461 --> 00:42:48.530
<v Speaker 3>failure and uselessness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a consequence.</v>

865
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:53.650
<v Speaker 3>The existential psychologist in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>fifties who emerged out of the chaos of </v>

866
00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:58.151
<v Speaker 3>world war two were very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very much concentrated on the idea </v>

867
00:42:58.151 --> 00:42:59.300
<v Speaker 3>of existential guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

868
00:42:59.301 --> 00:43:04.301
<v Speaker 3>that you owed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you owed being a ransom for your </v>

869
00:43:04.301 --> 00:43:08.690
<v Speaker 3>existence and the way that you paid that</v>
<v Speaker 3>ransom was to work for the betterment of</v>

870
00:43:08.691 --> 00:43:08.990
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

871
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very ancient idea,</v>

872
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:15.460
<v Speaker 3>but of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is the one idea I think that </v>

873
00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.960
<v Speaker 3>gives people the self respect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not self esteem,</v>

874
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.400
<v Speaker 3>the self respect that's necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 3>carry them through terrible times and to</v>

875
00:43:22.401 --> 00:43:24.260
<v Speaker 3>use a story that people are familiar </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

876
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:29.740
<v Speaker 3>When I'm asked to what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is Jordan Peterson done for your </v>

877
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:29.740
<v Speaker 3>members?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

878
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.521
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has to stop acting like Peter Pan so </v>

879
00:43:33.521 --> 00:43:36.140
<v Speaker 3>that they can actually be a man and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>a boy.</v>

880
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.900
<v Speaker 3>The Peter Pan Story is a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting one.</v>

881
00:43:38.901 --> 00:43:43.130
<v Speaker 3>A because Peter Pan Pan means </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

882
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:45.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Technically that's what pan means.</v>

883
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.970
<v Speaker 3>And Peter Pan Wants to be a child </v>
<v Speaker 3>because a child can be anything.</v>

884
00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.110
<v Speaker 3>It can be everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

885
00:43:51.111 --> 00:43:56.111
<v Speaker 3>So what you have in childhood is that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>plethora of potential and the problem </v>

886
00:43:56.111 --> 00:43:58.130
<v Speaker 3>with growing up is that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice that,</v>

887
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:03.970
<v Speaker 3>that pan potential for a defined </v>
<v Speaker 3>actuality,</v>

888
00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:04.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

889
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.330
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

890
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:10.360
<v Speaker 3>that's to grow up and become something </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of staying potentially anything.</v>

891
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:15.910
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with Peter Pan is that he </v>

892
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:17.270
<v Speaker 3>looks into the world and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sees captain hook as his role model.</v>

893
00:44:17.271 --> 00:44:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's his model for,</v>

894
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:22.610
<v Speaker 3>for adulthood and hook is terrified of </v>
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

895
00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:26.780
<v Speaker 3>That's the crocodile is chasing him with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a clock in his stomach and the crocodile</v>

896
00:44:26.781 --> 00:44:28.700
<v Speaker 3>already has a piece of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's got a taste of him.</v>

897
00:44:28.701 --> 00:44:32.370
<v Speaker 3>And so hook is constantly chased by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dragon of chaos essentially.</v>

898
00:44:32.371 --> 00:44:35.910
<v Speaker 3>That's already got a taste of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because hook is terrified of his own</v>

899
00:44:35.911 --> 00:44:38.850
<v Speaker 3>mortality and terrified in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a tyrant.</v>

900
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:41.910
<v Speaker 3>And so pan looks at Hook and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

901
00:44:41.911 --> 00:44:44.760
<v Speaker 3>if that's adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather stay king of the lost boys.</v>

902
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:46.870
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>

903
00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:48.650
<v Speaker 3>it's a very powerful story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

904
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.940
<v Speaker 3>which is why people still tell it 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years later.</v>

905
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.350
<v Speaker 3>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I see,</v>

906
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 3>at least from my experience is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

907
00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000
<v Speaker 3>that idea of staying a boy is idolized </v>
<v Speaker 3>and is made more culturally acceptable </v>

908
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:09.410
<v Speaker 3>in America than ever has been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's almost as if that you,</v>

909
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:14.460
<v Speaker 3>you ask a young man that is generally on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the direction towards,</v>

910
00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:19.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopelessness and just kind of what you </v>

911
00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.131
<v Speaker 3>bring men out of it is they look towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>that MTV vh one lifestyle of being able </v>

912
00:45:22.531 --> 00:45:24.450
<v Speaker 3>to do whatever you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you want to do it,</v>

913
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.420
<v Speaker 3>get extraordinarily drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have no responsibility,</v>

914
00:45:27.421 --> 00:45:29.460
<v Speaker 3>be with women all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>

915
00:45:29.461 --> 00:45:33.150
<v Speaker 3>You do that for a couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You end up a horribly miserable person.</v>

916
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:35.250
<v Speaker 3>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's my question,</v>

917
00:45:35.251 --> 00:45:36.240
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

918
00:45:36.241 --> 00:45:38.340
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be the oldest guy at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the frat party.</v>

919
00:45:38.341 --> 00:45:39.180
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's correct.</v>

920
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty dismal.</v>

921
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:41.220
<v Speaker 3>But it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's my,</v>

922
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.640
<v Speaker 3>here's my distinction though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that in some ways it's the women that</v>

923
00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:48.240
<v Speaker 3>are embracing the masculine archetype </v>
<v Speaker 3>and some ways that are being successful.</v>

924
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:48.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

925
00:45:48.901 --> 00:45:50.880
<v Speaker 3>they're being extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible and they're,</v>

926
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:53.370
<v Speaker 3>they're feeling a lot of these positions</v>
<v Speaker 3>quicker than men can't.</v>

927
00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:58.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're graduating at higher rates </v>

928
00:45:58.760 --> 00:45:58.760
<v Speaker 3>of college and they're declining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're declining motherhood,</v>

929
00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.900
<v Speaker 3>or they're at least suspending it </v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout the west,</v>

930
00:46:00.901 --> 00:46:02.520
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could argue for either ways.</v>

931
00:46:02.521 --> 00:46:05.400
<v Speaker 3>There's reasons for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guess my question is,</v>

932
00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:10.460
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the expression of the </v>

933
00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.051
<v Speaker 3>masculine spirit and women isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>denigrated like women don't get accused </v>

934
00:46:12.051 --> 00:46:16.530
<v Speaker 3>of contributing to the patriarchy even </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they take positions in society that</v>

935
00:46:16.531 --> 00:46:20.880
<v Speaker 3>you would think are fully patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and which is a strange thing.</v>

936
00:46:20.881 --> 00:46:25.380
<v Speaker 3>So women who go to law school and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then practices corporate lawyers say</v>

937
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.920
<v Speaker 3>aren't subject to the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it?</v>

938
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:34.160
<v Speaker 3>Claim that their activity is </v>
<v Speaker 3>facilitating that the decline of the </v>

939
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.050
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess because they're seen as well.</v>

940
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:42.050
<v Speaker 3>They're there because of their gender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose they're seen as as as leaders </v>

941
00:46:42.271 --> 00:46:44.430
<v Speaker 3>of the rebellion against the patriarchal</v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit.</v>

942
00:46:44.431 --> 00:46:46.680
<v Speaker 3>Even though structurally it boils down </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the same thing.</v>

943
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that masculine,</v>

944
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.410
<v Speaker 3>classically masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolically masculine,</v>

945
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:57.890
<v Speaker 3>yearning for hierarchical productivity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and competition is rewarded in women but</v>

946
00:46:58.741 --> 00:47:03.741
<v Speaker 3>not in men and which is also a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>perverse thing because it doesn't make </v>

947
00:47:03.741 --> 00:47:07.971
<v Speaker 3>any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense through the </v>

948
00:47:07.971 --> 00:47:10.161
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is they're just undoing the </v>

949
00:47:10.161 --> 00:47:10.161
<v Speaker 3>oppressor ship of the man and the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

950
00:47:10.161 --> 00:47:12.600
<v Speaker 3>hundred 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the ends justify the means.</v>

951
00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:17.601
<v Speaker 3>That's the way they look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever power women can take from men </v>

952
00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:19.050
<v Speaker 3>is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the way they look at it.</v>

953
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a funny thing about that too,</v>

954
00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:24.720
<v Speaker 3>that like I really need this and 12 </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules for life.</v>

955
00:47:24.721 --> 00:47:26.830
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at some of the pew </v>
<v Speaker 3>research data,</v>

956
00:47:26.831 --> 00:47:28.800
<v Speaker 3>and I don't remember the figures </v>
<v Speaker 3>precisely,</v>

957
00:47:28.801 --> 00:47:33.801
<v Speaker 3>but the last 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the percentage of women who young women </v>

958
00:47:33.821 --> 00:47:38.821
<v Speaker 3>who claim that they would like to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>married in a permanent relationship has </v>

959
00:47:38.821 --> 00:47:39.610
<v Speaker 3>gone up a substantial amount.</v>

960
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what it was at 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent approximately springs to mind,</v>

961
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:50.190
<v Speaker 3>but a lot at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's declined almost the same degree </v>

962
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:53.740
<v Speaker 3>among young men and so what's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's perverse about this,</v>

963
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:59.010
<v Speaker 3>this is something I've talked to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter a fair a bit about is that I </v>

964
00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:00.310
<v Speaker 3>mean if you ask young women what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

965
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:05.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they can answer because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they know if they're 19 </v>

966
00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.551
<v Speaker 3>or 20 because I think their heads are so</v>
<v Speaker 3>muddled by what they've been told that </v>

967
00:48:08.551 --> 00:48:12.091
<v Speaker 3>they don't really know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my sense is that women want the </v>

968
00:48:12.091 --> 00:48:15.580
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to develop their career in </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever direction they see fit and fair</v>

969
00:48:15.581 --> 00:48:20.581
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they want an intimate relationship </v>

970
00:48:20.581 --> 00:48:23.790
<v Speaker 3>and usually I'm monogamous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one that's permanent and they want to </v>

971
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:25.150
<v Speaker 3>have the opportunity to have kids and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you see happening.</v>

972
00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Inevitably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I believe this to be the case.</v>

973
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:32.320
<v Speaker 3>I've watched very carefully as I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I've grown up and go to older because</v>

974
00:48:32.321 --> 00:48:37.060
<v Speaker 3>I've worked with women my whole life is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that women are less,</v>

975
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:42.510
<v Speaker 3>are less compelled by their career as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they approached their thirties and more </v>

976
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:46.231
<v Speaker 3>compelled by the desire to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>permanent relationship and biological </v>

977
00:48:46.231 --> 00:48:46.600
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would argue too.</v>

978
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think it's.</v>

979
00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:55.480
<v Speaker 3>It's a biological necessity because </v>
<v Speaker 3>women have to have children relatively </v>

980
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:55.480
<v Speaker 3>young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's correct,</v>

981
00:48:55.481 --> 00:49:00.481
<v Speaker 3>but it's interesting to watch it </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenologically and even the women </v>

982
00:49:00.481 --> 00:49:04.291
<v Speaker 3>that I've seen who've had very high </v>
<v Speaker 3>powered careers is that as they move </v>

983
00:49:04.291 --> 00:49:04.810
<v Speaker 3>into their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially their early thirties,</v>

984
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:08.890
<v Speaker 3>they start to realize that the career is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pretty one dimensional enterprise,</v>

985
00:49:08.891 --> 00:49:13.891
<v Speaker 3>even if it's a good career because even </v>
<v Speaker 3>good careers are still jobs and good </v>

986
00:49:14.381 --> 00:49:16.150
<v Speaker 3>careers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're also very hard jobs.</v>

987
00:49:16.151 --> 00:49:20.770
<v Speaker 3>They're like 70 hour a week jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're full bore commitment jobs and to</v>

988
00:49:20.771 --> 00:49:25.150
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to have a career like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and to have a life,</v>

989
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:28.090
<v Speaker 3>to have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have an intimate relationship,</v>

990
00:49:28.091 --> 00:49:30.520
<v Speaker 3>to have children and then to also be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to take care of them.</v>

991
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:35.820
<v Speaker 3>That's a very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very complex job to manage and so </v>

992
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:41.130
<v Speaker 3>what's strange is I think what's strange</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the very things that the </v>

993
00:49:41.171 --> 00:49:44.350
<v Speaker 3>radicals are undermining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the monogamous family,</v>

994
00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:49.890
<v Speaker 3>are actually those things that women </v>
<v Speaker 3>most want,</v>

995
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:52.180
<v Speaker 3>especially as they approach their </v>
<v Speaker 3>thirties.</v>

996
00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.780
<v Speaker 3>And so this is a catastrophe on both </v>
<v Speaker 3>ends of the,</v>

997
00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.960
<v Speaker 3>of the gender distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if there's one thing I would love to </v>

998
00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.780
<v Speaker 3>get your opinion and take on is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideal,</v>

999
00:50:01.781 --> 00:50:06.100
<v Speaker 3>what these college radicals is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least the professors that people that</v>

1000
00:50:06.101 --> 00:50:09.250
<v Speaker 3>should know better of the roots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Western civilization.</v>

1001
00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:14.520
<v Speaker 3>The only description that I could give </v>
<v Speaker 3>to their motivation is some people just </v>

1002
00:50:14.531 --> 00:50:19.531
<v Speaker 3>want to see the world burn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost as if they want chaos for </v>

1003
00:50:19.531 --> 00:50:22.870
<v Speaker 3>the sake that they were not able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>contribute meaningfully mindfully.</v>

1004
00:50:22.871 --> 00:50:26.380
<v Speaker 3>I would love your take on that from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>social psychologist brother-in-law about</v>

1005
00:50:26.381 --> 00:50:27.700
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've thought about it.</v>

1006
00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:29.060
<v Speaker 3>What is their intention?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is.</v>

1007
00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:32.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question is to some degree,</v>

1008
00:50:32.751 --> 00:50:35.090
<v Speaker 3>what's the intention of resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>failure?</v>

1009
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:36.710
<v Speaker 3>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1010
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:40.700
<v Speaker 3>let's say that you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that you.</v>

1011
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:45.820
<v Speaker 3>Everything hasn't turned out for you the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way you want it and you're angry about </v>

1012
00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:49.181
<v Speaker 3>that and maybe you're angry about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who have been successful because </v>

1013
00:50:49.181 --> 00:50:52.151
<v Speaker 3>they cast you in a dim light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so there's the anger that motivates </v>

1014
00:50:52.151 --> 00:50:52.820
<v Speaker 3>the desire for destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's resentment,</v>

1015
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:54.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you never want to underestimate evil</v>

1016
00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:55.990
<v Speaker 3>triad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1017
00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Greed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>envy and resentment.</v>

1018
00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.030
<v Speaker 3>Something something like arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrogance,</v>

1019
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:02.990
<v Speaker 3>arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deceit and resentment.</v>

1020
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.450
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a bad trial that'll take you down</v>

1021
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:11.050
<v Speaker 3>and the thing about the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's anger and maybe the anger you</v>

1022
00:51:11.421 --> 00:51:15.200
<v Speaker 3>want everything to burn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also the idea to that,</v>

1023
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:20.830
<v Speaker 3>and this is part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality actually is a problem for </v>

1024
00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:24.311
<v Speaker 3>people on the right and on the left is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you put people into a position </v>

1025
00:51:24.311 --> 00:51:27.080
<v Speaker 3>where they don't have what they need and</v>
<v Speaker 3>want and they can't see a way to get it,</v>

1026
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:32.470
<v Speaker 3>they have high motivation to flip the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game board over and start again or maybe</v>

1027
00:51:33.321 --> 00:51:34.640
<v Speaker 3>to try to play a new game.</v>

1028
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:38.810
<v Speaker 3>And so part of the reason that those on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right for example,</v>

1029
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:43.190
<v Speaker 3>have to be careful not only to raise </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth overall,</v>

1030
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:48.191
<v Speaker 3>but also to be careful about inequality </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that as societies become more </v>

1031
00:51:48.191 --> 00:51:52.031
<v Speaker 3>unequal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the motivation for those who feel </v>

1032
00:51:52.031 --> 00:51:54.680
<v Speaker 3>dispossessed to flip the entire game </v>
<v Speaker 3>overgrows and grows quite rapidly.</v>

1033
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.610
<v Speaker 3>And I'd see that sort of resentment in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universities.</v>

1034
00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Although it's to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult to say why.</v>

1035
00:52:01.401 --> 00:52:06.401
<v Speaker 3>Because of course university professors </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't unsuccessful by any stretch of </v>

1036
00:52:06.651 --> 00:52:11.651
<v Speaker 3>the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well compensated and they have very </v>

1037
00:52:11.651 --> 00:52:11.651
<v Speaker 3>secure positions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

1038
00:52:11.651 --> 00:52:16.480
<v Speaker 3>but there's still on an anti capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethos that runs through the </v>

1039
00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:20.951
<v Speaker 3>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's difficult to make a to make a </v>

1040
00:52:20.951 --> 00:52:20.951
<v Speaker 3>case for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>

1041
00:52:20.951 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 3>Is it an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to figure out,</v>

1042
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:27.790
<v Speaker 3>is it that I know better than you sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of thing and you deal with these </v>

1043
00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:32.411
<v Speaker 3>professors?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it that I'm a smarter individual and </v>

1044
00:52:32.411 --> 00:52:33.030
<v Speaker 3>we can create society more equitable?</v>

1045
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's partly that.</v>

1046
00:52:34.101 --> 00:52:35.210
<v Speaker 3>It's Hubris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1047
00:52:35.211 --> 00:52:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's partly the rationalist UK Hubris.</v>

1048
00:52:37.731 --> 00:52:38.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1049
00:52:38.571 --> 00:52:43.571
<v Speaker 3>That you know that you can systematize </v>
<v Speaker 3>utopia and that you're smart enough to </v>

1050
00:52:44.301 --> 00:52:49.301
<v Speaker 3>do that doctorate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can figure this stuff out so well and </v>

1051
00:52:49.301 --> 00:52:51.860
<v Speaker 3>that you're systematizing of utopia </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't going to generate an unexpected </v>

1052
00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:55.901
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now know social scientists should be </v>

1053
00:52:55.901 --> 00:52:58.520
<v Speaker 3>much smarter than that because if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>a social scientist who has any sense,</v>

1054
00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:04.090
<v Speaker 3>what you learned from your research is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the probability that you can </v>

1055
00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:07.421
<v Speaker 3>predict the outcome of your procedure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what you're trying to do as a </v>

1056
00:53:07.421 --> 00:53:07.610
<v Speaker 3>scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is very low.</v>

1057
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:11.060
<v Speaker 3>You're running experiment predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a hypothesis.</v>

1058
00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:16.120
<v Speaker 3>You'll put the procedure in place that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to put pros to produce the </v>

1059
00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.990
<v Speaker 3>hypothesized outcome and likely is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>

1060
00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:23.020
<v Speaker 3>And those are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's under simple conditions in the </v>

1061
00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:23.020
<v Speaker 3>lab where you can control almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1062
00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:27.610
<v Speaker 3>And then there's also the case that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this has been well known among good </v>

1063
00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:32.271
<v Speaker 3>social scientists for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that large scale social engineering </v>

1064
00:53:32.311 --> 00:53:37.311
<v Speaker 3>projects almost never produced the </v>
<v Speaker 3>results that are in that are intended </v>

1065
00:53:37.311 --> 00:53:41.950
<v Speaker 3>and they pr because systems are very </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex and you tweak one thing and you </v>

1066
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:46.071
<v Speaker 3>think you're only tweaking one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're tweaking 20 things and a lot </v>

1067
00:53:46.071 --> 00:53:49.551
<v Speaker 3>of the things that you tweak </v>
<v Speaker 3>inadvertently kick back and get that </v>

1068
00:53:49.551 --> 00:53:49.800
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1070
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1071
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:58.710
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a hard thing to push it because I </v>

1072
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:59.010
<v Speaker 3>get this question a lot from because </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all I deal with.</v>

1073
00:53:59.011 --> 00:54:04.011
<v Speaker 3>I deal with the leftist activists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the social justice mind and to things </v>

1074
00:54:04.501 --> 00:54:09.501
<v Speaker 3>that are so important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The activists are taking over </v>

1075
00:54:09.501 --> 00:54:11.721
<v Speaker 3>governments now and at a rapid rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Democrat Party in America has been </v>

1076
00:54:11.721 --> 00:54:14.670
<v Speaker 3>taken over by the social justice neo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxist postmodernist left,</v>

1077
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:20.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that it's extraordinarily dangerous </v>

1078
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.670
<v Speaker 3>to the west and east,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm always,</v>

1079
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:25.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm always asked by people what </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivates them because it's so damn </v>

1080
00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:25.770
<v Speaker 3>obvious.</v>

1081
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:29.280
<v Speaker 3>The ideas that they're trying to advance</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't work.</v>

1082
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:30.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a plethora of,</v>

1083
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:34.370
<v Speaker 3>with a century of evidence that central </v>
<v Speaker 3>planning will weaken.</v>

1084
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Societies will cause or will cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

1085
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.570
<v Speaker 3>Civilized chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization,</v>

1086
00:54:39.571 --> 00:54:42.900
<v Speaker 3>chaos will not create wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will cause debt.</v>

1087
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:45.900
<v Speaker 3>So what still motivates them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think part of it is just,</v>

1088
00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.060
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually complexity.</v>

1089
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like I've been thinking about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's easy.</v>

1090
00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:55.740
<v Speaker 3>It's relatively straightforward to </v>
<v Speaker 3>identify pathology on the right,</v>

1091
00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.690
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And basically you,</v>

1092
00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:02.370
<v Speaker 3>you look at claims of racial superiority</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the right wing identity,</v>

1093
00:55:02.371 --> 00:55:05.010
<v Speaker 3>politics types who were making claims of</v>
<v Speaker 3>racial superiority.</v>

1094
00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Everyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1095
00:55:05.851 --> 00:55:10.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wandering down the Nazi pathway </v>

1096
00:55:10.851 --> 00:55:11.040
<v Speaker 3>and that's unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And virtually everyone,</v>

1097
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:14.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>99 percent of people agree that that's a</v>

1098
00:55:14.071 --> 00:55:16.170
<v Speaker 3>bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on the left,</v>

1099
00:55:16.171 --> 00:55:21.171
<v Speaker 3>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's clear that some </v>

1100
00:55:21.171 --> 00:55:24.560
<v Speaker 3>concatenation of leftist policies when </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken to extreme producer catastrophe,</v>

1101
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:25.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1102
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:28.920
<v Speaker 3>But it's not just the economic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the cultural too.</v>

1103
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is it's not that easy to</v>

1104
00:55:31.711 --> 00:55:35.880
<v Speaker 3>point to which policies you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you read the Gulag archipelago,</v>

1105
00:55:35.881 --> 00:55:38.760
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social units and his work on prison camp</v>

1106
00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:43.761
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does a really good job of detailing </v>

1107
00:55:43.761 --> 00:55:47.391
<v Speaker 3>out the relationship between the Utopian</v>
<v Speaker 3>policies of the Lennon nests and the </v>

1108
00:55:47.391 --> 00:55:49.020
<v Speaker 3>catastrophes that have occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not simple.</v>

1109
00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.730
<v Speaker 3>You can't point to one thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1110
00:55:50.731 --> 00:55:55.731
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's like a racial superiority </v>

1111
00:55:55.731 --> 00:55:55.731
<v Speaker 3>charger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because,</v>

1112
00:55:55.731 --> 00:55:57.900
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to foster inclusion of oppressed</v>

1113
00:55:57.901 --> 00:55:59.670
<v Speaker 3>group who could be against that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1114
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we want to,</v>

1115
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:02.790
<v Speaker 3>we want to level the playing field will </v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

1116
00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:04.500
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well exactly.</v>

1117
00:56:04.501 --> 00:56:09.501
<v Speaker 3>And so in isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each of these ideas not only sounds </v>

1118
00:56:09.501 --> 00:56:11.670
<v Speaker 3>plausible but sounds positively </v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial,</v>

1119
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:16.850
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is is that you put a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of them together and somehow </v>

1120
00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:19.140
<v Speaker 3>things tilt in a direction that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1121
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:20.820
<v Speaker 3>really terrible.</v>

1122
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:21.840
<v Speaker 3>But that isn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

1123
00:56:21.841 --> 00:56:24.370
<v Speaker 3>this is the other part of it that I try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to dive into.</v>

1124
00:56:24.371 --> 00:56:27.300
<v Speaker 3>I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I do my speeches on campuses,</v>

1125
00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:29.980
<v Speaker 3>I asked a series of five questions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first question is,</v>

1126
00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:35.220
<v Speaker 3>are people good or bad by nature?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Neo Marxists will get in front of a </v>

1127
00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:37.510
<v Speaker 3>mic and I have these videos that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>

1128
00:56:37.511 --> 00:56:39.870
<v Speaker 3>15 million views where they'll try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>argue me.</v>

1129
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:42.160
<v Speaker 3>That argued to me that people are are </v>
<v Speaker 3>good by nature.</v>

1130
00:56:42.161 --> 00:56:44.440
<v Speaker 3>It's just the social construct that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes them bad.</v>

1131
00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:46.870
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the big problems is </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely,</v>

1132
00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:49.510
<v Speaker 3>but you're the expert here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1133
00:56:49.511 --> 00:56:52.870
<v Speaker 3>you've been doing this for decades and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have plethora of research.</v>

1134
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:58.200
<v Speaker 3>My argument is always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then why do we have to teach </v>

1135
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.151
<v Speaker 3>goodness to our youth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have to tell young people to </v>

1136
00:57:00.151 --> 00:57:02.371
<v Speaker 3>stop crying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do young people pick their parents </v>

1137
00:57:02.371 --> 00:57:02.371
<v Speaker 3>against each other?</v>

1138
00:57:02.371 --> 00:57:02.371
<v Speaker 3>There?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were there ever taught that behavior?</v>

1139
00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.730
<v Speaker 3>Of course la even aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like evidence that aggression is a.</v>

1140
00:57:05.731 --> 00:57:07.730
<v Speaker 3>nate is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's.</v>

1141
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's overwhelming.</v>

1142
00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.640
<v Speaker 3>It's inclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We evolved from chimpanzees.</v>

1143
00:57:12.641 --> 00:57:13.630
<v Speaker 3>They go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1144
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1145
00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:14.710
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1146
00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:19.740
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the key things is how did </v>

1147
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:20.980
<v Speaker 3>the neo Marxist find any sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1148
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:26.220
<v Speaker 3>any sort of intellectual consistency </v>
<v Speaker 3>with believing that then they teach </v>

1149
00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:30.691
<v Speaker 3>young people that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is all just a flawed social </v>

1150
00:57:30.691 --> 00:57:33.181
<v Speaker 3>construct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're actually good people by </v>

1151
00:57:33.181 --> 00:57:33.181
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not aggressive.</v>

1152
00:57:33.181 --> 00:57:36.510
<v Speaker 3>We're not prejudiced in any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a compelling story because it's </v>

1153
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.780
<v Speaker 3>half the true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1154
00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:41.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the reason that human endeavor </v>

1155
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.920
<v Speaker 3>is pathologized is because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical element to social </v>

1156
00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.521
<v Speaker 3>organization and so you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well people are basically good and </v>

1157
00:57:50.521 --> 00:57:55.030
<v Speaker 3>culture makes them bad and you can tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>a good story using those axioms.</v>

1158
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:56.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can reverse it and you can say no,</v>

1159
00:57:56.711 --> 00:58:01.711
<v Speaker 3>people are basically like uncivilized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>barbaric as individuals and that only </v>

1160
00:58:01.711 --> 00:58:04.420
<v Speaker 3>society makes them good to the degree </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're good.</v>

1161
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:06.700
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference between Hobbes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rousseau,</v>

1162
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:08.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because Russo would argue for the former</v>

1163
00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:12.610
<v Speaker 3>and hobbs for the ladder and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a very strong case for both.</v>

1164
00:58:12.611 --> 00:58:17.611
<v Speaker 3>And because the case is compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't necessarily hear the other </v>

1165
00:58:17.611 --> 00:58:17.611
<v Speaker 3>side of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1166
00:58:17.611 --> 00:58:18.160
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

1167
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:22.030
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing about ideologies is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they tend to tell half the story in</v>

1168
00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:27.031
<v Speaker 3>a compelling way and I mean it's also </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a nice story if you're a naive </v>

1169
00:58:27.031 --> 00:58:28.150
<v Speaker 3>person because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1170
00:58:28.151 --> 00:58:30.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm a good person and everybody else I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know is good.</v>

1171
00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:33.310
<v Speaker 3>That must come from somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really interesting you say that.</v>

1172
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:38.400
<v Speaker 3>So we are at Ucla and this is a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting thing and there was a black </v>

1173
00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:38.430
<v Speaker 3>woman that said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>candace islands,</v>

1174
00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.790
<v Speaker 3>I think you're a white supremacist.</v>

1175
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:41.200
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another black woman.</v>

1176
00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:42.970
<v Speaker 3>And I asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1177
00:58:42.971 --> 00:58:44.170
<v Speaker 3>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you a racist?</v>

1178
00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:45.150
<v Speaker 3>Are you racist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1179
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then where's the line?</v>

1180
00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:49.330
<v Speaker 3>Where does one stop becoming racist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're not.</v>

1181
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1182
00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:51.700
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be saying this if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't.</v>

1183
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 3>So what do I have to do to be more like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>

1184
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like everyone else has a horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>person except me.</v>

1185
00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1186
00:58:57.341 --> 00:58:59.410
<v Speaker 3>it's that kind of narcissism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>self centerdness.</v>

1187
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:02.200
<v Speaker 3>There's a great quote by Dennis prager </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he said,</v>

1188
00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:04.660
<v Speaker 3>growing up in the 19 seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties,</v>

1189
00:59:04.661 --> 00:59:09.070
<v Speaker 3>we taught our youth that they were the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem in America was a good thing.</v>

1190
00:59:09.071 --> 00:59:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Now it's the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's that America is the problem and</v>

1191
00:59:12.521 --> 00:59:17.521
<v Speaker 3>you're the greatest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the most impactful analysis </v>

1192
00:59:17.521 --> 00:59:20.080
<v Speaker 3>you ever made was kind of something Carl</v>
<v Speaker 3>June said is,</v>

1193
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:21.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>treat others the way,</v>

1194
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:26.080
<v Speaker 3>want to be treated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that you don't always want to be </v>

1195
00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:26.080
<v Speaker 3>treated with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1196
00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:26.900
<v Speaker 3>ubiquitous love and kindness.</v>

1197
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:31.640
<v Speaker 3>You want to be sometimes have discipline</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and let lot.</v>

1198
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:36.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I've learned as a </v>

1199
00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:36.730
<v Speaker 3>clinician while in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

1200
00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:38.900
<v Speaker 3>as a private person for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we outsource our sanity.</v>

1201
00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:41.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the psychoanalysts believed,</v>

1202
00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:46.451
<v Speaker 3>and most psychologists believe that your</v>
<v Speaker 3>sanity is sort of something you carry </v>

1203
00:59:46.451 --> 00:59:46.451
<v Speaker 3>around in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your ego,</v>

1204
00:59:46.451 --> 00:59:49.620
<v Speaker 3>in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're saying it's because your,</v>

1205
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:53.180
<v Speaker 3>your psyche as well structured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's actually not true.</v>

1206
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:55.130
<v Speaker 3>It's true to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1207
00:59:55.310 --> 01:00:00.310
<v Speaker 3>but what's more true is that the way you</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay sane is by knowing how to behave in</v>

1208
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:04.910
<v Speaker 3>a manner that makes you sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 3>acceptable so that other people will put</v>

1209
01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:08.180
<v Speaker 3>up with you and then you surround </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself with other people and hopefully</v>

1210
01:00:08.181 --> 01:00:13.181
<v Speaker 3>they're doing reasonably well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every time you do something stupid </v>

1211
01:00:13.181 --> 01:00:13.940
<v Speaker 3>they slap you on the side of the head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1212
01:00:13.941 --> 01:00:18.941
<v Speaker 3>either fairly gruffly or subtly by </v>
<v Speaker 3>raising an eyebrow or failing to listen </v>

1213
01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:24.461
<v Speaker 3>to you or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not phoning you to go out for a beer on </v>

1214
01:00:24.461 --> 01:00:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Friday night because then you change </v>
<v Speaker 3>your behavior a little bit.</v>

1215
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.270
<v Speaker 3>You reflect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

1216
01:00:26.271 --> 01:00:31.271
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to do something different while </v>

1217
01:00:31.271 --> 01:00:31.271
<v Speaker 3>in you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're lucky,</v>

1218
01:00:31.271 --> 01:00:33.521
<v Speaker 3>you have 20 people around you that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>always tapping you and telling you when </v>

1219
01:00:33.521 --> 01:00:37.450
<v Speaker 3>you're funny and witty and interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you're boring and stupid or </v>

1220
01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:37.450
<v Speaker 3>more that or less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1221
01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:37.880
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1222
01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:39.900
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you.</v>

1223
01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.000
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social structure plays a key role in</v>

1224
01:00:44.001 --> 01:00:46.820
<v Speaker 3>maintaining individuals sanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that.</v>

1225
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:48.770
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to switch this a little bit.</v>

1226
01:00:48.771 --> 01:00:51.410
<v Speaker 3>I want to get back to some things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are more specific to you,</v>

1227
01:00:51.411 --> 01:00:56.411
<v Speaker 3>so let's talk about your plans for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization over the next couple of </v>

1228
01:00:57.830 --> 01:00:59.720
<v Speaker 3>years and your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1229
01:00:59.721 --> 01:01:01.850
<v Speaker 3>because a critic might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1230
01:01:01.851 --> 01:01:03.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're complaining about activism on the</v>

1231
01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:08.621
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here you are engaging in activism </v>

1232
01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:08.621
<v Speaker 3>and who cares if it's on the right or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left.</v>

1233
01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:12.170
<v Speaker 3>It's still activism and that carries </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it all the problems of activism.</v>

1234
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:16.910
<v Speaker 3>So I'd like you to address that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also then to say where you're headed</v>

1235
01:01:16.911 --> 01:01:19.880
<v Speaker 3>and how you expect to get there and why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1236
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:23.060
<v Speaker 3>So first I would say we have to reclaim </v>
<v Speaker 3>the term activism.</v>

1237
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:27.170
<v Speaker 3>Activism for the right ideas is virtuous</v>
<v Speaker 3>and correct and always has been,</v>

1238
01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:30.220
<v Speaker 3>I think throughout Western civilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're on the side now we're,</v>

1239
01:01:30.221 --> 01:01:33.950
<v Speaker 3>we're fighting for intellectual and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological diversity and free speech.</v>

1240
01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:38.150
<v Speaker 3>Not Activism does not necessarily mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to storm the president's office</v>

1241
01:01:38.151 --> 01:01:43.151
<v Speaker 3>or defy the rules that be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does mean you try to be </v>

1242
01:01:43.151 --> 01:01:46.660
<v Speaker 3>disruptive on campus wherever necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're not doing what the </v>

1243
01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:51.971
<v Speaker 3>left does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is trying to suppress someone </v>

1244
01:01:51.971 --> 01:01:52.460
<v Speaker 3>else's rights to speech or try to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1245
01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:55.190
<v Speaker 3>destroy private property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll give you a great example.</v>

1246
01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Me going to UC Berkeley with Dave Rubin </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Candice Owens.</v>

1247
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:59.330
<v Speaker 3>That's a form of activism.</v>

1248
01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:02.750
<v Speaker 3>We were welcomed by our group there on </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus.</v>

1249
01:02:02.751 --> 01:02:05.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm the young Republican group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was petitions trying to get us</v>

1250
01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:08.300
<v Speaker 3>off campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an immense hostility.</v>

1251
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:10.310
<v Speaker 3>The administration did not want us </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1252
01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:13.370
<v Speaker 3>We had to pay thousands of dollars for </v>
<v Speaker 3>security fees and for police.</v>

1253
01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That host security fee thing.</v>

1254
01:02:15.201 --> 01:02:17.330
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's extraordinarily cumbersome.</v>

1255
01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:19.800
<v Speaker 3>It well and it essentially so </v>
<v Speaker 3>underhanded.</v>

1256
01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:24.801
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so unbelievably underhand and so </v>

1257
01:02:24.801 --> 01:02:27.351
<v Speaker 3>there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an interesting distinction here </v>

1258
01:02:27.351 --> 01:02:27.351
<v Speaker 3>that I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make an.</v>

1259
01:02:27.351 --> 01:02:30.590
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to get your analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to deviate too much from </v>

1260
01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:32.661
<v Speaker 3>your question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for doing this for the years I've </v>

1261
01:02:32.661 --> 01:02:32.661
<v Speaker 3>done this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost daily.</v>

1262
01:02:32.661 --> 01:02:34.530
<v Speaker 3>One of our groups will get disinvited </v>
<v Speaker 3>from campus,</v>

1263
01:02:34.531 --> 01:02:36.180
<v Speaker 3>had their funding cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1264
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:41.240
<v Speaker 3>I will get shouted down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire alarms polled windows smashed </v>

1265
01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.510
<v Speaker 3>daily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conservatives will try to get disinvited</v>

1266
01:02:42.511 --> 01:02:43.170
<v Speaker 3>from campus.</v>

1267
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.380
<v Speaker 3>I've never once seen a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>student,</v>

1268
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:48.330
<v Speaker 3>a student group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a conservative group,</v>

1269
01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:53.331
<v Speaker 3>or considered professor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to disinvite or try to prevent a </v>

1270
01:02:53.331 --> 01:02:53.331
<v Speaker 3>liberal from coming on campus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not once,</v>

1271
01:02:53.331 --> 01:02:57.950
<v Speaker 3>not once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have here the left being the </v>

1272
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:58.320
<v Speaker 3>predominant political viewpoint on </v>
<v Speaker 3>college campuses,</v>

1273
01:02:58.321 --> 01:03:03.321
<v Speaker 3>a monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet they do everything they can to </v>

1274
01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:05.601
<v Speaker 3>prevent anyone else from challenging </v>
<v Speaker 3>that viewpoint and we conservatives are </v>

1275
01:03:05.601 --> 01:03:09.171
<v Speaker 3>in the political minority and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly allow the free discussion and </v>

1276
01:03:09.171 --> 01:03:10.230
<v Speaker 3>free flow of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to answer your question,</v>

1277
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:15.500
<v Speaker 3>at least from the activism standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone would be a critic of they </v>

1278
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:15.500
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well Charlie,</v>

1279
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:15.500
<v Speaker 3>you're just doing the left is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1280
01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:18.870
<v Speaker 3>I will defend a socialist right to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong to the death.</v>

1281
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:22.940
<v Speaker 3>I think that free speech and dialog </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion is,</v>

1282
01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:24.180
<v Speaker 3>is the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1283
01:03:24.181 --> 01:03:28.650
<v Speaker 3>I do think to the marketplace of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>civil behavior is unbelievably useful.</v>

1284
01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:33.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I've experienced </v>

1285
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:36.471
<v Speaker 3>over the last couple of years is that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep my head and I stay reasonable in </v>

1286
01:03:38.551 --> 01:03:42.270
<v Speaker 3>the face of provocation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which can be very severe at times,</v>

1287
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:43.920
<v Speaker 3>fire alarms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being pulled in,</v>

1288
01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:45.510
<v Speaker 3>people blowing air horns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1289
01:03:45.511 --> 01:03:49.590
<v Speaker 3>a foot away from me and getting in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>face in a serious way.</v>

1290
01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:53.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm as I'm leaving places that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking and carrying a garage which is,</v>

1291
01:03:53.851 --> 01:03:58.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really pushing it a bit too far as far </v>

1292
01:03:58.851 --> 01:04:00.770
<v Speaker 3>as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And pounding on windows and doors and </v>

1293
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:00.770
<v Speaker 3>creating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

1294
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:01.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's primal.</v>

1295
01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:07.220
<v Speaker 3>A good thing to really teach your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your participants is that there remain </v>

1296
01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:13.580
<v Speaker 3>civil and not to engage in acts that </v>
<v Speaker 3>discredit them regardless of the </v>

1297
01:04:14.011 --> 01:04:17.190
<v Speaker 3>provocation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's no firearm alarm polling,</v>

1298
01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:22.520
<v Speaker 3>that's never yelling people down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Civil dialogue and proper behave and we </v>

1299
01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.430
<v Speaker 3>win converts by doing that.</v>

1300
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:25.040
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1301
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:27.050
<v Speaker 3>and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll send you a couple of videos of,</v>

1302
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:30.390
<v Speaker 3>and I've taken a cue from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way you handled that BBC interview,</v>

1303
01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.370
<v Speaker 3>which went Shayla for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1304
01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.120
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1305
01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.270
<v Speaker 3>the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was extraordinary.</v>

1306
01:04:36.271 --> 01:04:39.450
<v Speaker 3>You had every right to pull her tongue </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1307
01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:44.480
<v Speaker 3>She was being just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was almost impressively </v>

1308
01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.261
<v Speaker 3>ignorant what she was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet you remain so calm and so in control</v>

1309
01:04:48.391 --> 01:04:50.430
<v Speaker 3>and I think if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you had a right to do it,</v>

1310
01:04:50.431 --> 01:04:54.750
<v Speaker 3>if you would have went a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards the direction of Abrasiveness or</v>

1311
01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:57.450
<v Speaker 3>confrontational,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't have been as effective.</v>

1312
01:04:57.451 --> 01:04:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I learned something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1313
01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:04.120
<v Speaker 3>and this is something that's worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing is that just because you're </v>

1314
01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.610
<v Speaker 3>being attacked doesn't mean that's a bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1315
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:07.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for now,</v>

1316
01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:12.210
<v Speaker 3>let's say that I go and give a talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well two things can happen.</v>

1317
01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:17.420
<v Speaker 3>I can either give the talk and film that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and put it on youtube and then there's </v>

1318
01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:20.110
<v Speaker 3>the advantages of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I can go give the talk and be shouted</v>

1319
01:05:20.111 --> 01:05:25.111
<v Speaker 3>down by protestors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the ones at Queen's university </v>

1320
01:05:25.111 --> 01:05:26.190
<v Speaker 3>literally stormed the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that big storm,</v>

1321
01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:27.430
<v Speaker 3>this new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>handled it beautifully,</v>

1322
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:29.530
<v Speaker 3>and then you said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is exactly,</v>

1323
01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why we're doing what we're doing,</v>

1324
01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:33.940
<v Speaker 3>or something to that effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a couple of things.</v>

1325
01:05:33.941 --> 01:05:38.941
<v Speaker 3>The first thing is it's not such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible thing for people who are </v>

1326
01:05:38.941 --> 01:05:43.141
<v Speaker 3>unreasonable to manifest or </v>
<v Speaker 3>unreasonableness and then to have that </v>

1327
01:05:43.141 --> 01:05:44.200
<v Speaker 3>publicized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing.</v>

1328
01:05:44.201 --> 01:05:49.201
<v Speaker 3>We do a lot of it and the second thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is is that just so there's the event </v>

1329
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.190
<v Speaker 3>which would be the place that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking,</v>

1330
01:05:51.191 --> 01:05:54.220
<v Speaker 3>but then that's not the event because </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this is filmed.</v>

1331
01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:59.610
<v Speaker 3>The event could easily be in the two </v>
<v Speaker 3>months after it and so one of the ways </v>

1332
01:06:00.131 --> 01:06:05.131
<v Speaker 3>that you can keep your head in this sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of situation is to understand that it </v>

1333
01:06:05.131 --> 01:06:09.211
<v Speaker 3>isn't obvious when things are unfolding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's good and what isn't and if you </v>

1334
01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.110
<v Speaker 3>like that interview.</v>

1335
01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1336
01:06:12.071 --> 01:06:17.071
<v Speaker 3>my sense of the interview was that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were going to just cut it to five </v>

1337
01:06:17.071 --> 01:06:20.971
<v Speaker 3>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what they broadcast and do </v>

1338
01:06:20.971 --> 01:06:20.971
<v Speaker 3>everything they could to make me look </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a fool,</v>

1339
01:06:20.971 --> 01:06:25.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they put the whole thing up because </v>

1340
01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:27.220
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have any idea what happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that interview.</v>

1341
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:32.670
<v Speaker 3>No one knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like channel four news that </v>

1342
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.670
<v Speaker 3>that was a disaster and they put it up </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways.</v>

1343
01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:37.860
<v Speaker 3>They thought the interview went fine and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then were absolutely shocked by the </v>

1344
01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:41.821
<v Speaker 3>public response,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by that time it was too late to </v>

1345
01:06:41.821 --> 01:06:44.461
<v Speaker 3>bring it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my point is that it's a lot easier </v>

1346
01:06:44.461 --> 01:06:47.821
<v Speaker 3>to keep your head if you don't jump to </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusions about what's happening in </v>

1347
01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:51.610
<v Speaker 3>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being what's actually happening.</v>

1348
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:54.500
<v Speaker 3>So like it's a long game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The short case,</v>

1349
01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.410
<v Speaker 3>so interesting you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went to the,</v>

1350
01:06:56.490 --> 01:07:00.770
<v Speaker 3>the anti-gun march in Washington DC and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I went and challenged some of these anti</v>

1351
01:07:00.771 --> 01:07:05.771
<v Speaker 3>gun protestors and I had someone follow </v>
<v Speaker 3>me around with a camera and I had four </v>

1352
01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:06.160
<v Speaker 3>hours of discussions with people.</v>

1353
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:09.460
<v Speaker 3>There was one discussion that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even remember with a woman.</v>

1354
01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:14.490
<v Speaker 3>It was about second amendment rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We put it up nine and a half million </v>

1355
01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:18.211
<v Speaker 3>views and I couldn't understand what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was and she was kind of getting very </v>

1356
01:07:18.211 --> 01:07:18.460
<v Speaker 3>abrasive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was saying such crazy things,</v>

1357
01:07:18.461 --> 01:07:20.770
<v Speaker 3>but I must've struck a chord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so interesting you say that,</v>

1358
01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:24.720
<v Speaker 3>that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two realities and really there's</v>

1359
01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:29.730
<v Speaker 3>one where you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's how it's perceived when you're </v>

1360
01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:30.550
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how people feel and how it sounds,</v>

1361
01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:31.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Echo,</v>

1362
01:07:31.391 --> 01:07:36.391
<v Speaker 3>location wise and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also the people that watch it when </v>

1363
01:07:36.391 --> 01:07:38.941
<v Speaker 3>you cut it up or the video afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in some ways is even more </v>

1364
01:07:38.941 --> 01:07:38.941
<v Speaker 3>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1365
01:07:38.941 --> 01:07:38.941
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1366
01:07:38.941 --> 01:07:39.110
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1367
01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:40.750
<v Speaker 3>it is more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

1368
01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:46.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is also why I think it's so useful </v>

1369
01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:46.050
<v Speaker 3>just to say what you think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1370
01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:49.060
<v Speaker 3>in a more fundamental way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the ideas that has guided</v>

1371
01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:52.270
<v Speaker 3>me in doing what I've been doing is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wanted,</v>

1372
01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.250
<v Speaker 3>you want to let go of the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your actions and say what you believe</v>

1373
01:07:57.251 --> 01:07:57.880
<v Speaker 3>to be true.</v>

1374
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean you should be a full </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it or that you should say </v>

1375
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.820
<v Speaker 3>everything all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reason that you.</v>

1376
01:08:05.050 --> 01:08:07.390
<v Speaker 3>This is this fundamental hallmark of </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith.</v>

1377
01:08:07.391 --> 01:08:12.391
<v Speaker 3>I believe in faith in the truest sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the belief that truthful speech </v>

1378
01:08:13.661 --> 01:08:18.661
<v Speaker 3>redeemed the world and that's a weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith because what that means is that </v>

1379
01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:23.710
<v Speaker 3>let's say you say some things and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing your best to be truthful and you </v>

1380
01:08:23.710 --> 01:08:23.900
<v Speaker 3>get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Think,</v>

1381
01:08:23.901 --> 01:08:25.130
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't work.</v>

1382
01:08:25.131 --> 01:08:30.131
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually you don't know whether or not </v>

1383
01:08:30.131 --> 01:08:31.370
<v Speaker 3>it worked because you can't calculate </v>
<v Speaker 3>the full consequences of your action.</v>

1384
01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.400
<v Speaker 3>And so it could be that it worked just </v>
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

1385
01:08:34.401 --> 01:08:39.401
<v Speaker 3>but it was painful in the short term and</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of things that worked fine or </v>

1386
01:08:39.401 --> 01:08:41.330
<v Speaker 3>painful in the short term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there is a leap of faith that has</v>

1387
01:08:41.331 --> 01:08:41.900
<v Speaker 3>to be made.</v>

1388
01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:46.900
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biblical corpus is so powerful in part </v>

1389
01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.771
<v Speaker 3>is because it's predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental assumption that truthful </v>

1390
01:08:50.771 --> 01:08:54.410
<v Speaker 3>speech turns the potential of of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

1391
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:59.240
<v Speaker 3>The potential is but you free well that </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

1392
01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:01.130
<v Speaker 3>which is who the hell would ever believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1393
01:09:01.131 --> 01:09:02.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that isn't what,</v>

1394
01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:07.270
<v Speaker 3>that isn't how it looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it looks like is that the truth </v>

1395
01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:07.420
<v Speaker 3>will get you in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1396
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:09.980
<v Speaker 3>what happens is it gets you in trouble </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the short term and,</v>

1397
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:13.130
<v Speaker 3>and freeze you in the and other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the medium to longterm.</v>

1398
01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:14.990
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1399
01:09:14.991 --> 01:09:17.480
<v Speaker 3>so back to your plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So where are you headed in the future?</v>

1400
01:09:17.481 --> 01:09:19.160
<v Speaker 3>So the organization is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1401
01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.350
<v Speaker 3>is growing rather dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's quite exciting.</v>

1402
01:09:21.351 --> 01:09:23.540
<v Speaker 3>So we have what's called vision 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

1403
01:09:23.541 --> 01:09:27.290
<v Speaker 3>We want to help move youth sentiment </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards free enterprise and free speech,</v>

1404
01:09:27.291 --> 01:09:29.930
<v Speaker 3>kind of those general issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 points by 2020.</v>

1405
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.720
<v Speaker 3>So we're ramping up our organization </v>
<v Speaker 3>dramatically,</v>

1406
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:34.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hopefully a $20,000,000</v>

1407
01:09:34.821 --> 01:09:36.500
<v Speaker 3>budget and the higher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1408
01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.870
<v Speaker 3>over 200 people on staff across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>states,</v>

1409
01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:40.300
<v Speaker 3>which will be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1410
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:43.560
<v Speaker 3>a monumental accomplishment to able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do is near field staffers.</v>

1411
01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:48.580
<v Speaker 3>These are organizers and in some ways my</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole perspective from the very </v>

1412
01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.020
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called ourselves the move on.org</v>

1413
01:09:50.021 --> 01:09:55.021
<v Speaker 3>or the right now move on.org</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a political social activism </v>

1414
01:09:55.021 --> 01:09:56.180
<v Speaker 3>organization based in the states for far</v>
<v Speaker 3>left wing causes.</v>

1415
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:57.530
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1416
01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:59.930
<v Speaker 3>And to this day with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what drives our organization.</v>

1417
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:03.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the left should have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>monopoly on grassroots activism and they</v>

1418
01:10:03.381 --> 01:10:05.540
<v Speaker 3>almost always have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1419
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.600
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason for that lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest is that we have a builtin </v>

1420
01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.000
<v Speaker 3>counterrevolution bring on our college </v>
<v Speaker 3>campuses,</v>

1421
01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:18.001
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>students that are being punished for </v>

1422
01:10:18.001 --> 01:10:19.991
<v Speaker 3>thinking differently and there is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>organic uprising of students that are </v>

1423
01:10:19.991 --> 01:10:21.890
<v Speaker 3>joining our organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attending our events,</v>

1424
01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:27.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>implementing leadership positions in </v>

1425
01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.940
<v Speaker 3>student government and other places </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're fed up,</v>

1426
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:33.970
<v Speaker 3>they've had enough and I can't tell what</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be really good if it for about </v>

1427
01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:37.931
<v Speaker 3>15 years it wasn't the most left leaning</v>
<v Speaker 3>radicals who controlled the student </v>

1428
01:10:37.931 --> 01:10:39.020
<v Speaker 3>newspapers and the student union.</v>

1429
01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:42.130
<v Speaker 3>So it's been like that since I went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>college back in the 19 nineties,</v>

1430
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.920
<v Speaker 3>1972.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The programming we're implementing,</v>

1431
01:10:44.921 --> 01:10:49.921
<v Speaker 3>it is encouraging our students to run </v>
<v Speaker 3>for student leadership on campus rather </v>

1432
01:10:49.921 --> 01:10:49.950
<v Speaker 3>successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1433
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot that we can show to </v>

1434
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:55.000
<v Speaker 3>actually change the campus culture and </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate by doing so that,</v>

1435
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.890
<v Speaker 3>that these student unions aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>divesting from fossil fuels,</v>

1436
01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:03.040
<v Speaker 3>fuels are saying there's no such thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>as genders or just astonishingly </v>

1437
01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:03.590
<v Speaker 3>radical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1438
01:11:03.591 --> 01:11:06.680
<v Speaker 3>sentiments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so as an organization more broadly,</v>

1439
01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:07.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1440
01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.560
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of different ways we </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure success.</v>

1441
01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Things I can talk about publicly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things I can't talk about publicly,</v>

1442
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:14.550
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>

1443
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:19.940
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are very concerned about the current </v>

1444
01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:22.980
<v Speaker 2>trajectory of the west and I believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said this many times,</v>

1445
01:11:22.981 --> 01:11:24.840
<v Speaker 2>I believe the greatest threat to Western</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

1446
01:11:24.841 --> 01:11:29.841
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening on American college </v>

1447
01:11:29.841 --> 01:11:29.841
<v Speaker 2>campuses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1448
01:11:29.841 --> 01:11:31.080
<v Speaker 2>it's even more so than any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>geopolitical flow.</v>

1449
01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:34.620
<v Speaker 2>It's more so than what's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington dc because more than anything</v>

1450
01:11:34.621 --> 01:11:39.621
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a generation that has been </v>

1451
01:11:39.621 --> 01:11:39.780
<v Speaker 2>inculcated to believe that America is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>

1452
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Everything about the West is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1453
01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:45.210
<v Speaker 2>the thing is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America is a mistake and so is the west,</v>

1454
01:11:45.211 --> 01:11:47.190
<v Speaker 2>but compared to other mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty damn.</v>

1455
01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's life is suffering.</v>

1456
01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:52.170
<v Speaker 2>It's finding the words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's finding the best,</v>

1457
01:11:52.171 --> 01:11:55.350
<v Speaker 2>worst model that is possible and what so</v>
<v Speaker 2>divine.</v>

1458
01:11:55.351 --> 01:11:58.500
<v Speaker 2>I think about what the founding fathers </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized is they said,</v>

1459
01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:02.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people suck that systems get corrupted.</v>

1460
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Civilizations are ruined.</v>

1461
01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Things fall apart essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do we decentralize that to the </v>

1462
01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:14.271
<v Speaker 2>furthest extent so that we can have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hedge against the inevitability of human</v>

1463
01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:17.090
<v Speaker 2>agree with you completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that that was the.</v>

1464
01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:19.800
<v Speaker 2>That's the fundamental stroke of genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't.</v>

1465
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:24.950
<v Speaker 2>How can we bring about utopia is how can</v>
<v Speaker 2>we design a system that idiots can't </v>

1466
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:26.340
<v Speaker 2>screw up too badly given that we're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiots?</v>

1467
01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1468
01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.510
<v Speaker 2>That's real wisdom and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1469
01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.710
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real humility to it is.</v>

1470
01:12:31.711 --> 01:12:33.360
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real humility as well.</v>

1471
01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:38.420
<v Speaker 2>It means that you don't overreach </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself is that you're not presuming </v>

1472
01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.930
<v Speaker 2>that you know enough to bring about </v>
<v Speaker 2>heaven on earth,</v>

1473
01:12:39.931 --> 01:12:42.960
<v Speaker 2>but that maybe you can stave off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst excesses of hell.</v>

1474
01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:48.050
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what we teach our students and </v>

1475
01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:50.481
<v Speaker 2>what's not taught in our schools is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American founding was the first </v>

1476
01:12:50.481 --> 01:12:54.171
<v Speaker 2>political revolution where the victors </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily gave up political power </v>

1477
01:12:54.171 --> 01:12:54.171
<v Speaker 2>wash.</v>

1478
01:12:54.171 --> 01:12:58.730
<v Speaker 2>It could have been the Washingtonian </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamiltonian Jeffersonian monarchy that </v>

1479
01:12:58.730 --> 01:12:59.580
<v Speaker 2>rule America for the next 200 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have done quite well,</v>

1480
01:12:59.790 --> 01:13:04.790
<v Speaker 2>rich and natural resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unaccompanied land that they could have </v>

1481
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:08.001
<v Speaker 2>took over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what was so amazing to them and </v>

1482
01:13:08.001 --> 01:13:08.001
<v Speaker 2>their motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe were pure,</v>

1483
01:13:08.001 --> 01:13:10.440
<v Speaker 2>is that they wanted to try something </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely and totally different.</v>

1484
01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.960
<v Speaker 2>They did not want to embrace that which </v>
<v Speaker 2>they rebelled against,</v>

1485
01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.200
<v Speaker 2>and as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the humility for them to implement a </v>

1486
01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:18.200
<v Speaker 2>system has been replicated all </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the west.</v>

1487
01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea of natural rights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>decentralized government in democratic </v>

1488
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.790
<v Speaker 2>elections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a constitutional republic.</v>

1489
01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:24.720
<v Speaker 2>It's what built Western civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spain,</v>

1490
01:13:24.721 --> 01:13:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Portugal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>France,</v>

1491
01:13:25.351 --> 01:13:30.351
<v Speaker 2>Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all have some form of that </v>

1492
01:13:30.351 --> 01:13:30.351
<v Speaker 2>governance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little differences here and there.</v>

1493
01:13:30.351 --> 01:13:31.920
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now that's being challenged.</v>

1494
01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:37.220
<v Speaker 2>That wealth of prosperity and standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>of living increase and human rights </v>

1495
01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.320
<v Speaker 2>accomplishments is now being in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>university center.</v>

1496
01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:39.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>

1497
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:42.390
<v Speaker 2>This is all wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all a racist,</v>

1498
01:13:42.391 --> 01:13:47.391
<v Speaker 2>homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigoted construct designed to benefit </v>

1499
01:13:47.391 --> 01:13:50.121
<v Speaker 2>white males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a patriarchy must uproot the </v>

1500
01:13:50.121 --> 01:13:50.121
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so more broadly,</v>

1501
01:13:50.121 --> 01:13:55.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are unbelievably privileged and </v>

1502
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.880
<v Speaker 2>blessed to live in Western civilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>even more specifically as an American.</v>

1503
01:13:56.881 --> 01:14:01.881
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky to live in America and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to fight every single day through </v>

1504
01:14:01.881 --> 01:14:06.471
<v Speaker 2>the conduits and the vehicles that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>created to try to save this experiment </v>

1505
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:08.640
<v Speaker 2>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1506
01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the move that makes that something other</v>

1507
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:16.420
<v Speaker 3>than Jingoistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>patriotism is the move that says this is</v>

1508
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:19.150
<v Speaker 3>all good fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that and,</v>

1509
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:24.270
<v Speaker 3>and that we should be grateful for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that our moral obligation is to </v>

1510
01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.910
<v Speaker 3>sustain that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take up the responsibility,</v>

1511
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.700
<v Speaker 3>ability necessary to sustain that and to</v>
<v Speaker 3>improve it.</v>

1512
01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:33.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not ours by birthright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

1513
01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:35.140
<v Speaker 3>not by any means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is also why,</v>

1514
01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:35.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1515
01:14:35.831 --> 01:14:37.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm loath to,</v>

1516
01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:43.970
<v Speaker 3>this is why I have trouble with right </v>
<v Speaker 3>wing identitarianism because the right </v>

1517
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:47.421
<v Speaker 3>wing identitarian tend to take to </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves the positive attributes of </v>

1518
01:14:47.421 --> 01:14:51.381
<v Speaker 3>their states without having to do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>work necessary to place themselves among</v>

1519
01:14:51.961 --> 01:14:54.570
<v Speaker 3>the people who were the actual founders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without a doubt.</v>

1520
01:14:54.610 --> 01:14:57.450
<v Speaker 3>So it's identity politics or the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1521
01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:59.070
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1522
01:14:59.071 --> 01:15:04.071
<v Speaker 3>so where can people learn more about </v>
<v Speaker 3>your organization so that they ignored </v>

1523
01:15:04.071 --> 01:15:07.550
<v Speaker 3>our website [inaudible] dot com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a massive conference coming up </v>

1524
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:08.680
<v Speaker 3>that I mentioned that we'd love to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1525
01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:12.420
<v Speaker 3>of course have you keynote and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll say that I don't know if I said</v>

1526
01:15:12.421 --> 01:15:13.530
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I repeat myself,</v>

1527
01:15:13.531 --> 01:15:14.850
<v Speaker 3>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1528
01:15:14.851 --> 01:15:19.851
<v Speaker 3>I've seen you save people's lives and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've changed my own and you're the by </v>

1529
01:15:19.851 --> 01:15:24.171
<v Speaker 3>far the most requested speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guess the question I have for you </v>

1530
01:15:24.171 --> 01:15:25.230
<v Speaker 3>in the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the short time we have remaining,</v>

1531
01:15:25.231 --> 01:15:27.690
<v Speaker 3>I guess is um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you,</v>

1532
01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:32.720
<v Speaker 3>have you seen any of this visibility or </v>
<v Speaker 3>popularity or fame change you or at </v>

1533
01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.970
<v Speaker 3>least change your pattern or your style </v>
<v Speaker 3>of life or any of that?</v>

1534
01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:41.130
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's completely changed it in some way </v>

1535
01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:41.130
<v Speaker 3>somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>

1536
01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:44.100
<v Speaker 3>how do you keep order in this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's chaotic,</v>

1537
01:15:44.101 --> 01:15:46.140
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not very well,</v>

1538
01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:48.780
<v Speaker 3>I from the master of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure.</v>

1539
01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:49.650
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1540
01:15:49.651 --> 01:15:54.651
<v Speaker 3>so I have more and more people helping </v>
<v Speaker 3>me all the time and we've been fortunate</v>

1541
01:15:54.661 --> 01:15:59.661
<v Speaker 3>because we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning my family because we've gone </v>

1542
01:15:59.661 --> 01:16:02.841
<v Speaker 3>through this as a family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been fortunate that people who </v>

1543
01:16:02.841 --> 01:16:06.680
<v Speaker 3>have the expertise necessary to help us </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this have showed up at opportune </v>

1544
01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:10.551
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've had enough people around me </v>

1545
01:16:10.551 --> 01:16:13.071
<v Speaker 3>with their eyes open to help me point </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself in the right direction and Fal </v>

1546
01:16:13.071 --> 01:16:17.000
<v Speaker 3>myself that help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say what it's done to me </v>

1547
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.811
<v Speaker 3>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly is just to make me more careful </v>

1548
01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:27.440
<v Speaker 3>because the costs of mistakes are while </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cost of mistakes for me over the </v>

1549
01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.071
<v Speaker 3>last two years have been incredibly high</v>
<v Speaker 3>because precise and watching my every </v>

1550
01:16:31.071 --> 01:16:35.691
<v Speaker 3>move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including things that I've done in the </v>

1551
01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:37.761
<v Speaker 3>past to see if there's any credible </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence that I.</v>

1552
01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:42.940
<v Speaker 3>Many of the terrible things that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>would like me to be because it's a pain </v>

1553
01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:43.810
<v Speaker 3>in the neck for my leftist</v>

1554
01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:52.080
<v Speaker 3>opponents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say if I'm not a brute because </v>

1555
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:52.990
<v Speaker 3>then I have to be contended with </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

1556
01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:58.380
<v Speaker 3>And so everything I've said and done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been going over with a fine tooth </v>

1557
01:16:58.380 --> 01:16:59.290
<v Speaker 3>comb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And luckily so far that's worked out.</v>

1558
01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:00.250
<v Speaker 3>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1559
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:05.630
<v Speaker 3>that's grace of God and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so mostly it's made me more careful </v>

1560
01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:09.130
<v Speaker 3>and more awake and more nervous all at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time.</v>

1561
01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:11.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just I wanted to say that you've,</v>

1562
01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:16.380
<v Speaker 3>you've kept an unbelievable discipline </v>
<v Speaker 3>of consistency throughout your career </v>

1563
01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:18.920
<v Speaker 3>and what I always joke around and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that to you.</v>

1564
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in proper humility,</v>

1565
01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:23.520
<v Speaker 3>which you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1566
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:26.930
<v Speaker 3>few read enough 20th century history and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually tried to understand it,</v>

1567
01:17:26.931 --> 01:17:31.931
<v Speaker 3>that'll make you humble enough and </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you start thinking that if you </v>

1568
01:17:31.931 --> 01:17:32.000
<v Speaker 3>have any sense and you read that </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

1569
01:17:32.001 --> 01:17:37.001
<v Speaker 3>you don't read it as a victim and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't read it as the person that would </v>

1570
01:17:37.001 --> 01:17:37.001
<v Speaker 3>set things right.</v>

1571
01:17:37.001 --> 01:17:38.420
<v Speaker 3>You read it as a perpetrator and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1572
01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:41.040
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what people relate to it.</v>

1573
01:17:41.041 --> 01:17:42.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what really,</v>

1574
01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:44.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1575
01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:49.451
<v Speaker 3>open my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the stuff you said is imagined </v>

1576
01:17:49.451 --> 01:17:49.451
<v Speaker 3>being a prison guard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fitz Morris' imagined.</v>

1577
01:17:49.451 --> 01:17:50.720
<v Speaker 3>Enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1578
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Imagine benefiting from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1579
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:53.810
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you would.</v>

1580
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:55.530
<v Speaker 3>And you think you're such a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1581
01:17:55.531 --> 01:17:57.830
<v Speaker 3>You'd stand up to the SS if you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of them.</v>

1582
01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:00.470
<v Speaker 3>And as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real evil of Hitler is,</v>

1583
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.630
<v Speaker 3>he didn't even use the utility of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jews.</v>

1584
01:18:02.631 --> 01:18:07.631
<v Speaker 3>He tried to kill Morris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has Civilization was crushing around </v>

1585
01:18:07.631 --> 01:18:07.790
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sinister stuff.</v>

1586
01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:13.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would've made more sense to put in </v>

1587
01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:13.260
<v Speaker 3>the work camps to make rifles and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1588
01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:15.490
<v Speaker 3>and bombs instead he tried to kill more </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them and all that.</v>

1589
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:19.610
<v Speaker 3>That does seem to indicate that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental motivation was destruction.</v>

1590
01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:21.620
<v Speaker 3>That's regardless of the overlaying </v>
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

1591
01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.710
<v Speaker 3>which I think is a perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis.</v>

1592
01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:26.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say again,</v>

1593
01:18:26.361 --> 01:18:27.120
<v Speaker 3>the website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1594
01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.950
<v Speaker 3>It's a TP USA.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So TP USA.com,</v>

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.230

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1596
01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:36.260
<v Speaker 3>Charlie Kirk Eleven and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1597
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:38.850
<v Speaker 3>we're fighting for the ideas that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that created once.</v>

1598
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:40.580
<v Speaker 3>It would be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1599
01:18:40.581 --> 01:18:45.581
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to think hard about how a couple of </v>

1600
01:18:45.581 --> 01:18:46.670
<v Speaker 3>things that might be useful adjuncts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you guys have thought this through</v>

1601
01:18:46.671 --> 01:18:48.230
<v Speaker 3>to your organization is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1602
01:18:48.231 --> 01:18:53.231
<v Speaker 3>there are places like the Founder </v>
<v Speaker 3>Institute in California that are doing </v>

1603
01:18:53.231 --> 01:18:57.161
<v Speaker 3>everything they can to start to help </v>
<v Speaker 3>early stage entrepreneurs and it might </v>

1604
01:18:57.161 --> 01:18:59.060
<v Speaker 3>be really nice to make part of your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1605
01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:04.750
<v Speaker 3>your message,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the necessity for the people who are </v>

1606
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:06.650
<v Speaker 3>part of your organization to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make a life plan,</v>

1607
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:11.890
<v Speaker 3>to figure out how they're putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves together as individuals to </v>

1608
01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:12.950
<v Speaker 3>center the activism on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then to say,</v>

1609
01:19:12.951 --> 01:19:17.951
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to stand up and talk and speak </v>

1610
01:19:17.951 --> 01:19:21.010
<v Speaker 3>whenever you're right to do that or your</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to do that as being </v>

1611
01:19:21.010 --> 01:19:21.080
<v Speaker 3>interfered with.</v>

1612
01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:26.080
<v Speaker 3>But the fundamental thing that you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to concentrate on is putting your life </v>

1613
01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.290
<v Speaker 3>in order that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that keeps the Hubris at bay at least to</v>

1614
01:19:27.291 --> 01:19:32.291
<v Speaker 3>some degree that that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you have 1200 women coming </v>

1615
01:19:32.291 --> 01:19:32.300
<v Speaker 3>together in June,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's correct.</v>

1616
01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phoenix.</v>

1617
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's in Dallas.</v>

1618
01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:39.220
<v Speaker 3>That's in Dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you have an open invite to </v>

1619
01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:39.220
<v Speaker 3>everything and anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's curious that,</v>

1620
01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:39.830
<v Speaker 3>that'd be something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1621
01:19:39.831 --> 01:19:41.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in both of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1622
01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:46.530
<v Speaker 3>and I would like to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't spoken to enough to young </v>

1623
01:19:46.530 --> 01:19:49.331
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're doing a young men </v>

1624
01:19:49.331 --> 01:19:49.331
<v Speaker 3>summit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think next summer to,</v>

1625
01:19:49.331 --> 01:19:50.420
<v Speaker 3>of the design around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the young women is interesting.</v>

1626
01:19:50.421 --> 01:19:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1627
01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:55.760
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is extraordinarily hard to be a young</v>

1628
01:19:55.761 --> 01:20:00.761
<v Speaker 3>conservative on American college campus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a multiple of difficult to be a </v>

1629
01:20:00.761 --> 01:20:03.770
<v Speaker 3>young conservative woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an expectancy of leftism.</v>

1630
01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:07.190
<v Speaker 3>There is a hostility towards espousing </v>
<v Speaker 3>any sort of conservative</v>

1631
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.440
<v Speaker 2>and the gathering of young ladies </v>
<v Speaker 2>together in this,</v>

1632
01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:12.900
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a summit,</v>

1633
01:20:12.901 --> 01:20:14.320
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has grown dramatically.</v>

1634
01:20:14.321 --> 01:20:19.321
<v Speaker 2>We have 300,</v>
<v Speaker 2>800 and 1200 has been so useful and I'm </v>

1635
01:20:19.321 --> 01:20:23.001
<v Speaker 2>a very firm believer in um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender segregated education at times and</v>

1636
01:20:23.701 --> 01:20:25.380
<v Speaker 2>that's a horrible term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I mean?</v>

1637
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Essentially having women only events,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1638
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:30.780
<v Speaker 2>there's something quite special that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens and same with mental events.</v>

1639
01:20:30.781 --> 01:20:34.420
<v Speaker 2>That's where the fraternity and sorority</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure came across in North American.</v>

1640
01:20:34.421 --> 01:20:36.900
<v Speaker 2>And so we'd love to have you maybe take </v>
<v Speaker 2>a look at that.</v>

1641
01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that would be.</v>

1642
01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that and we can stay in touch </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

1643
01:20:41.641 --> 01:20:42.750
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1644
01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:47.751
<v Speaker 2>well thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should probably bring this to a </v>

1645
01:20:47.751 --> 01:20:47.751
<v Speaker 2>close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1646
01:20:47.751 --> 01:20:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Great honor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much for agreeing to know.</v>

1647
01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the greatest honors of my</v>

1648
01:20:49.981 --> 01:20:50.640
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1649
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:57.030
<v Speaker 1>The problem with wanting to be friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your child is that that's not good </v>

1650
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:58.990
<v Speaker 1>enough because as a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not less than a friend.</v>

1651
01:20:58.991 --> 01:21:02.380
<v Speaker 1>You're far more than a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're someone that's going to be in the</v>

1652
01:21:02.381 --> 01:21:05.410
<v Speaker 1>child's life for the duration of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life with any luck.</v>

1653
01:21:05.710 --> 01:21:10.710
<v Speaker 1>You're a longterm island of stability in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sea of turbulence and the child needs </v>

1654
01:21:12.911 --> 01:21:15.580
<v Speaker 1>that far more than than he or she needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend.</v>

1655
01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Parents need to be courageous because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to let their children go and </v>

1656
01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:25.651
<v Speaker 1>make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to let your child fall when </v>

1657
01:21:25.651 --> 01:21:28.171
<v Speaker 1>they're learning to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bump themselves up against the </v>

1658
01:21:28.171 --> 01:21:31.291
<v Speaker 1>world a lot and you don't want to do any</v>
<v Speaker 1>more for your child than you absolutely </v>

1659
01:21:31.291 --> 01:21:36.061
<v Speaker 1>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it means that there's a certain </v>

1660
01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:36.940
<v Speaker 1>amount of detached harshness that has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go along with your love and compassion.</v>

1661
01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:41.560
<v Speaker 1>You have to stand back and let your </v>
<v Speaker 1>child stumble forward towards mastery.</v>

1662
01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Today's parents are terrified of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>children because they're often afraid </v>

1663
01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:50.491
<v Speaker 1>that if they intervene in their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'll make a mistake and that </v>

1664
01:21:50.491 --> 01:21:53.761
<v Speaker 1>that will be irrevocable and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the courage of your convictions.</v>

1665
01:21:53.891 --> 01:21:57.430
<v Speaker 1>When you have children and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that if you do make mistakes,</v>

1666
01:21:57.431 --> 01:22:00.010
<v Speaker 1>that you can learn and you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgiven.</v>

1667
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:05.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be a perfect parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you should aim up with your </v>

1668
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:09.061
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parents are terrified of making </v>

1669
01:22:09.061 --> 01:22:09.061
<v Speaker 1>mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means that they're terrified of</v>

1670
01:22:09.061 --> 01:22:12.160
<v Speaker 1>being parents and they and that stops </v>
<v Speaker 1>them from being parents.</v>

1671
01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:30.250
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>
