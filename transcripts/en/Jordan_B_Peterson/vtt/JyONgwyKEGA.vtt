1
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.143
<v Speaker 1>So I'm talking today with Nina Paley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a brilliant animator and she's </v>

2
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.583
<v Speaker 1>making a variety of short films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I guess are going to be joined </v>

3
00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>together into a longer film about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature,</v>

4
00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:32.414
<v Speaker 1>old testament themes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's the creator of the animated </v>

5
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:37.940
<v Speaker 1>musical features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sita sings the blues,</v>

6
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 1>her adventures in our broken copyright </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

7
00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>let her to join question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>copyright.org as artists in residence in</v>

8
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:45.764
<v Speaker 1>2008 where she produced a series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>animated shorts about intellectual </v>

9
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:54.371
<v Speaker 1>freedom called minute means or recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>she made this land is mine,</v>

10
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.460
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shocking,</v>

11
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Speaker 1>a devastating and also aesthetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive film about Israel Palestine,</v>

12
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Canaan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Levant,</v>

13
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's intended for her new feature </v>
<v Speaker 1>film sadomasochism.</v>

14
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And you can find a lot of Nina's pieces </v>
<v Speaker 1>of pieces of that film online.</v>

15
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.400
<v Speaker 1>And I would highly recommend watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wheel,</v>

16
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.030
<v Speaker 1>a couple of them into this interview so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can see what she's up to.</v>

17
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>So I guess there's two things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could really talk about.</v>

18
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I think that most important one </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously is your work,</v>

19
00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:34.184
<v Speaker 1>but I guess the second one is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern for intellectual freedom and </v>

20
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.690
<v Speaker 1>your feeling with regards to two </v>
<v Speaker 1>copyrights.</v>

21
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Copying is not stealing and less less </v>
<v Speaker 2>copying.</v>

22
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.323
<v Speaker 2>It makes one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what toppings for copying is not </v>

23
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.750
<v Speaker 2>the</v>
<v Speaker 2>one for me and one for you.</v>

24
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.150
<v Speaker 2>That's what God is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one for each of us.</v>

25
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 2>That is what we call copy sharing ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>with everyone.</v>

26
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.960
<v Speaker 2>That's why it caught me,</v>

27
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.150
<v Speaker 1>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start.</v>

28
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's start by talking about you first </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

29
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.093
<v Speaker 1>tell my listeners and tell me who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and where you come from and what </v>

30
00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:44.794
<v Speaker 1>you're about.</v>

31
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.190
<v Speaker 3>You want to know about my identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's,</v>

32
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

33
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.460
<v Speaker 3>trust me to identify myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust myself there.</v>

34
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 3>Well that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the best source we have today.</v>

35
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.900
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

36
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.550
<v Speaker 3>am not sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

37
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.903
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think most of us would agree that I'm </v>

38
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.154
<v Speaker 3>an artist and currently an animator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I've been doing animation since </v>

39
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.400
<v Speaker 3>1998.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

40
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.470
<v Speaker 3>before that I was a newspaper cartoonist</v>
<v Speaker 3>is still do comics from time to time.</v>

41
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Not very often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

42
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.283
<v Speaker 3>I guess the thing is I've just been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just came back from a bike ride and </v>

43
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.963
<v Speaker 3>I've just been thinking about identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>like all the time and how incredibly </v>

44
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 3>unreliable it is and how I don't respect</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

45
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 3>including ways that I identify myself.</v>

46
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Well I guess that's part of being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>artist,</v>

47
00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:38.574
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people who are artistic or high </v>

48
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:43.350
<v Speaker 1>in trait openness and that gives them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very fluid identity.</v>

49
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.313
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's an advantage because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are high in openness can think </v>

50
00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:50.850
<v Speaker 1>loudly and they're always coming up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative ideas,</v>

51
00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:51.684
<v Speaker 1>but it does tend to make their identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather pluralistic and sometimes </v>

52
00:03:56.191 --> 00:03:58.650
<v Speaker 1>unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that could also be a problem.</v>

53
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.063
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I guess it's not even that it's </v>

54
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 3>fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>

55
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I identify this way one day and this way</v>

56
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 3>another day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

57
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't really currently have much </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect for the idea of identity at all.</v>

58
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.303
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I could say all kinds of things </v>

59
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 3>about myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

60
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 3>does that actually do me any good?</v>

61
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.383
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you a couple of basic </v>

62
00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:23.060
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you live?</v>

63
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 3>I live in Urbana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Illinois.</v>

64
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.610
<v Speaker 3>That's verifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

65
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.510
<v Speaker 3>and where were you born?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born in her band.</v>

66
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.140
<v Speaker 1>So you've been there your whole life </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially?</v>

67
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.420
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left when I was 20.</v>

68
00:04:35.421 --> 00:04:38.540
<v Speaker 3>I moved to Santa Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>California and I wanted to be a hippie.</v>

69
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 3>I failed a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you know,</v>

70
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.810
<v Speaker 3>I was already out on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I briefly moved to Austin,</v>

71
00:04:44.811 --> 00:04:46.490
<v Speaker 3>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That didn't work out.</v>

72
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I moved to San Francisco in 1991.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived there for 11 years.</v>

73
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.590
<v Speaker 3>In 2002 I had followed my then </v>
<v Speaker 3>boyfriend.</v>

74
00:04:54.591 --> 00:04:57.770
<v Speaker 3>Actually we were legally married,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my then husband to India,</v>

75
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the subject,</v>

76
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.300
<v Speaker 3>one of the subjects of Sita sings the </v>
<v Speaker 3>blues.</v>

77
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.930
<v Speaker 3>And then later in 2002 I moved to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brooklyn,</v>

78
00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:10.340
<v Speaker 3>New York and lived in various places in </v>
<v Speaker 3>New York for a total of about 10 years.</v>

79
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.840
<v Speaker 3>I moved back to her Urbana in 2012 right</v>
<v Speaker 3>after my father died.</v>

80
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.160
<v Speaker 3>And here I am.</v>

81
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>And so why did you move back to her band</v>
<v Speaker 1>and after all that adventuring?</v>

82
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.920
<v Speaker 3>First I was done with New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though I really love New York,</v>

83
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.100
<v Speaker 3>especially know my first five years </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

84
00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:28.934
<v Speaker 3>I was fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of achieved more than I even </v>

85
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:34.604
<v Speaker 3>expected I would be able to and started </v>
<v Speaker 3>to just get the love affair with New </v>

86
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 3>York kind of wore off and I wanted a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little more peace and quiet and I wanted</v>

87
00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:50.690
<v Speaker 3>cooler summers and I didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>smell garbage everywhere all the time.</v>

88
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.423
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had an opportunity to move back here </v>

89
00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:54.674
<v Speaker 3>because my dad died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom was threatening to sell the </v>

90
00:05:56.481 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I joined the occupy movement,</v>

91
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.213
<v Speaker 3>occupy moms house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to keep her from selling that </v>

92
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.003
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

93
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.510
<v Speaker 1>You actually had a specific demand with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your occupied movement.</v>

94
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 3>Failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She sold the house anyway,</v>

95
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.370
<v Speaker 3>but I think in our new house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

96
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.373
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was dating somebody that lived here </v>

97
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has ended,</v>

98
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.640
<v Speaker 3>but I actually really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's much more relaxed and inexpensive.</v>

99
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:29.534
<v Speaker 3>I get lots of fresh air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take lots of bike rides and I don't </v>

100
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 3>really care about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

101
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.780
<v Speaker 3>the less stressed out</v>
<v Speaker 3>identity less.</v>

102
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you have plenty of adventure,</v>

103
00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:45.600
<v Speaker 1>so obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess it must take a fair bit of,</v>

104
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I would think time of quiet and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

105
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.440
<v Speaker 1>and some isolation in order to work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your animation.</v>

106
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.133
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I achieved that quite an isolation </v>

107
00:06:55.881 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 3>in New York actually by just living in </v>
<v Speaker 3>New York in an apartment by myself.</v>

108
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.633
<v Speaker 3>I would rather live in New York than </v>
<v Speaker 3>visit New York because when you live </v>

109
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:05.024
<v Speaker 3>there you can actually control your </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment somewhat and you can shut </v>

110
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:09.404
<v Speaker 3>everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas when you're visiting usually </v>

111
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 3>have to be out all the time being </v>
<v Speaker 3>overstimulated.</v>

112
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.301
<v Speaker 1>Rick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

113
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Well it's definitely an overstimulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

114
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 1>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you start doing your animation?</v>

115
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.213
<v Speaker 3>I started animating as an adult in 1998.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before that I had done some animation </v>

116
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:32.531
<v Speaker 3>when I was 13 years old using a borrowed</v>
<v Speaker 3>super eight camera and I just completely</v>

117
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:35.234
<v Speaker 3>stopped because I was in central </v>
<v Speaker 3>Illinois and there was no support for </v>

118
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.753
<v Speaker 3>doing animation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no way I could have advanced </v>

119
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:46.300
<v Speaker 3>beyond the neighbor super eight camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

120
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.293
<v Speaker 3>but then in 1998 I was burning out of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>daily comic strip and wanted to do </v>

121
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:53.984
<v Speaker 3>something and borrowed somebody else's </v>
<v Speaker 3>super eight camera and in 1998 it was </v>

122
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:58.784
<v Speaker 3>easier to advance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in San Francisco where a lot </v>

123
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:05.270
<v Speaker 3>of people were doing independent film </v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

124
00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:06.104
<v Speaker 3>I just picked up where I left off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did plasticine clay stuff on super </v>

125
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:10.784
<v Speaker 3>eight and shared that film with a band </v>
<v Speaker 3>called Nick Phelps in the sprocket </v>

126
00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 3>ensemble that did live music to </v>
<v Speaker 3>animation and that was really fun.</v>

127
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:20.384
<v Speaker 3>I was being gratified by audience </v>
<v Speaker 3>feedback and so I made another film on </v>

128
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.910
<v Speaker 3>16 millimeter and then my next film was </v>
<v Speaker 3>drawing and scratching on 35 millimeter.</v>

129
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:33.911
<v Speaker 3>And then my next film after that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>drawing and scratching on Imax film,</v>

130
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:37.100
<v Speaker 3>which is 70 millimeter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really big frames.</v>

131
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.503
<v Speaker 3>And then I got into flash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>macromedia flash and I've been digital </v>

132
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:43.964
<v Speaker 3>ever since.</v>

133
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Are you using macromedia flash now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your primary technology?</v>

134
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.240
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those clips for sadomasochism </v>
<v Speaker 3>more animated in macromedia flash,</v>

135
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.433
<v Speaker 3>adobe flash and crippled it and ruined </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in the opinion of many flash </v>

136
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:02.850
<v Speaker 3>animators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm still using macromedia flash from</v>

137
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:07.851
<v Speaker 3>1990 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that when my copy of flashes from,</v>

138
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>macromedia flash eight.</v>

139
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 3>It only runs on older computers actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it might be from 2006 or 2005.</v>

140
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.413
<v Speaker 3>So I have this old Mac here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a running ios 10 point six because it </v>

141
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:24.600
<v Speaker 3>won't run on any more recent machines </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

142
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like impossible to integrate with a</v>

143
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.760
<v Speaker 3>modern video editing system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have a new Mac as well.</v>

144
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.240
<v Speaker 3>And the newer parts though Sadomasochism</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm using a program called Moho pro 12,</v>

145
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.180
<v Speaker 3>which is kept up and runs on modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>computers.</v>

146
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny how sometimes software peaks </v>

147
00:09:48.011 --> 00:09:51.400
<v Speaker 1>in terms of complexity and usability and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it goes downhill,</v>

148
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're seeing that not just with </v>

149
00:09:54.251 --> 00:09:55.084
<v Speaker 3>software but with computers altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like personal computers I think peaked </v>

150
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:00.843
<v Speaker 3>around 2007,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 2010 and they've been getting </v>

151
00:10:03.611 --> 00:10:04.444
<v Speaker 3>worse ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like any sort of upgrade to operating </v>

152
00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:10.900
<v Speaker 3>systems just means more surveillance and</v>
<v Speaker 3>less user freedom at this point.</v>

153
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As well as the steep learning curve.</v>

154
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:15.933
<v Speaker 1>What annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you happen to be an expert with the </v>

155
00:10:17.141 --> 00:10:18.040
<v Speaker 1>previous system,</v>

156
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:19.481
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

157
00:10:19.481 --> 00:10:22.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I don't know if I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep animating digitally,</v>

158
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it,</v>

159
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the software that I'm using now </v>

160
00:10:25.271 --> 00:10:26.104
<v Speaker 3>motto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just found out that the person that </v>

161
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.503
<v Speaker 3>created it and was an integral part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's team this whole time just left the </v>

162
00:10:32.951 --> 00:10:33.940
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

163
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

164
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.900
<v Speaker 3>we'll host faith is unclear and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

165
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:42.340
<v Speaker 3>if I have to learn a whole other piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>of software again,</v>

166
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.260
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know if I can take this </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

167
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so fluent with flash.</v>

168
00:10:46.031 --> 00:10:48.070
<v Speaker 3>It took me years to become fluent at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

169
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.953
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

170
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's another thing is that it </v>

171
00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.293
<v Speaker 1>takes a long time to become an expert </v>
<v Speaker 1>user of a complex software program and </v>

172
00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:58.090
<v Speaker 1>then when it shifts the ground shifts </v>
<v Speaker 1>from underneath you,</v>

173
00:10:58.091 --> 00:10:58.924
<v Speaker 1>it's rather disheartening because all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that expertise is essentially </v>

174
00:11:02.591 --> 00:11:03.424
<v Speaker 1>disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess it's part of what we're </v>

175
00:11:05.141 --> 00:11:05.974
<v Speaker 1>experiencing as our technology advances </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast enough so that our lifespans are </v>

176
00:11:10.031 --> 00:11:12.010
<v Speaker 1>too long really to keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

177
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.933
<v Speaker 1>we get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get outdated and superannuated on </v>

178
00:11:16.531 --> 00:11:19.450
<v Speaker 1>about a five year rotation and it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>get exhausting.</v>

179
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe I'll just die early.</v>

180
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Won't have to worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll solve the problem.</v>

181
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.950
<v Speaker 3>Then you won't feel finished your film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now it seems like a bad idea.</v>

182
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to finish this film.</v>

183
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 3>I finally see the light at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tunnel for sadomasochism.</v>

184
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

185
00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:37.100
<v Speaker 1>so let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you something about that.</v>

186
00:11:37.101 --> 00:11:39.950
<v Speaker 1>So now you made this land is mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was that?</v>

187
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:45.340
<v Speaker 3>That was in 2012 I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the first scene that I made.</v>

188
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.990
<v Speaker 4>God gave this</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>

189
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.660
<v Speaker 4>I</v>
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>

190
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.680
<v Speaker 3>So it's going to be the last scene in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the film,</v>

191
00:15:02.681 --> 00:15:03.940
<v Speaker 3>but it's the first one that I made.</v>

192
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.250
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

193
00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.470
<v Speaker 1>what possessed you to make that?</v>

194
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.413
<v Speaker 3>So I knew I wanted to make a movie about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Passover because I was ready to just </v>

195
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.480
<v Speaker 3>observing Passover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although not much else.</v>

196
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:21.350
<v Speaker 3>And so I was doing research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen the movie exodus,</v>

197
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.613
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that movie.</v>

198
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.053
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I watched it as part of my research </v>

199
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:26.843
<v Speaker 3>and I learned that the theme music had </v>
<v Speaker 3>lyrics written to it by Pat Boone and </v>

200
00:15:31.741 --> 00:15:34.830
<v Speaker 3>that it was a really popular song in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>

201
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.680
<v Speaker 3>Tons of artists did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never even heard it before.</v>

202
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.260
<v Speaker 3>So I heard it and I just thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

203
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This land is mine.</v>

204
00:15:41.611 --> 00:15:43.410
<v Speaker 3>God gave this land to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

205
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.360
<v Speaker 3>any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone would say that,</v>

206
00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:46.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody,</v>

207
00:15:46.411 --> 00:15:49.170
<v Speaker 3>every group feels that way about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>land that they're on,</v>

208
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.630
<v Speaker 3>every single one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the absurdity of it was just apparent</v>

209
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.473
<v Speaker 3>in the song and no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't even really a process of </v>

210
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.913
<v Speaker 3>coming up with a concept for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just that was what the song </v>

211
00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:04.853
<v Speaker 3>evoked for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just showing how every single </v>

212
00:16:06.511 --> 00:16:08.200
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not every single person,</v>

213
00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:12.750
<v Speaker 3>but every single tribe has that attitude</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards their land.</v>

214
00:16:12.751 --> 00:16:16.530
<v Speaker 3>And so saying that this land is yours </v>
<v Speaker 3>and God gave this land to me,</v>

215
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:21.460
<v Speaker 3>gives you no authority at all because</v>
<v Speaker 3>every.</v>

216
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's just what it is to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribe living on land.</v>

217
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.273
<v Speaker 1>So what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of reaction did you garner </v>

218
00:16:30.011 --> 00:16:31.840
<v Speaker 1>from this land is mine,</v>

219
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.220
<v Speaker 3>this land is mine is the most popular </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing I have ever made.</v>

220
00:16:36.221 --> 00:16:39.820
<v Speaker 3>It's been viewed on various channels </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than 10 million times.</v>

221
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

222
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.270
<v Speaker 3>many people like it in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticism,</v>

223
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.133
<v Speaker 3>the criticism seems equally divided </v>
<v Speaker 3>between people that say that I'm a </v>

224
00:16:50.261 --> 00:16:54.100
<v Speaker 3>Zionist and people that say I'm an anti </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zionist,</v>

225
00:16:54.101 --> 00:16:58.180
<v Speaker 3>so it's either a really anti Zionist </v>
<v Speaker 3>film or it's a really Zionist film.</v>

226
00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.273
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can just add that criticism </v>

227
00:17:00.631 --> 00:17:02.670
<v Speaker 1>together in sum to zero and ignore it.</v>

228
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

229
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm really flattered by it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

230
00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:08.810
<v Speaker 3>Because if people that passionately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

231
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:14.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm on polar opposite sides are saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

232
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:16.310
<v Speaker 3>then I feel like I've really done </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

233
00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

234
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've definitely done something right.</v>

235
00:17:18.711 --> 00:17:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was the first film of yours</v>

236
00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:23.210
<v Speaker 1>that I saw and then I've watched many of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

237
00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:24.044
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone I could get my hands on</v>
<v Speaker 1>since then and instruct me in a variety </v>

238
00:17:27.681 --> 00:17:28.490
<v Speaker 1>of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

239
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:29.323
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say strange about your animation </v>

240
00:17:32.961 --> 00:17:35.900
<v Speaker 1>is that it's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If first of all,</v>

241
00:17:35.901 --> 00:17:37.520
<v Speaker 1>you have great taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't use it,</v>

242
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I'll get the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how do you get permission?</v>

243
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.820
<v Speaker 3>How do you be done to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

244
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.013
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing.</v>

245
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

246
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 3>How's that working out for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

247
00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:52.640
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the case of this land is mine.</v>

248
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty clear cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair use because the film is parody,</v>

249
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:57.983
<v Speaker 3>like I said it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's literally a parody of those lyrics </v>

250
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:05.160
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fair use.</v>

251
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

252
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.590
<v Speaker 3>I actually think most of my uses are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair use,</v>

253
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:11.424
<v Speaker 3>their transformative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of uses are not as clear cut </v>

254
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:16.134
<v Speaker 3>as parody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's actually a really interesting </v>

255
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:19.703
<v Speaker 3>issue with the film and how is this film</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be released and how's it going </v>

256
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:24.264
<v Speaker 3>to be shown because there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way I am going to ask for permission </v>

257
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.813
<v Speaker 3>to use this music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly music that entered my head </v>

258
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:35.010
<v Speaker 3>as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

259
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.190
<v Speaker 3>which I did not consent to and I had no </v>
<v Speaker 3>control over it.</v>

260
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.250
<v Speaker 3>Of course nobody has any control over </v>
<v Speaker 3>what goes into your head,</v>

261
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you'd go out in the world and music</v>

262
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 3>is playing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes into your head,</v>

263
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yet once it's there,</v>

264
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.520
<v Speaker 3>that part of your head that it occupies </v>
<v Speaker 3>belongs to a corporation.</v>

265
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:56.240
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just done asking corporations </v>
<v Speaker 3>for permission to use what's in my head,</v>

266
00:18:57.151 --> 00:18:59.430
<v Speaker 3>which they put there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

267
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.430
<v Speaker 3>So you basically solve the problem by </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying to hell with it,</v>

268
00:19:02.431 --> 00:19:05.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this no matter what.</v>

269
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.153
<v Speaker 3>And you're going to hire note whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficulties there are with that as you </v>

270
00:19:09.151 --> 00:19:12.210
<v Speaker 3>move along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an illegal film.</v>

271
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the case of Sita sings the blues,</v>

272
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.433
<v Speaker 3>I Made Sita sings the blues when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was certainly questioning in </v>

273
00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:20.334
<v Speaker 3>copyright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't really see it as a </v>

274
00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:27.111
<v Speaker 3>completely bankrupt institution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when that film was done,</v>

275
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.183
<v Speaker 3>I cleared all the rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was an incredibly difficult </v>

276
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:33.234
<v Speaker 3>process and required hiring </v>
<v Speaker 3>intermediaries because the rights </v>

277
00:19:36.931 --> 00:19:38.640
<v Speaker 3>holders don't talk to normal people.</v>

278
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.500
<v Speaker 3>So if you do make a film and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have permission to use the music in it,</v>

279
00:19:43.501 --> 00:19:46.320
<v Speaker 3>you can't simply ask for permission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They won't talk to you.</v>

280
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.230
<v Speaker 3>So you have to pay lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And intermediaries,</v>

281
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.363
<v Speaker 3>just for them to even listen to you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you how much money they're </v>

282
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:53.664
<v Speaker 3>demanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is inevitably an absurd amount </v>

283
00:19:54.871 --> 00:19:55.704
<v Speaker 3>that you can't afford.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I ended up spending a mere $70,000 </v>

284
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.583
<v Speaker 3>to make sita sings the blues legal to </v>
<v Speaker 3>show for free and legal to share for </v>

285
00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:08.850
<v Speaker 3>free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I wanted some other model,</v>

286
00:20:08.851 --> 00:20:13.851
<v Speaker 3>it would have been more than that </v>
<v Speaker 3>$70,000 to be able to give it away.</v>

287
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not doing that with a new film.</v>

288
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:20.940
<v Speaker 3>The new film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm making an illegal film.</v>

289
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.390
<v Speaker 3>All of my music choices have to do not </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their licenses,</v>

290
00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:29.010
<v Speaker 3>but with the content and meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>resonance of the songs.</v>

291
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.293
<v Speaker 3>Most songs have a kind of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>resonance that is related to the point </v>

292
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:39.021
<v Speaker 3>in time they were circulating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

293
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.960
<v Speaker 3>this land is mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

294
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.770
<v Speaker 3>refers directly to this period of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>

295
00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.643
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a cultural resonance because of </v>

296
00:20:46.051 --> 00:20:47.410
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which a new song.</v>

297
00:20:47.411 --> 00:20:50.410
<v Speaker 3>If I commissioned a new song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like that,</v>

298
00:20:50.411 --> 00:20:52.210
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't have the same meaning at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

299
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely no.</v>

300
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:54.363
<v Speaker 1>Songs like that they pick up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting to watch what </v>

301
00:20:56.541 --> 00:20:59.880
<v Speaker 1>happens to a song across time because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>picks up again,</v>

302
00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:00.853
<v Speaker 1>it's embedded in the context and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>context grows and develops and </v>

303
00:21:03.381 --> 00:21:06.740
<v Speaker 1>transforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The song is really a mutable entity.</v>

304
00:21:06.741 --> 00:21:07.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

305
00:21:07.821 --> 00:21:10.700
<v Speaker 1>it transforms tremendously as it moves </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>

306
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:11.933
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that.</v>

307
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.950
<v Speaker 3>And that meaning comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>

308
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.920
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't come from even the person </v>
<v Speaker 3>that wrote it,</v>

309
00:21:16.921 --> 00:21:18.780
<v Speaker 3>let alone the copyright holder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

310
00:21:18.781 --> 00:21:21.330
<v Speaker 3>The value of it comes from us.</v>

311
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back to this land is mine.</v>

312
00:21:23.111 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 1>So when I watched that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it produced a lot of mixed feelings.</v>

313
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:31.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean the first was that it was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackly humorous and you know,</v>

314
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 1>you have this stirring propaganda stick </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthem,</v>

315
00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:42.100
<v Speaker 1>light music in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of overblown.</v>

316
00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm the singer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

317
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:45.283
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he amplifies the emotional resonance of </v>

318
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:52.561
<v Speaker 1>it and then you have this just nonstop </v>
<v Speaker 1>carnage in the background to this,</v>

319
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:54.843
<v Speaker 1>to this stirring music and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's really strange about it as </v>

320
00:21:58.031 --> 00:21:58.864
<v Speaker 1>far as I was concerned is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>eerily beautiful and that's something </v>

321
00:22:02.861 --> 00:22:05.860
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be a perverse and remarkable</v>

322
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:06.694
<v Speaker 1>element of all of your films is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they deal with extremely harsh </v>

323
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.390
<v Speaker 1>realities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical and,</v>

324
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.433
<v Speaker 1>and genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have this amazing capacity to </v>

325
00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.930
<v Speaker 1>generate these complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful images and to set them in a,</v>

326
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.183
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an equally beautiful relationship to </v>

327
00:22:26.891 --> 00:22:27.970
<v Speaker 1>the music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

328
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.673
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know and still don't know what </v>

329
00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:34.084
<v Speaker 1>to make of the film because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>often see what you might describe as </v>

330
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:43.000
<v Speaker 1>stunningly beautiful satire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stunningly beautiful artistic satire.</v>

331
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.633
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mad magazine was pretty stunningly </v>

332
00:22:48.161 --> 00:22:51.560
<v Speaker 3>beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 3>back back in the day.</v>

333
00:22:51.561 --> 00:22:53.860
<v Speaker 3>It hadn't had like the best artists </v>
<v Speaker 3>working for it.</v>

334
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

335
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:56.910
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're,</v>

336
00:22:56.911 --> 00:22:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an element to what you're doing,</v>

337
00:22:59.401 --> 00:23:02.620
<v Speaker 1>especially with the juxtaposition of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>music that seems to elevate it,</v>

338
00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.520
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to something like the level of high art.</v>

339
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:07.980
<v Speaker 3>What's high?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's low?</v>

340
00:23:07.981 --> 00:23:08.581
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

341
00:23:08.581 --> 00:23:11.340
<v Speaker 3>I thank you for the compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't really respond to any,</v>

342
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.960
<v Speaker 3>anything other than thanking you.</v>

343
00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.580
<v Speaker 1>So your aesthetic sense and the style </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've developed,</v>

344
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.700
<v Speaker 1>do you have sources for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have influences that,</v>

345
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.020
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helped you,</v>

346
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.680
<v Speaker 1>helped you develop that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>style?</v>

347
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a foolish question,</v>

348
00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:31.970
<v Speaker 1>dial star artists where they get their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

349
00:23:31.971 --> 00:23:35.300
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering how it is that you came up</v>

350
00:23:35.301 --> 00:23:37.340
<v Speaker 1>with the concepts that you're working </v>
<v Speaker 1>with?</v>

351
00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>graphically,</v>

352
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.200
<v Speaker 3>some of the style is determined by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>software that I use.</v>

353
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:48.650
<v Speaker 3>So this land is mine and all the song </v>
<v Speaker 3>scenes and Sadomasochism,</v>

354
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.230
<v Speaker 3>arch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flash and flash.</v>

355
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 3>The way I use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what we call a cutout style.</v>

356
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.183
<v Speaker 3>We're all drawing shapes and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll move them in relation to each </v>

357
00:23:58.191 --> 00:23:59.024
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ships themselves don't bend or </v>

358
00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:02.474
<v Speaker 3>anything they're just cut out is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>animation technique where people would </v>

359
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:11.441
<v Speaker 3>literally cut out shapes from paper and </v>
<v Speaker 3>move them around under a camera.</v>

360
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.980
<v Speaker 3>So that's part of the style,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

361
00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.013
<v Speaker 3>with this land is mine in particular I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was looking at ancient Assyrian art and </v>

362
00:24:20.841 --> 00:24:23.000
<v Speaker 3>ancient Egyptian art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of that is reflected.</v>

363
00:24:23.001 --> 00:24:27.590
<v Speaker 3>There's like little border of flowers </v>
<v Speaker 3>which comes from a Syrian art.</v>

364
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

365
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.320
<v Speaker 3>those are the main things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cutout style and this Syria and stuff.</v>

366
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.163
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

367
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.780
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you made this way or this morning,</v>

368
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:45.710
<v Speaker 1>did you have the sadomasochism film in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind or did that emerge afterwards?</v>

369
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:47.480
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew,</v>

370
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:52.460
<v Speaker 3>I knew I wanted to make this film about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Passover and that's why I watched exodus</v>

371
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.480
<v Speaker 3>and that's how sadomasochism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's how this land is.</v>

372
00:24:56.481 --> 00:24:57.314
<v Speaker 3>Mine came to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just knew I wanted to do a film </v>

373
00:24:59.391 --> 00:25:00.224
<v Speaker 3>about Passover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what it was gonna be </v>

374
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:04.390
<v Speaker 3>because I had never read the Old </v>
<v Speaker 3>Testament before.</v>

375
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:08.060
<v Speaker 3>And reading exodus was of course an eye </v>
<v Speaker 3>opener.</v>

376
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the film,</v>

377
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't imagine what the film was gonna</v>

378
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.040
<v Speaker 3>be like when I started it other than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>topic I would work around.</v>

379
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:19.850
<v Speaker 3>But the way the film is actually shaping</v>
<v Speaker 3>up is a surprise to me.</v>

380
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.670
<v Speaker 1>So we should probably walk everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's listening through the film itself.</v>

381
00:25:25.671 --> 00:25:30.671
<v Speaker 1>So you've created a variety of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>appear at least to be at the moment,</v>

382
00:25:31.011 --> 00:25:31.844
<v Speaker 1>to be animated shorts that detail out </v>
<v Speaker 1>different episodes in the biblical </v>

383
00:25:35.781 --> 00:25:38.570
<v Speaker 1>narrative surrounding essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding Moses.</v>

384
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:39.404
<v Speaker 1>There's more to it than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly surrounding Moses and so </v>

385
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.423
<v Speaker 1>does the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does the film essentially concentrate </v>

386
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.430
<v Speaker 1>solely on exodus or are there other </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of,</v>

387
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.770
<v Speaker 1>of Old Testament stories that are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're including?</v>

388
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.353
<v Speaker 3>It's really just exodus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leviticus and deuteronomy and numbers </v>

389
00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:04.110
<v Speaker 3>all have bits of exodus in them.</v>

390
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

391
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically the story of Moses.</v>

392
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a story of Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

393
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.080
<v Speaker 3>It's the story of the exodus and then be</v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment of the,</v>

394
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.813
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Tabernacle and the priesthood and </v>

395
00:26:17.741 --> 00:26:18.850
<v Speaker 3>the religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

396
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:22.720
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of a mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's regarded as the birth of the Jewish</v>

397
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.583
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

398
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

399
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.430
<v Speaker 1>And so now you said that when you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up,</v>

400
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you observed Passover but not much else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

402
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not unreasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to observe that there appears to</v>

403
00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 1>be something like a deep religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensibility in your,</v>

404
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.990
<v Speaker 1>in your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

405
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 1>you seem to be treating the stories with</v>

406
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.810
<v Speaker 3>a tremendous amount of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what,</v>

407
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:49.523
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think's welling up from </v>

408
00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:53.540
<v Speaker 3>inside of you to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

409
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you recognize the risk and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect.</v>

410
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:57.023
<v Speaker 3>Any respect for this was like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I approached these stories with an open </v>

411
00:27:03.301 --> 00:27:08.301
<v Speaker 3>mind and an open heart and was expecting</v>
<v Speaker 3>to find some wisdom in them.</v>

412
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.833
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I began this project I thought I'm </v>

413
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.550
<v Speaker 3>going to explore the religion of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>father.</v>

414
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.030
<v Speaker 3>My father came from a religious Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>

415
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.280
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't really religious when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was growing up.</v>

416
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.310
<v Speaker 3>Although he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

417
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:34.370
<v Speaker 3>he wanted us to observe Passover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess as part of our,</v>

418
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:37.263
<v Speaker 3>he want us to have some Jewish identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted us to be in touch with our </v>

419
00:27:40.321 --> 00:27:45.321
<v Speaker 3>heritage as Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a bit muddled.</v>

420
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we,</v>

421
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:52.890
<v Speaker 3>we were forbidden from observing any </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian holidays.</v>

422
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.880
<v Speaker 3>There was no Christmas in our house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas a lot of secular Jews do observe</v>

423
00:27:56.881 --> 00:27:57.714
<v Speaker 3>Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like a really half assed </v>

424
00:27:59.241 --> 00:28:02.730
<v Speaker 3>Hanukkah and there were no other high </v>
<v Speaker 3>holy days.</v>

425
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.623
<v Speaker 3>And my dad was an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So after spending years reading many </v>

426
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.653
<v Speaker 3>different versions of exodus and </v>
<v Speaker 3>commentary on it and things relating to </v>

427
00:28:18.481 --> 00:28:19.314
<v Speaker 3>it and trying to understand it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find some way to connect to </v>

428
00:28:23.191 --> 00:28:24.024
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

429
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:29.680
<v Speaker 3>What happened was I realized that I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>found the religion of my father and that</v>

430
00:28:29.681 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 3>was atheism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

431
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.300
<v Speaker 3>I became sort of a born again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>atheist reading this stuff.</v>

432
00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.163
<v Speaker 3>My neutrality towards the religion </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed to a kind of a boring towards </v>

433
00:28:44.501 --> 00:28:45.740
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

434
00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.510
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not to take away from.</v>

435
00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.400
<v Speaker 3>It's important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

436
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.970
<v Speaker 3>as a cultural foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

437
00:28:52.971 --> 00:28:53.804
<v Speaker 3>Like I live in western culture and these</v>
<v Speaker 3>texts are stories that everybody knows </v>

438
00:28:59.421 --> 00:29:03.880
<v Speaker 3>to some extent and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very important and I,</v>

439
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:04.723
<v Speaker 3>I respect them for that reason that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were like a cultural touchstone </v>

440
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:12.580
<v Speaker 3>for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I did not emerge from exodus within,</v>

441
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had like less connection to God than I</v>

442
00:29:17.121 --> 00:29:20.510
<v Speaker 3>had ever had in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually had like a spiritual crisis,</v>

443
00:29:20.511 --> 00:29:22.070
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

444
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:23.323
<v Speaker 3>it was really hard for me to have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of sense of a power greater than </v>

445
00:29:27.291 --> 00:29:30.950
<v Speaker 3>myself after reading this and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and working with it.</v>

446
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.300
<v Speaker 3>And that's also been the case as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of doing the animation.</v>

447
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>

448
00:29:36.921 --> 00:29:40.190
<v Speaker 3>animation is like a meditation when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you made an old story,</v>

449
00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:41.024
<v Speaker 3>it's just a long out meditation on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes insights can pop up while </v>

450
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:46.630
<v Speaker 3>you're working on it.</v>

451
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like in your face everyday.</v>

452
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have there,</v>

453
00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:53.020
<v Speaker 3>there are insights that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them,</v>

454
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:53.913
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them are comparative religion </v>
<v Speaker 3>insights because the previous film with </v>

455
00:29:56.141 --> 00:29:56.974
<v Speaker 3>Sita sings the blues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in this film I included Aaron a lot </v>

456
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.563
<v Speaker 3>in Sita sings the blues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left out Luckman who is a Rahm's </v>

457
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:05.703
<v Speaker 3>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I decided not to do that here even </v>

458
00:30:09.461 --> 00:30:12.640
<v Speaker 3>though with a lot of these stories when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're turned into films,</v>

459
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:13.623
<v Speaker 3>Erin is made into this minor character </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of things that Aaron does in </v>

460
00:30:17.321 --> 00:30:22.321
<v Speaker 3>movies they show Moses doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like casting the staff down and it turns</v>

461
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:25.480
<v Speaker 3>into a snake that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was Aaron's business.</v>

462
00:30:25.481 --> 00:30:26.314
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I showed Aaron in this and I fought </v>

463
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.550
<v Speaker 3>about how both stories have these </v>
<v Speaker 3>brothers,</v>

464
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:31.443
<v Speaker 3>they have like the big important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>memorable brother and the other brother </v>

465
00:30:34.211 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 3>who actually carries out quite a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the work.</v>

466
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:38.803
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's a similarity and of course </v>

467
00:30:40.811 --> 00:30:45.811
<v Speaker 3>both stories also have a really gruesome</v>
<v Speaker 3>scene after what we normally think of as</v>

468
00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 3>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like with exodus,</v>

469
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.173
<v Speaker 3>especially growing up with Passover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd always thought the story was the </v>

470
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:58.080
<v Speaker 3>Hebrews were slaves and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were free,</v>

471
00:30:58.181 --> 00:30:59.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the end is,</v>

472
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.213
<v Speaker 3>they're free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They crossed the Red Sea to get away </v>

473
00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:02.074
<v Speaker 3>from the Egyptians for Ray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course what actually happens in </v>

474
00:31:05.111 --> 00:31:05.944
<v Speaker 3>the story after that is there's this </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hebrew on Hebrew slaughter because of </v>

475
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:14.230
<v Speaker 3>the golden calf and a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those Hebrews who were liberated,</v>

476
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.303
<v Speaker 3>they die.</v>

477
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:16.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

478
00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:19.240
<v Speaker 1>liberation turns out to be a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated thing.</v>

479
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:20.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

480
00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.483
<v Speaker 1>it's funny when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I watched the Americans go into </v>

481
00:31:23.951 --> 00:31:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

482
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.433
<v Speaker 1>with her initial optimism and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute disintegration of the Iraqi </v>

483
00:31:30.881 --> 00:31:31.720
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

484
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:32.583
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the failure to produce </v>

485
00:31:34.121 --> 00:31:35.040
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

486
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.450
<v Speaker 1>stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence,</v>

487
00:31:37.451 --> 00:31:38.284
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

488
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:41.410
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of exodus would have gone a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long ways.</v>

489
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.410
<v Speaker 1>It was quite funny in some sense because</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a black way,</v>

490
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:50.230
<v Speaker 1>because of course the people who invaded</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq who planned the invasion or</v>

491
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:55.840
<v Speaker 1>we're at least nominally committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians and I thought,</v>

492
00:31:55.841 --> 00:31:56.674
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took out the tyrant like just as </v>

493
00:32:00.101 --> 00:32:01.950
<v Speaker 1>the Hebrews escape from retirement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

494
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.930
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exodus lays it out pretty clearly is you</v>

495
00:32:04.931 --> 00:32:09.880
<v Speaker 1>escaped from tyranny into the desert and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's no joke and it's 40 years,</v>

496
00:32:09.881 --> 00:32:12.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's three generations before the desert</v>

497
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.850
<v Speaker 1>disappears and in the desert there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but inter,</v>

498
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.460
<v Speaker 1>inter tribal warfare and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

499
00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.830
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

500
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:24.580
<v Speaker 1>and the conflict around new emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>

501
00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:25.414
<v Speaker 1>which is of course that the conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the idealization of the golden </v>

502
00:32:29.561 --> 00:32:33.010
<v Speaker 1>calf and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the necessity for the new rules that</v>

503
00:32:33.011 --> 00:32:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Moses imposes.</v>

504
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It's no picnic and then meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the old testament is like that.</v>

505
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been a series of lectures.</v>

506
00:32:40.551 --> 00:32:41.384
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've done 12 lectures on the old </v>

507
00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 1>testament that have actually become </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite popular.</v>

508
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 1>I think the first one has about three </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarters of a million views and I'd been</v>

509
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:55.050
<v Speaker 1>attempting to treat the stories with as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much respect as I can because like you,</v>

510
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I believe that their foundation stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

511
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.850
<v Speaker 1>I would say that my respect for them has</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually grown and,</v>

512
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.833
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my relationship with whatever you </v>

513
00:33:06.321 --> 00:33:08.870
<v Speaker 1>might regard as transcendent has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>improved by that,</v>

514
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:09.763
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>be that as it may even in the story of </v>

515
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

516
00:33:14.691 --> 00:33:17.720
<v Speaker 1>he's called forward by God to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the world.</v>

517
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.730
<v Speaker 1>He's an old man by that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

518
00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:22.280
<v Speaker 1>He's 75 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should have left his family,</v>

519
00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:26.060
<v Speaker 1>his father's house and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his kinsmen long before.</v>

520
00:33:26.061 --> 00:33:29.990
<v Speaker 1>But God calls him on an adventure to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>out into the land of the stranger and to</v>

521
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.490
<v Speaker 1>leave his home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

522
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.430
<v Speaker 1>it just goes terribly badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Abraham,</v>

523
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:36.800
<v Speaker 1>it means the first thing he encounters </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a famine.</v>

524
00:33:36.801 --> 00:33:38.960
<v Speaker 1>And then he moves into the tyranny of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>

525
00:33:38.961 --> 00:33:39.794
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

526
00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:40.763
<v Speaker 1>the Pharaoh takes his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's one of the things that you can </v>

527
00:33:45.171 --> 00:33:46.004
<v Speaker 1>say about the old testament is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not easily optimistic in any sense of </v>

528
00:33:49.731 --> 00:33:50.564
<v Speaker 1>the word,</v>

529
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:57.040
<v Speaker 3>but the Passover story kind of is as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's as people observe it,</v>

530
00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:02.540
<v Speaker 3>like when you read the Passover story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just this nice part and that,</v>

531
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:06.510
<v Speaker 3>like I say that other part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that later chapter,</v>

532
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:10.090
<v Speaker 3>we never discussed that at Passover and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

533
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:12.360
<v Speaker 3>the closest will come as 40 years in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>desert.</v>

534
00:34:12.361 --> 00:34:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't know that the Jews </v>
<v Speaker 3>wandered the desert for 40 years.</v>

535
00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:18.180
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know they kill each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

536
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.493
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is something that's similar to </v>

537
00:34:20.791 --> 00:34:21.624
<v Speaker 3>the Ramayana because the Ramayana is </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently told without the last </v>

538
00:34:25.561 --> 00:34:27.110
<v Speaker 3>chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without the authority Aconda,</v>

539
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:28.980
<v Speaker 3>which is the difficult part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

540
00:34:28.981 --> 00:34:32.490
<v Speaker 3>Which I think is the richest and most </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting part of the whole story.</v>

541
00:34:32.491 --> 00:34:34.770
<v Speaker 3>So I focused on it in Sita sings the </v>
<v Speaker 3>blues.</v>

542
00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:36.243
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

543
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.980
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that what</v>

544
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.823
<v Speaker 3>the most valuable parts of these stories</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the most difficult and other parts </v>

545
00:34:43.951 --> 00:34:46.230
<v Speaker 3>that are left out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't know about.</v>

546
00:34:46.231 --> 00:34:47.370
<v Speaker 3>You have to actually read them.</v>

547
00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.473
<v Speaker 1>It will be the most useful parts because</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is full of difficulty and so with </v>

548
00:34:53.051 --> 00:34:53.884
<v Speaker 1>you over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you leap over the parts of the </v>

549
00:34:56.741 --> 00:35:01.540
<v Speaker 1>stories that are pessimistic and dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you missed part of what the stories</v>

550
00:35:01.541 --> 00:35:04.870
<v Speaker 1>are trying to teach you about how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepare for catastrophe mean it says,</v>

551
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:05.853
<v Speaker 1>obviously in the exodus story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the Hebrews escaped from </v>

552
00:35:09.851 --> 00:35:13.420
<v Speaker 1>tyranny is presented as a good segue and</v>
<v Speaker 1>even as something that God wills,</v>

553
00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.283
<v Speaker 1>but it's by no means a straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 1>passage from tyranny to the promised </v>

554
00:35:19.361 --> 00:35:19.861
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

555
00:35:19.861 --> 00:35:22.420
<v Speaker 1>in Moses doesn't make it to the promised</v>
<v Speaker 1>land right here.</v>

556
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.100
<v Speaker 1>He dies before he gets there.</v>

557
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even the promised land is not nearly</v>

558
00:35:27.601 --> 00:35:31.950
<v Speaker 3>as much fun as it's been as we have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>led to believe,</v>

559
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:32.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're,</v>

560
00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:36.150
<v Speaker 3>they're constantly the Jews that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly falling short.</v>

561
00:35:36.151 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're constantly and God,</v>

562
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.990
<v Speaker 3>they're never getting their shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

563
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.150
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God just keeps,</v>

564
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God's ambivalence towards persists.</v>

565
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:47.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

566
00:35:47.881 --> 00:35:48.714
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

567
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and I also think that's very realistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are very few times in life</v>

568
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:59.121
<v Speaker 1>where even if you're not suffering from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tyranny of other people or yourself,</v>

569
00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:02.010
<v Speaker 1>that it's very difficult to walk the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper,</v>

570
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.873
<v Speaker 1>straight and narrow path and to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything organized and to keep things </v>

571
00:36:05.311 --> 00:36:06.144
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Property.</v>

572
00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.053
<v Speaker 1>And there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never any shortage of severe </v>

573
00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:10.930
<v Speaker 1>challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

574
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.230
<v Speaker 1>So in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're chosen by God,</v>

575
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:14.064
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no shortage of severe </v>

576
00:36:15.031 --> 00:36:15.864
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also see that in all the other </v>

577
00:36:17.311 --> 00:36:19.000
<v Speaker 1>stories in the Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

578
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.593
<v Speaker 1>even when God is walking with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say like Abraham or Noah for that </v>

579
00:36:25.021 --> 00:36:25.854
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty still pretty much nonstop </v>

580
00:36:27.961 --> 00:36:28.920
<v Speaker 1>carnage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

581
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.510
<v Speaker 1>noah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noah has his family together and um,</v>

582
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.130
<v Speaker 1>his generations are perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

583
00:36:35.131 --> 00:36:37.950
<v Speaker 1>And he walks with God so he's properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented in the world,</v>

584
00:36:37.951 --> 00:36:42.951
<v Speaker 1>but he still has to build the Ark and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get through the damn storm and,</v>

585
00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:44.570
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

586
00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.460
<v Speaker 1>and be humiliated by his children at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

587
00:36:47.461 --> 00:36:49.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

588
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.440
<v Speaker 1>it's very rough business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the,</v>

589
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:53.900
<v Speaker 1>in one of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

590
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.780
<v Speaker 1>shorts and I don't know the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the one where the,</v>

591
00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.673
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's the one that specifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>deals with the Passover where the </v>

592
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian firstborns are all killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

593
00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that one called?</v>

594
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.650
<v Speaker 3>Death of the firstborn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Egyptians go,</v>

595
00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:08.180
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>

596
00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.620
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And appropriate title.</v>

597
00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.473
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but harbored the suspicion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had a fair bit of sympathy for </v>

598
00:37:14.961 --> 00:37:16.100
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians.</v>

599
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

600
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:21.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had some great art.</v>

601
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:23.563
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

602
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do a wonderful job by the way of</v>

603
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:26.634
<v Speaker 1>incorporating that into that film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not wanting to spectacularly </v>

604
00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:30.414
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

605
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Well thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they had religion and uh,</v>

606
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:42.000
<v Speaker 3>so doing visual research for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>project,</v>

607
00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.713
<v Speaker 3>there was not a lot of really great </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient Hebrew art possibly or probably </v>

608
00:37:50.431 --> 00:37:54.360
<v Speaker 3>because it's against the religion to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make art.</v>

609
00:37:54.361 --> 00:37:56.340
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to make graven </v>
<v Speaker 3>images.</v>

610
00:37:56.341 --> 00:37:57.174
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of coming up with a style that </v>

611
00:38:01.081 --> 00:38:04.170
<v Speaker 3>evoked this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to,</v>

612
00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:06.810
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at art from the region and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

613
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.210
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all Egyptian and Syrian.</v>

614
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:13.290
<v Speaker 3>Those are the ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the people there that made the</v>

615
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:14.124
<v Speaker 3>art fantastic art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It breaks my heart that that's supposed </v>

616
00:38:19.711 --> 00:38:20.700
<v Speaker 3>to be evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

617
00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:21.331
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

618
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:22.164
<v Speaker 3>that art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which actually moves me when I look at </v>

619
00:38:23.971 --> 00:38:27.450
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what we're supposed to smash,</v>

620
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:28.111
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

621
00:38:28.111 --> 00:38:28.944
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we're commanded to destroy </v>

622
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.850
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all full of idols.</v>

623
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

624
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.143
<v Speaker 3>I'm not down with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just naturally was going to </v>

625
00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:41.520
<v Speaker 3>sympathize with the Egyptians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is all we'll do.</v>

626
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:46.880
<v Speaker 1>There's a real tension there that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is worth thinking about,</v>

627
00:38:46.881 --> 00:38:47.714
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I understand why from a </v>

628
00:38:50.761 --> 00:38:51.594
<v Speaker 1>psychological perspective and understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>why there was an injunction against </v>

629
00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:57.170
<v Speaker 1>making images and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the same thing,</v>

630
00:38:57.171 --> 00:39:00.870
<v Speaker 1>kept it out right now with isis say in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East where they're destroying</v>

631
00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:01.830
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

632
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.790
<v Speaker 1>all the great Buddhist art and all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient monuments,</v>

633
00:39:05.791 --> 00:39:09.090
<v Speaker 1>which of course is an absolute and utter</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>

634
00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.493
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

635
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.393
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were following it better </v>

636
00:39:13.281 --> 00:39:14.114
<v Speaker 3>than we do.</v>

637
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

638
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:15.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

639
00:39:15.901 --> 00:39:20.220
<v Speaker 1>so the conundrum seems to me to be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is also played out in the story</v>

640
00:39:20.221 --> 00:39:23.230
<v Speaker 1>of exodus with the golden calf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that no,</v>

641
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the idea of God is supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something at least in principle,</v>

642
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.533
<v Speaker 1>that you can't really grip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't really encapsulate that </v>

643
00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.093
<v Speaker 1>know that you can't dogmatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent because then it turns into an </v>

644
00:39:33.721 --> 00:39:37.380
<v Speaker 1>idol and an article in etiology are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>much the same thing.</v>

645
00:39:37.381 --> 00:39:39.930
<v Speaker 1>And I think ideology is terribly </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

646
00:39:39.931 --> 00:39:42.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you take something concrete like</v>

647
00:39:42.271 --> 00:39:44.050
<v Speaker 1>an axiom of some sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

648
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.983
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

649
00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:45.893
<v Speaker 1>that's very concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you make that your highest </v>

650
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.233
<v Speaker 1>value and it narrows you and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and restricts you and also makes you </v>

651
00:39:51.211 --> 00:39:52.044
<v Speaker 1>incredibly dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that there's a great </v>

652
00:39:55.711 --> 00:39:59.670
<v Speaker 1>danger in idolization I think is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very,</v>

653
00:39:59.671 --> 00:40:00.504
<v Speaker 1>very powerful notion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's what informed the </v>

654
00:40:03.001 --> 00:40:03.834
<v Speaker 1>restrictions against making graven </v>
<v Speaker 1>images of God because you end up </v>

655
00:40:07.321 --> 00:40:10.770
<v Speaker 1>confusing the image with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent reality.</v>

656
00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:11.663
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think that you understand </v>

657
00:40:12.511 --> 00:40:13.344
<v Speaker 1>it and you have it in your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly does seem to have some </v>

658
00:40:16.381 --> 00:40:17.214
<v Speaker 1>pretty dramatically negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences when the consequence of </v>

659
00:40:20.371 --> 00:40:23.790
<v Speaker 1>that is the absence of visual arc in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound sense.</v>

660
00:40:23.791 --> 00:40:28.791
<v Speaker 1>And also this injunction to destroy the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idols of well of the foreigner or,</v>

661
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.510
<v Speaker 1>or of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the person who's heretical or,</v>

662
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.030
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

663
00:40:35.031 --> 00:40:37.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure how to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>

664
00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure what the mediating </v>
<v Speaker 1>path is between those two extremes and I</v>

665
00:40:43.001 --> 00:40:44.500
<v Speaker 1>think a real artist and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

666
00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

667
00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think that you belong in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that category is someone who isn't using</v>

668
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.373
<v Speaker 1>idols as representation because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>using your artistic talent to push </v>

669
00:40:56.701 --> 00:40:57.534
<v Speaker 1>beyond what you already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a form of exploration rather </v>

670
00:41:00.151 --> 00:41:04.680
<v Speaker 1>than a form of Canada [inaudible] or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or categorization,</v>

671
00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:05.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

672
00:41:05.191 --> 00:41:06.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

673
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a journey into the unknown and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extension of the way that people think.</v>

674
00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:14.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think of that as a way of uniting </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the transcendent rather than trying</v>

675
00:41:14.521 --> 00:41:17.880
<v Speaker 1>to encapsulate it in some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate box.</v>

676
00:41:17.881 --> 00:41:21.870
<v Speaker 1>But there is a great danger of that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of formula formulization.</v>

677
00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:23.760
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

678
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.753
<v Speaker 3>there is that danger and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is of course the commonest </v>

679
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:31.700
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of the injunction against</v>
<v Speaker 3>idols.</v>

680
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:35.770
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

681
00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.630
<v Speaker 3>it's never borne out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

682
00:41:37.631 --> 00:41:42.631
<v Speaker 3>It's like any injunction against that </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a idolatry has never resulted in</v>

683
00:41:46.361 --> 00:41:49.570
<v Speaker 3>the absence of idolatry ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

684
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.270
<v Speaker 3>and we can clearly do it with abstract </v>
<v Speaker 3>concepts.</v>

685
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.133
<v Speaker 3>We can clearly do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a clearly don't need images to </v>

686
00:41:55.331 --> 00:41:56.164
<v Speaker 3>do this.</v>

687
00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:59.890
<v Speaker 1>You could argue that you could do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with words just as effectively</v>

688
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:05.230
<v Speaker 3>you never have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if it doesn't work,</v>

689
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.220
<v Speaker 3>I wondered while I was working on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>film,</v>

690
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:11.683
<v Speaker 3>whether it might have been a simple and </v>
<v Speaker 3>misunderstood injunction against using </v>

691
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.053
<v Speaker 3>Egyptian hieroglyphics and that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a requirement to use submitted </v>

692
00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:22.903
<v Speaker 3>written language rather than Egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Egyptian hieroglyphics are full </v>

693
00:42:27.351 --> 00:42:32.330
<v Speaker 3>of things that fly in the air and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that crawl on the ground and things that</v>

694
00:42:32.331 --> 00:42:34.940
<v Speaker 3>swim in the sea and men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that stuff.</v>

695
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.440
<v Speaker 3>Because I was working on these little </v>
<v Speaker 3>animated hieroglyphs and I was like,</v>

696
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:40.220
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was just this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which would have made sense,</v>

697
00:42:40.221 --> 00:42:41.180
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because</v>

698
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:43.873
<v Speaker 3>because anti-depression when when these </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories were written down and they were </v>

699
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.440
<v Speaker 3>promoting the Semitic language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you were supposed to use.</v>

700
00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Well now we've put it in some sense in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same categories,</v>

701
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.120
<v Speaker 1>the dietary prescriptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

702
00:42:55.121 --> 00:42:55.954
<v Speaker 1>Because the best evidence for the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those dietary prescriptions isn't </v>

703
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.980
<v Speaker 1>hygiene or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's don't eat the food that you're,</v>

704
00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:06.220
<v Speaker 1>that the people who worship other gods </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

705
00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a variety of,</v>

706
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.010
<v Speaker 1>of useful reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly one of them.</v>

707
00:43:12.011 --> 00:43:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

708
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:14.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a price at an advantages that </v>

709
00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.153
<v Speaker 1>the people you eat with your kinsmen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your tribesmen pretty much by </v>

710
00:43:21.251 --> 00:43:23.560
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you share a pallet,</v>

711
00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:27.040
<v Speaker 1>if you share a menu and there and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>share it restrictions,</v>

712
00:43:27.041 --> 00:43:27.874
<v Speaker 1>it's much easier for you to socialize </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the people who have the same </v>

713
00:43:30.011 --> 00:43:30.844
<v Speaker 1>restrictions that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to be a reasonably </v>

714
00:43:33.011 --> 00:43:35.330
<v Speaker 1>intelligent way of keeping your culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>cohesive.</v>

715
00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:36.483
<v Speaker 1>While it certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly worked for a very long </v>

716
00:43:38.261 --> 00:43:43.090
<v Speaker 1>period of time so that that would be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that's in keeping with that,</v>

717
00:43:43.091 --> 00:43:43.924
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You certainly don't use the idol </v>

718
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.233
<v Speaker 1>representations of the people who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not because then you integrate with </v>

719
00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:52.930
<v Speaker 1>them and your and your culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappears.</v>

720
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you don't use their language and you</v>

721
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:55.634
<v Speaker 3>don't use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't write down things that they </v>

722
00:43:56.781 --> 00:43:57.614
<v Speaker 3>can read.</v>

723
00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:03.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so much of these books of Moses were</v>

724
00:44:03.271 --> 00:44:05.160
<v Speaker 3>about being different from your </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighbors.</v>

725
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Like don't let your neighbors corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are different from your neighbors.</v>

726
00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:11.310
<v Speaker 3>And interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was raised with that,</v>

727
00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my father,</v>

728
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.183
<v Speaker 3>the atheist Jew was adamant about</v>
<v Speaker 3>not doing the Christmas things when I </v>

729
00:44:22.051 --> 00:44:24.130
<v Speaker 3>went to school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

730
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.553
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have Christmas projects in </v>

731
00:44:27.211 --> 00:44:30.360
<v Speaker 3>the winter and he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just tell your teacher you don't have to</v>

732
00:44:30.361 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 3>do this project,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're Jewish.</v>

733
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.233
<v Speaker 3>He never said you don't have to do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>project because you're an atheist just </v>

734
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:37.130
<v Speaker 3>because you're Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

735
00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.113
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we maintain some sort of </v>

736
00:44:40.081 --> 00:44:45.081
<v Speaker 3>difference in spite of not actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>practicing Jewish religion.</v>

737
00:44:46.321 --> 00:44:47.154
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

738
00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the things that's </v>

739
00:44:48.651 --> 00:44:51.680
<v Speaker 1>always been interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me about Judaism,</v>

740
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:55.420
<v Speaker 1>particularly in a mystery I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

741
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.393
<v Speaker 1>I think there are very many ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>believing in God and one way of </v>

742
00:45:00.201 --> 00:45:05.201
<v Speaker 1>believing is conscious and that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of belief that you can state as</v>

743
00:45:07.131 --> 00:45:07.964
<v Speaker 1>I believe or I don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think in some sense that's the </v>

744
00:45:11.271 --> 00:45:14.940
<v Speaker 1>weakest form of belief and it's also the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that's most easily undermined.</v>

745
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:16.423
<v Speaker 1>I think the more profound forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief or ones that you act out there </v>

746
00:45:20.241 --> 00:45:21.074
<v Speaker 1>like a dance in some sense and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>built into your behavioral coding and </v>

747
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:25.873
<v Speaker 1>they're not so easily criticized and </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermined because they don't really </v>

748
00:45:28.371 --> 00:45:30.890
<v Speaker 1>operate at an intellectual level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

749
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>

750
00:45:32.241 --> 00:45:36.820
<v Speaker 1>watching your videos</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not,</v>

751
00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:40.010
<v Speaker 1>they're not reduceable to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual exercise.</v>

752
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:41.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't watch them.</v>

753
00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:45.560
<v Speaker 1>And first of all I can't say exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that you're up to.</v>

754
00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.113
<v Speaker 1>And even if I could lay out a reasonably</v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive description of what you </v>

755
00:45:50.301 --> 00:45:51.051
<v Speaker 1>are up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

756
00:45:51.051 --> 00:45:51.884
<v Speaker 1>which would be by no means complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be easy for me to mountain </v>

757
00:45:54.891 --> 00:45:59.330
<v Speaker 1>intellectual attack on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because because of your use use of dance</v>

758
00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:00.223
<v Speaker 1>in some sense with the catapults and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your use of imagery in your use of </v>

759
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.333
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it it puts the entire discussion on a </v>

760
00:46:06.951 --> 00:46:10.940
<v Speaker 1>plane that can't be easily reducible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an intellectual discussion.</v>

761
00:46:10.941 --> 00:46:14.810
<v Speaker 1>And so in Judaism you see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the case,</v>

762
00:46:14.811 --> 00:46:15.644
<v Speaker 1>I think with the atheist Jews perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>most self evidently is that the rituals </v>

763
00:46:20.781 --> 00:46:21.614
<v Speaker 1>are kept in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The division is kept and the encoded </v>

764
00:46:23.811 --> 00:46:27.140
<v Speaker 1>actions are kept and the person might </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

765
00:46:27.141 --> 00:46:28.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in God,</v>

766
00:46:28.491 --> 00:46:31.490
<v Speaker 1>and the proper objection to that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be something like,</v>

767
00:46:31.491 --> 00:46:32.324
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say that you don't believe in </v>

768
00:46:34.221 --> 00:46:35.870
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you sure acted out.</v>

769
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:38.840
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

770
00:46:38.841 --> 00:46:40.940
<v Speaker 1>people have asked me about my religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>

771
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:45.540
<v Speaker 1>which is a question that I find quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrusive and I'm not that.</v>

772
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:46.403
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that people don't have the right to </v>

773
00:46:47.391 --> 00:46:50.540
<v Speaker 1>ask it because they certainly do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean I'm,</v>

774
00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.153
<v Speaker 1>I'm sufficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ignorant about my own orientations </v>

775
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.180
<v Speaker 1>in some sense to not know exactly how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer that.</v>

776
00:46:59.181 --> 00:47:04.181
<v Speaker 1>But one answer that I find quite useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think fairly truthfulness that are</v>

777
00:47:04.631 --> 00:47:09.631
<v Speaker 1>certainly act as if there's a god and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the rest of it I leave I suppose in</v>

778
00:47:11.121 --> 00:47:15.290
<v Speaker 1>some sense in a cloud of an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of as,</v>

779
00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:16.124
<v Speaker 1>of yet into bleakly explored ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I do believe that human beings </v>

780
00:47:20.451 --> 00:47:22.490
<v Speaker 1>have a relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent.</v>

781
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Now I see that manifest itself in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in great art,</v>

782
00:47:25.791 --> 00:47:26.624
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people seem to be able to reach </v>

783
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:32.080
<v Speaker 1>beyond to produce something that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular,</v>

784
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:32.943
<v Speaker 1>lasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense emotional and practical </v>

785
00:47:35.111 --> 00:47:35.920
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>

786
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the realm of inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

787
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:38.644
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that we understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that very well at all and I don't think </v>

788
00:47:41.601 --> 00:47:45.970
<v Speaker 1>that we understand consciousness very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as well at all in stockton.</v>

789
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it is a fundamental element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being so.</v>

790
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.030
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is interesting and it in,</v>

791
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:54.480
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your work too,</v>

792
00:47:54.481 --> 00:47:55.314
<v Speaker 1>like I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to hear you talk about </v>

793
00:47:57.761 --> 00:48:00.250
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a profound religious,</v>

794
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:02.490
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

795
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:05.223
<v Speaker 1>well I see a profound religious spirit </v>
<v Speaker 1>at work and it's so interesting to me </v>

796
00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:09.793
<v Speaker 1>that your experience of reading exodus </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also doing these animations has </v>

797
00:48:13.361 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 1>actually for you being an increased </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of divorce from the,</v>

798
00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.240
<v Speaker 1>from let's say the realities of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>text.</v>

799
00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know that.</v>

800
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:27.230
<v Speaker 3>So the word I use to describe it as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was bereft,</v>

801
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:29.253
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after spending all this time with them </v>

802
00:48:31.591 --> 00:48:33.420
<v Speaker 3>because the more time I met with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tests,</v>

803
00:48:33.421 --> 00:48:35.340
<v Speaker 3>the more time I spent working on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

804
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.413
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the other less connected to </v>

805
00:48:39.811 --> 00:48:44.811
<v Speaker 3>anything I would call God I felt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And after I finished those scenes,</v>

806
00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:51.590
<v Speaker 3>it took me a really long time to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>inspiration for finishing the film.</v>

807
00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:59.090
<v Speaker 3>I guess I finished the last scene of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Moses parts a year and a half ago</v>

808
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.073
<v Speaker 3>and I just could not continue working on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the film because I was thinking like </v>

809
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:04.643
<v Speaker 3>more Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more old testament and it just made me </v>

810
00:49:07.021 --> 00:49:10.650
<v Speaker 3>feel sick every time I approached it.</v>

811
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:12.763
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible just out of curiosity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that was a form of something like </v>

812
00:49:15.951 --> 00:49:18.360
<v Speaker 1>spiritual exhaustion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it'd be.</v>

813
00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Your films are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very serious and they're,</v>

814
00:49:21.411 --> 00:49:22.244
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're very complex and so I kind </v>

815
00:49:25.161 --> 00:49:27.450
<v Speaker 1>of wonder too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is if you just haven't like,</v>

816
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:29.300
<v Speaker 1>drained yourself of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

817
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.600
<v Speaker 1>of inspiration as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on this for so long.</v>

818
00:49:32.601 --> 00:49:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very complex,</v>

819
00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.980
<v Speaker 1>deep themes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

820
00:49:36.981 --> 00:49:37.814
<v Speaker 1>they do sit at the bottom of the culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's no joke to mess around with </v>

821
00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:41.444
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

822
00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.950
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I now see what I was missing.</v>

823
00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:46.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

824
00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:49.970
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my Muse has returned so I,</v>

825
00:49:49.971 --> 00:49:52.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could say that I'm not religious,</v>

826
00:49:52.221 --> 00:49:53.054
<v Speaker 3>but I clearly practice like a religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>person because I have a Mus and I'm </v>

827
00:49:56.301 --> 00:49:57.134
<v Speaker 3>inspired by my muse and I have faith in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my muse and I even have prayer that I </v>

828
00:49:59.931 --> 00:50:02.090
<v Speaker 3>say to my muse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

829
00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

830
00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:04.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

831
00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:09.740
<v Speaker 3>that's a sort of religious lifestyle or</v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual one anyway.</v>

832
00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:10.891
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

833
00:50:10.891 --> 00:50:11.311
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

834
00:50:11.311 --> 00:50:15.230
<v Speaker 1>And so you said that you even prayed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

835
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me about the muse.</v>

836
00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:17.971
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

837
00:50:17.971 --> 00:50:19.590
<v Speaker 3>would you like to hear it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Muse prayer?</v>

838
00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:21.930
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely amusing.</v>

839
00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:22.853
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our idea which art in the ether that be </v>

840
00:50:27.601 --> 00:50:28.434
<v Speaker 3>named by vision come by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll be done on earth as it is an </v>

841
00:50:32.791 --> 00:50:35.700
<v Speaker 3>abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give us this day,</v>

842
00:50:35.701 --> 00:50:36.534
<v Speaker 3>our daily spark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and forgive us our criticisms as we </v>

843
00:50:39.391 --> 00:50:44.391
<v Speaker 3>forgive those who critique against us </v>
<v Speaker 3>and lead us not into stagnation,</v>

844
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.350
<v Speaker 3>but deliver us from ego for dynasty </v>
<v Speaker 3>division,</v>

845
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:50.910
<v Speaker 3>the power and the glory forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amen.</v>

846
00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:58.600
<v Speaker 1>That certainly seems to me to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think of that as a,</v>

847
00:50:58.690 --> 00:50:59.523
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mantra to open up the gateway between </v>

848
00:51:02.481 --> 00:51:06.200
<v Speaker 1>you and this transcendent forest that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows people religious inspiration.</v>

849
00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're doing something like clearing</v>

850
00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:09.134
<v Speaker 1>out your ego and I think it is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting that it's associated with </v>

851
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.990
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

852
00:51:13.991 --> 00:51:15.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lord's prayer,</v>

853
00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.340
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

854
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:22.790
<v Speaker 1>you make this interesting identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>between criticism and temptation.</v>

855
00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.560
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In one of the things,</v>

856
00:51:24.561 --> 00:51:27.800
<v Speaker 1>of course it does interfere with </v>
<v Speaker 1>stagnation.</v>

857
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yes,</v>

858
00:51:29.931 --> 00:51:32.540
<v Speaker 1>but deliver us from criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you something you,</v>

859
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.713
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Faded,</v>

860
00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:36.250
<v Speaker 3>but deliver us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait,</v>

861
00:51:36.251 --> 00:51:38.160
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but deliver us from ego.</v>

862
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.863
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will forgive us our criticisms as we </v>

863
00:51:42.301 --> 00:51:43.330
<v Speaker 3>forgive those who critique.</v>

864
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.633
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that well and the criticism that </v>

865
00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:46.883
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting element of it </v>

866
00:51:47.791 --> 00:51:48.624
<v Speaker 1>too because it's often the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I teach my </v>

867
00:51:51.691 --> 00:51:52.524
<v Speaker 1>students when they're writing is to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>a critical spirit the hell out of the </v>

868
00:51:54.871 --> 00:51:56.430
<v Speaker 1>way to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

869
00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:57.353
<v Speaker 1>because what people try to do is produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>and edit at the same time and you </v>

870
00:52:00.901 --> 00:52:01.734
<v Speaker 1>actually can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you have to do is open yourself up </v>

871
00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:04.793
<v Speaker 1>to the to the to to the creative process</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of its errors because when you </v>

872
00:52:10.381 --> 00:52:11.214
<v Speaker 1>first start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be very much error </v>

873
00:52:12.301 --> 00:52:13.134
<v Speaker 1>written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to allow yourself to </v>

874
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:15.833
<v Speaker 1>manifest that ever written spark of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity to begin with and keep the </v>

875
00:52:20.071 --> 00:52:24.990
<v Speaker 1>criticism at bay and also the ego </v>
<v Speaker 1>element I think is extremely interesting</v>

876
00:52:24.991 --> 00:52:25.824
<v Speaker 1>because to the degree that you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bend your artistic production to the </v>

877
00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:34.110
<v Speaker 1>proximal demands of your ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you actually.</v>

878
00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:38.100
<v Speaker 1>You've polluted you propaganda is it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you reduce it.</v>

879
00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.550
<v Speaker 1>I would say to something like an idol </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it then it.</v>

880
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:41.703
<v Speaker 1>Then it's to serve some other master </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than whatever it is that is </v>

881
00:52:45.391 --> 00:52:47.610
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be in some sense flowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>through you.</v>

882
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:52.343
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a real problem doing work for </v>

883
00:52:54.991 --> 00:52:59.130
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love money and what I like to do is do</v>

884
00:52:59.131 --> 00:53:01.770
<v Speaker 3>my work and then encourage people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>send me money.</v>

885
00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:07.590
<v Speaker 3>But the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole thing where somebody says,</v>

886
00:53:07.591 --> 00:53:09.540
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you this money if you do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

887
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:10.853
<v Speaker 3>I've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just called being a professional </v>

888
00:53:12.721 --> 00:53:16.580
<v Speaker 3>artist and it never works out for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

889
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.670
<v Speaker 3>I did this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a segment of this commercial film.</v>

890
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ironically it was Kahlil Gibran,</v>

891
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.180
<v Speaker 3>the profit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

892
00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:30.240
<v Speaker 3>all animated and I did it for money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got paid well.</v>

893
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:31.403
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was never going to animate </v>
<v Speaker 3>again after that because it burned me </v>

894
00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:34.344
<v Speaker 3>out so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a really unpleasant process </v>

895
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:40.500
<v Speaker 3>because the authority in this was not my</v>
<v Speaker 3>muse.</v>

896
00:53:40.501 --> 00:53:42.660
<v Speaker 3>The authority was the people with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

897
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:43.733
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

898
00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:47.770
<v Speaker 1>The money you subjugating the greater to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lesser.</v>

899
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if I do that even a little bit,</v>

900
00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:55.120
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the feeling is horrible and I can.</v>

901
00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:59.720
<v Speaker 3>I liken it to how I imagine </v>
<v Speaker 3>prostitution,</v>

902
00:53:59.721 --> 00:54:02.630
<v Speaker 3>like all the warnings about prostitution</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what it,</v>

903
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:06.500
<v Speaker 3>what it does to your soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you think it's Hunky Dory.</v>

904
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

905
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:11.870
<v Speaker 3>I can relate to that when I do the work </v>
<v Speaker 3>for money,</v>

906
00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:15.170
<v Speaker 3>it's really different than when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

907
00:54:15.171 --> 00:54:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

908
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So which of your prayer.</v>

909
00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.910
<v Speaker 1>So now you've modified the Lord's </v>
<v Speaker 1>prayer.</v>

910
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so did you write that down?</v>

911
00:54:24.791 --> 00:54:25.624
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how in the world did you come up with </v>

912
00:54:26.621 --> 00:54:28.750
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for actually telling me.</v>

913
00:54:28.751 --> 00:54:29.584
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite amazed that you did because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course it's a peculiar thing and I mean </v>

914
00:54:33.101 --> 00:54:33.934
<v Speaker 1>that in the best possible sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems also to be quite a private </v>

915
00:54:36.971 --> 00:54:37.804
<v Speaker 1>thing</v>

916
00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:39.913
<v Speaker 3>out about it since,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the thing with the blues is it </v>

917
00:54:41.901 --> 00:54:46.901
<v Speaker 3>was such a profoundly weird experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>making that film and it was so much like</v>

918
00:54:48.111 --> 00:54:51.200
<v Speaker 3>the channeling and it was so much just </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting out of my own way.</v>

919
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:53.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I,</v>

920
00:54:53.231 --> 00:54:56.420
<v Speaker 3>I did want to share that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean because people would ask me these</v>

921
00:54:56.421 --> 00:54:58.080
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how did you make that?</v>

922
00:54:58.081 --> 00:54:59.960
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't ever really know,</v>

923
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said you got out of your own way,</v>

924
00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:07.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of the things that,</v>

925
00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:10.330
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've been struck by with regards to</v>

926
00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.193
<v Speaker 1>both the prophetic tradition in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament and also the passion story in </v>

927
00:55:15.731 --> 00:55:18.250
<v Speaker 1>the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a tremendous emphasis in</v>

928
00:55:18.251 --> 00:55:21.550
<v Speaker 1>those stories are on getting out of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own way,</v>

929
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the idea is supposed to be.</v>

930
00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:27.310
<v Speaker 1>This is part of the idea of the dying </v>
<v Speaker 1>and resurrected hero of course,</v>

931
00:55:27.311 --> 00:55:31.240
<v Speaker 1>is that you're supposed to let </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in you that gets in your way,</v>

932
00:55:31.241 --> 00:55:36.241
<v Speaker 1>burn away and die so that whatever can </v>
<v Speaker 1>flow through you that,</v>

933
00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:40.180
<v Speaker 1>that has true value and that's oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the highest good,</v>

934
00:55:40.181 --> 00:55:41.014
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I think is what you're doing when </v>

935
00:55:42.371 --> 00:55:44.470
<v Speaker 1>you're establishing a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your muse,</v>

936
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:47.740
<v Speaker 1>is that there isn't anything that's part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Ego,</v>

937
00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:51.700
<v Speaker 1>part of that critical capacity that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's inappropriate or part of,</v>

938
00:55:51.701 --> 00:55:54.880
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldly concerns that's interfering with</v>

939
00:55:54.881 --> 00:55:58.290
<v Speaker 1>your ability to reach beyond yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

940
00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a holy calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's.</v>

941
00:56:00.881 --> 00:56:03.550
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's the primary holy calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

942
00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:04.970
<v Speaker 1>I certainly think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

943
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:05.833
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me to be the case and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think in some sense that's what </v>

944
00:56:08.621 --> 00:56:11.440
<v Speaker 1>artists act out when they're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>being artists because they're,</v>

945
00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:15.880
<v Speaker 1>they're establishing a relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the source of inspiration,</v>

946
00:56:15.881 --> 00:56:16.714
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like we understand that we </v>

947
00:56:19.121 --> 00:56:21.010
<v Speaker 1>don't understand that it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>

948
00:56:21.011 --> 00:56:21.844
<v Speaker 1>very deep.</v>

949
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:23.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

950
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Or I</v>

951
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.843
<v Speaker 1>do believe if I have beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that regarding it as </v>

952
00:56:29.111 --> 00:56:29.944
<v Speaker 1>something that comes from elsewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something bigger than yourself is for </v>

953
00:56:33.011 --> 00:56:33.940
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helpful.</v>

954
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:35.441
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

955
00:56:35.441 --> 00:56:36.274
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this idea that it's all me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm connected to other people and </v>

956
00:56:40.571 --> 00:56:41.404
<v Speaker 1>connected through culture and through </v>
<v Speaker 1>language which is culture and through </v>

957
00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:44.860
<v Speaker 1>art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is culture.</v>

958
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm just like a fish swimming in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sea of culture on a,</v>

959
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:51.453
<v Speaker 1>what we call creating is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbing and processing all of this </v>

960
00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:03.060
<v Speaker 1>culture that I'm a part of and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing a little bit out.</v>

961
00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm very dubious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of originality.</v>

962
00:57:06.461 --> 00:57:09.250
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote an essay about that,</v>

963
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:14.650
<v Speaker 1>the cult of originality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's delusional.</v>

964
00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe difficult part of the originality </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea is that it's it,</v>

965
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:20.623
<v Speaker 1>it's tied up with ego</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that people can be </v>

966
00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:25.324
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly original,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if you give to </v>

967
00:57:27.251 --> 00:57:29.160
<v Speaker 1>attribute that to their ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

968
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Tibet part of them that you call me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind is a very strange place because</v>

969
00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:39.690
<v Speaker 1>there's obviously a part of it that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we identify with as ourselves.</v>

970
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.593
<v Speaker 1>That would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that would be the ego and it's </v>

971
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:43.003
<v Speaker 1>obviously it and it's the thing I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is capable of generating eagle </v>

972
00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.473
<v Speaker 1>testicle criticisms and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and standing on principles for self </v>

973
00:57:53.141 --> 00:57:55.750
<v Speaker 1>defense or for dominance display or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

974
00:57:55.751 --> 00:57:56.281
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

975
00:57:56.281 --> 00:58:00.010
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it operates at a relatively low level of</v>

976
00:58:00.011 --> 00:58:00.844
<v Speaker 1>moral virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's parts of us that are </v>

977
00:58:02.651 --> 00:58:05.500
<v Speaker 1>obviously far beyond ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

978
00:58:05.501 --> 00:58:07.050
<v Speaker 1>and that's the part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

979
00:58:07.051 --> 00:58:11.140
<v Speaker 1>to generate dreams and visions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even ideas.</v>

980
00:58:11.141 --> 00:58:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things I really liked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about reading curl young,</v>

981
00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:18.070
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he made me really </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious of was the fact that.</v>

982
00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:21.580
<v Speaker 1>And nature of course talked about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the same way.</v>

983
00:58:21.581 --> 00:58:25.600
<v Speaker 1>To some degree is that it's not so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have ideas,</v>

984
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:27.940
<v Speaker 1>it's the one you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

985
00:58:27.941 --> 00:58:30.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sure about that.</v>

986
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:33.310
<v Speaker 1>The ideas have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that,</v>

987
00:58:33.311 --> 00:58:34.630
<v Speaker 1>and then the next thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

988
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:37.450
<v Speaker 1>it isn't so much that you think up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

989
00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:38.493
<v Speaker 1>it's that you encountered them if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>open yourself up to the possibility of </v>

990
00:58:41.861 --> 00:58:42.694
<v Speaker 1>encountering them and it is like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of discovery rather than a </v>

991
00:58:45.671 --> 00:58:47.920
<v Speaker 1>process of origination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

992
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:49.333
<v Speaker 1>And that's also so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're like a biological </v>

993
00:58:52.181 --> 00:58:53.014
<v Speaker 1>materialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I actually don't think you can be </v>

994
00:58:55.391 --> 00:58:59.560
<v Speaker 1>because biological materialism doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>help us account for consciousness in the</v>

995
00:58:59.561 --> 00:59:00.580
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far.</v>

996
00:59:00.581 --> 00:59:02.230
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a good theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

997
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:03.463
<v Speaker 3>You're saying like a biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>materialist theory of consciousness </v>

998
00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:09.340
<v Speaker 3>because I'm a biological materialists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Biology exists.</v>

999
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:10.503
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1000
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:11.510
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1001
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that it provides.</v>

1002
00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.253
<v Speaker 1>It isn't sophisticated enough to provide</v>
<v Speaker 1>answers to some of the most fundamental </v>

1003
00:59:18.081 --> 00:59:20.870
<v Speaker 1>questions about human existence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>

1004
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.211
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1005
00:59:22.211 --> 00:59:23.530
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1006
00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:27.140
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you just expressed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in a creative,</v>

1007
00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:28.323
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're engaging in the creative </v>

1008
00:59:29.301 --> 00:59:31.820
<v Speaker 1>process with whatever it is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>praying to,</v>

1009
00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:36.080
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you're opening yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to something that's beyond you.</v>

1010
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say that that comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep within the human psyche,</v>

1011
00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:43.300
<v Speaker 1>which is a psychoanalytic way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it and,</v>

1012
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.760
<v Speaker 1>and I think a reasonably appropriate way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking about it,</v>

1013
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:47.594
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's any more </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable in some sense than making </v>

1014
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:52.244
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generating the hypothesis that you're </v>

1015
00:59:53.631 --> 00:59:54.464
<v Speaker 1>opening yourself up to unknown forces in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cosmos because I think that's just </v>

1016
00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:03.680
<v Speaker 1>as just as intelligent and account for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomena as the,</v>

1017
01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:05.540
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the former one,</v>

1018
01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:09.110
<v Speaker 1>we are in contact with things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond us.</v>

1019
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>And I do think that that's a large part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what the artist actually demonstrates</v>

1020
01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.433
<v Speaker 1>and keeps and keeps in front of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think beauty in particular is a </v>

1021
01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>powerful force for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1022
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I've watched your videos really,</v>

1023
01:00:23.181 --> 01:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>they are so beautiful that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they virtually bring me to tears.</v>

1024
01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Aw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in combination with the music</v>

1025
01:00:29.511 --> 01:00:30.344
<v Speaker 1>because I'm very sensitive to music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have this unbelievable capacity </v>

1026
01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for grace and for color and for,</v>

1027
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:39.133
<v Speaker 1>and for deep respect for the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is also really quite </v>

1028
01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:43.124
<v Speaker 1>remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your noi often see movies that use </v>

1029
01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>good music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have much respect for the</v>

1030
01:00:49.281 --> 01:00:50.060
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>

1031
01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.020
<v Speaker 1>they'll cut it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1032
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:53.600
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of a phrase or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1033
01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the movie Magnolia was a real</v>

1034
01:00:56.601 --> 01:00:58.690
<v Speaker 1>exception to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1035
01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>that move uses music beautifully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a</v>

1036
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:06.110
<v Speaker 1>woody allen is very good at using music </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautifully.</v>

1037
01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>And so is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1038
01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>who is the director of the shining?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Kimra Kubrick Kubrick.</v>

1039
01:01:12.561 --> 01:01:13.011
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1040
01:01:13.011 --> 01:01:15.580
<v Speaker 1>he loves music and his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1041
01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:16.443
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1042
01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.640
<v Speaker 1>his work a clockwork orange has some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of perverse,</v>

1043
01:01:21.861 --> 01:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>but that some of your animation has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1044
01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:24.953
<v Speaker 1>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used those great beethoven pieces </v>

1045
01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:28.293
<v Speaker 1>that were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were transformed into electronic </v>

1046
01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:35.050
<v Speaker 1>music by Walter Wendy Carlos and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and set these brutal scenes of mayhem to</v>

1047
01:01:36.711 --> 01:01:38.420
<v Speaker 1>beautiful music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was also,</v>

1048
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very profound thing to do.</v>

1049
01:01:40.341 --> 01:01:41.600
<v Speaker 1>It kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1050
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:42.463
<v Speaker 1>of course Germany is the home of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi-ism and it's also the home of </v>

1051
01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.613
<v Speaker 1>Beethoven and Bach and so you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't separate those things in some </v>

1052
01:01:48.321 --> 01:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>sense and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1053
01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:53.630
<v Speaker 1>so let's go to the copyright issue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree now.</v>

1054
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:54.763
<v Speaker 1>Now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a fan of the idea of </v>

1055
01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>copyright and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1056
01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:02.660
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting to me because it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been arguably a reasonably</v>

1057
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:05.143
<v Speaker 1>efficient way for people to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say protect theft of they're </v>

1058
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>protecting themselves from theft if </v>
<v Speaker 1>their intellectual property.</v>

1059
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:12.343
<v Speaker 1>Although I would say that's broken down </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite badly now for people like </v>

1060
01:02:14.661 --> 01:02:18.260
<v Speaker 1>musicians because their work is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributable.</v>

1061
01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:19.663
<v Speaker 1>Are you against copyright for all forms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of intellectual property or why don't </v>

1062
01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>you tell us a little bit about your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ideas?</v>

1063
01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say that is if intellectual property</v>

1064
01:02:29.181 --> 01:02:32.420
<v Speaker 3>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is intellectual property?</v>

1065
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:34.023
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess to some degree I'll take the </v>

1066
01:02:35.411 --> 01:02:37.510
<v Speaker 1>easy way out and say that's a legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

1067
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>but I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1068
01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.490
<v Speaker 1>I would say that at least to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

1069
01:02:42.491 --> 01:02:47.491
<v Speaker 1>intellectual property is the consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of abstract work when you.</v>

1070
01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:50.883
<v Speaker 1>Because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly possible to work </v>

1071
01:02:52.031 --> 01:02:52.864
<v Speaker 1>abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deconstructing something like you're </v>

1072
01:02:54.191 --> 01:02:55.024
<v Speaker 1>constructing your movies or perhaps a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book and it seems to me that it's not </v>

1073
01:02:58.301 --> 01:02:59.134
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable to propose that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserves some of the same ownership </v>

1074
01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:04.400
<v Speaker 1>protection that a physical entity like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1075
01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that there's,</v>

1076
01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:09.003
<v Speaker 1>there's some level of similarity between</v>
<v Speaker 1>you owning your house and not allowing </v>

1077
01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>other people then you owning the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract work that you've done.</v>

1078
01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:17.643
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm certainly not attempting to </v>

1079
01:03:19.901 --> 01:03:22.460
<v Speaker 1>engage you in an argument about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of copyright.</v>

1080
01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I presume that you have a very well </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought through stance on s and m.</v>

1081
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:28.463
<v Speaker 3>well was it begins with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It begins with acknowledging that </v>

1082
01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:34.020
<v Speaker 3>culture is not property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just didn't.</v>

1083
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.930
<v Speaker 3>And what we were just talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few minutes ago where,</v>

1084
01:03:36.931 --> 01:03:38.530
<v Speaker 3>where does this stuff come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1085
01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 3>it comes from something bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves.</v>

1086
01:03:40.051 --> 01:03:41.290
<v Speaker 3>We were just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1087
01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.730
<v Speaker 3>we do not actually originate this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We certainly work,</v>

1088
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:50.580
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't originate any of the work </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm putting out there.</v>

1089
01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just stated it.</v>

1090
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:55.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't own children either.</v>

1091
01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.064
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we let our children go out into the </v>

1092
01:03:57.031 --> 01:03:57.710
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

1093
01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:01.290
<v Speaker 3>if you want to own your child for 96 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and you know,</v>

1094
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:02.610
<v Speaker 3>control everything,</v>

1095
01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.560
<v Speaker 1>well then that serves you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1096
01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:07.370
<v Speaker 1>You get exactly what you deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I do that,</v>

1097
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:10.640
<v Speaker 3>you get a dead trial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically you get a crippled,</v>

1098
01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>non human being.</v>

1099
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.280
<v Speaker 3>And the thing with cultural works is </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1100
01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:18.620
<v Speaker 3>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fish swimming in there,</v>

1101
01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:19.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like water.</v>

1102
01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:22.760
<v Speaker 3>What happens when you enclose water?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes stagnant,</v>

1103
01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.680
<v Speaker 3>it becomes nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes toxic and you know,</v>

1104
01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:28.573
<v Speaker 3>I know that for my own work it has to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>out in the world and it has to continue </v>

1105
01:04:32.721 --> 01:04:33.554
<v Speaker 3>circulating and for me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>copyright interferes with that because </v>

1106
01:04:37.191 --> 01:04:38.750
<v Speaker 3>you put a monopoly around something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

1107
01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.673
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if one person or even if I am licensed </v>

1108
01:04:42.561 --> 01:04:45.620
<v Speaker 3>my copyrights to others when when it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>centrally controlled,</v>

1109
01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:49.130
<v Speaker 3>it does not move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I did a lot of experiments.</v>

1110
01:04:49.131 --> 01:04:49.964
<v Speaker 3>The Sita sings the blues and by far the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best way to get it into the world is to </v>

1111
01:04:54.771 --> 01:04:56.450
<v Speaker 3>just let people carry it into the world.</v>

1112
01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have.</v>

1113
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.983
<v Speaker 1>That's certainly what I've experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well and people are also taking more </v>

1114
01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:04.493
<v Speaker 1>lectures and cutting them into pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not something I expected and </v>

1115
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.050
<v Speaker 1>then putting up pieces of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>length on,</v>

1116
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1117
01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.630
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the net,</v>

1118
01:05:12.631 --> 01:05:14.760
<v Speaker 1>and I've had companies contact me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1119
01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for um,</v>

1120
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>for a fee we'll more or less hunt</v>

1121
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.740
<v Speaker 5>these people down and it's forced your </v>
<v Speaker 5>copyright.</v>

1122
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:22.210
<v Speaker 5>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well no one,</v>

1123
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.193
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm more thinking about the message in </v>

1124
01:05:25.151 --> 01:05:28.450
<v Speaker 5>the bottle approach to this and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>willing to let go where,</v>

1125
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:32.500
<v Speaker 5>where it to let the wind blow where it </v>
<v Speaker 5>wants to blow,</v>

1126
01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:34.180
<v Speaker 5>let's say he could put it that way</v>

1127
01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:35.383
<v Speaker 3>and I'll say if you're making more money</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way because as you just pointed </v>

1128
01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:39.700
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are sending,</v>

1129
01:05:39.701 --> 01:05:40.534
<v Speaker 3>people want to support you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to support you because they </v>

1130
01:05:42.911 --> 01:05:44.920
<v Speaker 3>actually see your work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1131
01:05:44.921 --> 01:05:48.460
<v Speaker 3>If you were taking down all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these instances of your work getting</v>

1132
01:05:48.461 --> 01:05:51.670
<v Speaker 3>seen because of copyright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fewer people would see your work.</v>

1133
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:55.510
<v Speaker 3>The audience is the most efficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>distribution machine that exists.</v>

1134
01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:56.483
<v Speaker 5>It's definitely been a case for me and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been fortunate too because I've </v>

1135
01:06:00.971 --> 01:06:01.804
<v Speaker 5>been involved in some political </v>
<v Speaker 5>controversy over the last year and some </v>

1136
01:06:04.811 --> 01:06:07.750
<v Speaker 5>people that I know who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who,</v>

1137
01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:09.363
<v Speaker 5>who have been involved in say let's say </v>
<v Speaker 5>broadly similar political controversies </v>

1138
01:06:13.271 --> 01:06:15.670
<v Speaker 5>have been demonetized on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1139
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:16.893
<v Speaker 5>and I'm outside of that because </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything I put up is free and people </v>

1140
01:06:21.101 --> 01:06:26.101
<v Speaker 5>are perfectly willing to support me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean it's also very fortunate that</v>

1141
01:06:26.581 --> 01:06:27.414
<v Speaker 5>a new thing that this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these new platforms for direct support </v>

1142
01:06:30.011 --> 01:06:33.130
<v Speaker 5>of creative people let's say have just </v>
<v Speaker 5>emerged and developed,</v>

1143
01:06:33.131 --> 01:06:33.930
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1144
01:06:33.930 --> 01:06:34.763
<v Speaker 5>thank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank God for that because it's very </v>

1145
01:06:35.801 --> 01:06:38.410
<v Speaker 5>difficult for creative people to </v>
<v Speaker 5>monetize their production.</v>

1146
01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:39.623
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1147
01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:41.020
<v Speaker 5>so now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

1148
01:06:41.021 --> 01:06:41.790
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

1149
01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:45.300
<v Speaker 3>art is just to say something about more </v>
<v Speaker 3>on this,</v>

1150
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:46.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

1151
01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:46.973
<v Speaker 3>with my films going out for free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but benefit to me is that far more </v>

1152
01:06:49.921 --> 01:06:50.754
<v Speaker 3>people see them that way than would see </v>
<v Speaker 3>them if I were trying to control them </v>

1153
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.320
<v Speaker 3>and trying to get people to pay me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see the thing.</v>

1154
01:06:56.321 --> 01:07:00.540
<v Speaker 3>So I made more money releasing sita,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sings the blues for free than I ever had</v>

1155
01:07:00.541 --> 01:07:03.330
<v Speaker 3>before in my career where everything was</v>
<v Speaker 3>copyrighted,</v>

1156
01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:04.373
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of all my comic strips </v>
<v Speaker 3>being copyrighted is that people just </v>

1157
01:07:06.571 --> 01:07:08.730
<v Speaker 3>don't see them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1158
01:07:08.731 --> 01:07:11.430
<v Speaker 3>so just releasing it as good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the other assets,</v>

1159
01:07:11.431 --> 01:07:13.020
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the benefit to me,</v>

1160
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:14.303
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the benefit to society is that you </v>

1161
01:07:16.591 --> 01:07:21.420
<v Speaker 3>overcome like a form of societal brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>damage when you ignore copyright.</v>

1162
01:07:21.421 --> 01:07:23.970
<v Speaker 3>And I gave a talk called copyright is </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain damage.</v>

1163
01:07:23.971 --> 01:07:25.740
<v Speaker 3>You can look that up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you,</v>

1164
01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:26.603
<v Speaker 3>if you look at all of us are neurons and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great mind and all of us transmit and </v>

1165
01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:32.964
<v Speaker 3>receive information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>copyright blocks that function or in an </v>

1166
01:07:36.751 --> 01:07:38.790
<v Speaker 3>attempt to control that function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1167
01:07:38.791 --> 01:07:39.624
<v Speaker 3>of course you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have a brain with totally </v>

1168
01:07:41.671 --> 01:07:43.200
<v Speaker 3>uncontrolled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1169
01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:45.930
<v Speaker 3>firing of sign apses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's madness.</v>

1170
01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:50.520
<v Speaker 3>But I really think that each human being</v>
<v Speaker 3>shares work that they love.</v>

1171
01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:55.650
<v Speaker 3>So if you just let humans share work </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they love and you know,</v>

1172
01:07:55.651 --> 01:07:58.020
<v Speaker 3>they naturally will not share work that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't love,</v>

1173
01:07:58.021 --> 01:08:00.210
<v Speaker 3>then you end up with a really healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

1174
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:01.463
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good works are going to succeed </v>

1175
01:08:04.261 --> 01:08:05.094
<v Speaker 3>in that system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas controlling things with </v>

1176
01:08:06.751 --> 01:08:07.584
<v Speaker 3>copyright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this artificial damage to that </v>

1177
01:08:10.411 --> 01:08:10.800
<v Speaker 3>system?</v>

1178
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.633
<v Speaker 5>Well there's also been a Sarah bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crooked tree in relationship to </v>

1179
01:08:14.241 --> 01:08:15.074
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In recent I would say perhaps Disney is </v>

1180
01:08:17.481 --> 01:08:20.300
<v Speaker 5>more responsible for that than any other</v>
<v Speaker 5>organization,</v>

1181
01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:21.134
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it was Disney that was </v>

1182
01:08:23.091 --> 01:08:27.290
<v Speaker 5>instrumental in getting copyright </v>
<v Speaker 5>extended from 50 to 75 years.</v>

1183
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:28.124
<v Speaker 5>And I really did think that that was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>form of crime because some of those </v>

1184
01:08:30.621 --> 01:08:31.454
<v Speaker 5>early Disney movies and I would put milk</v>
<v Speaker 5>in that category particularly are are </v>

1185
01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:39.860
<v Speaker 5>incredibly culturally significant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And to forestall</v>

1186
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:44.300
<v Speaker 5>a proper discussion of those cultural </v>
<v Speaker 5>artists.</v>

1187
01:08:44.301 --> 01:08:45.134
<v Speaker 5>Alex I think is truly damaging.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was a travesty that that </v>

1188
01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.120
<v Speaker 5>copyright extension was granted</v>

1189
01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.820
<v Speaker 3>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Disney is not the only one.</v>

1190
01:08:52.821 --> 01:08:56.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean most of our cultural heritage is </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled by five big corporations.</v>

1191
01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:57.973
<v Speaker 3>Almost everything now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean everything is owned by someone </v>

1192
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.390
<v Speaker 3>and once it's owned it can be sold to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else.</v>

1193
01:09:02.391 --> 01:09:04.900
<v Speaker 3>And it all ends up in the hands of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1194
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:07.730
<v Speaker 3>buy a calm and Sony everything.</v>

1195
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:12.200
<v Speaker 5>So now with regards to copyright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

1196
01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:17.180
<v Speaker 5>do you draw a distinction?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about patents and things like that?</v>

1197
01:09:17.181 --> 01:09:19.160
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that they are technically </v>
<v Speaker 5>different?</v>

1198
01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a problem with patents,</v>

1199
01:09:21.391 --> 01:09:26.391
<v Speaker 3>although my expertise is not in the area</v>
<v Speaker 3>of patents though the one legal concepts</v>

1200
01:09:26.971 --> 01:09:29.160
<v Speaker 3>that is classified as intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 3>property,</v>

1201
01:09:29.161 --> 01:09:33.720
<v Speaker 3>which is a misnomer that is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely fundamentally bankrupt.</v>

1202
01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:34.613
<v Speaker 3>His trademark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the trademark theoretically has </v>

1203
01:09:38.611 --> 01:09:40.590
<v Speaker 3>something to do with fraud and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need,</v>

1204
01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.920
<v Speaker 3>you don't need or desire some mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1205
01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.760
<v Speaker 3>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>control or punished fraud.</v>

1206
01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:51.290
<v Speaker 3>So roof arc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trademark alone would be that.</v>

1207
01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:52.124
<v Speaker 3>It's not usually used that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's usually abused is as much as </v>

1208
01:09:56.521 --> 01:09:59.610
<v Speaker 3>anything under the intellectual property</v>
<v Speaker 3>label,</v>

1209
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.863
<v Speaker 3>but at least it has some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could make some excuse for it to </v>

1210
01:10:03.691 --> 01:10:04.524
<v Speaker 3>exist.</v>

1211
01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:05.991
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1212
01:10:05.991 --> 01:10:06.890
<v Speaker 5>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1213
01:10:06.891 --> 01:10:07.611
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of it,</v>

1214
01:10:07.611 --> 01:10:10.700
<v Speaker 5>I guess part of the claim for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>protection of originality,</v>

1215
01:10:10.701 --> 01:10:14.240
<v Speaker 5>we might say it's also the protection </v>
<v Speaker 5>you could argue for,</v>

1216
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.060
<v Speaker 5>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for genuineness you don't like,</v>

1217
01:10:17.061 --> 01:10:20.630
<v Speaker 5>I might want to know that and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>legal protection can help with this,</v>

1218
01:10:20.631 --> 01:10:21.464
<v Speaker 5>that I might want to know that the thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I'm watching or the thing that I'm </v>

1219
01:10:24.291 --> 01:10:27.680
<v Speaker 5>consuming is actually produced by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>person who said that they produced it.</v>

1220
01:10:27.681 --> 01:10:29.810
<v Speaker 5>So if I go on your website and I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>watched it,</v>

1221
01:10:29.811 --> 01:10:30.644
<v Speaker 5>Nina Paley animated short,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to make sure that it isn't </v>

1222
01:10:33.201 --> 01:10:37.580
<v Speaker 5>something someone copying you and using </v>
<v Speaker 5>your identity as a,</v>

1223
01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:39.290
<v Speaker 5>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a form.</v>

1224
01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:42.110
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a form of parasitism essentially.</v>

1225
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.273
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1226
01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is I don't,</v>

1227
01:10:45.101 --> 01:10:48.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a lot of need for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>largely because I do free my work.</v>

1228
01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:53.520
<v Speaker 3>So most people are aware of something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's by me is by me,</v>

1229
01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:54.860
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1230
01:10:54.861 --> 01:10:55.694
<v Speaker 3>there's I guess some danger or the way I</v>
<v Speaker 3>might invoke trademark law is if </v>

1231
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.033
<v Speaker 3>somebody edited something of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's welcome to edit and </v>

1232
01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:07.304
<v Speaker 3>redistribute it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they said that the edit and </v>

1233
01:11:09.141 --> 01:11:11.180
<v Speaker 3>redistribution was mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1234
01:11:11.181 --> 01:11:11.920
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1235
01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.890
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the work I did is mine.</v>

1236
01:11:13.891 --> 01:11:17.340
<v Speaker 3>But you have to take responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that edit and redistribution.</v>

1237
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:19.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm not responsible for your edit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>redistribution.</v>

1238
01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:24.060
<v Speaker 3>So if they add some message to it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not mine,</v>

1239
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.133
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that attributed to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I suppose I could invoke trademark </v>

1240
01:11:30.571 --> 01:11:32.740
<v Speaker 3>or something to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1241
01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really would do is just go and say,</v>

1242
01:11:35.371 --> 01:11:36.450
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never said that.</v>

1243
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:38.343
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's a lot simpler than engaging </v>

1244
01:11:39.611 --> 01:11:43.960
<v Speaker 5>in legal battles were roughly the </v>
<v Speaker 5>equivalent of a fairly serious disease.</v>

1245
01:11:44.210 --> 01:11:46.970
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a legal valid nonviolence.</v>

1246
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:49.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that system.</v>

1247
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.113
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it's certainly a way of keeping </v>

1248
01:11:51.901 --> 01:11:54.600
<v Speaker 5>your life simpler and unless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1249
01:11:54.601 --> 01:11:55.434
<v Speaker 5>unless you get attacked by something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's truly malevolent and of course </v>

1250
01:11:57.721 --> 01:11:59.760
<v Speaker 5>that can happen from time to time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1251
01:11:59.761 --> 01:12:00.594
<v Speaker 5>So let's go back to your masochism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's going to come out in 2018 and </v>

1252
01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm very much looking forward to that.</v>

1253
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.200
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet.</v>

1254
01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:11.760
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we're a couple of things is,</v>

1255
01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:14.720
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1256
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:17.310
<v Speaker 5>it's so interesting because when I watch</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

1257
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:19.260
<v Speaker 5>your shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1258
01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.673
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember a couple of them that have </v>

1259
01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:23.274
<v Speaker 5>Moses wandering through the desert with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the pillar of light leading him on and </v>

1260
01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.610
<v Speaker 5>cloud pillar of cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1261
01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:30.540
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

1262
01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:31.321
<v Speaker 5>The cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1263
01:12:31.321 --> 01:12:32.154
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you've animated that very </v>

1264
01:12:33.361 --> 01:12:35.880
<v Speaker 5>interesting way and it's got a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>grandeur as well,</v>

1265
01:12:35.881 --> 01:12:36.714
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which again spoke to me of something </v>

1266
01:12:38.401 --> 01:12:40.830
<v Speaker 5>approximating a profound religious </v>
<v Speaker 5>sensibility,</v>

1267
01:12:40.831 --> 01:12:45.831
<v Speaker 5>which is partly why I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>surprised by your comments about the,</v>

1268
01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:47.023
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the intellectual effect of your </v>

1269
01:12:47.971 --> 01:12:50.760
<v Speaker 5>endeavors on your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on your relationship with belief.</v>

1270
01:12:50.761 --> 01:12:51.594
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

1271
01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.830
<v Speaker 3>this is the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ego talk.</v>

1272
01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:56.770
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1273
01:12:56.770 --> 01:13:00.060
<v Speaker 5>I think now and then we managed to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>it a muse to muse talk.</v>

1274
01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe a little bit.</v>

1275
01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.020
<v Speaker 3>You're going to hear from my ego.</v>

1276
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:06.470
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1277
01:13:06.471 --> 01:13:08.270
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's always the danger in talking</v>

1278
01:13:08.271 --> 01:13:10.030
<v Speaker 5>to artists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1279
01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.290
<v Speaker 5>Because I think generally when you speak</v>
<v Speaker 5>with artists,</v>

1280
01:13:12.291 --> 01:13:13.124
<v Speaker 5>you speak to the inferior part of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not because their ego is inferior </v>

1281
01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:17.834
<v Speaker 5>compared to the ego of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But because the part of them that you </v>

1282
01:13:21.051 --> 01:13:21.884
<v Speaker 5>would like to communicate with is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually the part that's generating the </v>

1283
01:13:23.901 --> 01:13:26.630
<v Speaker 5>art already doing it's communication.</v>

1284
01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:28.400
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I would rather,</v>

1285
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:29.463
<v Speaker 3>I mean in general it's like I speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>better through my art than any other or </v>

1286
01:13:32.471 --> 01:13:34.520
<v Speaker 3>an amendment anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1287
01:13:34.521 --> 01:13:39.521
<v Speaker 3>It's whatever by his Dick Expressions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my talking head.</v>

1288
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.910
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1289
01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.330
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1290
01:13:44.331 --> 01:13:45.164
<v Speaker 5>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason I wanted to do the </v>

1291
01:13:47.031 --> 01:13:47.864
<v Speaker 5>interview though was to find out what </v>
<v Speaker 5>your ego thinks of all of this as well </v>

1292
01:13:50.991 --> 01:13:53.810
<v Speaker 5>as to take the opportunity hopefully to </v>
<v Speaker 5>bring your work to,</v>

1293
01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:56.690
<v Speaker 5>to perhaps do some people who don't know</v>
<v Speaker 5>about it yet.</v>

1294
01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:00.350
<v Speaker 5>And okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now you're making this magnificent,</v>

1295
01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.593
<v Speaker 5>a production about exodus and about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>old testament and that's a pretty </v>

1296
01:14:05.061 --> 01:14:07.640
<v Speaker 5>strange thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say in the modern world,</v>

1297
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:13.930
<v Speaker 5>what do you have any sense of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're hoping that will accomplish?</v>

1298
01:14:13.931 --> 01:14:14.764
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that you want to launch it and </v>

1299
01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:19.030
<v Speaker 5>see what happens and that there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>curiosity associated with that,</v>

1300
01:14:19.031 --> 01:14:21.640
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But do you have.</v>

1301
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.863
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a hypothesis or a theory </v>
<v Speaker 5>about what it is that this is doing in </v>

1302
01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:28.954
<v Speaker 5>the broader sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how you're contributing to the cultural </v>

1303
01:14:30.731 --> 01:14:31.570
<v Speaker 5>conversation?</v>

1304
01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:36.910
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that I do.</v>

1305
01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.880
<v Speaker 3>I can't access those thoughts right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1306
01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:43.360
<v Speaker 3>but I'll learn a lot more once it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once it goes out.</v>

1307
01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.513
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll sort of focus it a bit more in </v>

1308
01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.120
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the Pinocchio Movie,</v>

1309
01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:52.360
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mrs. Very ancient theme in order for the</v>

1310
01:14:52.361 --> 01:14:56.050
<v Speaker 5>puppet Marionette,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whose strings are being pulled by forces</v>

1311
01:14:56.051 --> 01:14:59.620
<v Speaker 5>beyond his control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In order for him to become real,</v>

1312
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:01.600
<v Speaker 5>there's a variety of things he has to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

1313
01:15:01.601 --> 01:15:04.960
<v Speaker 5>He has to learn to tell the truth and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>has to learn not to be a neurotic victim</v>

1314
01:15:04.961 --> 01:15:08.710
<v Speaker 5>and he has to learn not to be an </v>
<v Speaker 5>impulsive pleasure seeking,</v>

1315
01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:13.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a victim of totalitarian processes,</v>

1316
01:15:13.781 --> 01:15:14.614
<v Speaker 5>all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then he asked to go down to the </v>

1317
01:15:16.331 --> 01:15:19.180
<v Speaker 5>bottom of chaos itself and rescue his </v>
<v Speaker 5>father.</v>

1318
01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:22.900
<v Speaker 5>I can't help but think that that's part </v>
<v Speaker 5>of what you're doing.</v>

1319
01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:24.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you said it yourself in the interview,</v>

1320
01:15:24.911 --> 01:15:25.744
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you said that you were </v>

1321
01:15:27.311 --> 01:15:28.144
<v Speaker 5>attempting to make some connection with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the belief of your father and to make </v>

1322
01:15:30.581 --> 01:15:35.050
<v Speaker 5>some sense out of it and so you are in </v>
<v Speaker 5>fact going into the void,</v>

1323
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.943
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to rescue your father from the belly of </v>

1324
01:15:38.681 --> 01:15:41.170
<v Speaker 5>the whale and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1325
01:15:41.171 --> 01:15:43.620
<v Speaker 5>it seems to me that we're in a period </v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

1326
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:44.783
<v Speaker 5>of chaotic instability in our culture </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it actually has a fair bit of </v>

1327
01:15:48.161 --> 01:15:48.994
<v Speaker 5>danger associated with it and that I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>felt a strong impulse to go back to </v>

1328
01:15:52.961 --> 01:15:57.961
<v Speaker 5>these original stories to find out what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they are and to establish them,</v>

1329
01:15:58.631 --> 01:15:59.464
<v Speaker 5>to reestablish them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say his foundation or whatever </v>

1330
01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:02.270
<v Speaker 5>that might mean.</v>

1331
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.453
<v Speaker 5>It might be my imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it seems to me that that's </v>

1332
01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:06.994
<v Speaker 5>associated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's akin in some sense to what </v>

1333
01:16:09.311 --> 01:16:10.690
<v Speaker 5>you're doing with exodus.</v>

1334
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:12.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1335
01:16:12.311 --> 01:16:16.210
<v Speaker 3>and when I set out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did set out to connect to my father,</v>

1336
01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.650
<v Speaker 3>your rescue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my father.</v>

1337
01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I have learned in the past year</v>

1338
01:16:22.721 --> 01:16:27.721
<v Speaker 3>is that actually I'm looking for my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother and I think I found her.</v>

1339
01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:30.640
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well now,</v>

1340
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.270
<v Speaker 5>now obviously I'm going to have to ask </v>
<v Speaker 5>you to elaborate on that.</v>

1341
01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:37.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I can in words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1342
01:16:37.311 --> 01:16:39.710
<v Speaker 3>like it's still in the process of doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1343
01:16:39.711 --> 01:16:44.711
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I have been seeking to connect</v>

1344
01:16:45.741 --> 01:16:47.750
<v Speaker 3>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this father,</v>

1345
01:16:47.751 --> 01:16:51.410
<v Speaker 3>this God the father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also my own father,</v>

1346
01:16:51.411 --> 01:16:53.450
<v Speaker 3>which I didn't have the best connection </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1347
01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:54.530
<v Speaker 3>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1348
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:58.280
<v Speaker 3>nothing really terrible or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just never really connected with him.</v>

1349
01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:00.080
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've longed for that,</v>

1350
01:17:00.081 --> 01:17:00.914
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of my life because the </v>

1351
01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:05.300
<v Speaker 3>culture tells me that that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>

1352
01:17:05.301 --> 01:17:06.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1353
01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:11.060
<v Speaker 3>and all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the psychologists say,</v>

1354
01:17:11.230 --> 01:17:12.830
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need a really important thing.</v>

1355
01:17:12.831 --> 01:17:14.390
<v Speaker 3>So my whole life it's been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1356
01:17:14.391 --> 01:17:16.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I,</v>

1357
01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.440
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be messed up about this or </v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing.</v>

1358
01:17:18.441 --> 01:17:19.274
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this is a daddy issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I gotTa get right with my dad even </v>

1359
01:17:22.941 --> 01:17:24.110
<v Speaker 3>though he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's dead.</v>

1360
01:17:24.111 --> 01:17:26.360
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just like looking and looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and it's like,</v>

1361
01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:29.060
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I missed something,</v>

1362
01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:30.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1363
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Like it's my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

1364
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:34.633
<v Speaker 3>it's all of our mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you talked about the original </v>

1365
01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:38.280
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You referred to the Old Testament texts,</v>

1366
01:17:38.281 --> 01:17:40.040
<v Speaker 3>the original stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1367
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:41.660
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1368
01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:46.690
<v Speaker 3>we have most of the history of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion was not these stories as far as</v>

1369
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:56.410
<v Speaker 3>as far as I have read or learned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The early human conception of the divine</v>

1370
01:17:56.601 --> 01:17:57.434
<v Speaker 3>was female everywhere and we have broken</v>
<v Speaker 3>the connection to that and actually the </v>

1371
01:18:02.241 --> 01:18:03.074
<v Speaker 3>story of exodus to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is is it's the solidifying of </v>

1372
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:08.203
<v Speaker 3>the that change that it was a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>gradual process of moving from goddess </v>

1373
01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.770
<v Speaker 3>to gods and Goddesses to just God just </v>
<v Speaker 3>one God,</v>

1374
01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:23.990
<v Speaker 3>but I'm reaching further back and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize,</v>

1375
01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:24.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I.</v>

1376
01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:29.980
<v Speaker 3>When I found that and when I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>working with that earlier religion where</v>

1377
01:18:30.741 --> 01:18:35.180
<v Speaker 3>we have no text for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all we have is some artifacts,</v>

1378
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:36.103
<v Speaker 3>many artifacts from all over the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and beautiful symbols and of course </v>

1379
01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:41.960
<v Speaker 3>there's a book by Eric Newman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great mother,</v>

1380
01:18:41.961 --> 01:18:45.510
<v Speaker 3>which talks about all the symbols</v>
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>

1381
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:48.110
<v Speaker 3>I read that sucker cover to cover</v>

1382
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:49.670
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You read the origins.</v>

1383
01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.280
<v Speaker 5>Have you read the origins and history of</v>
<v Speaker 5>consciousness?</v>

1384
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:54.680
<v Speaker 3>I have eight by Norman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have not,</v>

1385
01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.080
<v Speaker 3>but I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would highly recommend,</v>

1386
01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:00.080
<v Speaker 3>but let me just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you.</v>

1387
01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.210
<v Speaker 3>I liked the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He writes like a lead weight.</v>

1388
01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:03.373
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just good to immerse myself in </v>

1389
01:19:04.881 --> 01:19:07.400
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So definitely that is what I was longing</v>

1390
01:19:07.401 --> 01:19:09.080
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And back to the Old Testament.</v>

1391
01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:10.273
<v Speaker 3>Those things are in the Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all portrayed as the other and </v>

1392
01:19:14.121 --> 01:19:17.180
<v Speaker 3>the enemies and what we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop out,</v>

1393
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:19.520
<v Speaker 3>but they're in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1394
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:23.030
<v Speaker 3>so in that way I relate to the Old </v>
<v Speaker 3>Testament,</v>

1395
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 3>not the heroes of the Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moses and Aaron and them.</v>

1396
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:30.410
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take</v>

1397
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:36.470
<v Speaker 3>inspiration from the stiff necked people</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's like,</v>

1398
01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:37.570
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too stiff.</v>

1399
01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Neck people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're disobedient.</v>

1400
01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.820
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

1401
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:42.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the,</v>

1402
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:44.120
<v Speaker 3>if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's any history to this,</v>

1403
01:19:44.121 --> 01:19:44.954
<v Speaker 3>which there probably isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like those are the ones I'm </v>

1404
01:19:46.881 --> 01:19:49.020
<v Speaker 3>descended from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bad one.</v>

1405
01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:51.003
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1406
01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.420
<v Speaker 5>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1407
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:55.423
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting because in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio Story and in the classic </v>

1408
01:19:58.961 --> 01:19:59.794
<v Speaker 5>stories of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of journeying to the belly of the whale </v>

1409
01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:02.764
<v Speaker 5>or journeying into the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's often but not always males who are </v>

1410
01:20:06.371 --> 01:20:08.020
<v Speaker 5>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the farther,</v>

1411
01:20:08.021 --> 01:20:08.854
<v Speaker 5>and it isn't obvious to me </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychologically what happens when a </v>

1412
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:12.144
<v Speaker 5>woman goes to the underworld to rescue </v>
<v Speaker 5>her father isn't clear what she's going </v>

1413
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:17.260
<v Speaker 5>to discover their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1414
01:20:17.261 --> 01:20:19.270
<v Speaker 5>when it seems to me that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1415
01:20:19.670 --> 01:20:22.620
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're using your creative pseudopods to</v>

1416
01:20:22.621 --> 01:20:25.710
<v Speaker 5>sort of feel out that territory and </v>
<v Speaker 5>discover what might be there.</v>

1417
01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:30.490
<v Speaker 5>So that seems very important too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because obviously there's,</v>

1418
01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.620
<v Speaker 5>there's a problem in our culture and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>problem is how,</v>

1419
01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:39.680
<v Speaker 5>what is exactly the relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 5>femininity and women and these,</v>

1420
01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:44.490
<v Speaker 5>let's call them patriarchal religions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

1421
01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:45.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of,</v>

1422
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:48.060
<v Speaker 5>one of your criticisms of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of Christianity.</v>

1423
01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:51.060
<v Speaker 5>And of course this is also evident in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Eric moments work,</v>

1424
01:20:51.061 --> 01:20:53.610
<v Speaker 5>is that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a trinity,</v>

1425
01:20:53.611 --> 01:20:55.410
<v Speaker 5>obviously Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

1426
01:20:55.411 --> 01:20:56.244
<v Speaker 5>and it's a fairly comprehensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well there's God the father and that's </v>

1427
01:20:58.501 --> 01:20:59.334
<v Speaker 5>tradition and there's the Holy Spirit </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that you might think about that is </v>

1428
01:21:02.071 --> 01:21:05.860
<v Speaker 5>the news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's God in the Sun Forum,</v>

1429
01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:06.694
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1430
01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:07.563
<v Speaker 5>you take human being who's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's vulnerable and mortal and who's </v>

1431
01:21:10.831 --> 01:21:11.664
<v Speaker 5>destined to live on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that those are nice elements of the </v>

1432
01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:14.694
<v Speaker 5>divine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's a missing fourth as far as </v>

1433
01:21:16.670 --> 01:21:17.503
<v Speaker 5>you're concerned and he thought about as</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes constituted by the figure of </v>

1434
01:21:20.941 --> 01:21:22.980
<v Speaker 5>Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that was where evil standard,</v>

1435
01:21:22.981 --> 01:21:26.840
<v Speaker 5>but also sometimes constituted by </v>
<v Speaker 5>femininity itself and,</v>

1436
01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:29.910
<v Speaker 5>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those two things were often conflated as</v>

1437
01:21:29.911 --> 01:21:32.580
<v Speaker 5>well because they were the other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1438
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:38.250
<v Speaker 5>and that is a complicated technical </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem because it's not obvious,</v>

1439
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:42.900
<v Speaker 5>it's not precisely obvious what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>divine model is for women,</v>

1440
01:21:42.901 --> 01:21:46.110
<v Speaker 5>especially now that they have control </v>
<v Speaker 5>over their reproductive function because</v>

1441
01:21:46.111 --> 01:21:50.490
<v Speaker 5>they're sort of half women in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>traditional classic biological sense.</v>

1442
01:21:50.491 --> 01:21:54.680
<v Speaker 5>Half the email,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also in some sense half male freedom</v>

1443
01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:55.010
<v Speaker 5>now</v>

1444
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:57.740
<v Speaker 3>control over the reproductive function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sadly.</v>

1445
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:59.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean if we lived in that world we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>

1446
01:21:59.810 --> 01:22:01.370
<v Speaker 3>we could talk that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

1447
01:22:01.371 --> 01:22:02.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>practically speaking,</v>

1448
01:22:02.631 --> 01:22:03.530
<v Speaker 3>women really don't.</v>

1449
01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:08.140
<v Speaker 5>Well because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You mean because it's unreliable?</v>

1450
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for one thing,</v>

1451
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:11.423
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you talking about like a hormonal </v>

1452
01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:15.000
<v Speaker 3>pills?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Birth control?</v>

1453
01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:17.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about birth control pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1454
01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.650
<v Speaker 3>like I can't take them right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>

1455
01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:22.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have horrible side effects for me.</v>

1456
01:22:22.291 --> 01:22:23.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm quite a few women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1457
01:22:23.881 --> 01:22:25.800
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like,</v>

1458
01:22:25.801 --> 01:22:26.330
<v Speaker 3>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1459
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:28.020
<v Speaker 3>we invented this pill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1460
01:22:28.021 --> 01:22:31.310
<v Speaker 3>that's actually one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a great example of,</v>

1461
01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:33.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our Patriarchal Society,</v>

1462
01:22:33.571 --> 01:22:35.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that could be developed for men.</v>

1463
01:22:35.611 --> 01:22:36.444
<v Speaker 3>Men wouldn't tolerate the side effects </v>
<v Speaker 3>and back they weren't developing a pill </v>

1464
01:22:39.451 --> 01:22:40.284
<v Speaker 3>like that for men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they cut the experiments short </v>

1465
01:22:41.701 --> 01:22:42.480
<v Speaker 3>because men weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1466
01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.313
<v Speaker 3>weren't tolerating the side effects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which were worse than the side effects </v>

1467
01:22:46.021 --> 01:22:46.854
<v Speaker 3>for women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But women are going to tolerate that </v>

1468
01:22:48.061 --> 01:22:51.550
<v Speaker 3>shit because they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1469
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:56.750
<v Speaker 3>we're physically more vulnerable anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never ends all the old.</v>

1470
01:22:57.690 --> 01:22:59.580
<v Speaker 3>This is why I believe from biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

1471
01:22:59.581 --> 01:23:02.570
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what biological materialist just</v>

1472
01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 3>because regardless of my identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of my ideas,</v>

1473
01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:10.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every month I'm doubled over in pain and</v>

1474
01:23:10.290 --> 01:23:11.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having like very real consequences of </v>

1475
01:23:14.111 --> 01:23:15.480
<v Speaker 3>bright of my biology.</v>

1476
01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:16.040
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1477
01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.910
<v Speaker 5>you just did a short about the great </v>
<v Speaker 5>mother and now you know,</v>

1478
01:23:19.911 --> 01:23:20.744
<v Speaker 5>I wondered if you had read a book when I</v>
<v Speaker 5>saw that because I know there's </v>

1479
01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:24.993
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is an absolutely great book and as </v>

1480
01:23:26.481 --> 01:23:27.314
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would recommend or just history of </v>

1481
01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:29.650
<v Speaker 5>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously it's,</v>

1482
01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.273
<v Speaker 5>I think it would help answer some of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>questions that you were talking about </v>

1483
01:23:33.651 --> 01:23:35.140
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe you.</v>

1484
01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:35.991
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1485
01:23:35.991 --> 01:23:36.824
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was the book that you said he wished </v>

1486
01:23:38.541 --> 01:23:39.374
<v Speaker 5>he would have written,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is hell of a thing for someone </v>

1487
01:23:41.571 --> 01:23:44.180
<v Speaker 5>like him to say because he was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>remarkable genius.</v>

1488
01:23:44.181 --> 01:23:45.600
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1489
01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.963
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I guess that the new film and what's </v>

1490
01:23:51.171 --> 01:23:53.090
<v Speaker 5>it called when the feature is the great </v>
<v Speaker 5>mother</v>

1491
01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.133
<v Speaker 3>godmother.</v>

1492
01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:55.420
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1493
01:23:55.421 --> 01:23:56.254
<v Speaker 5>And so is that now that seems </v>
<v Speaker 5>importantly related to this issue that </v>

1494
01:23:59.411 --> 01:24:03.850
<v Speaker 5>you brought up about rediscovering the </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection with your mother going to.</v>

1495
01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:04.993
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1496
01:24:05.670 --> 01:24:08.070
<v Speaker 3>My actual mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mother,</v>

1497
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:09.780
<v Speaker 3>the great mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1498
01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:12.840
<v Speaker 3>I live with my actual mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She great and everything,</v>

1499
01:24:12.841 --> 01:24:17.841
<v Speaker 3>but we're on a metaphorical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1500
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:19.783
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually is the first scene of </v>

1501
01:24:22.621 --> 01:24:23.454
<v Speaker 3>sadomasochism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I did the last scene first and then </v>

1502
01:24:25.171 --> 01:24:28.560
<v Speaker 3>it took years for me to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first scene is.</v>

1503
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:34.290
<v Speaker 3>So That's interesting and there's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>be no introduction and no explanation.</v>

1504
01:24:34.291 --> 01:24:35.124
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's gonna set the stage for the </v>

1505
01:24:37.891 --> 01:24:39.660
<v Speaker 3>exodus story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>
