1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.110
<v Speaker 1>So welcome to psychology to 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and its transformations.</v>

2
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.380
<v Speaker 1>So I guess the first thing I'll do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

3
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a description of what</v>

4
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:26.921
<v Speaker 1>personality is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very extensive phenomenon.</v>

5
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your personality determines the way you</v>

6
00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 1>perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means,</v>

7
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.490
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that your personality actually</v>

8
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:45.350
<v Speaker 1>determines</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you're going to extract facts from</v>

9
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:47.750
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>people think that you see the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think about it then,</v>

11
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:55.100
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you react emotionally and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you act.</v>

12
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:59.900
<v Speaker 1>But that's really not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too slow,</v>

13
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>first of all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of times when you have</v>

14
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>to be fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you had to go through all that</v>

15
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>processing before you acted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be dead.</v>

16
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.420
<v Speaker 1>So personality is deeper than what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with facts.</v>

17
00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>It's deep enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that determines how you bias your</v>

18
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>perceptions</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the world appears to you in a</v>

19
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.950
<v Speaker 1>particular manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't really understand how</v>

20
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>personality does that yet.</v>

21
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.033
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

22
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.410
<v Speaker 1>It determines your emotional response to</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

23
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.730
<v Speaker 1>People differ in their positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>

24
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 1>their baseline level of positive emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their variability and they differ in</v>

25
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:45.430
<v Speaker 1>their negative emotions as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people are set to be anxious and</v>

26
00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 1>some people are set to be fearless and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment can move that around to</v>

27
00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:52.630
<v Speaker 1>some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a fair bit of it's at least it's</v>

28
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:56.120
<v Speaker 1>origin point seems to be pretty tightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>determined by genetic factors.</v>

29
00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:56.954
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

30
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>people differ in the degree to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're creative or they differ in the</v>

31
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:07.100
<v Speaker 1>degree to which they're orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of different phenomena</v>

32
00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:12.101
<v Speaker 1>that are tightly attached to what makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you different from other people because</v>

33
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>that's another way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

34
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.810
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>colors,</v>

35
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:21.830
<v Speaker 1>your actions because you act in</v>
<v Speaker 1>accordance with your personality,</v>

36
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it determines your values.</v>

37
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And so that also determines how you act</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course you act in accordance</v>

38
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:31.430
<v Speaker 1>with what you value because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving from where you are,</v>

39
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:35.930
<v Speaker 1>which isn't as as good as it could be to</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere better and you have to decide</v>

40
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe that's decided for you by your</v>

41
00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:41.060
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just where better is.</v>

42
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting for me to teach personality</v>

43
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the most personal of all phenomena</v>

44
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's understanding isn't extraordinarily</v>

45
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:57.050
<v Speaker 1>relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to everyone.</v>

46
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Understanding your personality can help</v>
<v Speaker 1>you figure out who you are for better or</v>

47
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:06.740
<v Speaker 1>for worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because with every set of personnel,</v>

48
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.970
<v Speaker 1>personality attributes there tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on an associated set of devices.</v>

49
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're an orderly person,</v>

50
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.970
<v Speaker 1>which in many cases is a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're also prone to harsh</v>

51
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>judgments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tend to be xenophobic and sexual</v>

52
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>behaviors that aren't strictly normative</v>
<v Speaker 1>are likely to discuss you.</v>

53
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>And you might think of that as something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you conclude as a consequence of</v>

54
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it looks in many ways like it's</v>

55
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>determined before you act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some ways,</v>

56
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>personality theory can also help you</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand other people because it's</v>

57
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>easy to think that other people are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and they are like you.</v>

58
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>They're like you enough so that more or</v>
<v Speaker 1>less you can communicate with them,</v>

59
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>but they're also very different from</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

60
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And so often when you're communicating</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people,</v>

61
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>they're actually starting with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different set of a priori presumptions</v>

62
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>than you are and we'd like to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>things can be worked out as a</v>

63
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>consequence of logical negotiation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true to some degree,</v>

64
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.670
<v Speaker 1>but these a priority factors that</v>
<v Speaker 1>underlie your being itself interfere</v>

65
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:29.311
<v Speaker 1>with the ability to use logic because</v>
<v Speaker 1>logic is usually predicated on values</v>

66
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>and values in turn are predicated on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your temperament.</v>

67
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.120
<v Speaker 1>So having an appreciation for</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in personality can help you</v>

68
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.850
<v Speaker 1>understand your own personality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe improve it and also understanding</v>

69
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>and and give some credence to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints of other people.</v>

70
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we've been studying in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my lab for example,</v>

71
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 1>is the relationship between personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and political belief.</v>

72
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I know when it's been thought for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

73
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of an enlightenment idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come to your political beliefs as a</v>

74
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:04.270
<v Speaker 1>consequence again of rational</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberation.</v>

75
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.270
<v Speaker 1>You take a look at the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you analyze them and you extract out</v>

76
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 1>what you think are the appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the appropriate information from</v>

77
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>that analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've found,</v>

78
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people who are high in creativity,</v>

79
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the technical term really for</v>

80
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 1>the trait that's associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

81
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>People who are high in openness and low</v>
<v Speaker 1>in conscientiousness,</v>

82
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness in order to get high in</v>

83
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low in conscientiousness,</v>

84
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be liberal or left leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas people who are more</v>

85
00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>conscientious and less creative tend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be conservative.</v>

86
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be true more or less</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross culturally,</v>

87
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:46.240
<v Speaker 1>at least in those cultures where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left right spectrum is similar in nature</v>

88
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>to the left right spectrum in North</v>
<v Speaker 1>American culture.</v>

89
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we also found,</v>

90
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 1>although this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still kind of wrestling with this,</v>

91
00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:59.190
<v Speaker 1>finding that the effects of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality on your political preference</v>

92
00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:01.860
<v Speaker 1>and you're voting behavior actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase as you get older.</v>

93
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.210
<v Speaker 1>They don't decrease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense,</v>

94
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.480
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which your eight by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>state priority,</v>

95
00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:13.080
<v Speaker 1>by your temperamental perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominates your thoughts and your</v>

96
00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:18.081
<v Speaker 1>behavior even more as you age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really know what to make of</v>

97
00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:19.811
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

98
00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:21.360
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the sort of thing that,</v>

99
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.290
<v Speaker 1>that people normally bring into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>political discussion.</v>

100
00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:28.170
<v Speaker 1>But the next time that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of you are probably left wing</v>

101
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.990
<v Speaker 1>because most of you are open and</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent and low in</v>

102
00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:33.720
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively speaking.</v>

103
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.050
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're likely to be lower in orderliness</v>

105
00:06:37.051 --> 00:06:39.420
<v Speaker 1>than the typical population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Given that you're interested in this</v>

106
00:06:39.421 --> 00:06:41.190
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next time that you're having a</v>

107
00:06:41.191 --> 00:06:43.620
<v Speaker 1>discussion with someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative,</v>

108
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:47.220
<v Speaker 1>you might give some credence to the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're actually talking to someone</v>

109
00:06:47.221 --> 00:06:49.950
<v Speaker 1>who's quite different than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't just that they believe a bunch</v>

110
00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:53.760
<v Speaker 1>of stupid things that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand why anyone would possibly</v>

111
00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:58.260
<v Speaker 1>believe it's that the facts themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>array themselves before those people</v>

112
00:06:58.261 --> 00:07:00.240
<v Speaker 1>differently than they do in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

113
00:07:00.241 --> 00:07:02.910
<v Speaker 1>And if you listen as they should listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

114
00:07:02.911 --> 00:07:05.610
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might learn something that you</v>

115
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.670
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't know given your temperamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>stance.</v>

116
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.903
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

117
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.240
<v Speaker 1>practical matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need the,</v>

118
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.850
<v Speaker 1>you need to know this url.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

119
00:07:20.851 --> 00:07:23.610
<v Speaker 1>So you have to write it down because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the syllabus is.</v>

120
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

121
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.960
<v Speaker 1>opposed to copy of it on blackboard as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

122
00:07:27.961 --> 00:07:31.560
<v Speaker 1>But for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's there and the syllabus lists</v>

123
00:07:31.561 --> 00:07:33.360
<v Speaker 1>everything that you need to know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the course.</v>

124
00:07:33.361 --> 00:07:38.100
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to go through it today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it tells you what the lecture topics</v>

125
00:07:38.101 --> 00:07:40.710
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course the readings are posted there</v>

126
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:42.840
<v Speaker 1>except for the texts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two books for the class.</v>

127
00:07:42.841 --> 00:07:45.390
<v Speaker 1>There's a textbook and a book called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black Swan,</v>

128
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the assignments and so forth.</v>

129
00:07:49.861 --> 00:07:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And their requirements are listed on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>syllabus as well.</v>

130
00:07:52.801 --> 00:07:56.580
<v Speaker 1>So it should serve as a place where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get all the information you need for</v>

131
00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:59.100
<v Speaker 1>the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we'll walk through it today and I'll</v>

132
00:07:59.101 --> 00:08:02.340
<v Speaker 1>give you an overview of what the course</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be like.</v>

133
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.710
<v Speaker 1>So now it didn't just personality that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this course is about,</v>

134
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.240
<v Speaker 1>people tend to think of personality as</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's relatively fixed and</v>

135
00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:16.410
<v Speaker 1>stable because if it was fluctuating</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely all over the potential range</v>

136
00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:18.750
<v Speaker 1>of personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't be a lot of utility and</v>

137
00:08:18.751 --> 00:08:23.370
<v Speaker 1>discussing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is stable so that you are who you</v>

138
00:08:23.371 --> 00:08:26.160
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also amenable to change.</v>

139
00:08:26.161 --> 00:08:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Now it's difficult to change your</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

140
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.190
<v Speaker 1>It's as if in some sense that the dice</v>
<v Speaker 1>was rolled or five sets of dice.</v>

141
00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:35.280
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're rolled at the point where you were</v>

142
00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:40.281
<v Speaker 1>born and you were granted a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of personality configuration on the</v>

143
00:08:40.741 --> 00:08:44.640
<v Speaker 1>off chance that that configuration could</v>
<v Speaker 1>find its proper niche in the</v>

144
00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:49.020
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like people have more or</v>

145
00:08:49.021 --> 00:08:51.420
<v Speaker 1>less settled on a five dimensional</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality model,</v>

146
00:08:51.421 --> 00:08:54.030
<v Speaker 1>which we'll talk about a lot in the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of the course.</v>

147
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:59.030
<v Speaker 1>But the idea seems to be that perhaps is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the environment that you inhabit,</v>

148
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>which is largely social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

149
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not just physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mostly social cause you're like</v>

150
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:07.200
<v Speaker 1>hyper social primates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you are probably checking your</v>

151
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:09.240
<v Speaker 1>email right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

152
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:15.020
<v Speaker 1>it's as if there are niches within that</v>
<v Speaker 1>space that may or may not be there may</v>

153
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:18.630
<v Speaker 1>or may not predominate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the dice rolls when you're conceived</v>

154
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 1>and you're given a set of attributes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>with any luck you can find a niche in</v>

155
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>the broader social and physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment where your particular set of</v>

156
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 1>attributes is going to be functional for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

157
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.080
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

158
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>this is something to think about too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll try to get into this in some depth</v>

159
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 1>in the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what you need to do to make</v>

160
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 1>your life at least tolerable is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what your personality</v>

161
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 1>attributes are and then to find a niche</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're valued.</v>

162
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.530
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those of you that are creative,</v>

163
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably know who you are.</v>

164
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a rare trait by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

165
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:59.060
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend banking or law</v>
<v Speaker 1>because law and banking,</v>

166
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 1>just to take two examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very conservative enterprises.</v>

167
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.440
<v Speaker 1>We tested the hundred most creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers in Canada at one point with,</v>

168
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.590
<v Speaker 1>they were nominated by their firms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the most outstanding personality</v>

169
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:17.550
<v Speaker 1>attribute of the hundred most creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loris was not openness.</v>

170
00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was conscientiousness,</v>

171
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 1>even though they were the hundred most</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative lawyers.</v>

172
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.140
<v Speaker 1>And of course largely depends on</v>
<v Speaker 1>precedent.</v>

173
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 1>And how creative do you want your lawyer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be?</v>

174
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your lawyer is creative enough then</v>

175
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:30.840
<v Speaker 1>you'll be in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's probably not,</v>

176
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the greatest idea.</v>

177
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's very useful to get a handle on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your personality is because then</v>

178
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:42.291
<v Speaker 1>you can take a look at the potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments that lie in front of you</v>

179
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.670
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully match yourself to one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

180
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a tricky business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:50.970
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't necessarily the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the niche that you're most suitable</v>

182
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:55.860
<v Speaker 1>to inhabit is one that's stable or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or economically viable,</v>

183
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

184
00:10:57.781 --> 00:11:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I think in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways it's become more difficult,</v>

185
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:02.970
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to monetize a variety of different</v>

186
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:06.000
<v Speaker 1>creative production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's harder to monetize music,</v>

187
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.220
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course it can be shared for</v>

188
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:09.420
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

189
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's luck of the draw to some degree.</v>

190
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 1>So now the other part of the course is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transformation element.</v>

191
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.233
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.350
<v Speaker 1>personality is stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you test person at one time and</v>

193
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:25.650
<v Speaker 1>you test the person later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's high correlations between</v>

194
00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:29.400
<v Speaker 1>the two sets of tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also variability and the</v>

195
00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:33.240
<v Speaker 1>variability is the part that contains</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential,</v>

196
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.980
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for transformation.</v>

197
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.450
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

198
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.300
<v Speaker 1>you're an entity with cause I fixed</v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes.</v>

199
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>transform and learn.</v>

200
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a sort of this weird balance</v>

201
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:51.030
<v Speaker 1>between stability and plasticity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually happened to be two metta</v>

202
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:56.031
<v Speaker 1>traits of personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also want to take you through the</v>

203
00:11:56.531 --> 00:12:01.531
<v Speaker 1>process of understanding what</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality transformation is and how to</v>

204
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because personality transformation comes</v>

205
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:11.020
<v Speaker 1>at a cost and the cost seems to be with</v>
<v Speaker 1>each incremental change,</v>

206
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>there is an equal increment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>unstability of instability,</v>

207
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's often because you learn things</v>

208
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:18.910
<v Speaker 1>painfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

209
00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you learn something,</v>

210
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.110
<v Speaker 1>if it's something you expect and</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you want,</v>

211
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 1>there's no learning there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking because you expect it</v>

212
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:28.540
<v Speaker 1>so it means you already know about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want it.</v>

213
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:32.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most potent learning experiences</v>

214
00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:37.351
<v Speaker 1>tend to occur when something occurs in</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the realm of your experience that</v>

215
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:40.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't expect and often that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want.</v>

216
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.900
<v Speaker 1>And those are the sorts of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>destabilize your personality.</v>

217
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Now they can also be the sort of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that eventually expand it because if you</v>

218
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:50.980
<v Speaker 1>encounter something that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

219
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.570
<v Speaker 1>that means that there's information in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the event that you haven't incorporated</v>

220
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Speaker 1>within your own being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can do that,</v>

221
00:12:57.911 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 1>then at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your dominion of competence can</v>

222
00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:06.010
<v Speaker 1>expand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things you'd see the</v>

223
00:13:06.011 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 1>courses sort of broken up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

224
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:11.830
<v Speaker 1>it's broken up into two sections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are more sections which I'll get</v>

225
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:14.020
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest split is actually</v>

226
00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:17.320
<v Speaker 1>between the clinical theorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those would be people who are,</v>

227
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 1>some of them are psychiatrists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them,</v>

228
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:23.170
<v Speaker 1>more practitioners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their theories were derived from</v>

229
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:25.900
<v Speaker 1>observations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly of personality pathology and</v>

230
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:28.750
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first half of the course is really</v>

231
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:32.900
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because I think the</v>

232
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.930
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

233
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 1>intellectually compelling and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

234
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.250
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps even practically useful</v>

235
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.600
<v Speaker 1>theories of personality have in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>been derived by clinical practitioners</v>

236
00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 1>like Freud and like human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Rogers and of the various people</v>

237
00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:51.790
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to talk about him.</v>

238
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's really</v>

239
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:56.860
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>practitioners,</v>

240
00:13:56.861 --> 00:13:59.290
<v Speaker 1>because they have to deal with issues of</v>
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>

241
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.800
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good mental health versus poor mental</v>

242
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:06.220
<v Speaker 1>health say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they're all their fields of</v>

243
00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:11.221
<v Speaker 1>endeavor also deal with values because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to grapple with</v>

244
00:14:13.751 --> 00:14:18.751
<v Speaker 1>the problem of the good or wellbeing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health or psychopathology or</v>

245
00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:24.211
<v Speaker 1>suffering or anxiety or pain or any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those phenomena without also necessarily</v>

246
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.610
<v Speaker 1>evaluating the domain of values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

247
00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:32.380
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're a certain way.</v>

248
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to be better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were better,</v>

249
00:14:34.931 --> 00:14:36.970
<v Speaker 1>would that mean that you are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally healthy?</v>

250
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.440
<v Speaker 1>What exactly does better mean and is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful to use that sort of descriptive</v>

251
00:14:41.441 --> 00:14:43.450
<v Speaker 1>terminology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about personality</v>

252
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.950
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume that most of you wanting to be</v>

253
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>better people now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your definition of what might better is</v>

254
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 1>going to differ again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to your temperament,</v>

255
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.440
<v Speaker 1>but generally speaking it seems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

256
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.230
<v Speaker 1>they're like scissor office there uphill</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbers,</v>

257
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to go from bad to worse.</v>

258
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.420
<v Speaker 1>You want to go from where you are to</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

259
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize what constitutes better.</v>

260
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:14.411
<v Speaker 1>And that makes personality theory at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least in re in regard to its,</v>

261
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.210
<v Speaker 1>its clinical domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very strange hybrid of science and</v>

262
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.760
<v Speaker 1>engineering because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally science doesn't deal with</v>

263
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:24.560
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're dealing with human</v>

264
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:29.561
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems impossible to avoid the the</v>

265
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.430
<v Speaker 1>topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're concerned with</v>

266
00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.550
<v Speaker 1>something like mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

267
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:36.860
<v Speaker 1>you can assume that mental health means</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>

268
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.830
<v Speaker 1>but most of you don't assume that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

269
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

270
00:15:41.721 --> 00:15:44.960
<v Speaker 1>if you're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want your reach to exceed your</v>

271
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:46.790
<v Speaker 1>grasp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of you are going to be aiming for</v>

272
00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 1>something that's better than normal or</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than average.</v>

273
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Let's say we don't consider average</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimal.</v>

274
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first half of the course that</v>

275
00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:59.930
<v Speaker 1>deals with the clinicians is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take us into the realm of personality</v>

276
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:04.460
<v Speaker 1>transformation and also necessarily lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>us through a discussion of value because</v>

277
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't see that there's any avoiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

278
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be ridiculous to avoid</v>

279
00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:12.930
<v Speaker 1>it because why you should do things is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:17.950
<v Speaker 1>how you conceptualize why you should do</v>
<v Speaker 1>things is extraordinarily integral part</v>

281
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:20.120
<v Speaker 1>of your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

282
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.790
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we found</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

283
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a variant of an exercise that I'm</v>

284
00:16:26.001 --> 00:16:28.270
<v Speaker 1>going to have you do in this class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

285
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:33.370
<v Speaker 1>is that if you get people to spend a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of hours writing down their</v>

286
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:35.210
<v Speaker 1>vision of the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

287
00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:36.800
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question basically is,</v>

288
00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine yourself now.</v>

289
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine yourself three to five years</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>

290
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and here's the rules.</v>

291
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you're trying to take care</v>
<v Speaker 1>of yourself.</v>

292
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Like you would take care of someone that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cared about.</v>

293
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange framing,</v>

294
00:16:52.731 --> 00:16:54.800
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people often don't take care of</v>

295
00:16:54.801 --> 00:16:56.750
<v Speaker 1>themselves as well as they take care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

296
00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hard on themselves and they</v>

297
00:16:58.401 --> 00:17:02.180
<v Speaker 1>denigrate themselves because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might be painfully aware of all your</v>

298
00:17:02.181 --> 00:17:04.310
<v Speaker 1>multiple inadequacies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

299
00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:06.230
<v Speaker 1>inadequacies are part of the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>

300
00:17:06.231 --> 00:17:11.231
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy if you've become cognizant</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your inadequacies to also denigrate</v>

301
00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:14.210
<v Speaker 1>the value of your being and not take</v>
<v Speaker 1>care of yourself.</v>

302
00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:15.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

303
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.470
<v Speaker 1>flawed is you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're probably no worse than anyone</v>

304
00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:21.080
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if things shouldn't be good for you,</v>

305
00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:24.140
<v Speaker 1>then the logical conclusion is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>things shouldn't be good for anyone else</v>

306
00:17:24.141 --> 00:17:24.974
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

307
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:27.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start with yourself and assume that you</v>

308
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 1>deserve some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the basic elements of the</v>

309
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:33.140
<v Speaker 1>attitude that you would give to someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you care for.</v>

310
00:17:33.141 --> 00:17:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you put yourself in that mind frame</v>

311
00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:36.680
<v Speaker 1>now you think three to five years down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road,</v>

312
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:39.200
<v Speaker 1>what do you want for friendship?</v>

313
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.740
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for career?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for family?</v>

314
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.410
<v Speaker 1>How do you want your intimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships to be constituted?</v>

315
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.230
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do when you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>working?</v>

316
00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 1>What sort of productive useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>activities and interesting activities</v>

317
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:55.530
<v Speaker 1>are you going to engage it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could optimize your life three to</v>

318
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 1>five years down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly would that look like?</v>

319
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.660
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's that question.</v>

320
00:18:00.661 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Then we also get people to do dance or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reverse question,</v>

321
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 1>which is all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine that you allow your</v>

322
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 1>inadequacies and your pathology such as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are to gain the upper hand,</v>

323
00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:14.880
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your own life zone and week to week</v>

324
00:18:14.881 --> 00:18:17.160
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you really let them get out of</v>

325
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:19.170
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know you're,</v>

326
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:23.760
<v Speaker 1>you're drinking 26 ounces of vodka every</v>
<v Speaker 1>second day in five years or you know,</v>

327
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:27.660
<v Speaker 1>you're lying uncontrollably or no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>can stand to you cause you're too</v>

328
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:30.350
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable in neurotic or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

329
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

330
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:34.950
<v Speaker 1>whatever your weaknesses happened to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you procrastinate all the time and</v>

331
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:38.880
<v Speaker 1>end up unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine three to five years down the</v>

332
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:42.630
<v Speaker 1>road that things turn out as badly for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you as they can because you've allowed</v>

333
00:18:42.631 --> 00:18:46.320
<v Speaker 1>things to go from bad to worse and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize that</v>

334
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.590
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we have people write a plan</v>

335
00:18:50.591 --> 00:18:53.440
<v Speaker 1>based on the positive vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The negative vision I think is really</v>

336
00:18:53.441 --> 00:18:55.840
<v Speaker 1>useful because if you're running towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

337
00:18:55.841 --> 00:18:59.200
<v Speaker 1>it's also extremely useful from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational perspective to be running</v>

338
00:18:59.201 --> 00:19:01.810
<v Speaker 1>away from something at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

339
00:19:01.811 --> 00:19:04.720
<v Speaker 1>then you can harness your positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions which are associated with</v>

340
00:19:04.721 --> 00:19:07.840
<v Speaker 1>approaching a valued goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can have your negative emotions</v>

341
00:19:07.841 --> 00:19:11.290
<v Speaker 1>like fear chasing you instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing in front of you,</v>

342
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.410
<v Speaker 1>interfering with your progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

343
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:19.030
<v Speaker 1>When we have people do this exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their grade point average,</v>

344
00:19:19.031 --> 00:19:21.160
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd done this with 3000 people so far,</v>

345
00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:26.460
<v Speaker 1>grade point average goes up about 25%</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropout rate goes down about 30% so you</v>

346
00:19:27.101 --> 00:19:31.330
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the act of positing value,</v>

347
00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.610
<v Speaker 1>so like a valued future or or terribly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

348
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:39.100
<v Speaker 1>negatively valued future is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prerequisite to appropriate functional</v>

349
00:19:39.101 --> 00:19:41.080
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means in part is that</v>

350
00:19:41.081 --> 00:19:44.700
<v Speaker 1>human beings are value producing</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures and there's just no way of,</v>

351
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.110
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous to avoid dealing with</v>

352
00:19:48.111 --> 00:19:52.520
<v Speaker 1>that well in a class on personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that it's and as uneasy</v>

353
00:19:52.521 --> 00:19:55.670
<v Speaker 1>balance between science and engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

354
00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:01.030
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first part of the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

355
00:20:01.281 --> 00:20:03.140
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get into details here.</v>

356
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:07.643
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

357
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.750
<v Speaker 1>We're going to tell you a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this picture.</v>

358
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.800
<v Speaker 1>That's Jonah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you know the</v>

359
00:20:13.801 --> 00:20:16.050
<v Speaker 1>story of Jonah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the story basically goes like this.</v>

360
00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:17.900
<v Speaker 1>It's an old testament story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

361
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.010
<v Speaker 1>God tells Jonah to go off and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and he doesn't want to do it.</v>

362
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:27.930
<v Speaker 1>So cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least as far as the old testament is</v>

363
00:20:27.931 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's always telling people to do</v>

364
00:20:29.941 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 1>horrible and miserable things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

365
00:20:31.771 --> 00:20:34.410
<v Speaker 1>And so avoiding it is the logical thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

366
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:39.590
<v Speaker 1>So Jonah goes out on a boat trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away from this demand and there's a</v>

367
00:20:39.691 --> 00:20:43.050
<v Speaker 1>huge storm and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boat is in danger of being swamped</v>

368
00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:45.550
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so,</v>

369
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.750
<v Speaker 1>so sailors are all wondering this storm</v>
<v Speaker 1>is happening and Joan and finally admits</v>

370
00:20:49.751 --> 00:20:50.660
<v Speaker 1>that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

371
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.570
<v Speaker 1>got this command from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's running away from it.</v>

372
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.480
<v Speaker 1>So they throw him overboard and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees common.</v>

373
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joan ends up inside this whale and then</v>

374
00:20:57.851 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three days later,</v>

375
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 1>as it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's spits them up back on shore.</v>

376
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

377
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 1>why the hell are you telling us this</v>
<v Speaker 1>story?</v>

378
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.300
<v Speaker 1>But I can give you a hint about why I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you this story.</v>

379
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the last time that you broke</v>

380
00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:17.860
<v Speaker 1>through the thin ice that you're skating</v>
<v Speaker 1>on all the time.</v>

381
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows what that means,</v>

382
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:22.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that you're cruising along in your</v>

383
00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 1>life perfectly content or at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably content,</v>

384
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.710
<v Speaker 1>and then something strikes you out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blue.</v>

385
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the death of someone that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

386
00:21:31.451 --> 00:21:34.880
<v Speaker 1>or it's the breakup of a relationship or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you failed dismally at,</v>

387
00:21:34.881 --> 00:21:38.710
<v Speaker 1>or some manner in which you'd be trade a</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend or they betrayed you and all of a</v>

388
00:21:38.711 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 1>sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you stand on disappears</v>

389
00:21:41.261 --> 00:21:42.580
<v Speaker 1>and you get swallowed up.</v>

390
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that the Motif of being</v>

391
00:21:45.491 --> 00:21:49.450
<v Speaker 1>swallowed by something that lurks</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath like the,</v>

392
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.390
<v Speaker 1>like the shark in jaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

393
00:21:52.391 --> 00:21:55.180
<v Speaker 1>very old story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

394
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.850
<v Speaker 1>it's the oldest story that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

395
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.800
<v Speaker 1>It's the same story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

396
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.480
<v Speaker 1>that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watched the hobbit guys,</v>

397
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.220
<v Speaker 1>how many of you have seen the hobbit</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently or the Lord of the Rings?</v>

398
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

399
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:08.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

400
00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:11.830
<v Speaker 1>in the harbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little hobbit encounters a dragon,</v>

401
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone seems to understand what</v>

402
00:22:13.871 --> 00:22:16.450
<v Speaker 1>that means even though it's completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>absurd proposition.</v>

403
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's allied with this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of pattern of story.</v>

404
00:22:20.621 --> 00:22:22.960
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is something like this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

405
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.920
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

406
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:32.560
<v Speaker 1>your current pattern of being is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragile.</v>

407
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not very much of you and there's an</v>

408
00:22:36.401 --> 00:22:40.270
<v Speaker 1>awful lot of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that at any</v>

409
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:43.660
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some element of the world that you have</v>

410
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:48.661
<v Speaker 1>not mastered and do not understand can</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge and destroy you potentially your</v>

411
00:22:51.401 --> 00:22:54.190
<v Speaker 1>psychological health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your physical health and your dreams.</v>

412
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 1>And that puts you somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ancients believed that that put</v>

413
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:02.950
<v Speaker 1>you somewhere that was akin to being</v>
<v Speaker 1>devoured by a great beast.</v>

414
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.080
<v Speaker 1>And if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

415
00:23:05.081 --> 00:23:07.840
<v Speaker 1>it spits you up later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're unlucky,</v>

416
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:09.590
<v Speaker 1>then you stay inside it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

417
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.640
<v Speaker 1>those are the sorts of people that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in mental hospitals are wandering</v>

418
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 1>around on the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

419
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:16.420
<v Speaker 1>hearing voices and talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

420
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:22.000
<v Speaker 1>they never get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the standard transformative</v>

421
00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:27.420
<v Speaker 1>narrative is descent an asset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn something by deteriorating</v>

422
00:23:27.521 --> 00:23:30.340
<v Speaker 1>first and then by reascended as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate it.</v>

423
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.410
<v Speaker 1>And I love the story because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

424
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:35.740
<v Speaker 1>the first of all to know that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the fundamental story of</v>

425
00:23:35.741 --> 00:23:38.170
<v Speaker 1>mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know that story means first of all,</v>

426
00:23:38.171 --> 00:23:42.850
<v Speaker 1>that you understand that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning without pain and the pain is a</v>

427
00:23:42.851 --> 00:23:45.190
<v Speaker 1>necessary prerequisite to</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

428
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Now the pain doesn't necessarily have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be of the sort that completely destroys</v>

429
00:23:49.081 --> 00:23:51.330
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But generally a valuable lesson is one</v>

430
00:23:51.331 --> 00:23:54.540
<v Speaker 1>that's difficult to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that also means something very</v>

431
00:23:54.541 --> 00:23:56.370
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the human psyche</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

432
00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.590
<v Speaker 1>and this is something to really think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about too,</v>

433
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:00.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you might say,</v>

434
00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 1>are you who you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>or are you who you could be or are you</v>

435
00:24:08.431 --> 00:24:11.760
<v Speaker 1>the thing that changes from who you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what you could be?</v>

436
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.273
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

437
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.810
<v Speaker 1>which of those things you identify with</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a huge difference to your life.</v>

438
00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.540
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are who you are,</v>

439
00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.360
<v Speaker 1>then you can't talk to someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't agree with you.</v>

440
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:29.820
<v Speaker 1>You can't listen to them because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>may tell you something that you don't</v>

441
00:24:29.821 --> 00:24:33.120
<v Speaker 1>already know and that'll change you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you are who you are and that's</v>

442
00:24:33.121 --> 00:24:35.190
<v Speaker 1>the right way to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't want to be changed.</v>

443
00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.710
<v Speaker 1>And if you are who you're going to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>

444
00:24:37.711 --> 00:24:42.210
<v Speaker 1>then if any circumstance comes along to</v>
<v Speaker 1>destabilize the environment so that that</v>

445
00:24:42.211 --> 00:24:45.240
<v Speaker 1>future becomes unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're in the same boat.</v>

446
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Things are going to fall apart around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

447
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.540
<v Speaker 1>But if you're the thing that can change</v>
<v Speaker 1>when change is necessary,</v>

448
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.320
<v Speaker 1>well then you don't have to be who you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are or who you could be.</v>

449
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:59.370
<v Speaker 1>You can be the thing that changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when new things come along,</v>

450
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.440
<v Speaker 1>regardless of how they're presented to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

451
00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.260
<v Speaker 1>well then you can welcome them even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though they're going to destabilize you</v>

452
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:12.470
<v Speaker 1>in the hope that what comes out the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>what comes out the other side will be an</v>

453
00:25:12.871 --> 00:25:15.060
<v Speaker 1>improved version of you.</v>

454
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.560
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that all talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

455
00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:25.580
<v Speaker 1>especially in the first couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures is the notion that the idea</v>

456
00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:30.891
<v Speaker 1>that you should identify with the part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your psyche that can transform is</v>

457
00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:37.530
<v Speaker 1>actually one of the world's most</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental religious ideas and the</v>

458
00:25:37.531 --> 00:25:40.580
<v Speaker 1>reason I'm discussing religious ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you in part is Walt's.</v>

459
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Partly because when we deal with some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more profound thinkers in the early</v>

460
00:25:44.641 --> 00:25:47.850
<v Speaker 1>part of the chorus and the part that</v>
<v Speaker 1>deals with psychoanalysis like young for</v>

461
00:25:47.851 --> 00:25:52.851
<v Speaker 1>example being use depth psychology goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>down deep enough into the psyche so that</v>

462
00:25:53.791 --> 00:25:58.260
<v Speaker 1>the appropriate language to describe the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena that he is dealing with is</v>

463
00:25:58.261 --> 00:26:03.120
<v Speaker 1>always religious language is young sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of conceptualized religious language,</v>

464
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.830
<v Speaker 1>religious symbols as the grammatical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of the grammatical structure of</v>

465
00:26:07.831 --> 00:26:12.180
<v Speaker 1>the psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an archetype by the way,</v>

466
00:26:12.181 --> 00:26:13.380
<v Speaker 1>that's what an archetype is.</v>

467
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.500
<v Speaker 1>An archetype is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is part of the structure of the psyche.</v>

468
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.450
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something you can't escape from.</v>

469
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.120
<v Speaker 1>So I could give you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a quick example of that.</v>

470
00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.163
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

471
00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:26.550
<v Speaker 1>men are much more visually oriented</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards sexual stimuli than women.</v>

472
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.820
<v Speaker 1>It appears that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women seem to be more oriented towards</v>

473
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.000
<v Speaker 1>auditory sexual stimuli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

474
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.420
<v Speaker 1>there was a book published a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>while ago called dataclysm.</v>

475
00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.040
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the first third of,</v>

476
00:26:38.041 --> 00:26:39.460
<v Speaker 1>it's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

477
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.020
<v Speaker 1>it's written by one of the Google</v>
<v Speaker 1>analytics guys and it's,</v>

478
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.540
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I'm wrong.</v>

479
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.180
<v Speaker 1>It's called a billion wicked thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read too,</v>

480
00:26:48.181 --> 00:26:51.480
<v Speaker 1>that we're dealing with Internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena is called a billion wicked</v>

481
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:52.800
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

482
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:54.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the authors were analyzing,</v>

483
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pornography usage on the web.</v>

484
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.193
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

485
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.950
<v Speaker 1>for the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 35% of web traffic was pornography</v>

486
00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 1>and it actually really got the web</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

487
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.273
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough.</v>

488
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

489
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:08.041
<v Speaker 1>it's strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

490
00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 1>and so that sexual motivation was what</v>
<v Speaker 1>drove to technological innovation.</v>

491
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.470
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even now,</v>

492
00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:15.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's driving</v>

493
00:27:15.241 --> 00:27:18.720
<v Speaker 1>computer chip technology is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity for making more and more</v>

494
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:19.870
<v Speaker 1>accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

495
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.730
<v Speaker 1>CGI movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very strange things often that</v>

496
00:27:23.731 --> 00:27:25.170
<v Speaker 1>motivate human progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

497
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.110
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the desire for entertainment more</v>

498
00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:30.750
<v Speaker 1>and more realistic artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment.</v>

499
00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:31.920
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sex,</v>

500
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:34.830
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what Freud would</v>
<v Speaker 1>presume anyways,</v>

501
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.080
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at visual stimuli and women read</v>

502
00:27:37.081 --> 00:27:42.081
<v Speaker 1>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now with regards to men,</v>

503
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.030
<v Speaker 1>there some things you can say about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>men find attractive sexually if they're,</v>

504
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.140
<v Speaker 1>if they're heterosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

505
00:27:49.141 --> 00:27:54.060
<v Speaker 1>they prefer a west waist to hip ratio of</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 0.68 and that's standard across</v>

506
00:27:54.061 --> 00:27:57.060
<v Speaker 1>body types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a thin woman who has a hip waist to</v>

507
00:27:57.061 --> 00:28:00.570
<v Speaker 1>hip ratio of 0.68 is attractive and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

508
00:28:00.571 --> 00:28:04.680
<v Speaker 1>a mesomorphic woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman of medium build with a waist to</v>

509
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:06.840
<v Speaker 1>hip ratio of 0.68 is also attractive.</v>

510
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the function of the archetype.</v>

511
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:13.260
<v Speaker 1>And that archetype would be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype of air oss or Venus or,</v>

512
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.560
<v Speaker 1>or beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the problem with those archetypes</v>

513
00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:18.270
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what makes the market</v>

514
00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:20.730
<v Speaker 1>tipple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you can't argue yourself out of them.</v>

515
00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.420
<v Speaker 1>They're in built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

516
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.870
<v Speaker 1>they're part of your operating system to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use a terrible analogy.</v>

517
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.950
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he owns,</v>

518
00:28:30.951 --> 00:28:35.951
<v Speaker 1>his claim was that the architectural</v>
<v Speaker 1>images are religious fundamentally that</v>

519
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.800
<v Speaker 1>they hit you with the force of</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious,</v>

520
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the word?</v>

521
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Re revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

522
00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.450
<v Speaker 1>so that's all in that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

523
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a picture's worth a thousand words and</v>

524
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.410
<v Speaker 1>that one's worth a lot more than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand.</v>

525
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also might ask yourself,</v>

526
00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:00.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't people do what's right?</v>

527
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question because</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically they could,</v>

528
00:29:03.501 --> 00:29:05.460
<v Speaker 1>and the answer seems to be something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

529
00:29:05.461 --> 00:29:08.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transforming yourself into something</v>

530
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:12.180
<v Speaker 1>that's continually better means</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually being swallowed up by</v>

531
00:29:12.181 --> 00:29:13.200
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>

532
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.010
<v Speaker 1>And so it's hard and frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why people aren't enlightened</v>

533
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.540
<v Speaker 1>and there's gotta be some reason given</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's hypothetically possible.</v>

534
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hear people like Joseph</v>

535
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Campbell say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow your bliss,</v>

536
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:27.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that sounds pretty easy.</v>

537
00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.270
<v Speaker 1>You want to develop your personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do what you love.</v>

538
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.720
<v Speaker 1>You know it's a corruption of Carl</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jung's thinking because young would say,</v>

539
00:29:33.721 --> 00:29:35.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow what you're interested.</v>

540
00:29:35.371 --> 00:29:37.500
<v Speaker 1>It'll take you somewhere you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to go.</v>

541
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.740
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

542
00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:43.510
<v Speaker 1>and that's a whole different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different proposition.</v>

543
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

544
00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I already asked you to write down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>

545
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.050
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to type my name into the</v>

546
00:29:53.051 --> 00:29:55.330
<v Speaker 1>web and my website will come up and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find the course.</v>

547
00:29:55.331 --> 00:29:58.600
<v Speaker 1>But I would still write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show it to you again at the end of</v>

548
00:29:58.601 --> 00:30:01.090
<v Speaker 1>class for those who didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who didn't get it.</v>

549
00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

550
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.910
<v Speaker 1>here's the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what we're going to try to do</v>

551
00:30:06.911 --> 00:30:08.410
<v Speaker 1>during this semester.</v>

552
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.700
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

553
00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to structure this class in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>

554
00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.040
<v Speaker 1>both sort of historically and</v>
<v Speaker 1>developmentally.</v>

555
00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:25.030
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe to you is an elaborated version</v>

556
00:30:26.721 --> 00:30:30.110
<v Speaker 1>of what I just did when I was telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about the Jonah image.</v>

557
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you about an array of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you might describe as eternal</v>

558
00:30:36.171 --> 00:30:40.640
<v Speaker 1>images there or they're like eternal</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters in a story that our</v>

559
00:30:40.641 --> 00:30:42.680
<v Speaker 1>architectural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to show you how those have</v>

560
00:30:42.681 --> 00:30:47.230
<v Speaker 1>been represented by cultures that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>would regard as say pre-scientific.</v>

561
00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good way to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

562
00:30:48.801 --> 00:30:52.370
<v Speaker 1>So those are cultures that haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely divided the world up into</v>

563
00:30:52.371 --> 00:30:55.940
<v Speaker 1>objective reality and subjective</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

564
00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.990
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be something like a set</v>

565
00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:04.700
<v Speaker 1>of constant reference that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>have used all over the world to orient</v>

566
00:31:04.701 --> 00:31:07.010
<v Speaker 1>themselves in their existence.</v>

567
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:11.090
<v Speaker 1>And so I want to talk to you about those</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think one of the things that</v>

568
00:31:11.091 --> 00:31:15.130
<v Speaker 1>does is that it provides you with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying theory metatheory it's a</v>

569
00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:20.030
<v Speaker 1>better way of of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a metatheory into which you can plug all</v>

570
00:31:20.031 --> 00:31:22.370
<v Speaker 1>the particular theories that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about.</v>

571
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the strange things about</v>

572
00:31:24.351 --> 00:31:26.900
<v Speaker 1>personality theory is that it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly integrated.</v>

573
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.110
<v Speaker 1>There's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's also partly because</v>

574
00:31:30.111 --> 00:31:34.640
<v Speaker 1>it's still a pre science in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are a variety of different</v>

575
00:31:34.641 --> 00:31:38.840
<v Speaker 1>theories and all of the theories have</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat different claims and all of the</v>

576
00:31:38.841 --> 00:31:42.920
<v Speaker 1>claims seem logically coherent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate and applicable,</v>

577
00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:46.940
<v Speaker 1>but they don't necessarily seem mutually</v>
<v Speaker 1>inclusive.</v>

578
00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:50.870
<v Speaker 1>So thinker a might claim one thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're be another and the two</v>

579
00:31:50.871 --> 00:31:54.470
<v Speaker 1>things aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't logically coexist.</v>

580
00:31:54.471 --> 00:31:59.180
<v Speaker 1>And so that makes learning about</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality theory difficult because</v>

581
00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:05.190
<v Speaker 1>things that aren't coherent across any</v>
<v Speaker 1>distance of any length of time or</v>

582
00:32:05.191 --> 00:32:07.320
<v Speaker 1>difficult to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

583
00:32:07.321 --> 00:32:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to provide you with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying metatheory and then we're</v>

584
00:32:10.441 --> 00:32:13.920
<v Speaker 1>going to try to plug all the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>theorists into that metatheory and then</v>

585
00:32:13.921 --> 00:32:18.420
<v Speaker 1>hopefully that'll give you a nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>coherent and memorable account of</v>

586
00:32:18.421 --> 00:32:23.421
<v Speaker 1>personality and its transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's mythological representations.</v>

587
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality has been represented since</v>

588
00:32:27.211 --> 00:32:29.850
<v Speaker 1>history began,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally since history began because</v>

589
00:32:29.851 --> 00:32:34.830
<v Speaker 1>the oldest written documents that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have are about personality and its</v>

590
00:32:34.831 --> 00:32:36.930
<v Speaker 1>transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

591
00:32:36.931 --> 00:32:40.580
<v Speaker 1>and interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those tell a story that you're all</v>

592
00:32:40.581 --> 00:32:45.581
<v Speaker 1>entirely familiar with and that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen hundreds of times as you've grown</v>

593
00:32:45.651 --> 00:32:48.650
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're constantly represented in movies</v>

594
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:52.670
<v Speaker 1>and in tv shows and everything that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would regard as an infj brawling</v>

595
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:55.250
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things you might ask</v>

596
00:32:55.251 --> 00:32:57.080
<v Speaker 1>yourself is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the hell are you interested in</v>

597
00:32:57.081 --> 00:32:57.914
<v Speaker 1>stories?</v>

598
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you interested in watching TV?</v>

599
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Why are you interested in going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies?</v>

600
00:33:02.601 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll line up and pay for them.</v>

601
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you often see in movies things that</v>

602
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:11.770
<v Speaker 1>are completely impossible and yet you</v>
<v Speaker 1>swallow them without a second's thought.</v>

603
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.081
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

604
00:33:12.081 --> 00:33:14.870
<v Speaker 1>as long as they're done in a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner that allow you to,</v>

605
00:33:14.871 --> 00:33:18.710
<v Speaker 1>in some sense to suspend disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get completely engaged.</v>

606
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.830
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the early theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that we're going to talk about,</v>

607
00:33:21.831 --> 00:33:23.750
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to depth</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

608
00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:29.380
<v Speaker 1>posited that the human personality was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact a narrative or even even more</v>

609
00:33:29.601 --> 00:33:34.550
<v Speaker 1>deeply that human experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you could think of as existence</v>

610
00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:39.230
<v Speaker 1>itself has a narrative structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a pretty broad claim,</v>

611
00:33:39.231 --> 00:33:40.880
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been some pretty,</v>

612
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.260
<v Speaker 1>there's been some heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers who've wandered down that</v>

613
00:33:45.261 --> 00:33:46.170
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So heidegger,</v>

614
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.450
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of them.</v>

615
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:49.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's very,</v>

616
00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:53.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a very interesting thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider because it's certainly the case</v>

617
00:33:53.601 --> 00:33:56.660
<v Speaker 1>that human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you talk about a human being,</v>

618
00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 1>you tend to use something that's like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

619
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.320
<v Speaker 1>And when you recount your own being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to use something like a story.</v>

620
00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:05.600
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of begs the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

621
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:10.280
<v Speaker 1>does that mean in fact that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience is either a story or</v>

622
00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:11.430
<v Speaker 1>something like a story?</v>

623
00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.280
<v Speaker 1>One of the things young said I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is you should figure out which</v>

624
00:34:18.281 --> 00:34:21.940
<v Speaker 1>story you're living because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>living a story and it might be a</v>

625
00:34:21.941 --> 00:34:24.940
<v Speaker 1>tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

626
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.930
<v Speaker 1>you want to find out because if it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy you don't come to a very good</v>

627
00:34:28.931 --> 00:34:31.990
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing young said was this is</v>

628
00:34:31.991 --> 00:34:35.290
<v Speaker 1>also worth thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't have ideas,</v>

629
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.330
<v Speaker 1>ideas have people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we are dealing with say is</v>

630
00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:44.810
<v Speaker 1>that if you're living out of tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tragedy has you,</v>

631
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:48.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can figure out what the</v>

632
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:51.830
<v Speaker 1>tragedy is that has you in its grip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have a fighting chance of</v>

633
00:34:51.831 --> 00:34:54.680
<v Speaker 1>escaping from it into a more pleasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>plot.</v>

634
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.650
<v Speaker 1>But it's no easy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

635
00:34:57.651 --> 00:35:02.651
<v Speaker 1>So if you're one of those people to whom</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same terrible thing keeps happening</v>

636
00:35:03.921 --> 00:35:07.790
<v Speaker 1>over and over after the third time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately,</v>

637
00:35:07.791 --> 00:35:09.250
<v Speaker 1>you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

638
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:12.710
<v Speaker 1>is this the world or is this me?</v>

639
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.030
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

640
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:22.020
<v Speaker 1>we moved from mythological</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations into a discussion of</v>

641
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:26.790
<v Speaker 1>both heroic and shamanic initiations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we're going to talk about</v>

642
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.830
<v Speaker 1>shamonic initiations is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

643
00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:34.020
<v Speaker 1>they are a logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are logical next step in moving</v>

644
00:35:34.021 --> 00:35:36.990
<v Speaker 1>from the fundamental mythology into</v>
<v Speaker 1>depth psychology.</v>

645
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:42.290
<v Speaker 1>But also because initiation processes</v>
<v Speaker 1>are processes that archaic people have</v>

646
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:46.380
<v Speaker 1>used learning to use to catalyze</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality transformation.</v>

647
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.080
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a typical initiation tends to be more</v>

648
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.780
<v Speaker 1>young men who are initiated more often</v>
<v Speaker 1>than young women.</v>

649
00:35:52.781 --> 00:35:57.300
<v Speaker 1>And the hypothesis there is that mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature initiates young women all on her</v>

650
00:35:57.301 --> 00:35:58.950
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with young men,</v>

651
00:35:58.951 --> 00:36:02.250
<v Speaker 1>something has to be imposed from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural perspective in order to</v>

652
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:07.110
<v Speaker 1>catalyze their transition from childhood</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependency and make them independent</v>

653
00:36:07.111 --> 00:36:09.840
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that usually involves some</v>

654
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.980
<v Speaker 1>relatively terrible experience that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it does.</v>

655
00:36:13.981 --> 00:36:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is it helps the person defined what</v>

656
00:36:17.521 --> 00:36:19.650
<v Speaker 1>actually constitutes terrible.</v>

657
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Cause you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

658
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.970
<v Speaker 1>how worried should you be about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

659
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you wake up in the morning and</v>

660
00:36:26.791 --> 00:36:28.020
<v Speaker 1>you know you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a wide,</v>

661
00:36:28.021 --> 00:36:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I know you've got an ache in your side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

662
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.280
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't there the night before.</v>

663
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:34.320
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

664
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.700
<v Speaker 1>you pulled a muscle or you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>die of cancer in three months.</v>

665
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:43.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how upset should you be?</v>

666
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is you don't know.</v>

667
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:50.460
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiation process is due to people is,</v>

668
00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:54.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calibrate their anxiety systems.</v>

669
00:36:55.350 --> 00:37:00.300
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you've been required at some</v>

670
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:05.301
<v Speaker 1>point in your existence to face</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is truly awful without</v>

671
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.900
<v Speaker 1>destroying you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't know how to calibrate</v>

672
00:37:09.901 --> 00:37:11.790
<v Speaker 1>what you should be worried about and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you shouldn't.</v>

673
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.100
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to be the implicit theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon which initiation rituals are</v>

674
00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:17.730
<v Speaker 1>predicated.</v>

675
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:18.091
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

676
00:37:18.091 --> 00:37:20.310
<v Speaker 1>they tend to reemerge spontaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

677
00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.170
<v Speaker 1>you see them reemerge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

678
00:37:22.171 --> 00:37:24.810
<v Speaker 1>in situations like fraternity hazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

679
00:37:24.811 --> 00:37:28.230
<v Speaker 1>or medical residency for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to be a medical</v>

680
00:37:28.231 --> 00:37:31.170
<v Speaker 1>resident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be completely assured that</v>

681
00:37:31.171 --> 00:37:33.810
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be tortured to death for</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>

682
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you come out of that,</v>

683
00:37:35.431 --> 00:37:37.890
<v Speaker 1>you won't be the same person that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were when you went in.</v>

684
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.240
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't necessarily the case that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be that you'll be better.</v>

685
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:47.270
<v Speaker 1>But that's a different issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to talk about the structure of</v>

686
00:37:47.581 --> 00:37:52.581
<v Speaker 1>shamonic and heroic initiations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly to further our understanding of</v>

687
00:37:54.361 --> 00:37:59.340
<v Speaker 1>personality transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also partly to give you an idea of</v>

688
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:04.910
<v Speaker 1>the body of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between the symbolic</v>

689
00:38:05.251 --> 00:38:10.140
<v Speaker 1>realm and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the day to day realm prior to the</v>

690
00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:14.970
<v Speaker 1>emergence of psycho analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when psychoanalysis emerged in</v>

691
00:38:14.971 --> 00:38:19.470
<v Speaker 1>the first part of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalysts,</v>

692
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.980
<v Speaker 1>mostly Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you discovered what you might regard</v>

693
00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:26.060
<v Speaker 1>as a symbolic realm they associated it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

694
00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:27.060
<v Speaker 1>with within.</v>

695
00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:32.310
<v Speaker 1>So the symbolic realm in terms of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience might be what you dream at</v>

696
00:38:32.581 --> 00:38:33.361
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

697
00:38:33.361 --> 00:38:35.110
<v Speaker 1>how bizarre dreams are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

698
00:38:35.111 --> 00:38:37.030
<v Speaker 1>when there's debate about whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're interpretable,</v>

699
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.850
<v Speaker 1>say some people's dreams are</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretable and some people's aren't</v>

700
00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 1>in my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

701
00:38:41.711 --> 00:38:42.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dream realm,</v>

702
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.600
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very peculiar because obviously you</v>

703
00:38:46.601 --> 00:38:51.490
<v Speaker 1>experience it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quasi coherent in that when you</v>

704
00:38:51.491 --> 00:38:53.170
<v Speaker 1>wake up and you remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

705
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.700
<v Speaker 1>you can remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

706
00:38:54.701 --> 00:38:57.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like white noise on a blank</v>

707
00:38:57.641 --> 00:38:58.451
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

708
00:38:58.451 --> 00:38:59.890
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has characters,</v>

709
00:38:59.891 --> 00:39:01.880
<v Speaker 1>they're doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

710
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.960
<v Speaker 1>although there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

711
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:07.060
<v Speaker 1>there are dynamic jumps usually in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative structure that make it</v>

712
00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:10.030
<v Speaker 1>difficult to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are chunks of it that are clearly</v>

713
00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:13.870
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible and that seemed to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same quality.</v>

714
00:39:13.871 --> 00:39:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking is something cinematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

715
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.560
<v Speaker 1>things transform in peculiar ways in</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

716
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:24.880
<v Speaker 1>The normal laws of physics are often</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspended in one way or another.</v>

717
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.550
<v Speaker 1>So people frequently dream of flying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

718
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most peculiarly dreams seem to</v>

719
00:39:32.201 --> 00:39:34.210
<v Speaker 1>happen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

720
00:39:34.211 --> 00:39:34.991
<v Speaker 1>because you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

721
00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 1>I drank last night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't generally mean that,</v>

722
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you decided which movie to play in your</v>

723
00:39:40.691 --> 00:39:43.210
<v Speaker 1>head so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems when you're dreaming that</v>

724
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:46.930
<v Speaker 1>things happen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in your dream that are like the</v>

725
00:39:46.931 --> 00:39:50.950
<v Speaker 1>things that happened to you in regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>life in that they happen.</v>

726
00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't make them happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a dream,</v>

727
00:39:55.091 --> 00:39:58.330
<v Speaker 1>you're the subject of uncontrollable</v>
<v Speaker 1>forces in some sense,</v>

728
00:39:58.331 --> 00:40:00.520
<v Speaker 1>just as you are in waking life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

729
00:40:00.521 --> 00:40:03.280
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well who in the world is dreaming?</v>

730
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the ego obviously cause he</v>

731
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:08.650
<v Speaker 1>can't control it unless you happen to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lucid dreamer.</v>

732
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:10.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people can become conscious during</v>

733
00:40:10.661 --> 00:40:14.290
<v Speaker 1>their dreams and exercise a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree of control over the contents.</v>

734
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Although it's a relatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a relatively undeveloped skill.</v>

735
00:40:18.731 --> 00:40:21.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not particularly rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have had lucid dreams?</v>

736
00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very much,</v>

737
00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:28.360
<v Speaker 1>much more common among women generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reasons we don't really understand</v>

738
00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.790
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time a dream is</v>

739
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:33.850
<v Speaker 1>something in which you're embedded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's dreaming exactly.</v>

740
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:35.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would say,</v>

741
00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:37.390
<v Speaker 1>well the world is dreaming inside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

742
00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:42.930
<v Speaker 1>It's nature dreaming inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural phenomena and it has the</v>

743
00:40:43.301 --> 00:40:46.510
<v Speaker 1>same kind of meaning that any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural phenomena has,</v>

744
00:40:46.511 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 1>which is what meaning that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>discover that turns out to be useful.</v>

745
00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:55.890
<v Speaker 1>So there's a relationship between that</v>
<v Speaker 1>internal set of processes,</v>

746
00:40:56.291 --> 00:40:58.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that deeply symbolic set of processes</v>

747
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:03.750
<v Speaker 1>and the kinds of rituals and symbols</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are used in archaic ceremonies like</v>

748
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.480
<v Speaker 1>heroic in Shamanic initiations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly why I wanted to</v>

749
00:41:07.481 --> 00:41:08.314
<v Speaker 1>tell you about them.</v>

750
00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I'd also helps you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a little more deeply</v>

751
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:17.680
<v Speaker 1>the price that you have to pay in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>for transfer in order to transform.</v>

752
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Because the rule in most archaic</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures is that to transform a male</v>

753
00:41:23.471 --> 00:41:28.300
<v Speaker 1>adolescent into a man requires</v>
<v Speaker 1>dismantling the childhood personality</v>

754
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.930
<v Speaker 1>often rather brutally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and replacing it with something that's</v>

755
00:41:31.931 --> 00:41:33.740
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

756
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

757
00:41:35.271 --> 00:41:37.520
<v Speaker 1>well perhaps the brutality isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>

758
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.433
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

759
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.830
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to say what's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

760
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:47.831
<v Speaker 1>there's a rule in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychological therapy and the rule is</v>

761
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.290
<v Speaker 1>if you want to improve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to identify what it is that</v>

762
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:59.150
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid of that stopping you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to confront it.</v>

763
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:02.600
<v Speaker 1>And you have to do that voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the primary rule.</v>

764
00:42:02.601 --> 00:42:04.760
<v Speaker 1>You might say it's primary rule of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy.</v>

765
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:07.130
<v Speaker 1>You're going somewhere there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impediments,</v>

766
00:42:07.131 --> 00:42:11.000
<v Speaker 1>the impediments make you afraid because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid you start progressing.</v>

767
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:15.230
<v Speaker 1>So what do you have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to face the things that are</v>

768
00:42:15.231 --> 00:42:17.290
<v Speaker 1>stopping you voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

769
00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the heroic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually part of standard hero</v>

770
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.850
<v Speaker 1>narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is face the thing that you're</v>

771
00:42:22.851 --> 00:42:24.110
<v Speaker 1>afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>

772
00:42:24.111 --> 00:42:25.300
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Hobbit,</v>

773
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Frodo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frodo,</v>

774
00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Frodo is not bill bose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second one.</v>

775
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frodo has to face the dragon and the</v>

776
00:42:31.761 --> 00:42:34.670
<v Speaker 1>dragon hordes gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Billable.</v>

777
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well thank you.</v>

778
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what I was asking.</v>

779
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Bilbo has to face the dragon and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon hordes gold.</v>

780
00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the hell does a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>reptile need with gold?</v>

781
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that in part is that the,</v>

782
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.220
<v Speaker 1>the giant reptile represents that which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are afraid of.</v>

783
00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:56.060
<v Speaker 1>And the treasure that it sits on</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents what you gain if you conquer</v>

784
00:42:56.061 --> 00:42:58.940
<v Speaker 1>what you're afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's an architectural story in some</v>

785
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:03.941
<v Speaker 1>sense because you can't invent a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>frightening story than that more</v>

786
00:43:04.161 --> 00:43:04.580
<v Speaker 1>frightening.</v>

787
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.950
<v Speaker 1>And Richard Story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more frightening than a</v>

788
00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:08.750
<v Speaker 1>dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

789
00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.240
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing more valuable than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoard of gold.</v>

790
00:43:11.241 --> 00:43:13.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly what makes the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal right?</v>

791
00:43:13.431 --> 00:43:17.800
<v Speaker 1>It's taken the phenomena and extended</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to the point of,</v>

792
00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:21.650
<v Speaker 1>of maximum return in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

793
00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:28.180
<v Speaker 1>constructivism as piaget mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a</v>

794
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.770
<v Speaker 1>PSA called himself a genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>epistemologist,</v>

795
00:43:33.771 --> 00:43:36.020
<v Speaker 1>which is hardly the same thing as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist.</v>

796
00:43:36.021 --> 00:43:40.540
<v Speaker 1>But Piaget was actually interested this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something you won't hear in</v>

797
00:43:40.541 --> 00:43:44.510
<v Speaker 1>most classes about piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Piaget was a adolescent,</v>

798
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:50.240
<v Speaker 1>he was very obsessed by the growing</v>
<v Speaker 1>split between religion and science.</v>

799
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.280
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a novel about that and uh,</v>

800
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 1>he took it upon himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His life's goal was to reconcile the gap</v>

801
00:43:57.261 --> 00:44:00.360
<v Speaker 1>between religion and science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's something you don't know.</v>

802
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Did anybody know that about piaget?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people know you knew that?</v>

803
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:08.180
<v Speaker 1>How did you learn that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

804
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

805
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:13.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way of learning things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you knew who knew who</v>

806
00:44:13.011 --> 00:44:15.230
<v Speaker 1>piaget is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

807
00:44:15.231 --> 00:44:16.470
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many don't you?</v>

808
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.190
<v Speaker 1>It's okay if you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're probably engineers or some damn</v>

809
00:44:19.191 --> 00:44:20.024
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

810
00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

811
00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Piaget became interested in how</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is developed and he started</v>

812
00:44:28.161 --> 00:44:33.161
<v Speaker 1>with the infant and he's very interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in how the infant who is an embodied</v>

813
00:44:33.241 --> 00:44:34.170
<v Speaker 1>creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

814
00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:36.720
<v Speaker 1>who has a body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which turns out to be very important if</v>

815
00:44:36.721 --> 00:44:40.080
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the infant comes to construct his</v>

816
00:44:40.081 --> 00:44:42.210
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked the PSG and approach</v>

817
00:44:42.211 --> 00:44:46.260
<v Speaker 1>because it melds nicely with our</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion of both personality,</v>

818
00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:50.220
<v Speaker 1>the stable elements of personality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transformative elements of</v>

819
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:51.390
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

820
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause piaget has a stage theory of</v>

821
00:44:53.341 --> 00:44:56.970
<v Speaker 1>development and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't concentrate a tremendous</v>

822
00:44:56.971 --> 00:45:00.900
<v Speaker 1>amount on the intervening period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos between the stages of development.</v>

823
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.890
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

824
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:05.010
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is still there.</v>

825
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:09.120
<v Speaker 1>So as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in a Thomas Kuhn's work on the</v>

826
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.820
<v Speaker 1>history of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which piaget was aware of [inaudible]</v>

827
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:17.520
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to lay out the Piagetian</v>

828
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:22.590
<v Speaker 1>theory because</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that piaget was really</v>

829
00:45:22.591 --> 00:45:27.591
<v Speaker 1>good at was understanding that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche is not like a floating soul.</v>

830
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:29.640
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

831
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:33.420
<v Speaker 1>we believe perhaps that we've dispensed</v>
<v Speaker 1>with most of the religious</v>

832
00:45:33.421 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions that interfere with our</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific clarity,</v>

833
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.680
<v Speaker 1>which we certainly haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one idea that's,</v>

834
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:44.550
<v Speaker 1>that lurks deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to abandoned for a</v>

835
00:45:44.551 --> 00:45:47.070
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons is the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

836
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:51.180
<v Speaker 1>you have a consciousness that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a soul that sort of stuck in your</v>

837
00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:52.560
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

838
00:45:52.561 --> 00:45:55.050
<v Speaker 1>and that's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think about that as your ego</v>

839
00:45:55.051 --> 00:45:59.430
<v Speaker 1>or you might think about it as the I</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you experienced when you talk about</v>

840
00:45:59.431 --> 00:46:01.800
<v Speaker 1>yourself it's like a floating</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

841
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:03.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that's,</v>

842
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:07.110
<v Speaker 1>that's led people like artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence researchers for the longest</v>

843
00:46:07.111 --> 00:46:12.111
<v Speaker 1>time to imagine that they could embody a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind inside complicated machines and in</v>

844
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:16.220
<v Speaker 1>that would function perhaps in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that your mind functions.</v>

845
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Piaget is a really good antidote to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what piaget points out very</v>

846
00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:25.911
<v Speaker 1>clearly is that you cannot have a mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we have without having the body to</v>

847
00:46:26.161 --> 00:46:29.760
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the one of the ways that you can</v>

848
00:46:29.761 --> 00:46:33.300
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize that cause it's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>important is that your personality is</v>

849
00:46:33.301 --> 00:46:38.301
<v Speaker 1>actually oriented towards action rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than perception of the object of worlds.</v>

850
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Like what the hell do you care about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective world?</v>

851
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:43.050
<v Speaker 1>We didn't even discover it until 500</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

852
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:44.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

853
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.860
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're concerned about is how to</v>

854
00:46:46.861 --> 00:46:51.600
<v Speaker 1>act in the world and your conceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you may think about them as</v>

855
00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:55.020
<v Speaker 1>conceptions of the objective world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what they are,</v>

856
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:59.580
<v Speaker 1>what they are instead is abstractions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to act in the world.</v>

857
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:04.380
<v Speaker 1>And Piaget explains this in a beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>way because he starts with the infant</v>

858
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:09.710
<v Speaker 1>and he talks about how the infant's body</v>
<v Speaker 1>develops in sync with its psyche and how</v>

859
00:47:09.781 --> 00:47:14.070
<v Speaker 1>the two things are like absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrally interlock.</v>

860
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's a lovely idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

861
00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I think not only do I think it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that all the evidence in the</v>

862
00:47:20.311 --> 00:47:23.220
<v Speaker 1>last 30 years points towards being</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

863
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't been able to make artificial</v>

864
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:30.490
<v Speaker 1>intelligence without embodying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence in something that acts.</v>

865
00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.550
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Google cars or they're getting</v>

866
00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:35.830
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a body.</v>

867
00:47:35.831 --> 00:47:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are things that can act in the</v>

868
00:47:37.781 --> 00:47:38.890
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

869
00:47:38.891 --> 00:47:42.790
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out to be more difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk than it does to calculate,</v>

870
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely complex mathematical formula,</v>

871
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:47.340
<v Speaker 1>which a computer can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

872
00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:50.650
<v Speaker 1>a billionth of a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though we haven't got computers</v>

873
00:47:50.651 --> 00:47:53.800
<v Speaker 1>that can walk around in the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that turns out to be difficult.</v>

874
00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:58.330
<v Speaker 1>So Piaget tells you how to build a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche from the bottom up and it's,</v>

875
00:47:58.331 --> 00:47:59.200
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

876
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:03.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a prerequisite I think for accurate</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the sorts of things</v>

877
00:48:03.431 --> 00:48:06.340
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to discuss as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

878
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Then we turned to the depth psychologist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

879
00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:16.970
<v Speaker 1>people usually start talking about depth</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

880
00:48:16.971 --> 00:48:21.920
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis with Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then move to young saying perhaps</v>

881
00:48:21.921 --> 00:48:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Adler as</v>

882
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

883
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:27.310
<v Speaker 1>accomplices or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the right word.</v>

884
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apprentices of Freud.</v>

885
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's probably because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>

886
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Ian's got a hold of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the best biographies written first,</v>

887
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:46.230
<v Speaker 1>but you was influenced by Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was equally influenced by nature</v>

888
00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:53.330
<v Speaker 1>and it in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>umes primary concerns were associated</v>

889
00:48:55.241 --> 00:48:58.170
<v Speaker 1>with niches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary concern and niches.</v>

890
00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Primary concern was that God had died in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the late 1900.</v>

891
00:49:03.011 --> 00:49:06.370
<v Speaker 1>So Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosopher announced that it's a</v>

892
00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:08.140
<v Speaker 1>famous announcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is dead.</v>

893
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.360
<v Speaker 1>God is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you see that written on</v>

894
00:49:10.361 --> 00:49:12.160
<v Speaker 1>bathroom walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is dead.</v>

895
00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche is dead.</v>

896
00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:18.610
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what needs you was,</v>

897
00:49:18.611 --> 00:49:21.010
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was observing was that,</v>

898
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.530
<v Speaker 1>and this is something you all know</v>
<v Speaker 1>implicitly,</v>

899
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.550
<v Speaker 1>is that the body of knowledge that human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings had evolved over centuries that</v>

900
00:49:27.551 --> 00:49:29.800
<v Speaker 1>was encapsulated within religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

901
00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:34.450
<v Speaker 1>had emerged in conflict with the body of</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that was produced primarily in</v>

902
00:49:34.451 --> 00:49:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Europe over about a 400 year period</v>
<v Speaker 1>ending say it in the beginning of the</v>

903
00:49:38.561 --> 00:49:41.500
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the two forms of knowledge seemed</v>

904
00:49:41.501 --> 00:49:45.580
<v Speaker 1>incommensurate the claims of religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the claims of science did not seem</v>

905
00:49:45.581 --> 00:49:50.170
<v Speaker 1>to be mutually harmonious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that,</v>

906
00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:54.880
<v Speaker 1>as far as Nisha was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the religious substructure upon</v>

907
00:49:54.881 --> 00:49:57.970
<v Speaker 1>which at that point Western civilization</v>
<v Speaker 1>was built,</v>

908
00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:59.103
<v Speaker 1>was</v>

909
00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 1>rendered invalid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that from a</v>

910
00:50:05.381 --> 00:50:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Nietzschean perspective was while there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were two problems,</v>

911
00:50:07.631 --> 00:50:08.950
<v Speaker 1>one was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

912
00:50:08.951 --> 00:50:13.570
<v Speaker 1>then what the hell are we doing and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second was so that's a</v>

913
00:50:13.571 --> 00:50:14.950
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

914
00:50:14.951 --> 00:50:17.680
<v Speaker 1>If there's no ultimate meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then why do anything?</v>

915
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Just perfectly reasonable question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second problem was,</v>

916
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:23.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the absence of comprehensive systems</v>

917
00:50:23.951 --> 00:50:26.950
<v Speaker 1>of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to be nihilistic,</v>

918
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.200
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And each,</v>

919
00:50:28.201 --> 00:50:29.001
<v Speaker 1>his answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

920
00:50:29.001 --> 00:50:31.820
<v Speaker 1>you developed totalitarian systems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>replace religion,</v>

921
00:50:31.821 --> 00:50:33.890
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century,</v>

922
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.000
<v Speaker 1>and that didn't seem to be a very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution and we're certainly not done</v>

923
00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:42.110
<v Speaker 1>with that problem yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the central problem that needs</v>

924
00:50:42.111 --> 00:50:45.380
<v Speaker 1>your post was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had these evolved systems of meaning</v>

925
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:48.500
<v Speaker 1>and science undercut them or apparently</v>
<v Speaker 1>undercut them,</v>

926
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 1>and that left people technologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened,</v>

927
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:53.930
<v Speaker 1>but spiritually deprived.</v>

928
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:58.100
<v Speaker 1>And that state of spiritual deprivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that your primary orientation in</v>

929
00:50:58.101 --> 00:51:02.210
<v Speaker 1>the world is towards action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is equivalent to a mass mental disease.</v>

930
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.680
<v Speaker 1>And it manifests itself in nihilism or</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the pension for adopting totalitarian</v>

931
00:51:06.681 --> 00:51:09.020
<v Speaker 1>belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big problem.</v>

932
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.020
<v Speaker 1>It killed millions of people in the 20th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

933
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:14.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not usually regarded as a form of</v>

934
00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.670
<v Speaker 1>personality pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just because people don't</v>

935
00:51:16.671 --> 00:51:19.640
<v Speaker 1>think about it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think now,</v>

936
00:51:19.641 --> 00:51:22.940
<v Speaker 1>une was very interested in that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

937
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:28.580
<v Speaker 1>as a student of nature and which he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote,</v>

938
00:51:28.581 --> 00:51:31.580
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a series of lectures that were</v>

939
00:51:31.581 --> 00:51:33.100
<v Speaker 1>published,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

940
00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:34.670
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as adjuncts to use,</v>

941
00:51:34.671 --> 00:51:39.671
<v Speaker 1>collected word works that I believe are</v>
<v Speaker 1>2,600 pages long and they're written in</v>

942
00:51:40.141 --> 00:51:44.150
<v Speaker 1>very little tight and all they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>commentaries on the first third of a</v>

943
00:51:44.151 --> 00:51:47.510
<v Speaker 1>book called [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very short book of very</v>

944
00:51:47.511 --> 00:51:51.920
<v Speaker 1>bizarre because I poetry and it happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the book in which Nietzsche had</v>

945
00:51:51.921 --> 00:51:53.630
<v Speaker 1>his character announced the death of</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

946
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:58.310
<v Speaker 1>So young was a real nietzschean scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what yoga was doing,</v>

947
00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:03.700
<v Speaker 1>see who thought that basically that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we d animated the cosmos,</v>

948
00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.080
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

949
00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:09.620
<v Speaker 1>as as the projections of Daddy's that</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings had created,</v>

950
00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.560
<v Speaker 1>had been pulled in from the objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

951
00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:14.960
<v Speaker 1>they didn't disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't destroyed,</v>

952
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.400
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

953
00:52:16.401 --> 00:52:20.420
<v Speaker 1>as Nietzsche might've presumed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of went into hiding inside the</v>

954
00:52:20.421 --> 00:52:22.520
<v Speaker 1>psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where the era where they</v>

955
00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 1>originated from to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They originated in the imagination.</v>

956
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a standard objective scientist would</v>

957
00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:30.351
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

958
00:52:30.351 --> 00:52:33.620
<v Speaker 1>if they originated in the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they aren't real.</v>

959
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Whereas young would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't kid yourself,</v>

960
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:41.300
<v Speaker 1>the imagination is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a different category of real</v>

961
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:43.370
<v Speaker 1>and that you better learn how to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

962
00:52:43.371 --> 00:52:48.371
<v Speaker 1>Because whether you know it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are pawns of your imagination in the</v>

963
00:52:49.971 --> 00:52:54.590
<v Speaker 1>same way that the Greeks considered them</v>
<v Speaker 1>pawns of the themselves,</v>

964
00:52:54.591 --> 00:52:56.240
<v Speaker 1>pawns of the Greek gods.</v>

965
00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.330
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a hell of a thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize.</v>

966
00:52:59.331 --> 00:53:01.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of the remarkable things</v>

967
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:04.880
<v Speaker 1>about depth psychology because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>depths psychologists tell you flat out</v>

968
00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:10.610
<v Speaker 1>you are a house of many spirits and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them is you.</v>

969
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:15.200
<v Speaker 1>And if you think that you are the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful spirit in your house of</v>

970
00:53:15.201 --> 00:53:17.690
<v Speaker 1>spirits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that means is that you're hyper</v>

971
00:53:17.691 --> 00:53:20.480
<v Speaker 1>protected and diluted because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

972
00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:25.920
<v Speaker 1>There are things that are deep inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you can think of them as systems</v>

973
00:53:25.921 --> 00:53:28.660
<v Speaker 1>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also manifest themselves in,</v>

974
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:33.210
<v Speaker 1>in psychological phenomena that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>more power than you do.</v>

975
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like try not to make a fool of</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself when you're,</v>

976
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:39.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopelessly in love with someone you</v>

977
00:53:39.301 --> 00:53:41.970
<v Speaker 1>don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like good luck to that cause you</v>

978
00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:45.240
<v Speaker 1>won't manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because the instinct that</v>

979
00:53:45.241 --> 00:53:50.241
<v Speaker 1>grips you when you're overwhelmingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to someone is more powerful</v>

980
00:53:50.881 --> 00:53:53.610
<v Speaker 1>than you are and you do what it wants.</v>

981
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Even though you might want to fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

982
00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:59.520
<v Speaker 1>you do what it wants and their reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

983
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:02.490
<v Speaker 1>You know some of them you can think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them as instinctual reasons.</v>

984
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:05.040
<v Speaker 1>See if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not overwhelmingly attracted</v>

985
00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:07.710
<v Speaker 1>to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least throughout most of the history</v>

986
00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:10.660
<v Speaker 1>of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability was pretty low that you</v>

987
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:13.170
<v Speaker 1>going to initiate any sort of sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with them.</v>

988
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.110
<v Speaker 1>So when see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since that's necessary for the human</v>

989
00:54:16.111 --> 00:54:20.010
<v Speaker 1>race to propagate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it serves biological purposes to have</v>

990
00:54:20.011 --> 00:54:25.011
<v Speaker 1>you play the role of actor of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>demands of the instinct of reproduction,</v>

991
00:54:25.951 --> 00:54:27.840
<v Speaker 1>which is of course also Freud's main</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim,</v>

992
00:54:27.841 --> 00:54:28.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Freud,</v>

993
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:34.550
<v Speaker 1>who I place after his fundamental claim</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the god that reels humanity is,</v>

994
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:36.640
<v Speaker 1>is air oss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is set,</v>

995
00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.030
<v Speaker 1>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

996
00:54:38.031 --> 00:54:39.920
<v Speaker 1>and I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also,</v>

997
00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.230
<v Speaker 1>he'll introduced an idea called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>death instinct later.</v>

998
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Freud was also concerned about</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

999
00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:47.640
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense you could say that Freud</v>

1000
00:54:47.641 --> 00:54:52.080
<v Speaker 1>believed that we were ruled by two gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the god of the goddess of sex,</v>

1001
00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:53.820
<v Speaker 1>we'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the god of war.</v>

1002
00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:55.741
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

1003
00:54:55.741 --> 00:54:58.950
<v Speaker 1>as far as reductive theories go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1004
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Beats most of the claims of postmodern</v>
<v Speaker 1>scholars.</v>

1005
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:03.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1006
00:55:03.901 --> 00:55:05.550
<v Speaker 1>so that's all pretty fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1007
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's really,</v>

1008
00:55:07.411 --> 00:55:10.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense he's in 19th century</v>

1009
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:13.980
<v Speaker 1>atheistic thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of like Dawkins and the other,</v>

1010
00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern atheist in that ways.</v>

1011
00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense a strict darwinist</v>

1012
00:55:18.511 --> 00:55:22.110
<v Speaker 1>antibiological reductionist and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Freud had some very interesting</v>

1013
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:24.000
<v Speaker 1>things to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them I really like,</v>

1014
00:55:24.001 --> 00:55:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Freud had it absolutely dead on</v>

1015
00:55:26.251 --> 00:55:27.084
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1016
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:29.310
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've noticed in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice,</v>

1017
00:55:29.311 --> 00:55:31.020
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a clinical psychologist,</v>

1018
00:55:31.021 --> 00:55:36.021
<v Speaker 1>is that I never have clients whose</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents made them too independent.</v>

1019
00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I always have the reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

1020
00:55:39.271 --> 00:55:41.340
<v Speaker 1>not that all my clients have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular problem,</v>

1021
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:44.340
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental problem is they</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot get away from their family.</v>

1022
00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:47.790
<v Speaker 1>They've been infant dialyzed or more</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately,</v>

1023
00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:53.450
<v Speaker 1>their families have conspired to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>them remain in an infant dialyzed state.</v>

1024
00:55:55.770 --> 00:56:00.240
<v Speaker 1>And so their world is the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't get out of the world of the</v>

1025
00:56:00.241 --> 00:56:02.400
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense that's still</v>

1026
00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:04.590
<v Speaker 1>childhood or adolescence because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not dealing with the,</v>

1027
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:06.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concern to the broader world.</v>

1028
00:56:06.991 --> 00:56:11.991
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the analysis of that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>done by Freud most particularly in his</v>

1029
00:56:12.421 --> 00:56:14.820
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization of the oedipal</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

1030
00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Now Freud concretize that in a variety</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ways that I don't think were</v>

1031
00:56:18.421 --> 00:56:21.090
<v Speaker 1>particularly helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had his finger on the right</v>

1032
00:56:21.091 --> 00:56:22.380
<v Speaker 1>button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1033
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:25.210
<v Speaker 1>human are unbelievably dependent when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're born.</v>

1034
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:30.880
<v Speaker 1>So a mammal of our size should have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gestation period of two years,</v>

1035
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:31.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1036
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:36.190
<v Speaker 1>if we were comparable to other mammals</v>
<v Speaker 1>of approximately our size being pregnant</v>

1037
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:38.110
<v Speaker 1>for two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does not sound like fun.</v>

1038
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:39.640
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1039
00:56:39.641 --> 00:56:41.140
<v Speaker 1>if you look at animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say like,</v>

1040
00:56:41.141 --> 00:56:41.860
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1041
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:45.040
<v Speaker 1>like a deer or moose or animals like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1042
00:56:45.041 --> 00:56:48.400
<v Speaker 1>pretty much as soon as they're born they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get up and walk.</v>

1043
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 15 months,</v>

1044
00:56:51.281 --> 00:56:52.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's calling around like,</v>

1045
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:53.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little</v>

1046
00:56:56.150 --> 00:57:01.000
<v Speaker 1>helpless little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even stand up for 15 months.</v>

1047
00:57:01.001 --> 00:57:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Well that's because it's born in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense in fetal form.</v>

1048
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:08.590
<v Speaker 1>And so that makes it incredibly deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like a baby kangaroo except</v>

1049
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:10.500
<v Speaker 1>it's more developed in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1050
00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:13.990
<v Speaker 1>it makes it incredibly dependent in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that no other animal is.</v>

1051
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.480
<v Speaker 1>And then of course it takes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's see,</v>

1052
00:57:16.481 --> 00:57:19.300
<v Speaker 1>about 40%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50% of people your age live in their</v>

1053
00:57:19.301 --> 00:57:20.740
<v Speaker 1>parents' houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1054
00:57:20.741 --> 00:57:23.650
<v Speaker 1>so you're 20 or 21 or 19 or whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

1055
00:57:23.651 --> 00:57:25.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1056
00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:26.860
<v Speaker 1>you're still dependent fundamentally.</v>

1057
00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:32.080
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not that easy to break a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependence habit of 19 years.</v>

1058
00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:35.170
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your parents may foster your</v>

1059
00:57:35.171 --> 00:57:39.010
<v Speaker 1>independence and chase you the hell out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the house if they can try to make you</v>

1060
00:57:39.011 --> 00:57:44.011
<v Speaker 1>into a functional try to help you become</v>
<v Speaker 1>a functional and independent adult.</v>

1061
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:47.620
<v Speaker 1>But maybe not too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the,</v>

1062
00:57:47.621 --> 00:57:50.230
<v Speaker 1>maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the big problem because it's</v>

1063
00:57:50.231 --> 00:57:52.720
<v Speaker 1>actually rather frightening to develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

1064
00:57:52.721 --> 00:57:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Even though you get to be independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is supposed to be the payoff.</v>

1065
00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's easy for that process to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>interfered with.</v>

1066
00:57:58.781 --> 00:58:02.380
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that can really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interfere with it as maternal anxiety.</v>

1067
00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Now paternal anxiety can interfere with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it too,</v>

1068
00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:08.770
<v Speaker 1>but fathers tend to be substantially</v>
<v Speaker 1>less anxious than mothers.</v>

1069
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:12.100
<v Speaker 1>And so the classic Eda pulled mother is</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious.</v>

1070
00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:15.580
<v Speaker 1>And so every time the child tries to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's independent,</v>

1071
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:17.440
<v Speaker 1>her anxiety gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1072
00:58:17.441 --> 00:58:19.300
<v Speaker 1>you better be careful if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

1073
00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:22.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like you hear that 5,000 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1074
00:58:22.121 --> 00:58:23.740
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be able to take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>step without,</v>

1075
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:28.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without manifesting the anxiety that</v>

1076
00:58:28.781 --> 00:58:33.160
<v Speaker 1>you've been taught by a powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>external force.</v>

1077
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:35.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the oedipal complex in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutshell,</v>

1078
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.050
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a great thing to,</v>

1079
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.940
<v Speaker 1>to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll look,</v>

1080
00:58:39.941 --> 00:58:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to look at a movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>called Crumb,</v>

1081
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:43.023
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1082
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:48.260
<v Speaker 1>it's about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>underground cartoonist named our crump.</v>

1083
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:49.503
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1084
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:54.340
<v Speaker 1>it has some very interesting things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say about the oedipal complex.</v>

1085
00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1086
00:58:56.801 --> 00:59:00.330
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanism,</v>

1087
00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.720
<v Speaker 1>existentialism and phenomenology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narcotic clump together,</v>

1088
00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:09.480
<v Speaker 1>brilliant theorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of this came out in the</v>

1089
00:59:09.481 --> 00:59:11.610
<v Speaker 1>1950s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went it was,</v>

1090
00:59:11.611 --> 00:59:13.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think about it in some sense</v>

1091
00:59:13.261 --> 00:59:15.690
<v Speaker 1>as the precursor deposit of psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except that,</v>

1092
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.393
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

1093
00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Except that positive psychology has no</v>
<v Speaker 1>either in psychology or philosophy.</v>

1094
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Whereas existentialism has good</v>
<v Speaker 1>grounding in both and it's not naive.</v>

1095
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists believed that,</v>

1096
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:32.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the a clump them together for the</v>

1097
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:36.440
<v Speaker 1>purpose of this brief exposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that this group of</v>

1098
00:59:36.441 --> 00:59:40.490
<v Speaker 1>thinkers asks you to consider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a hard thing to do,</v>

1099
00:59:40.491 --> 00:59:43.580
<v Speaker 1>but if you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really worthwhile is forget about</v>

1100
00:59:43.581 --> 00:59:47.510
<v Speaker 1>your normal conceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your formal conceptions of what</v>

1101
00:59:47.511 --> 00:59:50.570
<v Speaker 1>constitutes reality and play this game</v>
<v Speaker 1>in stat.</v>

1102
00:59:50.571 --> 00:59:52.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an axiom shift.</v>

1103
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Instead of thinking that reality is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective world and you're like a</v>

1104
00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.340
<v Speaker 1>superfluous subjective observer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a transient subjective observer.</v>

1105
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that what reality is is what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1106
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:09.080
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everything you experience is equally</v>

1107
01:00:09.081 --> 01:00:11.660
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although there are different categories</v>

1108
01:00:11.661 --> 01:00:12.470
<v Speaker 1>of real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1109
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:15.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dream is not in the same category as</v>

1110
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.830
<v Speaker 1>the chair that you're sitting on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from the phenomenological point of</v>

1111
01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:21.880
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dream and an emotion is just as real a</v>

1112
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>phenomena as the chair is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1113
01:00:25.161 --> 01:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1114
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the game is sort of what,</v>

1115
01:00:28.281 --> 01:00:30.080
<v Speaker 1>what if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if we make that assumption?</v>

1116
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>So you make that assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next issue is</v>

1117
01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>what are the essential qualities of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you experience?</v>

1118
01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.550
<v Speaker 1>And that can be addressed in a variety</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ways.</v>

1119
01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:52.120
<v Speaker 1>One of the most important things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists are concerned about</v>

1120
01:00:52.121 --> 01:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>is fundamental anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the this group of thinkers would say,</v>

1121
01:00:56.591 --> 01:00:57.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1122
01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:01.360
<v Speaker 1>you have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you exist within this domain of</v>

1123
01:01:01.361 --> 01:01:04.090
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the phenomena that's most</v>

1124
01:01:04.091 --> 01:01:08.110
<v Speaker 1>manifest within that domain is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of anxiety or dread.</v>

1125
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:13.000
<v Speaker 1>That's a Kierkegaardian idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that as at in an experience</v>

1126
01:01:13.001 --> 01:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>constituted like yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is somewhat fragile,</v>

1127
01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:20.050
<v Speaker 1>which knows its limits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's localized in time and space,</v>

1128
01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental negative meaning in some</v>

1129
01:01:28.591 --> 01:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and dread.</v>

1130
01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that that's the fundamental</v>

1131
01:01:33.451 --> 01:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do about it?</v>

1132
01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>And so the existentialist id and sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>is</v>

1133
01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>observe your existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find those elements of being that</v>

1134
01:01:47.011 --> 01:01:52.011
<v Speaker 1>support you and pursue them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that will counterbalance the primary</v>

1135
01:01:53.671 --> 01:01:58.671
<v Speaker 1>feeling of dread and alienation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and allow you to exist in a</v>

1136
01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>manner that makes existence at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>bearable.</v>

1137
01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at the Floridians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1138
01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Verdean sorta think that if there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with you,</v>

1139
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

1140
01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>if you were just a normal person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be okay.</v>

1141
01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.760
<v Speaker 1>And since you're not a normal person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something went wrong.</v>

1142
01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Where's the existentialists take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite idea?</v>

1143
01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1144
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>you're screwed from day one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it is.</v>

1145
01:02:24.961 --> 01:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at you.</v>

1146
01:02:26.071 --> 01:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're flawed,</v>

1147
01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>are finite and there's a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1148
01:02:30.631 --> 01:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>a million things that you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1149
01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiring to do you in.</v>

1150
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like with a problem like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need more problems to be</v>

1151
01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just unstable to begin with.</v>

1152
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:48.770
<v Speaker 1>So they think conceive of negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion related pathology as an integral</v>

1153
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>part of being and then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1154
01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>given that it's like the Buddhist idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that life is suffering.</v>

1155
01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>It's the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't be wondering why your</v>

1156
01:02:58.801 --> 01:03:01.470
<v Speaker 1>pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so obvious why your pathological,</v>

1157
01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.920
<v Speaker 1>how could you help but be pathological?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is given that what should</v>

1158
01:03:07.711 --> 01:03:10.740
<v Speaker 1>you do about it or even is there</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you can do about it and that's</v>

1159
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:16.470
<v Speaker 1>the question that we'll try to unfold in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this section of the course.</v>

1160
01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing that's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about this group of thinkers</v>

1161
01:03:23.101 --> 01:03:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I think is that especially the later</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones like,</v>

1162
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I include Solzhenitsyn has a personality</v>

1163
01:03:28.951 --> 01:03:31.530
<v Speaker 1>theorist for for reasons that I won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to you about now.</v>

1164
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn was a Russian author and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a book called the Gulag</v>

1165
01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was published in the 1970s and it</v>

1166
01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:40.890
<v Speaker 1>was one of the things that knocked over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union because it revealed for</v>

1167
01:03:40.891 --> 01:03:44.250
<v Speaker 1>the first time just how corrupt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderous the Soviet system was.</v>

1168
01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's interesting about</v>

1169
01:03:45.841 --> 01:03:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn and also about frankl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Viktor Frankl,</v>

1170
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:52.230
<v Speaker 1>who was a psychiatrist who had been put</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Nazi death camps,</v>

1171
01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:57.500
<v Speaker 1>is that they were very integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with the idea of the intrinsic</v>

1172
01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.110
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fullness and meaninglessness of human</v>

1173
01:04:01.111 --> 01:04:02.160
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing.</v>

1174
01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.480
<v Speaker 1>So that's the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that element.</v>

1175
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.610
<v Speaker 1>But the second thing they were concerned</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

1176
01:04:05.611 --> 01:04:10.611
<v Speaker 1>and this sort of made them logical</v>
<v Speaker 1>followers of Nietzsche,</v>

1177
01:04:10.861 --> 01:04:15.861
<v Speaker 1>was what effect is your decision about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of your life have on the</v>

1178
01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:17.520
<v Speaker 1>broader social community?</v>

1179
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:21.540
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that your nihilistic or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a totalitarian.</v>

1180
01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:25.140
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not an isolated unit.</v>

1181
01:04:25.141 --> 01:04:26.820
<v Speaker 1>You're interacting with people all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1182
01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:28.890
<v Speaker 1>You have a tremendous network of</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections.</v>

1183
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of it this way.</v>

1184
01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:34.170
<v Speaker 1>You know a thousand people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of those thousand people knows a</v>

1185
01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:36.240
<v Speaker 1>thousand people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means you're one person from</v>

1186
01:04:36.241 --> 01:04:40.560
<v Speaker 1>1,000,002 from a billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of being some little</v>

1187
01:04:40.561 --> 01:04:44.550
<v Speaker 1>localized.in an random array of dots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>7 billion of them,</v>

1188
01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.130
<v Speaker 1>you're the center of a connected</v>
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

1189
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.850
<v Speaker 1>And so if there's something that's gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>astray with your psychic functioning,</v>

1190
01:04:50.851 --> 01:04:54.510
<v Speaker 1>your psychological functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly does that do to the broader</v>

1191
01:04:54.511 --> 01:04:58.170
<v Speaker 1>social community and soldier Nixon's</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea and Frankel's as well?</v>

1192
01:04:58.171 --> 01:04:59.750
<v Speaker 1>It's quite straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the two.</v>

1193
01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:03.300
<v Speaker 1>The reason that societies become</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological,</v>

1194
01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:07.890
<v Speaker 1>deeply murderously pathological is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because individuals within this society</v>

1195
01:05:07.891 --> 01:05:10.800
<v Speaker 1>have become deeply and murderously</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological.</v>

1196
01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:15.150
<v Speaker 1>So instead of society in which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that the Marxists would think,</v>

1197
01:05:15.151 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that you're the of social</v>

1198
01:05:17.891 --> 01:05:20.080
<v Speaker 1>forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists would say,</v>

1199
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sure about that.</v>

1200
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:25.870
<v Speaker 1>It's the quality of the individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions that you make on a personal</v>

1201
01:05:25.871 --> 01:05:28.840
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>day to day that spread out into the</v>

1202
01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:31.660
<v Speaker 1>broader community and either improve it</v>
<v Speaker 1>or pathologize it.</v>

1203
01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm gonna have you read both</v>
<v Speaker 1>frank align solution medicine because I</v>

1204
01:05:35.201 --> 01:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>think they make viciously powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments that that is in fact the case.</v>

1205
01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:43.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually quite a useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny thing because often this is</v>

1206
01:05:43.841 --> 01:05:46.330
<v Speaker 1>sort of associated with the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>facing dragons.</v>

1207
01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Often you learn the things that are most</v>
<v Speaker 1>vital to your being by considering the</v>

1208
01:05:50.741 --> 01:05:53.560
<v Speaker 1>worst possible phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I might say,</v>

1209
01:05:53.561 --> 01:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think about this.</v>

1210
01:05:54.941 --> 01:05:59.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea that frankl and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn and others by the way have</v>

1211
01:05:59.531 --> 01:06:03.520
<v Speaker 1>been propagating is that whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions you make that are moral on a</v>

1212
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.390
<v Speaker 1>day to day basis aren't isolated to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spread out into the community very</v>

1213
01:06:07.391 --> 01:06:12.391
<v Speaker 1>rapidly and so the fate of the community</v>
<v Speaker 1>is dependent in some sense on your</v>

1214
01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:14.320
<v Speaker 1>personal morality.</v>

1215
01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.260
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a terrible thing.</v>

1216
01:06:17.261 --> 01:06:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a terrible weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly provides an answer to,</v>

1217
01:06:20.651 --> 01:06:23.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should I do what I do?</v>

1218
01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:25.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do good things,</v>

1219
01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.410
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They propagate,</v>

1220
01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:28.480
<v Speaker 1>do bad things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

1221
01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:31.900
<v Speaker 1>They propagate to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the really interesting things</v>

1222
01:06:31.901 --> 01:06:34.960
<v Speaker 1>about the existentialist is they took a</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at what happened in the 20th</v>

1223
01:06:34.961 --> 01:06:39.310
<v Speaker 1>century with its ungodly murderous</v>
<v Speaker 1>political systems and said,</v>

1224
01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.460
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just exactly what responsibility does</v>

1225
01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:45.880
<v Speaker 1>the individual bear for bringing those</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions about?</v>

1226
01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1227
01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:52.270
<v Speaker 1>we're thinking about and it certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't lost its relevance.</v>

1228
01:06:52.271 --> 01:06:53.230
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

1229
01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:54.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as relevant as ever,</v>

1230
01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:56.560
<v Speaker 1>so that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1231
01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:58.390
<v Speaker 1>that's really an interesting thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1232
01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Then we move into the fields that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>more strictly scientific,</v>

1233
01:07:02.441 --> 01:07:06.460
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of what we've covered in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the class provides the</v>

1234
01:07:06.461 --> 01:07:10.210
<v Speaker 1>platform for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you about the</v>

1235
01:07:10.211 --> 01:07:15.211
<v Speaker 1>structure and function of the basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological systems that underlie your</v>

1236
01:07:16.331 --> 01:07:19.390
<v Speaker 1>motivations and your emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And roughly speaking,</v>

1237
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:23.920
<v Speaker 1>we're going to say that a motivational</v>
<v Speaker 1>system sets a goal for you.</v>

1238
01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.020
<v Speaker 1>So if you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're goal is to eat.</v>

1239
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if you're thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're goal is to consume some liquid</v>

1240
01:07:30.490 --> 01:07:33.640
<v Speaker 1>goal setting systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a system for each of those.</v>

1241
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.100
<v Speaker 1>We'll call them drives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though that's we'll call the</v>

1242
01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:42.460
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems because they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>really drives where his emotions are,</v>

1243
01:07:42.461 --> 01:07:47.320
<v Speaker 1>things that are more likely to manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves as markers for your position</v>

1244
01:07:47.321 --> 01:07:49.240
<v Speaker 1>on the way to the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1245
01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:53.140
<v Speaker 1>if you have a goal in mind and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressing towards it without any</v>

1246
01:07:53.141 --> 01:07:55.060
<v Speaker 1>obstacles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel positive emotions.</v>

1247
01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.270
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a goal in mind and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're progressing towards it and you</v>

1248
01:07:58.271 --> 01:08:01.270
<v Speaker 1>encounter obstacles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to experience negative</v>

1249
01:08:01.271 --> 01:08:04.150
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I want to do is outline what I</v>

1250
01:08:04.151 --> 01:08:09.151
<v Speaker 1>think is the best relatively current</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience on the structure and</v>

1251
01:08:09.581 --> 01:08:13.180
<v Speaker 1>function of those systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we'll see is that there's a</v>

1252
01:08:13.181 --> 01:08:17.630
<v Speaker 1>nice analog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the peer Jedi and story about how the</v>

1253
01:08:17.631 --> 01:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>psyche develops and the way the brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized.</v>

1254
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:25.810
<v Speaker 1>And there's a nice analog between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories of psychological symbolism that</v>

1255
01:08:26.901 --> 01:08:31.901
<v Speaker 1>were pursued by the depths psychologists</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the relationship between the brain</v>

1256
01:08:33.111 --> 01:08:38.111
<v Speaker 1>areas that subsume your sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuality and the underlying</v>

1257
01:08:39.561 --> 01:08:44.450
<v Speaker 1>motivational and emotional systems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guide and drive and constrained and</v>

1258
01:08:44.451 --> 01:08:45.770
<v Speaker 1>allow your behavior.</v>

1259
01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:47.253
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1260
01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.410
<v Speaker 1>so that'll put some biology underneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theorizing and I think that's a</v>

1261
01:08:53.411 --> 01:08:55.450
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also a very fun thing to have</v>

1262
01:08:55.451 --> 01:08:58.090
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then after that we're going to talk</v>

1263
01:08:58.091 --> 01:09:03.091
<v Speaker 1>about five factor trait theory and fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>the five factor trait theory is the most</v>

1264
01:09:03.761 --> 01:09:08.761
<v Speaker 1>modern formulation of psychometric</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory and psychometric theory is the</v>

1265
01:09:09.421 --> 01:09:14.421
<v Speaker 1>statistical reduction of dis data sets</v>
<v Speaker 1>that describe human personality.</v>

1266
01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:19.300
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

1267
01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:21.850
<v Speaker 1>so if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I took an infinite bank of questions</v>

1268
01:09:21.851 --> 01:09:25.810
<v Speaker 1>that I could ask you about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and then I subjected them to</v>

1269
01:09:25.811 --> 01:09:29.680
<v Speaker 1>the proper kind of statistical analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could group those questions into</v>

1270
01:09:29.681 --> 01:09:32.980
<v Speaker 1>coherent groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I would discover is that your</v>

1271
01:09:32.981 --> 01:09:36.370
<v Speaker 1>personality has something resembling a</v>
<v Speaker 1>five factor structure,</v>

1272
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.530
<v Speaker 1>five dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of dimensions.</v>

1273
01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:41.200
<v Speaker 1>The world has four dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1274
01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Your personality has five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's plenty complicated and we're</v>

1275
01:09:45.011 --> 01:09:47.650
<v Speaker 1>going to walk through what those</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions are,</v>

1276
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:52.000
<v Speaker 1>what the variability represents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they might be related to the</v>

1277
01:09:52.001 --> 01:09:55.330
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems and the thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns that we discovered earlier.</v>

1278
01:09:55.510 --> 01:10:00.010
<v Speaker 1>And then all the practical consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>of knowing about those systems.</v>

1279
01:10:00.011 --> 01:10:02.590
<v Speaker 1>And we actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the model I'm going to present you with</v>

1280
01:10:02.591 --> 01:10:06.040
<v Speaker 1>this tiered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the top level is stability and</v>

1281
01:10:06.041 --> 01:10:09.070
<v Speaker 1>plasticity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next tier is the standard five</v>

1282
01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:12.220
<v Speaker 1>factor model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion and openness that makes up</v>

1283
01:10:12.221 --> 01:10:14.350
<v Speaker 1>plasticity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

1284
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:16.480
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1285
01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:20.300
<v Speaker 2>what's the other one there?</v>

1286
01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.000
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1287
01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:23.670
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1288
01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

1289
01:10:24.601 --> 01:10:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Emotional stability reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1290
01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then underneath that,</v>

1291
01:10:28.201 --> 01:10:31.770
<v Speaker 1>each of those breaks into two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I want to describe to you the</v>

1292
01:10:31.771 --> 01:10:36.771
<v Speaker 1>most current research on what each of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those hierarchical tiers mean and why</v>

1293
01:10:37.831 --> 01:10:40.200
<v Speaker 1>you want to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time I'm going to have</v>

1294
01:10:40.201 --> 01:10:45.201
<v Speaker 1>you do a personality analysis online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what it will do is help you identify</v>

1295
01:10:45.331 --> 01:10:49.740
<v Speaker 1>your personality virtues using a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>five model and your personality faults</v>

1296
01:10:49.741 --> 01:10:52.650
<v Speaker 1>also using a big five months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that'll give you some insight into</v>

1297
01:10:52.651 --> 01:10:56.910
<v Speaker 1>who you are and what the Hell's wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you and also what's good about you</v>

1298
01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:01.830
<v Speaker 1>at the same time that we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborate these dimensions on a,</v>

1299
01:11:01.831 --> 01:11:06.831
<v Speaker 1>at a conceptual level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's in a nutshell the course</v>

1300
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:15.120
<v Speaker 1>I want the readings and the order in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you have to do them are listed on</v>

1301
01:11:15.121 --> 01:11:15.600
<v Speaker 1>the website.</v>

1302
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.000
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not going to go through them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be relatively self</v>

1303
01:11:18.001 --> 01:11:21.030
<v Speaker 1>explanatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to read Chapter 15 of the</v>

1304
01:11:21.031 --> 01:11:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Black Swan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I want you to read that</v>

1305
01:11:23.641 --> 01:11:28.641
<v Speaker 1>is because it questions the validity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard normal distribution model</v>

1306
01:11:29.071 --> 01:11:33.420
<v Speaker 1>that psychometrics is predicated on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wilcock a lot more about that later.</v>

1307
01:11:33.421 --> 01:11:36.930
<v Speaker 1>But I think you need to know it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to learn in psychology that</v>

1308
01:11:36.931 --> 01:11:41.040
<v Speaker 1>most things are normally distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of the statistics that you'll</v>

1309
01:11:41.041 --> 01:11:44.400
<v Speaker 1>use in psychology are predicated on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that they're normal distribution</v>

1310
01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.920
<v Speaker 1>holds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's lots of situations in which</v>

1311
01:11:46.921 --> 01:11:49.410
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hold and they're important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1312
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:52.440
<v Speaker 1>money is not normally distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1313
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:55.980
<v Speaker 1>1% of the population has 50% of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1314
01:11:55.981 --> 01:12:00.150
<v Speaker 1>And then if you take that 1% and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the top 1% of that,</v>

1315
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:03.480
<v Speaker 1>then they have 50% of all the money that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top 1% has.</v>

1316
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And lots of phenomena like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Artistic productivity is like that.</v>

1317
01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Anything that people create productively</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like that.</v>

1318
01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:12.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1319
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:16.430
<v Speaker 1>exams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look this up on the website.</v>

1320
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Here's what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are three exams,</v>

1321
01:12:18.691 --> 01:12:23.691
<v Speaker 1>they're not cumulative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one 15% essay of 750 words and</v>

1322
01:12:23.911 --> 01:12:27.270
<v Speaker 1>the online exercise and it's pass fail</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

1323
01:12:27.271 --> 01:12:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I'm going to grade you</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your virtues of your faults.</v>

1324
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:31.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your problem,</v>

1325
01:12:31.441 --> 01:12:33.210
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1326
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:36.720
<v Speaker 1>so all we'll do is check to see that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've actually gone through the</v>

1327
01:12:36.721 --> 01:12:39.570
<v Speaker 1>exercise and half intelligible manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1328
01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:44.400
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I want to start with</v>

1329
01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:51.730
<v Speaker 1>that so you can write it down if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

1330
01:12:51.731 --> 01:12:53.560
<v Speaker 1>But here's a couple of things I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you.</v>

1331
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some insight into my own</v>

1332
01:12:57.641 --> 01:13:00.070
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very industrious,</v>

1333
01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not very orderly and a very high in</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness.</v>

1334
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:07.030
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm telling you that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some things you should</v>

1335
01:13:07.031 --> 01:13:10.510
<v Speaker 1>consider if you want to take this course</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should really consider them</v>

1336
01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.640
<v Speaker 1>because not every course is for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

1337
01:13:13.570 --> 01:13:18.280
<v Speaker 1>If you're unbelievably organized person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not the course for you.</v>

1338
01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a contradiction between</v>

1339
01:13:22.151 --> 01:13:26.270
<v Speaker 1>openness and orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about orderliness is that</v>

1340
01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:30.100
<v Speaker 1>orderliness puts everything into boxes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the boxes are tight and the</v>

1341
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:33.280
<v Speaker 1>dichotomies are black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not criticizing that.</v>

1342
01:13:33.281 --> 01:13:36.130
<v Speaker 1>There's great utility in orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but orderliness,</v>

1343
01:13:36.131 --> 01:13:40.390
<v Speaker 1>fights with openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like to break boxes apart.</v>

1344
01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:44.380
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're the sort of person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is orderly,</v>

1345
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:45.730
<v Speaker 1>we're like really orderly.</v>

1346
01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:47.680
<v Speaker 1>You'll know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How clean is your room,</v>

1347
01:13:47.681 --> 01:13:50.080
<v Speaker 1>like is have you alphabetized your soup</v>
<v Speaker 1>cans?</v>

1348
01:13:50.081 --> 01:13:52.900
<v Speaker 1>If you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this is not the course for you,</v>

1349
01:13:54.150 --> 01:13:57.310
<v Speaker 1>you to to take this course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two things that have to</v>

1350
01:13:57.311 --> 01:14:00.730
<v Speaker 1>characterize you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is you have to be willing to read.</v>

1351
01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reading load is quite,</v>

1352
01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's overwhelmingly heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the material is quite difficult and</v>

1353
01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:09.130
<v Speaker 1>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is plenty of it.</v>

1354
01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:13.000
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that interest you like don't take the</v>

1355
01:14:13.001 --> 01:14:15.160
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing is,</v>

1356
01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're the sort of person who</v>

1357
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.250
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously talks about ideas with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends,</v>

1358
01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:24.850
<v Speaker 1>you know when you find conversations</v>
<v Speaker 1>about things that aren't related to</v>

1359
01:14:24.851 --> 01:14:26.950
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat tedious,</v>

1360
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:30.070
<v Speaker 1>then this is the course for you because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1361
01:14:30.071 --> 01:14:34.750
<v Speaker 1>it's really because I'm an open person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but make my course.</v>

1362
01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but created in that image.</v>

1363
01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm really interested in ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I tried to tell you why it's</v>

1364
01:14:42.341 --> 01:14:45.580
<v Speaker 1>necessary to know them because an idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an interesting to me,</v>

1365
01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:50.410
<v Speaker 1>unless it has utility for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're going to go all over,</v>

1366
01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:51.790
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1367
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:56.770
<v Speaker 1>if you want a road that's defined and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a single track towards a goal that</v>

1368
