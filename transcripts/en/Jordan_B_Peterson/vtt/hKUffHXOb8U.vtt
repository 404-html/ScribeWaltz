<v Speaker 1>It's an Ode to our listeners.</v>

10

<v Speaker 1>We're recording this in front of a live </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience at the American Enterprise </v>

11
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.983
<v Speaker 1>Institute in Washington DC where </v>

<v Speaker 1>grateful to Aei every week for the use </v>

14
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:50.524
<v Speaker 1>of its recording studio for the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now for an introduction though he </v>

15
00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>needs no introduction to the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

16
00:00:57.521 --> 00:00:58.354
<v Speaker 1>but Jordan Peterson is a professor at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the University of Toronto and author of </v>

17
00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:03.124
<v Speaker 1>many books and and poster of many </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic lecturers and his most recent </v>

18
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 1>book has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep track of how many languages</v>

19
00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:12.394
<v Speaker 1>it's been translated into and the sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a phenomenally successful book </v>

20
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.280
<v Speaker 1>tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

21
00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:20.680
<v Speaker 1>my first question is really about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>tour.</v>

22
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.260
<v Speaker 1>You look pretty good for somebody who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>visited what,</v>

23
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 1>100 cities in the past since January </v>
<v Speaker 1>23rd.</v>

24
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you do it and mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>flying.</v>

25
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.523
<v Speaker 1>What do you do for fun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you ever get to relax in brief </v>

26
00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:41.950
<v Speaker 1>moments and what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on twitter and</v>

27
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.043
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I've been qualified that is </v>

28
00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 2>relaxing and I tried to forestall that </v>
<v Speaker 2>temptation as much as possible.</v>

29
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the automotive bit of time that I</v>

30
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 2>spend with my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She does travel with me and so,</v>

31
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had,</v>

32
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.483
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we try to take some time to walk around </v>

33
00:01:58.041 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 2>the cities that we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

34
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 2>and see what we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

35
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.473
<v Speaker 2>we're usually not at any given place for</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than a day or two and they're </v>

36
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:07.730
<v Speaker 2>usually pretty packed up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

37
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.833
<v Speaker 2>whatever is associated with the lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then with press that the publishers </v>

38
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:13.634
<v Speaker 2>usually arrange.</v>

39
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard you interviewed in Sweden in </v>

40
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Stockholm and you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a half an hour to visit the city</v>

41
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:24.130
<v Speaker 1>with your wife and you loved it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

42
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true</v>

43
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.160
<v Speaker 2>breaks where you get them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

44
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:28.994
<v Speaker 2>the thing is is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lecture tour is unbelievably </v>

45
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:36.080
<v Speaker 2>positive and a lot of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is ridiculously positive,</v>

46
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

47
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:40.910
<v Speaker 2>so if I'm going out on the streets now </v>
<v Speaker 2>or in cafes or you know,</v>

48
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:41.744
<v Speaker 2>airports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meet people all the time and they're </v>

49
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.510
<v Speaker 2>always polite and they're always happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see me and they always have some very</v>

50
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:54.731
<v Speaker 2>touching story to relate and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audiences themselves are very positively</v>

51
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 2>predisposed to whatever it is that doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

52
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:04.921
<v Speaker 2>And so that makes it a lot easier to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay motivated and,</v>

53
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.063
<v Speaker 2>and to continue right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's demanding because </v>

54
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.314
<v Speaker 2>everything's scheduled so tightly and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do a different lecture every </v>

55
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

56
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.003
<v Speaker 2>every time I go,</v>

57
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.883
<v Speaker 3>I find that amazing because I get a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of lectures that I anguish over every </v>

58
00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:23.954
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I have another one and you go </v>

59
00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:27.740
<v Speaker 3>up without notes.</v>

60
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

61
00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I have a large collection of things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what,</v>

62
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.613
<v Speaker 2>how to talk about and usually what I try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do is to formulate a problem before </v>

63
00:03:36.231 --> 00:03:41.231
<v Speaker 2>the lecture so I'm addressing a specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem and then I can track how I would</v>

64
00:03:41.991 --> 00:03:44.630
<v Speaker 2>set up the argument and then I walked </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it,</v>

65
00:03:44.631 --> 00:03:48.290
<v Speaker 2>but part of it's also an attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 2>formulate the argument on the fly,</v>

66
00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

67
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:49.683
<v Speaker 2>to make the question what would you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>to formulate it more precisely and to </v>

68
00:03:52.761 --> 00:03:56.420
<v Speaker 2>make a more precise and engaging answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I can use the audience to judge</v>

69
00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:58.460
<v Speaker 2>whether or not that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's happening.</v>

70
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.210
<v Speaker 2>And so it's also a real challenge to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

71
00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:03.044
<v Speaker 2>So I enjoyed that and it's a excellent </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual workout and I've been </v>

72
00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:09.374
<v Speaker 2>recording the lectures and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>using fair some of them to write the </v>

73
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:18.260
<v Speaker 2>first draft of the chapters for my next </v>
<v Speaker 2>book and for books after that.</v>

74
00:04:18.261 --> 00:04:19.310
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:04:19.311 --> 00:04:21.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to maximize the,</v>

76
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:22.603
<v Speaker 2>what would you say that utility of doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this at each event and my wife seems to </v>

77
00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:29.420
<v Speaker 2>be particularly well suited to traveling</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

78
00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:30.254
<v Speaker 2>She actually enjoys it quite a bit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very stable person and so that's </v>

79
00:04:36.981 --> 00:04:38.060
<v Speaker 2>also helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

80
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

81
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.561
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

82
00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:40.394
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to have an extra brain along </v>
<v Speaker 2>because things are scheduled so tightly </v>

83
00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:45.500
<v Speaker 2>that we don't ever have any room for </v>
<v Speaker 2>error.</v>

84
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

85
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.340
<v Speaker 3>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

86
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.683
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how intellectually rigorous</v>
<v Speaker 3>we plan to be with you today because we </v>

87
00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:56.210
<v Speaker 3>know that when ever you on one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>platform,</v>

88
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.660
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about your ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on the fence planners,</v>

89
00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:02.510
<v Speaker 3>we want to hear more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit more about Jordan Peterson,</v>

90
00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:07.250
<v Speaker 3>the man desk desperately and definitely </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to hear about your wife Tammy,</v>

91
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 3>and also you're so well known for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>views on men or how your ideas have been</v>

92
00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:17.240
<v Speaker 3>taken up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So enthusiastic or by young men,</v>

93
00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:19.940
<v Speaker 3>but we want to talk to about women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

94
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:20.930
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

95
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.803
<v Speaker 3>but</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you and I share is </v>

96
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.980
<v Speaker 3>that we both grew up in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I promise,</v>

97
00:05:27.981 --> 00:05:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Christine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would not do my Canadian accent.</v>

98
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.890
<v Speaker 3>So while you were here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you grew up in rural Alberta.</v>

99
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

100
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 3>and you are what the country's most </v>
<v Speaker 3>famous guru now since Marshall Mcluhan,</v>

101
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.583
<v Speaker 3>m and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the fact that you came from </v>

102
00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have any effect on your views,</v>

103
00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:53.060
<v Speaker 3>do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has it formed you in any way?</v>

104
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did,</v>

105
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.303
<v Speaker 3>what would it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would it be the same if you think </v>

106
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 3>you'd grown in rural Texas?</v>

107
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.640
<v Speaker 1>How is Canada contributed to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview?</v>

108
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.240
<v Speaker 1>She's always looking to the Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angle Canada.</v>

109
00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:06.130
<v Speaker 1>So in Canada,</v>

110
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.713
<v Speaker 2>well I think is a particular part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada I grew up in probably was </v>

111
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 2>formative to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the town I grew up in was only 50</v>

112
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:18.194
<v Speaker 2>years old and the particular part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world that I grew up in was really the </v>

113
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 2>last settled part of the North American </v>
<v Speaker 2>prairie.</v>

114
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 2>This was outside of Edmonton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

115
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Both 400 miles north of Edmonton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

116
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.833
<v Speaker 2>400 years.</v>

117
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

118
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>it's right at the tip of the short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short,</v>

119
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.710
<v Speaker 1>short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the prairie,</v>

120
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.153
<v Speaker 2>the prairie stretches up that far north.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stretches up farther north in </v>

121
00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:42.040
<v Speaker 2>Alberta than it does anywhere else in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the North American continent.</v>

122
00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:45.910
<v Speaker 2>And so we were at the tip of viable </v>
<v Speaker 2>farming essentially,</v>

123
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.010
<v Speaker 2>and so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

124
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.660
<v Speaker 2>it was a new place and it was a rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>raw place and it was,</v>

125
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.940
<v Speaker 2>it was a rather harsh place in many </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

126
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.410
<v Speaker 2>especially because of the winter and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was fundamentally a working class place,</v>

127
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.450
<v Speaker 2>although a prosperous working class </v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

128
00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:02.284
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because most of the industry there was </v>

129
00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:04.744
<v Speaker 2>related to the oil and gas industry on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although it was cyclical when things </v>

130
00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:12.520
<v Speaker 2>were good working class people could </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a very good living.</v>

131
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.860
<v Speaker 2>This was during the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

132
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.763
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to be a kid in 400 miles outside a </v>

133
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:21.150
<v Speaker 1>small town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

134
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.320
<v Speaker 2>I liked it when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

135
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.500
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it was as fun when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a teenager.</v>

136
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not convinced that,</v>

137
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people who are teenagers</v>

138
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.350
<v Speaker 2>necessarily have the most wonderful time</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

139
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:36.723
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think adults often look backwards at </v>

140
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:40.264
<v Speaker 2>the pass through rose colored glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what the cartoonist </v>

141
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.670
<v Speaker 2>trudeau accused Reagan of doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually.</v>

142
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.193
<v Speaker 2>Gary,</v>

143
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Mr. No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

144
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.313
<v Speaker 1>definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Used for it in your book was teenage </v>

145
00:07:56.411 --> 00:07:57.510
<v Speaker 1>wasteland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

146
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>what you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

147
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:04.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's Canadianness does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that form you or affected you,</v>

148
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.860
<v Speaker 1>if at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it didn't.</v>

149
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.153
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've lived in lots of different </v>

150
00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:13.650
<v Speaker 2>parts of Canada now and and Canada does </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite different.</v>

151
00:08:13.651 --> 00:08:18.510
<v Speaker 2>I lived in Alberta for a while and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>had this particular flavor of existence.</v>

152
00:08:18.511 --> 00:08:19.344
<v Speaker 2>I mean mostly in fairview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was striving to leave [inaudible] and </v>

153
00:08:23.701 --> 00:08:26.460
<v Speaker 2>to move ahead let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or two moves,</v>

154
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.223
<v Speaker 2>I hesitate to say up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somewhere different somewhere more </v>

155
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.580
<v Speaker 2>urban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the case with many people.</v>

156
00:08:32.581 --> 00:08:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean the small towns all across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>West in theU ,</v>

157
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:35.873
<v Speaker 2>s and Canada are dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're down to nothing because </v>

158
00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:43.110
<v Speaker 2>everyone's moved to the cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in Montreal for a good while and</v>

159
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.180
<v Speaker 2>that was interesting because it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

160
00:08:45.181 --> 00:08:49.530
<v Speaker 2>very different culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a culture that was to some degree</v>

161
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.430
<v Speaker 2>stratified by language and by class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that was true in Alberta because</v>

162
00:08:53.431 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 2>it was so new that there is no class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

163
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 2>So that was quite</v>

164
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You worked what I loved.</v>

165
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 3>I pulled a passage because I think as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

166
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.340
<v Speaker 3>people are born in small places </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and someone to leave and some</v>

167
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said I wanted to be elsewhere.</v>

168
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.113
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone who eventually left the </v>

169
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:12.144
<v Speaker 3>fairview I grew up knew they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving by the age of 12 I knew and my </v>

170
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 3>wife who grew up with me on the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>street knew.</v>

171
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 3>What was that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you call that?</v>

172
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 3>What's the thing that makes you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave and sets you off?</v>

173
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 3>Because you point out there was no class</v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

174
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.890
<v Speaker 3>Education was cheap in Canada compared </v>
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>

175
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't ego,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't cost.</v>

176
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 3>It was stopping people from a middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>class or you other</v>

177
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.980
<v Speaker 2>teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my wouldn't.</v>

178
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.570
<v Speaker 2>My mother was a librarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Bush,</v>

179
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.730
<v Speaker 2>you're trained as a nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

180
00:09:39.731 --> 00:09:41.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a comfortable,</v>

181
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I would say a suburban lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>

182
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:46.183
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

183
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.080
<v Speaker 2>moderate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle class suburban lifestyle.</v>

184
00:09:48.081 --> 00:09:48.914
<v Speaker 2>That's what fair have you looked like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked like a suburb that was built </v>

185
00:09:50.871 --> 00:09:51.704
<v Speaker 2>mostly in the ninth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say between the 19 fifties in the 19 </v>

186
00:09:53.631 --> 00:09:55.340
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

187
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.310
<v Speaker 3>the young Jordan and the then young </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tammy,</v>

188
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:01.100
<v Speaker 3>and you'll have to tell us that story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you met but wanted,</v>

189
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.293
<v Speaker 3>wanted more.</v>

190
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.373
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

191
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:09.000
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one thing that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>different to some degree about class.</v>

192
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.643
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my father and my mother had both left </v>

193
00:10:14.261 --> 00:10:15.094
<v Speaker 2>the towns they were from and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward future looking people and you </v>

194
00:10:18.881 --> 00:10:19.714
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of my friends who quit school and </v>

195
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.120
<v Speaker 2>who didn't attend university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have,</v>

196
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.390
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that more developed sense of</v>

197
00:10:29.391 --> 00:10:32.870
<v Speaker 2>a world outside of what they knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing is that my,</v>

198
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.110
<v Speaker 2>my father took us on long trips when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a kid.</v>

199
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.273
<v Speaker 2>He was a teacher and so he had summer </v>
<v Speaker 2>holidays and we drove all over western </v>

200
00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Canada and down into theU ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s long driving trips,</v>

201
00:10:43.581 --> 00:10:45.420
<v Speaker 2>thousands of miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

202
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.500
<v Speaker 2>that also gave us the sense that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world was a bigger place.</v>

203
00:10:48.501 --> 00:10:49.334
<v Speaker 2>But I knew way before I was 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that I was off at least to </v>

204
00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:56.060
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think generally in your family,</v>

205
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.960
<v Speaker 2>if you're liable to go to university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't even really talk about it.</v>

206
00:10:59.961 --> 00:11:02.450
<v Speaker 2>It's just a given that that's what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to happen.</v>

207
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.310
<v Speaker 2>It's something that you take in with </v>
<v Speaker 2>every breath almost.</v>

208
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.583
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an and it's often an unspoken </v>

209
00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:11.804
<v Speaker 2>expectation and maybe people make casual</v>
<v Speaker 2>reference like well when you go to </v>

210
00:11:15.831 --> 00:11:16.664
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like there's a question </v>

211
00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:19.424
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you're from a working class </v>

212
00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:24.320
<v Speaker 2>background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if your family hasn't pursued</v>

213
00:11:24.321 --> 00:11:25.154
<v Speaker 2>postsecondary education that isn't in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the realm of unspoken or spoken </v>

214
00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:31.220
<v Speaker 2>expectation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't like,</v>

215
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.083
<v Speaker 2>like lots of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including many of them who dropped out </v>

216
00:11:33.981 --> 00:11:36.530
<v Speaker 2>before they hit high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't by,</v>

217
00:11:36.531 --> 00:11:39.800
<v Speaker 2>they were by no means the dumbest people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the class.</v>

218
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.663
<v Speaker 2>Like they were plenty smart but they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't oriented towards the idea of </v>

219
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.640
<v Speaker 2>pursuing a career that involved </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual.</v>

220
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 2>What intellectual engagement wasn't in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their worldview.</v>

221
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.320
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hear people on the,</v>

222
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 2>let's say more socialist end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution,</v>

223
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:02.794
<v Speaker 2>talk about barriers to education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are often talk about cost and </v>

224
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.490
<v Speaker 2>sometimes cost is a barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

225
00:12:07.491 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's more the merrier.</v>

226
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's more of a barrier,</v>

227
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:11.044
<v Speaker 2>although there's still plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>community colleges and state colleges </v>

228
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 2>where you can get educated for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly reasonable amount of money.</v>

229
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.273
<v Speaker 2>But for my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was never a reason that money was </v>

230
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:22.384
<v Speaker 2>never a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't pursue post secondary </v>

231
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:24.454
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was more like a truncated view of </v>

232
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.890
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

233
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:30.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was more of an emphasis on the </v>

234
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:34.360
<v Speaker 2>here and now and there were jobs the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty.</v>

235
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:35.800
<v Speaker 2>I guess there also that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

236
00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And well paying jobs,</v>

237
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:38.434
<v Speaker 2>like it wasn't obvious that you were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>better shape economically to go to </v>

238
00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:41.530
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

239
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.720
<v Speaker 2>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

240
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.583
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you were doing something </v>

241
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:45.570
<v Speaker 2>like working on the oil rigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

242
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.310
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

243
00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:49.450
<v Speaker 2>that was rough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold,</v>

244
00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:50.284
<v Speaker 2>harsh work and it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't once you had an in you could </v>

245
00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:57.160
<v Speaker 2>stay employed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't that easy to land an entry</v>

246
00:12:57.161 --> 00:12:59.350
<v Speaker 2>level job either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

247
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

248
00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:02.104
<v Speaker 2>well it was wise for lots of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He caused people to work in those jobs </v>

249
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:07.060
<v Speaker 2>because they were unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>lucrative.</v>

250
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:08.613
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they should have been because they </v>

251
00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:11.950
<v Speaker 2>were very difficult and dangerous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>frigid cold and,</v>

252
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.300
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rough.</v>

253
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.193
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

254
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.850
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the people didn't earn </v>
<v Speaker 2>your money.</v>

255
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Let's just tell us quickly how you met </v>
<v Speaker 2>your wife.</v>

256
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:20.194
<v Speaker 2>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you met her when you were seven or </v>

257
00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:24.850
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or in grade three and grade three?</v>

258
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

259
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.750
<v Speaker 2>did you fall in love with her in grade </v>
<v Speaker 2>three?</v>

260
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Grade three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

261
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.410
<v Speaker 2>And was it mutual?</v>

262
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.750
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wouldn't admit it if it was.</v>

263
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 2>There were lots of the boys in grade </v>
<v Speaker 2>three were in love with her.</v>

264
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:41.883
<v Speaker 2>She had a whole little crew of guys that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were perfectly willing to follow her </v>

265
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:47.500
<v Speaker 2>around and she was perfectly willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploit that.</v>

266
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.650
<v Speaker 2>She very good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

267
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.930
<v Speaker 2>She was very popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little girl.</v>

268
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you met his children.</v>

269
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.370
<v Speaker 2>We were friends for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

270
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.233
<v Speaker 2>we used to play chess together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>croquet and she is a vicious croquet </v>

271
00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:02.180
<v Speaker 2>player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would,</v>

272
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever played </v>
<v Speaker 2>croquet,</v>

273
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:04.834
<v Speaker 2>but if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your balls touch then you can stand </v>

274
00:14:08.111 --> 00:14:08.944
<v Speaker 2>on Ireson wack it and then the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>person's ball will vanish off into the </v>

275
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.983
<v Speaker 2>stratosphere and she liked to knock it </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way down the street and then </v>

276
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:21.130
<v Speaker 2>she'd laugh and so she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she always had a good sense of,</v>

277
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.063
<v Speaker 2>of good vicious sense of humor is one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things I actually admired about my </v>

278
00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:28.120
<v Speaker 2>wife when we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we've had our verbal disputes,</v>

279
00:14:28.121 --> 00:14:29.470
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have certainly happened.</v>

280
00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.390
<v Speaker 2>She can string together a sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>insults that.</v>

281
00:14:32.391 --> 00:14:37.330
<v Speaker 2>So hair racing that you have to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

282
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.000
<v Speaker 2>did she have brothers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did.</v>

283
00:14:40.001 --> 00:14:42.280
<v Speaker 2>She has a brother much older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight years older,</v>

284
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 2>but he's quite a peaceful person and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>had two brothers can't seem to get along</v>

285
00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 2>with guys where they show love and </v>
<v Speaker 2>affection by</v>

286
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.143
<v Speaker 3>insults and jabs and jeers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you and I had brother and I sort </v>

287
00:14:57.181 --> 00:14:57.951
<v Speaker 3>of learned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

288
00:14:57.951 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't have brothers,</v>

289
00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:00.201
<v Speaker 3>girls like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

290
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:01.280
<v Speaker 3>that's so rude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so,</v>

291
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.120
<v Speaker 3>so she was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

292
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

293
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.573
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has a naturally or maybe case she </v>

294
00:15:06.551 --> 00:15:10.190
<v Speaker 3>came by it naturally in twists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She lost her father is,</v>

295
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.610
<v Speaker 2>are quite sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>witted and,</v>

296
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.170
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

297
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.343
<v Speaker 2>well he was a real town character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still alive and he was a real </v>

298
00:15:17.721 --> 00:15:19.790
<v Speaker 2>character in the tone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real hyper extrovert.</v>

299
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.683
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knew him and he had a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>good width on them and she had some of </v>

300
00:15:24.831 --> 00:15:26.720
<v Speaker 2>that while it still does have some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

301
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:32.110
<v Speaker 2>so she was a side from her humor and her</v>

302
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.330
<v Speaker 3>ability to whack balls and I just don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to go further on that description,</v>

303
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.960
<v Speaker 3>that many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many things that tells us about you.</v>

304
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.340
<v Speaker 3>What else brought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else attract.</v>

305
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've known her pretty much your</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole life,</v>

306
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.973
<v Speaker 3>so some of the other qualities that not </v>
<v Speaker 3>just attracted you but enable you to </v>

307
00:15:50.791 --> 00:15:51.720
<v Speaker 3>sustain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

308
00:15:51.721 --> 00:15:54.450
<v Speaker 3>I think every young person in this room </v>
<v Speaker 3>will want to know,</v>

309
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.060
<v Speaker 3>and maybe there isn't one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's the secret?</v>

310
00:15:57.061 --> 00:15:58.590
<v Speaker 3>What's it like to be with someone that </v>
<v Speaker 3>long?</v>

311
00:15:58.591 --> 00:16:00.420
<v Speaker 3>How do you sustain that?</v>

312
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.380
<v Speaker 2>We're fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it's,</v>

313
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.490
<v Speaker 2>some of it's good fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I would say this is true,</v>

314
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I've watched people in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships,</v>

315
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.873
<v Speaker 2>no personally for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also as a professional because I've </v>

316
00:16:12.431 --> 00:16:16.780
<v Speaker 2>done a lot of clinical counseling and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean there's some things that need to be</v>

317
00:16:16.781 --> 00:16:17.614
<v Speaker 2>a given about the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it doesn't hurt to find the </v>

318
00:16:21.011 --> 00:16:23.740
<v Speaker 2>other person very attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:16:23.741 --> 00:16:24.574
<v Speaker 2>and that's a mysterious thing where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not exactly sure what it is that </v>

320
00:16:27.731 --> 00:16:29.950
<v Speaker 2>produces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say chemistry between people.</v>

321
00:16:29.951 --> 00:16:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Although chemistry is definitely part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what produces it.</v>

322
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.920
<v Speaker 2>There's subtle things that attract </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to one another that are way below</v>

323
00:16:35.921 --> 00:16:38.440
<v Speaker 2>the level of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

324
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.800
<v Speaker 2>women don't like the older men who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>rh blood factors.</v>

325
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Who if they had children with would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to produce a stillborn infant.</v>

326
00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Well that's definitely a category on </v>
<v Speaker 3>match.com.</v>

327
00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so strange though,</v>

328
00:16:55.741 --> 00:16:58.870
<v Speaker 3>because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

329
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.260
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

330
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by older apparently,</v>

331
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:02.933
<v Speaker 3>and so there's all wearing Cologne</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it would depend on what type of </v>

332
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Cologne</v>
<v Speaker 3>smell is very</v>

333
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.083
<v Speaker 2>strange sense and it's very deeply tied </v>
<v Speaker 2>to very profound emotions including </v>

334
00:17:17.801 --> 00:17:18.634
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you find people attractive for </v>

335
00:17:20.231 --> 00:17:25.231
<v Speaker 2>reasons that you can't always determine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

336
00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.000
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was part of it.</v>

337
00:17:28.001 --> 00:17:28.834
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've always found her very </v>
<v Speaker 2>attractive and that continues and I </v>

338
00:17:32.561 --> 00:17:34.570
<v Speaker 2>liked her combativeness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

339
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.433
<v Speaker 2>like I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want someone I think in a </v>

340
00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:39.754
<v Speaker 2>relationship that you can spar with and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's partly because you have hard </v>

341
00:17:46.001 --> 00:17:51.001
<v Speaker 2>problems to solve and if the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're with isn't willing to put forward</v>

342
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.063
<v Speaker 2>their opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you only have half the cognitive </v>

343
00:17:55.501 --> 00:17:56.334
<v Speaker 2>power that you would otherwise have now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hopefully you find someone who's </v>

344
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.433
<v Speaker 2>interestingly different from you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not so different that you can't </v>

345
00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:06.390
<v Speaker 2>communicate and you have to be careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

346
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.590
<v Speaker 2>But interestingly different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then hopefully they have the ability</v>

347
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:12.450
<v Speaker 2>and the will to express their opinion.</v>

348
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 2>And then all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's,</v>

349
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then your interests stays </v>

350
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:20.190
<v Speaker 2>heightened and there has to be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tension in a relationship.</v>

351
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think,</v>

352
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.140
<v Speaker 2>well I want to get along perfectly with </v>
<v Speaker 2>my partner.</v>

353
00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:26.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

354
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:27.403
<v Speaker 2>you probably don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just get bored and then you go </v>

355
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:31.074
<v Speaker 2>looking for trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you want a little bit of trouble </v>

356
00:18:33.301 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 2>in the relationship and the little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mystery and a little bit of combat of</v>

357
00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:41.571
<v Speaker 2>medicine and the ability to exchange </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinions forthrightly and,</v>

358
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.070
<v Speaker 2>and I trust her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a huge element.</v>

359
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:46.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

360
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 2>when we finally did decide to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>together permanently,</v>

361
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:53.180
<v Speaker 2>we're both in our later twenties and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

362
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:58.190
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I had learned by </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point and insisted to her about was</v>

363
00:18:59.101 --> 00:19:04.101
<v Speaker 2>that we had to tell each other the truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she took to that wholeheartedly,</v>

364
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

365
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 2>for better and for worse because truths </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be harsh.</v>

366
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Does that include like does this outfit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

367
00:19:16.881 --> 00:19:17.714
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the truthful answer to that is I don't </v>

368
00:19:18.561 --> 00:19:20.570
<v Speaker 3>answer questions that are likely to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>me in trouble.</v>

369
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.840
<v Speaker 3>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a son who will answer honestly,</v>

370
00:19:26.841 --> 00:19:27.674
<v Speaker 3>and it's infuriating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I realized if you want the </v>

371
00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:31.140
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to Tamworth.</v>

372
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.810
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

373
00:19:32.811 --> 00:19:33.644
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's useful to know the truth is </v>

374
00:19:35.511 --> 00:19:38.570
<v Speaker 3>empowering truth tellers are </v>
<v Speaker 3>charismatic.</v>

375
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.600
<v Speaker 3>And actually both my sons are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>brutally honest,</v>

376
00:19:41.601 --> 00:19:42.770
<v Speaker 3>which is disconcerting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

377
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.473
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see that it has made them very </v>

378
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.000
<v Speaker 3>formidable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

379
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:50.953
<v Speaker 3>and because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people trust them and friendships and </v>

380
00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.060
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gives them the.</v>

381
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:57.590
<v Speaker 3>And you've written a lot about this.</v>

382
00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.331
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

383
00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:00.450
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I tell my wife that she looks good in</v>

384
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:01.900
<v Speaker 2>an outfit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knows that I mean it.</v>

385
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's some utility.</v>

386
00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:04.923
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you're silent and say I </v>

387
00:20:05.801 --> 00:20:07.850
<v Speaker 3>don't answer her questions that she goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she goes,</v>

388
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.020
<v Speaker 3>well sometimes sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

389
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:10.900
<v Speaker 3>she'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

390
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.120
<v Speaker 3>do you like this and all Keller that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

391
00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.470
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

392
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.230
<v Speaker 3>and that really</v>

393
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.630
<v Speaker 2>make her happy in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

394
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:22.170
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I do say I like it,</v>

395
00:20:22.171 --> 00:20:24.300
<v Speaker 2>she knows that I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

396
00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:26.040
<v Speaker 2>I actually liked her sense of style a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

397
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:29.190
<v Speaker 2>So it turns out that 90 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time it's pretty easy for me to say,</v>

398
00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:31.390
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you look great and mean it.</v>

399
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.190
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

400
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.700
<v Speaker 2>she's a fairly harsh standard bearer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

401
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.593
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's insisted that I stay in whatever </v>

402
00:20:39.481 --> 00:20:41.760
<v Speaker 2>reasonable physical shape I happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in,</v>

403
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:42.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

404
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:43.403
<v Speaker 2>that was something that she's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>demanding of and I would say that it's </v>

405
00:20:46.531 --> 00:20:51.531
<v Speaker 2>the same my side and we've been good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiating,</v>

406
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.130
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

407
00:20:54.131 --> 00:20:56.500
<v Speaker 2>what do you want from a partner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>

408
00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.910
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want need,</v>

409
00:20:57.911 --> 00:20:58.744
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing is that I'll hopefully </v>

410
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.481
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

411
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:02.314
<v Speaker 2>you're blessed with the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>find each other attractive and I think </v>

412
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:05.974
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>to begin or proceed or sustain itself </v>

413
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 2>without that.</v>

414
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.250
<v Speaker 2>But having that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what do you want?</v>

415
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.980
<v Speaker 2>While you want someone that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust,</v>

416
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.833
<v Speaker 2>you want someone that you can build a </v>
<v Speaker 2>view of the future with and you want </v>

417
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:21.454
<v Speaker 2>someone that you can negotiate with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's very hard to negotiate with </v>

418
00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:27.340
<v Speaker 2>people because they have to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they think.</v>

419
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.130
<v Speaker 2>They have to know what they want or </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure it out.</v>

420
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:30.964
<v Speaker 2>They have to tell you what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to be satisfied when they get </v>

421
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:34.744
<v Speaker 2>what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also a very difficult thing to </v>

422
00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:36.994
<v Speaker 2>manage and you have to continually </v>
<v Speaker 2>update that because your life goes </v>

423
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:41.254
<v Speaker 2>through different stages and well in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your attraction wanes as we all know it </v>

424
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.290
<v Speaker 2>are</v>

425
00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:50.290
<v Speaker 3>agent live not fatally necessarily for </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself but but no,</v>

426
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:54.540
<v Speaker 3>but you will go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you will not be 25 forever so.</v>

427
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.270
<v Speaker 2>So that that has to be renegotiated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

428
00:21:57.271 --> 00:21:59.160
<v Speaker 2>well when you have to work at that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

429
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.063
<v Speaker 2>and that's something that people also </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand because they tend to </v>

430
00:22:02.311 --> 00:22:04.640
<v Speaker 2>think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

431
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:09.120
<v Speaker 2>the that all romantic interaction should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be spontaneous.</v>

432
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.141
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

433
00:22:10.141 --> 00:22:10.974
<v Speaker 2>if that's your theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you might as well just give up </v>

434
00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.853
<v Speaker 2>right now if you're going to get married</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that like the only reason you </v>

435
00:22:17.101 --> 00:22:17.934
<v Speaker 2>can think that is because you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough responsibility to make romantic </v>

436
00:22:21.151 --> 00:22:24.330
<v Speaker 2>entanglement virtually impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens when you're married,</v>

437
00:22:24.331 --> 00:22:26.040
<v Speaker 2>especially when you have little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

438
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.680
<v Speaker 2>and you both have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

439
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.753
<v Speaker 2>is you're so busy that the probability </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to find time for </v>

440
00:22:32.521 --> 00:22:36.330
<v Speaker 2>spontaneous mutual interaction is </v>
<v Speaker 2>decreased to zero.</v>

441
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.720
<v Speaker 2>And so if that's what you're hoping for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're never gonna have it.</v>

442
00:22:39.721 --> 00:22:43.200
<v Speaker 2>And so what you have to do is you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make time for each other and you know</v>

443
00:22:43.201 --> 00:22:44.034
<v Speaker 2>if you're dating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're establishing a relationship </v>

444
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.580
<v Speaker 2>while you put some effort into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know you,</v>

445
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.483
<v Speaker 2>you decide that you're going to go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>for dinner and you dress up to some </v>

446
00:22:52.981 --> 00:22:53.814
<v Speaker 2>degree and you know you try to present </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself to each other in some halfways </v>

447
00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:57.623
<v Speaker 2>mutually acceptable manner and you hope </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's going to be a positive </v>

448
00:23:00.751 --> 00:23:01.584
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to find each other </v>

449
00:23:02.761 --> 00:23:03.594
<v Speaker 2>attractive.</v>

450
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.600
<v Speaker 2>But then as people somehow think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>once they're married,</v>

451
00:23:06.601 --> 00:23:09.390
<v Speaker 2>that the same amount of effort isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

452
00:23:09.391 --> 00:23:10.224
<v Speaker 2>And that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say more effort is necessary on </v>

453
00:23:14.041 --> 00:23:16.560
<v Speaker 2>the same front end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to think it through.</v>

454
00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:17.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

455
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:22.820
<v Speaker 2>if you don't want to be bitter about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimate element of your relationship,</v>

456
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.100
<v Speaker 2>how much time do you have to spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>together each week,</v>

457
00:23:26.101 --> 00:23:26.934
<v Speaker 2>and my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my rule of thumb sort of derived from </v>

458
00:23:29.311 --> 00:23:30.144
<v Speaker 2>clinical observations is that you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to spend 90 minutes a week with your </v>

459
00:23:33.661 --> 00:23:34.494
<v Speaker 2>partner talking and that means you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling each other about your life and </v>

460
00:23:38.431 --> 00:23:40.320
<v Speaker 2>staying in touch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

461
00:23:40.321 --> 00:23:41.154
<v Speaker 2>so that you each know what the other is </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to and you're discussing what needs </v>

462
00:23:44.491 --> 00:23:45.324
<v Speaker 2>to be done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the household running smoothly and </v>

463
00:23:47.061 --> 00:23:47.894
<v Speaker 2>you're laying out some mutually </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable vision of how the next week </v>

464
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 2>or the next months are going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

465
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:53.683
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

466
00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 2>that keeps your narratives locked </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

467
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the strands in a rope.</v>

468
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:58.663
<v Speaker 2>You need that for 90 minutes or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>drift apart and you need to spend </v>

469
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.140
<v Speaker 2>intimate time together at least once a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week and probably more like twice.</v>

470
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.410
<v Speaker 2>And that has to be negotiated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't negotiate it and if you</v>

471
00:24:09.411 --> 00:24:13.130
<v Speaker 2>don't make it a priority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it won't happen in all likelihood.</v>

472
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

473
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.170
<v Speaker 2>well then you don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a catastrophe because there's</v>

474
00:24:18.171 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 2>not that many things in life that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>intrinsically,</v>

475
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:22.993
<v Speaker 2>what would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging and meaningful and pleasurable </v>

476
00:24:25.071 --> 00:24:29.180
<v Speaker 2>and also bonding all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you let that go,</v>

477
00:24:29.181 --> 00:24:30.014
<v Speaker 2>then well part of you dies and part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship dies and while then </v>

478
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:34.994
<v Speaker 2>there's always the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming attracted by alternative </v>

479
00:24:37.161 --> 00:24:38.720
<v Speaker 2>entanglement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

480
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.450
<v Speaker 2>which you would do if you had any spirit</v>
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

481
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the thing is if,</v>

482
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:44.540
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not,</v>

483
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.990
<v Speaker 2>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your relationship at home is entirely</v>

484
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.260
<v Speaker 2>unsatisfying sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you supposed to do with that?</v>

485
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is supposed to just bear it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>one way.</v>

486
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:56.930
<v Speaker 2>The answer is yes because it's your </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage,</v>

487
00:24:56.931 --> 00:25:00.710
<v Speaker 2>but another way as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all the fight you've got in you.</v>

488
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:01.993
<v Speaker 2>You're going to just let the erotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>element of your life die and accept </v>

489
00:25:06.111 --> 00:25:06.944
<v Speaker 2>everything that goes along with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not willing to cause a </v>

490
00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:14.420
<v Speaker 2>bit of trouble to ensure that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintained and you know,</v>

491
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:17.060
<v Speaker 2>and we're not very good at thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things through consciously.</v>

492
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.493
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are bad at negotiating period as </v>

493
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:21.134
<v Speaker 2>far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're particularly bad at </v>

494
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.650
<v Speaker 2>negotiating things that are deeply </v>
<v Speaker 2>private.</v>

495
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.770
<v Speaker 2>How much do you want your partner to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know about you anyways?</v>

496
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.353
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot of trust to have a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation about what you need and </v>

497
00:25:33.381 --> 00:25:34.214
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

498
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Now you have it in the press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People read that you are a.</v>

499
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:47.730
<v Speaker 1>You have a following of young men and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to hear your lecture and Washington</v>

500
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.730
<v Speaker 1>DC and there were a lot of women there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your book,</v>

501
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:54.123
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men don't buy books that often compared </v>

502
00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:56.554
<v Speaker 1>to women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm presuming you have a lot of </v>

503
00:25:57.731 --> 00:25:58.564
<v Speaker 1>female readers and I found it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Danielle and I found it completely </v>

504
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.793
<v Speaker 1>readable and it wasn't uncommon for men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more like a delusional desire on </v>

505
00:26:08.741 --> 00:26:09.574
<v Speaker 1>the part of the radical leftists that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only people that could possibly be </v>

506
00:26:12.221 --> 00:26:14.430
<v Speaker 1>attracted to me or angry men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

507
00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.960
<v Speaker 1>It'd be better if they were angry young </v>
<v Speaker 1>white men,</v>

508
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then that fits the narrative.</v>

509
00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:19.623
<v Speaker 1>Particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a way you have a diverse </v>

510
00:26:20.921 --> 00:26:21.754
<v Speaker 1>audience and diverse following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including many women and they're also </v>

511
00:26:24.191 --> 00:26:25.960
<v Speaker 1>not particularly angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

512
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:28.023
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to 200 using the anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the point of your book is stop </v>

513
00:26:30.721 --> 00:26:32.290
<v Speaker 1>being angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop being resentful.</v>

514
00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

515
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.320
<v Speaker 2>Of resentment is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's absolutely crippling.</v>

516
00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just zenman deceit,</v>

517
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:39.730
<v Speaker 2>arrogance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of.</v>

518
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing another book and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules is don't allow yourself to</v>

519
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.760
<v Speaker 1>resentful receiptful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deceitful and arrogant fingers together.</v>

520
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it could be rad if you just.</v>

521
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's supposed to be a good thing.</v>

522
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

523
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.990
<v Speaker 2>There's been 250,000 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

524
00:26:58.991 --> 00:27:01.960
<v Speaker 2>come to the lectures and there hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>been a single negative incident.</v>

525
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:02.953
<v Speaker 1>Not One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I find fascinating is that </v>

526
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:06.803
<v Speaker 1>I found you early on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I'd had no idea you were just </v>

527
00:27:10.761 --> 00:27:11.594
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like butch cassidy and the </v>

528
00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Sundance kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who is that guy?</v>

529
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.343
<v Speaker 1>Who is that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you were pretty good and we were </v>

530
00:27:19.141 --> 00:27:21.430
<v Speaker 1>covering a lot of the same topics later </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

531
00:27:21.431 --> 00:27:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

532
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:23.830
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:24.983
<v Speaker 1>I found out who you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is astonishing to me is that </v>

534
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.273
<v Speaker 1>there's this amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just split between the positivity of </v>

535
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:36.300
<v Speaker 1>your audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diversity of your audience,</v>

536
00:27:36.301 --> 00:27:37.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

537
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual content of your message</v>

538
00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:43.590
<v Speaker 1>and then you get with a snarky </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist with an agenda.</v>

539
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.390
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not mentioning names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

540
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.670
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

541
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.553
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this young woman from a Gq and it was </v>

542
00:27:54.511 --> 00:27:57.180
<v Speaker 1>just me on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was just like lady.</v>

543
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha,</v>

544
00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For we don't want to blame the BBC saint</v>

545
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.470
<v Speaker 1>and then I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she seemed,</v>

546
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as often she seemed intelligent and</v>

547
00:28:07.051 --> 00:28:07.884
<v Speaker 1>capable of insight up to a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost as if something had </v>

548
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.780
<v Speaker 1>seized her mind and show you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had something new.</v>

549
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.733
<v Speaker 1>But I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be a poly says that a whole </v>

550
00:28:21.931 --> 00:28:22.764
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of our most talented young women </v>

551
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.750
<v Speaker 1>are incapable of thought because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

552
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:28.663
<v Speaker 1>I thought maybe you can just an openness</v>
<v Speaker 1>to she couldn't and you were saying </v>

553
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.510
<v Speaker 1>completely like interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>

554
00:28:36.511 --> 00:28:40.050
<v Speaker 1>original things even to me who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied these topics and.</v>

555
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.473
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

556
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was quite the day.</v>

557
00:28:42.991 --> 00:28:46.240
<v Speaker 2>So I went to Baltimore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You survived it very well,</v>

558
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:50.940
<v Speaker 2>but it just made me think a lot that day</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I went there and I had to go out</v>

559
00:28:50.941 --> 00:28:53.190
<v Speaker 2>of my way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm complaining,</v>

560
00:28:53.191 --> 00:28:55.710
<v Speaker 2>but there's a reason for saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

561
00:28:55.711 --> 00:28:57.660
<v Speaker 2>so I got there in Baltimore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

562
00:28:57.661 --> 00:28:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Well I was talking in Baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

563
00:28:59.261 --> 00:29:00.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

564
00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.853
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

565
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:01.763
<v Speaker 2>the aquarium and I showed up to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the hotel room where this was all </v>

566
00:29:04.861 --> 00:29:08.760
<v Speaker 2>occurring and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you expect generally speaking,</v>

567
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.560
<v Speaker 2>even from journalists who aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

568
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.430
<v Speaker 2>who are more of the attack dog variety </v>
<v Speaker 2>or who may be,</v>

569
00:29:14.431 --> 00:29:18.390
<v Speaker 2>aren't positively predisposed to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologically or personally,</v>

570
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.740
<v Speaker 2>you expect a certain modicum of </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional politeness.</v>

571
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because while you don't have to be there</v>

572
00:29:25.891 --> 00:29:29.220
<v Speaker 2>and you came and you and you accepted an</v>
<v Speaker 2>invitation and,</v>

573
00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>

574
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.550
<v Speaker 2>And so even with the channel for </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists,</v>

575
00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Kathy Newman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was quite polite and,</v>

576
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:40.530
<v Speaker 2>and forthcoming in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the green room before the interview,</v>

577
00:29:40.531 --> 00:29:41.364
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she would have had at least that </v>

578
00:29:42.371 --> 00:29:44.020
<v Speaker 2>professional persona,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

579
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not nothing right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something to be said for,</v>

580
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.433
<v Speaker 2>for going through the motions </v>
<v Speaker 2>professionally in an inappropriate </v>

581
00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:55.300
<v Speaker 2>manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I walked into the hotel room in</v>

582
00:29:55.301 --> 00:29:58.810
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was obvious that this interviewer had</v>

583
00:29:58.811 --> 00:30:03.040
<v Speaker 2>already made up her mind about me 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent and that she was absolutely,</v>

584
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:04.283
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negatively predisposed to me with a </v>

585
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:09.530
<v Speaker 2>personal animus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Animus is exactly the right word.</v>

586
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:10.923
<v Speaker 2>There was about a half an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>photography session because it was Gq </v>

587
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.770
<v Speaker 2>and so I was in that atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The photographers were fine.</v>

588
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:18.604
<v Speaker 2>I was in that atmosphere for about 45 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes before we started to talk and </v>

589
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.833
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that I'm so I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>as calm during that interview is are </v>

590
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:29.913
<v Speaker 2>usually I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little bit harsher and the reason </v>

591
00:30:31.571 --> 00:30:32.790
<v Speaker 2>for that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.210
<v Speaker 2>it just started off instantly combative </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

593
00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.710
<v Speaker 2>and what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I should have done,</v>

594
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.630
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

595
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:45.780
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to be awake enough to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things properly and they interview</v>

596
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:47.800
<v Speaker 2>progressed fine.</v>

597
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.633
<v Speaker 2>Although by the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that I had maybe done enough </v>

598
00:30:50.501 --> 00:30:55.060
<v Speaker 2>interviews for awhile because I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think I had regulated my temper as well.</v>

599
00:30:55.061 --> 00:30:57.280
<v Speaker 2>During that interview as I might've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish.</v>

600
00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.430
<v Speaker 2>Well so bad.</v>

601
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.593
<v Speaker 3>So you were getting it and then she </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought up a question about anger and I </v>

602
00:31:03.691 --> 00:31:07.670
<v Speaker 3>just saw you kind of adjust and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>after that it was smooth sailing.</v>

603
00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Well that's good because it was touch </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>

604
00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:10.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

605
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:11.361
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

606
00:31:11.361 --> 00:31:13.580
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're running out of patients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you know,</v>

607
00:31:13.581 --> 00:31:16.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's time to dial back on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews because you know,</v>

608
00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.310
<v Speaker 2>I've had many interviews like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very.</v>

609
00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:23.720
<v Speaker 2>I find them like it takes me like three </v>
<v Speaker 2>days to recover from an interview.</v>

610
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.090
<v Speaker 3>You start thinking yourself like what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>should've said,</v>

611
00:31:26.091 --> 00:31:27.770
<v Speaker 3>I should've said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I dragged myself mad.</v>

612
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.330
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you did very well.</v>

613
00:31:29.331 --> 00:31:30.164
<v Speaker 3>But it's so interesting that what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>told me was how parochial she was and </v>

614
00:31:35.361 --> 00:31:38.540
<v Speaker 3>she lives in her own little world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

615
00:31:38.541 --> 00:31:41.330
<v Speaker 3>More a little bit about the ideology of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our time and Gosh,</v>

616
00:31:41.331 --> 00:31:45.530
<v Speaker 3>you encountered this everywhere and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to write about this wisely.</v>

617
00:31:45.531 --> 00:31:46.580
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would encounter it.</v>

618
00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:47.893
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think part of the issue is that you </v>

619
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:55.550
<v Speaker 3>will acknowledge that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences between the sexes.</v>

620
00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.490
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that's a hell of a heresy.</v>

621
00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.300
<v Speaker 3>Heresy because when I was reading your </v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

622
00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.493
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing about it that is anti </v>

623
00:32:09.021 --> 00:32:09.990
<v Speaker 3>female.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

624
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:10.853
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do a lot of examination of the Adam </v>

625
00:32:12.711 --> 00:32:13.544
<v Speaker 3>and Eve story and you have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful passage about like Adam being </v>

626
00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.530
<v Speaker 3>the originally agreed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

627
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.770
<v Speaker 4>The man who throws the woman under the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sea,</v>

628
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:27.540
<v Speaker 4>a return fault do you made her</v>
<v Speaker 4>really funny.</v>

629
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:29.773
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

630
00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.250
<v Speaker 4>so there's nothing in you</v>

631
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.260
<v Speaker 3>this and the rules such as they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

632
00:32:34.261 --> 00:32:37.920
<v Speaker 3>they seem very common sensical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could apply to anyone.</v>

633
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so is that a fair</v>

634
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:41.683
<v Speaker 2>surmise of why you get so attacked a </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just the very fact that you're </v>

635
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:47.114
<v Speaker 2>willing to speak about the sexes as </v>
<v Speaker 2>being not unequal but different but </v>

636
00:32:51.441 --> 00:32:52.610
<v Speaker 2>equal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

637
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

638
00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:59.510
<v Speaker 2>I would say that that's part of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a threat there.</v>

639
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that happened when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Scandinavia,</v>

640
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I just wrote a column about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

641
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was interesting being in Scandinavia,</v>

642
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:08.354
<v Speaker 2>especially in Sweden because they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushed the equality of opportunity </v>

643
00:33:11.661 --> 00:33:14.790
<v Speaker 2>doctrine farther than any other country </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world today.</v>

644
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:19.930
<v Speaker 2>It almost started there like in the UN </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the original charter.</v>

645
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.630
<v Speaker 2>The Swedes were there and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've never given us.</v>

646
00:33:22.631 --> 00:33:23.301
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

647
00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:24.134
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the week that I was there was the </v>

648
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:31.850
<v Speaker 2>same week that two articles were </v>
<v Speaker 2>published on gender differences,</v>

649
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:33.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

650
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.693
<v Speaker 2>in temperament and an interest in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest sex differences that we know of </v>

651
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:42.860
<v Speaker 2>that aren't morphological are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>

652
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:47.510
<v Speaker 2>So women are more interested in people </v>
<v Speaker 2>by and large and men are more interested</v>

653
00:33:47.511 --> 00:33:50.780
<v Speaker 2>in things by and large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the difference is actually large.</v>

654
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:54.800
<v Speaker 2>It's one standard deviation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that means if you're a man,</v>

655
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:56.443
<v Speaker 2>you would have to be more interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>people than 85 percent of men to be as </v>

656
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:03.920
<v Speaker 2>interested as 50 percent of women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a woman,</v>

657
00:34:03.921 --> 00:34:08.480
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be more interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>things than 85 percent of women to be as</v>

658
00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:09.314
<v Speaker 2>interested as the 50th percentile male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the difference is actually quite </v>

659
00:34:12.711 --> 00:34:13.544
<v Speaker 2>substantial and it's certainly large </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to drive occupational choice </v>

660
00:34:17.421 --> 00:34:18.254
<v Speaker 2>differences and it explains a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>configuration of people in the </v>

661
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:24.050
<v Speaker 2>workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

662
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:24.561
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

663
00:34:24.561 --> 00:34:25.394
<v Speaker 2>we're approach approaching parody in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of workplace overall workplace </v>

664
00:34:29.361 --> 00:34:30.194
<v Speaker 2>distribution of women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's massive differences in </v>

665
00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:34.580
<v Speaker 2>occupational choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's very interesting,</v>

666
00:34:34.581 --> 00:34:35.414
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to the website of the US labor </v>

667
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.710
<v Speaker 2>department and look at male and female </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated industries.</v>

668
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:43.543
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the top 10 male dominated </v>

669
00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:46.754
<v Speaker 2>industries have basically zero women in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brick layers being one of the </v>

670
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.423
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people three zones according </v>

671
00:34:53.931 --> 00:34:57.250
<v Speaker 2>to Camille Paglia that you find is a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of men in the people freeze up.</v>

672
00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

673
00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:59.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the women are in.</v>

674
00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:00.494
<v Speaker 2>You ask a group of women and men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you rather spend the next three </v>

675
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:07.760
<v Speaker 2>weeks taking apart a machine and putting</v>
<v Speaker 2>it together or helping a group of people</v>

676
00:35:07.761 --> 00:35:11.750
<v Speaker 2>work out their problems and the pool of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who want to do them,</v>

677
00:35:11.751 --> 00:35:14.120
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just far more men than women.</v>

678
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.983
<v Speaker 2>There's more men in women dominated </v>
<v Speaker 2>industries than there are women and men </v>

679
00:35:17.961 --> 00:35:21.620
<v Speaker 2>dominated industries at the extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like nursing.</v>

680
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Nursing is way more male nurses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brick layers.</v>

681
00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:29.860
<v Speaker 2>I've studied these male nurses and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>

682
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender activists are upset because they </v>

683
00:35:33.351 --> 00:35:34.310
<v Speaker 2>earn more than women.</v>

684
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.833
<v Speaker 2>And a professor of nursing at University</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Pennsylvania tried to find out why </v>

685
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:40.883
<v Speaker 2>and she found out they immediately find </v>
<v Speaker 2>out what's the best paying field </v>

686
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.233
<v Speaker 2>subfield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they go into like nurse </v>

687
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.273
<v Speaker 2>anesthesiology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it pays a lot more than men are there </v>

688
00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:53.390
<v Speaker 2>and disproportionate number and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to work in insane hours.</v>

689
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.010
<v Speaker 2>They're far more willing to move to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher same thing.</v>

690
00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:56.883
<v Speaker 2>Feral phone with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with gender differences is that men are </v>

691
00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 2>more willing to move million or more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more willing to,</v>

692
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.320
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

693
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.153
<v Speaker 2>work outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more willing to take on </v>

694
00:36:06.571 --> 00:36:07.404
<v Speaker 2>dangerous tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more likely to work in scalable </v>

695
00:36:09.571 --> 00:36:10.404
<v Speaker 2>industries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'd like you can't scale personal </v>

696
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:13.210
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really very.</v>

697
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:14.400
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>

698
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.300
<v Speaker 2>They're much less likely to work part </v>
<v Speaker 2>time if they have small businesses,</v>

699
00:36:18.301 --> 00:36:19.134
<v Speaker 2>they're much more likely to work full </v>
<v Speaker 2>time in the small business rather than </v>

700
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:22.530
<v Speaker 2>this than part time.</v>

701
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:23.803
<v Speaker 2>And I mean women have their reasons to </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to work part time and feral also </v>

702
00:36:26.911 --> 00:36:29.730
<v Speaker 2>pointed out that if you work 10 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer hours,</v>

703
00:36:29.731 --> 00:36:30.564
<v Speaker 2>you make 40 percent more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your non linear nonlinear return on </v>

704
00:36:33.511 --> 00:36:35.600
<v Speaker 2>overtime had something that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful to know,</v>

705
00:36:35.601 --> 00:36:38.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of your career to an employer.</v>

706
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.370
<v Speaker 2>They have some also marks you out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

707
00:36:41.371 --> 00:36:44.220
<v Speaker 2>like if you have 10 employees and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all doing a reasonable job,</v>

708
00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.860
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of them is working an extra half</v>

709
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 2>an hour a day or 45 minutes a day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can observe that everyday.</v>

710
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Then that gives them an edge with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to potential promotion and so.</v>

711
00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:56.520
<v Speaker 2>And the return on those edges is </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonlinear.</v>

712
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.833
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went to Scandinavia and it was the </v>

713
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:01.463
<v Speaker 2>same week that two studies were released</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing what had already been </v>

714
00:37:05.251 --> 00:37:10.251
<v Speaker 2>established beyond a shadow of a doubt </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the personality differences between</v>

715
00:37:10.351 --> 00:37:11.184
<v Speaker 2>men and women and the differences in </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest as well actually get bigger as </v>

716
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:18.680
<v Speaker 2>your society gets richer and as it gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>more egalitarian and,</v>

717
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.760
<v Speaker 2>and not just a little bit either.</v>

718
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.950
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing that's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting is you might think,</v>

719
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:23.784
<v Speaker 2>well the effect is it's the opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the social constructionists would </v>

720
00:37:27.541 --> 00:37:28.380
<v Speaker 2>predict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all.</v>

721
00:37:28.381 --> 00:37:29.214
<v Speaker 2>So that's the first thing to point out </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's not only that their hypothesis </v>

722
00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:36.540
<v Speaker 2>wasn't supported,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was decidedly refuted and,</v>

723
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:38.310
<v Speaker 2>and none of them have come to terms with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

724
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.081
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

725
00:37:39.081 --> 00:37:41.010
<v Speaker 2>and it's not a small effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

726
00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:41.844
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference between personality </v>

727
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.393
<v Speaker 2>between men and women in Scandinavia is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot larger than it is in non </v>

728
00:37:47.271 --> 00:37:52.080
<v Speaker 2>egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rural but true in the United States.</v>

729
00:37:52.081 --> 00:37:55.680
<v Speaker 2>And the richer the democratic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your household demographic,</v>

730
00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.633
<v Speaker 2>your household,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more likely the woman is to take </v>

731
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.490
<v Speaker 2>time out and be at home with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

732
00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Because you can afford to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she can afford to major in od,</v>

733
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low paying fields,</v>

734
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:07.703
<v Speaker 2>like a feminist dance therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing you see too is that one </v>

735
00:38:13.201 --> 00:38:15.510
<v Speaker 2>of the things that's also interesting I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is that,</v>

736
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this idea that made that </v>

737
00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:20.070
<v Speaker 2>marriage is a patriarchal institution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

738
00:38:20.071 --> 00:38:22.730
<v Speaker 2>that's primarily put there for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the utility of the,</v>

739
00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.840
<v Speaker 2>of the mail and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

740
00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.000
<v Speaker 2>like I think that's complete bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>rubbish.</v>

741
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.280
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think there's any evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>to support it at all.</v>

742
00:38:29.281 --> 00:38:31.320
<v Speaker 2>But I think the best counter evidence is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

743
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:32.663
<v Speaker 2>well if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then rich people shouldn't be getting </v>

744
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 2>married because they don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppress themselves.</v>

745
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:42.460
<v Speaker 2>But the truth of the matter is is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the higher your demographic position,</v>

746
00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:43.294
<v Speaker 2>the more likely you are to be married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So marriage is falling apart among the </v>

747
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:49.960
<v Speaker 2>more likely the wife is staying home and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

748
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean she has all sorts of pursuits but</v>

749
00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.040
<v Speaker 3>wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not.</v>

750
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an old saying,</v>

751
00:38:53.941 --> 00:38:54.774
<v Speaker 3>anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any woman who marries for money earns </v>

752
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.640
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now let me just.</v>

753
00:38:59.641 --> 00:39:00.474
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where you might get in a little </v>

754
00:39:01.261 --> 00:39:05.970
<v Speaker 3>trouble because in your book you call </v>
<v Speaker 3>men order and women chaos,</v>

755
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.833
<v Speaker 3>and you say order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The known appears symbolically </v>

756
00:39:09.271 --> 00:39:10.104
<v Speaker 3>associated with masculinity and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Eternal Feminine is also the </v>

757
00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:15.600
<v Speaker 3>crushing force of sexual selection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

758
00:39:15.601 --> 00:39:20.340
<v Speaker 3>What's up with that chaotic chaos?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men and women net</v>

759
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:21.263
<v Speaker 2>or order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's masculinity and femininity </v>

760
00:39:24.191 --> 00:39:29.191
<v Speaker 2>symbolically and so what's happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally is that we're.</v>

761
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Our brains are wired for social </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognition,</v>

762
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 2>so we're not natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists were natural sociologists.</v>

763
00:39:37.991 --> 00:39:40.840
<v Speaker 2>That might be a better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I shutter to think that that</v>

764
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:41.674
<v Speaker 2>might be true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially given the sales associate as </v>

765
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:44.314
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it triggering or maybe or or </v>

766
00:39:48.311 --> 00:39:49.144
<v Speaker 2>maybe we're more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're more naturally a people who </v>

767
00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:52.534
<v Speaker 2>observed through the lens of fiction and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what we see as the world as </v>

768
00:39:55.541 --> 00:40:00.541
<v Speaker 2>characterized and w the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's made out of men and women</v>

769
00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:05.440
<v Speaker 2>and children and those seem to be our </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental cognitive categories.</v>

770
00:40:05.441 --> 00:40:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>femininity and,</v>

771
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.133
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

772
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:09.103
<v Speaker 2>and then the category of children and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those categories have expanded to take </v>

773
00:40:14.141 --> 00:40:19.141
<v Speaker 2>on connotations outside of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of pure person perception.</v>

774
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.670
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

775
00:40:21.671 --> 00:40:22.504
<v Speaker 2>it's for this reason that if you go to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and that maybe it's a Disney </v>

776
00:40:25.331 --> 00:40:26.164
<v Speaker 2>animated movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I like to talk about those because </v>

777
00:40:28.211 --> 00:40:30.520
<v Speaker 2>they draw on a very deep symbolic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

778
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:35.650
<v Speaker 2>it's perfectly reasonable to see a witch</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lives in the swamp because those go</v>

779
00:40:35.651 --> 00:40:37.540
<v Speaker 2>together like it makes sense.</v>

780
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:38.583
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the which doesn't live in a gleaming </v>

781
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.790
<v Speaker 2>chrome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high rise,</v>

782
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:42.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she lives in the swamp.</v>

783
00:40:42.641 --> 00:40:43.474
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe</v>

784
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:46.270
<v Speaker 2>you could just fly up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's it.</v>

785
00:40:46.271 --> 00:40:48.280
<v Speaker 2>That's where the high rise would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>better for.</v>

786
00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:51.100
<v Speaker 2>The brain could take off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take off better.</v>

787
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.520
<v Speaker 2>But there are categories of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of symbolic association that are natural</v>

788
00:40:56.591 --> 00:40:57.424
<v Speaker 2>to the way we think and the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of those categories seem to be </v>

789
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.970
<v Speaker 2>gendered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is partly why make reference</v>

790
00:41:03.971 --> 00:41:05.410
<v Speaker 2>to Taoism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

791
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:08.380
<v Speaker 2>So for the Daoists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is made out of chaos and order</v>

792
00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.573
<v Speaker 2>and chaos is the domain that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand and that emerges </v>

793
00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:16.030
<v Speaker 2>unpredictably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the domain from which new forms</v>

794
00:41:16.031 --> 00:41:17.740
<v Speaker 2>emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

795
00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:20.560
<v Speaker 2>Because it's from novelty that the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>way emerges.</v>

796
00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:21.663
<v Speaker 2>And I think the fundamental association </v>
<v Speaker 2>between femininity is chaos is the </v>

797
00:41:25.331 --> 00:41:26.164
<v Speaker 2>association between what's unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 2>and novel and what's new because new </v>

798
00:41:30.881 --> 00:41:33.320
<v Speaker 2>forms emerge from chaos and it's not.</v>

799
00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:37.910
<v Speaker 2>The chaos is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is bad in order to good that that's both</v>

800
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:40.860
<v Speaker 2>have their pathologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

801
00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:41.940
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

802
00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.020
<v Speaker 2>and what you're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

803
00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 2>this is the book concentrates on above </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

804
00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:50.060
<v Speaker 2>is that you're looking constantly to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find the balance between those two.</v>

805
00:41:50.061 --> 00:41:52.910
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>formerly speaking,</v>

806
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.420
<v Speaker 2>the domain of order is that place that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

807
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:59.300
<v Speaker 2>when what you're doing is producing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>results that you want,</v>

808
00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:01.640
<v Speaker 2>who have produced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine,</v>

809
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:02.533
<v Speaker 2>imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about the preconditions for not </v>

810
00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:06.620
<v Speaker 2>being anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

811
00:42:06.621 --> 00:42:07.454
<v Speaker 2>So the preconditions are that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly making predictions about </v>

812
00:42:09.531 --> 00:42:10.364
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those predictions are tied tightly </v>

813
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.013
<v Speaker 2>to your behavioral output.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you act in a certain way and you </v>

814
00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:19.370
<v Speaker 2>presume that a certain thing is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

815
00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:23.780
<v Speaker 2>And if your actions produce the results </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you desire,</v>

816
00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:24.733
<v Speaker 2>then you assume that you know where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are and you know what you're doing and </v>

817
00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:29.690
<v Speaker 2>that your plan is intact and that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment is secure.</v>

818
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:31.760
<v Speaker 2>And that keeps her anxiety under </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

819
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 2>that order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>

820
00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:35.744
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're at a party and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know anybody and you tell a joke and </v>

821
00:42:38.211 --> 00:42:39.044
<v Speaker 2>everybody looks at you like what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>said was not only not funny but also </v>

822
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:43.784
<v Speaker 2>downright offensive and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden you've moved from the domain of </v>

823
00:42:47.121 --> 00:42:47.954
<v Speaker 2>order into the domain of chaos because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you thought you were somewhere and you </v>

824
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:51.674
<v Speaker 2>thought you were someone and you thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were with people that were of a </v>

825
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:55.784
<v Speaker 2>certain type and you got all that wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it causes suggesting it is going </v>

826
00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:02.660
<v Speaker 2>to be the woman who says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that really offended.</v>

827
00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:08.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not suggesting that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it probably is nevermind.</v>

828
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.390
<v Speaker 2>But women are also more sensitive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion.</v>

829
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:12.343
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is some slightly higher </v>

830
00:43:13.641 --> 00:43:14.474
<v Speaker 2>probability that that might be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I think women are also </v>

831
00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:18.194
<v Speaker 2>associated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in men's imaginations with </v>

832
00:43:19.971 --> 00:43:20.804
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is part of the chaotic domain say </v>

833
00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:26.570
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to culture because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually selective.</v>

834
00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:29.810
<v Speaker 2>So you gotta think what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is nature?</v>

835
00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.840
<v Speaker 2>When we have that as a cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>category,</v>

836
00:43:32.841 --> 00:43:34.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think of the natural world,</v>

837
00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:37.130
<v Speaker 2>we think of nature versus culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fundamental opposition.</v>

838
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:39.260
<v Speaker 2>What is nature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

839
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.450
<v Speaker 2>nature is trees and landscapes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and all of that up,</v>

840
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:45.290
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't what nature fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

841
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Nature fundamentally is that which </v>
<v Speaker 2>selects from a genetic perspective,</v>

842
00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.093
<v Speaker 2>that's nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fundamental definition of </v>

843
00:43:53.721 --> 00:43:54.554
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is the case that human females </v>

844
00:43:57.171 --> 00:43:58.004
<v Speaker 2>are sexually selective and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a major component of human </v>

845
00:44:01.191 --> 00:44:03.050
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the.</v>

846
00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:03.943
<v Speaker 2>The evolutionary theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking is that the reason we </v>

847
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:12.200
<v Speaker 2>diverged from chimpanzees 8 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

848
00:44:12.201 --> 00:44:13.034
<v Speaker 2>7 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is at least in part because of the </v>

849
00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:17.654
<v Speaker 2>differences between sexual selectively </v>
<v Speaker 2>between female humans and female </v>

850
00:44:22.161 --> 00:44:22.994
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Female chimpanzees are more likely to </v>

851
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:26.204
<v Speaker 2>have offspring from dominant males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because of their sexual </v>

852
00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:30.860
<v Speaker 2>selectivities.</v>

853
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:35.370
<v Speaker 2>So female chimpanzee has periods of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fertility that are marked by physical,</v>

854
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 2>by observable physiological changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the case with human females.</v>

855
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:41.483
<v Speaker 2>Human female ovulation is is concealed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a very profound biological </v>

856
00:44:46.381 --> 00:44:49.920
<v Speaker 2>difference between human females and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees and the chimpanzee.</v>

857
00:44:49.921 --> 00:44:50.754
<v Speaker 2>Females will meet with any male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the dominant males chased the </v>

858
00:44:53.341 --> 00:44:57.660
<v Speaker 2>subordinate males away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but human females are sexually selective</v>

859
00:44:57.690 --> 00:44:58.523
<v Speaker 2>and so and and it's not trivial facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have twice as many female </v>

860
00:45:02.461 --> 00:45:05.820
<v Speaker 2>ancestors as male ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

861
00:45:05.821 --> 00:45:06.810
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can that be?</v>

862
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that on average,</v>

863
00:45:08.881 --> 00:45:09.714
<v Speaker 2>every single human female has had one </v>
<v Speaker 2>child throughout the entire course of </v>

864
00:45:13.081 --> 00:45:13.914
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is approximately correct by the </v>

865
00:45:15.571 --> 00:45:16.404
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then imagine that half of the men had </v>

866
00:45:17.941 --> 00:45:22.040
<v Speaker 2>zero and the other half had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

867
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:26.760
<v Speaker 2>and that's roughly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So half of males historically speaking,</v>

868
00:45:26.761 --> 00:45:27.594
<v Speaker 2>have been reproductive disasters and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason for that is because of female </v>

869
00:45:30.481 --> 00:45:31.650
<v Speaker 2>sexual collectivity.</v>

870
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:35.610
<v Speaker 2>So it is actually the case that female </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans are nature.</v>

871
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:36.503
<v Speaker 2>It's not only that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're associated with nature </v>

872
00:45:38.861 --> 00:45:41.640
<v Speaker 2>symbolically as far as production is </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

873
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:46.440
<v Speaker 2>They are the force of nature that does </v>
<v Speaker 2>the selection and so their nature in the</v>

874
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:49.920
<v Speaker 2>most fundamental way and there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic element of that,</v>

875
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:53.220
<v Speaker 2>at least in relationship to men and also</v>
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to women.</v>

876
00:45:53.221 --> 00:45:58.221
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of the female on female </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition is competition.</v>

877
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.550
<v Speaker 2>That's chaotic for the right to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually selective,</v>

878
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:03.743
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only with regards to men which </v>

879
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:06.294
<v Speaker 2>drives a lot of politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also in relationship to each other </v>

880
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:09.594
<v Speaker 2>because part of what human females do </v>
<v Speaker 2>his jockey for position in the female </v>

881
00:46:12.961 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy for the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

882
00:46:16.351 --> 00:46:17.184
<v Speaker 2>which is the woman who gets to be most </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually selective and so that drives </v>

883
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:23.640
<v Speaker 2>female female competition and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different dynamic.</v>

884
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:24.683
<v Speaker 2>There's similarities between female </v>
<v Speaker 2>female competition and male male </v>

885
00:46:27.571 --> 00:46:28.404
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are also differences and </v>

886
00:46:29.701 --> 00:46:31.980
<v Speaker 2>they're pronounced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So men for example,</v>

887
00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 2>while men are more likely to compete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compete for socioeconomic status,</v>

888
00:46:36.691 --> 00:46:39.060
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly because that drives </v>
<v Speaker 2>female mate choice.</v>

889
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:40.343
<v Speaker 2>So the correlation for men between </v>
<v Speaker 2>socioeconomic status and sexual success </v>

890
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:48.090
<v Speaker 2>is about point six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for women it's zero zero.</v>

891
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:49.770
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually slightly negative.</v>

892
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:52.620
<v Speaker 2>So when that's a huge difference between</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women,</v>

893
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.530
<v Speaker 1>the anthropologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Hrdy,</v>

894
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:56.750
<v Speaker 1>h r,</v>
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>

895
00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.370
<v Speaker 1>y,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

896
00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:59.790
<v Speaker 1>and she's like my favorite feminist </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorist,</v>

897
00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.300
<v Speaker 1>although is she would say I'm a theorist</v>
<v Speaker 1>who happens to be a feminist,</v>

898
00:47:03.301 --> 00:47:08.130
<v Speaker 1>but she studied primate behavior and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched.</v>

899
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.440
<v Speaker 1>She lifted the women very the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>females.</v>

900
00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:11.274
<v Speaker 1>And we very carefully and looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chimpanzees and gazelles and found </v>

901
00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:18.280
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

902
00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:24.400
<v Speaker 1>the female initially like male </v>
<v Speaker 1>primatologists would look and say,</v>

903
00:47:25.261 --> 00:47:26.220
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the females,</v>

904
00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.100
<v Speaker 1>the males are dominant in the females </v>
<v Speaker 1>are so cooperative.</v>

905
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.070
<v Speaker 1>She looked more carefully and so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>females weren't exactly cooperative,</v>

906
00:47:33.071 --> 00:47:35.830
<v Speaker 1>like they would pass around their </v>
<v Speaker 1>infants,</v>

907
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:37.120
<v Speaker 1>their baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

908
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:42.150
<v Speaker 1>whatever they were and would find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the male primatologist who say,</v>

909
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.353
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

910
00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:47.900
<v Speaker 1>they're so kind and caring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She found out that when it was not your,</v>

911
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.730
<v Speaker 1>it was not hers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would take a little tufts of hair,</v>

912
00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:52.713
<v Speaker 1>it would come out or they do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the eyes and the baby would be </v>

913
00:47:55.331 --> 00:47:58.420
<v Speaker 1>injured and she saw all this violence.</v>

914
00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.760
<v Speaker 2>But it was true in the status </v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiation.</v>

915
00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:01.913
<v Speaker 2>So it's much more likely that it'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen when a higher status female is </v>

916
00:48:04.121 --> 00:48:05.590
<v Speaker 2>taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lower status infant.</v>

917
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said the great tragedy,</v>

918
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:10.980
<v Speaker 1>but it will not tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had the reality of our species.</v>

919
00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.673
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subtitle for the book is that the </v>

920
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.233
<v Speaker 1>woman who never evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't evolve for niceness and </v>

921
00:48:19.111 --> 00:48:19.944
<v Speaker 1>cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an immense competition and we </v>

922
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.200
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to her,</v>

923
00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:26.243
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's indelibly marked in our nature to </v>

924
00:48:29.671 --> 00:48:34.671
<v Speaker 1>compete for the dominant males and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt about that and so,</v>

925
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:37.760
<v Speaker 2>and that seems to cross culturally as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

926
00:48:37.761 --> 00:48:39.560
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't fly in a little bit in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>

927
00:48:39.561 --> 00:48:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Gilda tarian societies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead of being exaggerated,</v>

928
00:48:42.621 --> 00:48:44.090
<v Speaker 2>it does flattened to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

929
00:48:44.091 --> 00:48:44.924
<v Speaker 2>So you could imagine that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological component and the cultural </v>

930
00:48:47.631 --> 00:48:50.930
<v Speaker 2>component both in in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that case,</v>

931
00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:55.940
<v Speaker 2>if you modify the cultural component and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems to decrease the overall.</v>

932
00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:59.300
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me be more clear about this.</v>

933
00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Women are less prone to mate up across </v>
<v Speaker 2>an upstate is hierarchies in Scandinavia</v>

934
00:49:05.991 --> 00:49:07.940
<v Speaker 2>than they are in less egalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>

935
00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:10.820
<v Speaker 2>but there are still prone to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So worldwide.</v>

936
00:49:10.821 --> 00:49:12.290
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

937
00:49:12.291 --> 00:49:15.140
<v Speaker 2>young women find men who are about four </v>
<v Speaker 2>years older than them,</v>

938
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:19.810
<v Speaker 2>maximally attractive and they tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>mate across an upstairs hierarchies.</v>

939
00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.040
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the consequences of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

940
00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.640
<v Speaker 2>is that as women have entered the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workforce,</v>

941
00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:26.623
<v Speaker 2>they've actually driven in equality </v>
<v Speaker 2>because rich women will only marry rich </v>

942
00:49:31.431 --> 00:49:32.960
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men is riches,</v>

943
00:49:32.961 --> 00:49:33.794
<v Speaker 2>them or Richard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas rich man will marry women who </v>

944
00:49:35.871 --> 00:49:38.180
<v Speaker 2>are poor than them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but women won't,</v>

945
00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:39.313
<v Speaker 2>and so what that means is it's another </v>
<v Speaker 2>factor that's pooling wealth in the </v>

946
00:49:42.321 --> 00:49:43.670
<v Speaker 2>hands of fewer and fewer people</v>

947
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:45.263
<v Speaker 1>assortative mating now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just find someone with your </v>

948
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.113
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd whereas a doctor might have once </v>

949
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.470
<v Speaker 1>married his secretary now marries </v>
<v Speaker 1>another doctor.</v>

950
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:53.323
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

951
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask then stepping a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>back from primates as well,</v>

952
00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:01.860
<v Speaker 2>how does this selection work in the era </v>
<v Speaker 2>of swiping right and left?</v>

953
00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:04.163
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is your reaction to the way young </v>

954
00:50:07.051 --> 00:50:08.200
<v Speaker 2>people date today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

955
00:50:08.201 --> 00:50:10.530
<v Speaker 2>that's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really hoping we'd get into that.</v>

956
00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:13.980
<v Speaker 2>I was really into the monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't want to interrupt.</v>

957
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.823
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should close off the Scandinavian </v>

958
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:18.393
<v Speaker 2>discussion just by pointing out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that the </v>

959
00:50:20.161 --> 00:50:22.050
<v Speaker 2>scandinavians are already going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to wrestle with,</v>

960
00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:22.913
<v Speaker 2>is that if you institute effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies to promote equality </v>

961
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.200
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the Scandinavians have done,</v>

962
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.963
<v Speaker 2>you're going to produce some equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like a 50 slash 50 distribution of </v>

963
00:50:34.671 --> 00:50:35.504
<v Speaker 2>men and women in the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also going to exacerbate </v>

964
00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 2>certain kinds of inequality and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't get out of that.</v>

965
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:42.703
<v Speaker 2>So you cannot have equality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity and equality of outcome </v>

966
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:46.430
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

967
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:48.380
<v Speaker 2>They don't work together and equality of</v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome.</v>

968
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:49.453
<v Speaker 2>Essentially quality of outcome doctrine </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is often described with the code </v>

969
00:50:52.821 --> 00:50:53.654
<v Speaker 2>word equity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that at every level of every </v>

970
00:50:55.821 --> 00:50:59.840
<v Speaker 2>occupation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people have to be represented by the</v>

971
00:50:59.841 --> 00:51:02.600
<v Speaker 2>same number that they're represented in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the population.</v>

972
00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:07.510
<v Speaker 2>So if it's not 50 slash 50 men and women</v>
<v Speaker 2>at each in each occupation I need and in</v>

973
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:12.290
<v Speaker 2>each strata at each occupation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that sort of prime fsc evidence for</v>

974
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.080
<v Speaker 2>discrimination and for systemic </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination.</v>

975
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:16.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

976
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:17.203
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to factor in choice and choice </v>

977
00:51:18.831 --> 00:51:21.320
<v Speaker 2>actually turns out to be a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important determinant.</v>

978
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.810
<v Speaker 2>And as the society gets flatter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>flatter,</v>

979
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 2>choice becomes a more important and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more important determinant.</v>

980
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:28.303
<v Speaker 2>And so you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what that essentially means is that </v>

981
00:51:30.741 --> 00:51:31.574
<v Speaker 2>the most radical end of the left wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>political agenda is logically </v>

982
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.320
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apart from the fact that it's impossible</v>

983
00:51:39.321 --> 00:51:40.460
<v Speaker 2>for a variety of other reasons.</v>

984
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:42.540
<v Speaker 1>And they should look at the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

985
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:48.220
<v Speaker 1>it's just a cliche now have in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a group of activists and they'll say,</v>

986
00:51:49.331 --> 00:51:50.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we need to,</v>

987
00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:56.400
<v Speaker 1>in order for women to achieve equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need government funded daycare and we</v>

988
00:51:56.411 --> 00:51:58.330
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have it in Sweden.</v>

989
00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Sweden has fewer women in managerial </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

990
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:06.210
<v Speaker 1>The American women are ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact now they have a,</v>

991
00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:07.053
<v Speaker 1>they have quotas over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they need more female ceos and </v>

992
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:10.603
<v Speaker 1>females on boards made any difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between bringing in memory American </v>

993
00:52:13.091 --> 00:52:15.400
<v Speaker 1>women because we're so much further </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>

994
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:18.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's called the no difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution of men and women.</v>

995
00:52:18.611 --> 00:52:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Lower in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Nordic paradox and say,</v>

996
00:52:22.361 --> 00:52:24.040
<v Speaker 1>you guys are so wonky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get back.</v>

997
00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:25.023
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

998
00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.900
<v Speaker 1>We all want to get back to get back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these monkeys.</v>

999
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking just</v>

1000
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.473
<v Speaker 2>thinking this morning about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to a variety of political </v>

1001
00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:38.250
<v Speaker 2>types and we were talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning in DC.</v>

1002
00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.820
<v Speaker 2>It hard to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to believe.</v>

1003
00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:40.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

1004
00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:43.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling you a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans here and I'd been talking to</v>

1005
00:52:43.691 --> 00:52:44.524
<v Speaker 2>Democrats as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was mostly Republicans here and </v>

1006
00:52:46.781 --> 00:52:47.614
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about abortion and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>made a case that that's really not a </v>

1007
00:52:53.411 --> 00:52:54.244
<v Speaker 2>very productive discussion because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about a problem way too </v>

1008
00:52:59.321 --> 00:53:00.154
<v Speaker 2>late in the sequence of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the time the discussion starts to </v>

1009
00:53:05.621 --> 00:53:06.454
<v Speaker 2>be about abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 50 problems that have already </v>

1010
00:53:08.531 --> 00:53:11.830
<v Speaker 2>emerged that no one has addressed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of those problems are.</v>

1011
00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.693
<v Speaker 2>The fundamental problem is how human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being should regulate their sexual </v>

1012
00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.800
<v Speaker 2>behavior and that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

1013
00:53:17.801 --> 00:53:22.300
<v Speaker 2>well there's an interesting thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening because you know the people on</v>

1014
00:53:22.301 --> 00:53:24.370
<v Speaker 2>the right would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's easy.</v>

1015
00:53:24.371 --> 00:53:25.204
<v Speaker 2>It's like don't sleep around and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>married and have sex with your marital </v>

1016
00:53:28.651 --> 00:53:32.670
<v Speaker 2>partner and that'll solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's strictures on sexual behavior</v>

1017
00:53:32.671 --> 00:53:33.504
<v Speaker 2>and those would be the traditional ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what you see on the left is that </v>

1018
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:41.040
<v Speaker 2>there's this weird paradoxical demand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say</v>

1019
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.823
<v Speaker 2>that people should be allowed to express</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sexuality in any manner that they </v>

1020
00:53:46.921 --> 00:53:48.630
<v Speaker 2>choose whenever they want,</v>

1021
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:51.593
<v Speaker 2>but that sex is so dangerous that it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be carefully regulated at every </v>

1022
00:53:55.891 --> 00:53:56.724
<v Speaker 2>single stage of the interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know that many state </v>

1023
00:54:00.361 --> 00:54:01.194
<v Speaker 2>legislatures have now followed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>example of university campuses and put </v>

1024
00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:06.123
<v Speaker 2>in affirmative consent legislation so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that every move you make towards </v>

1025
00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:15.170
<v Speaker 2>physical intimacy has to be preceded by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the instantiation of a verbal contract.</v>

1026
00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1027
00:54:17.071 --> 00:54:18.510
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I take your hand?</v>

1028
00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You actually,</v>

1029
00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.670
<v Speaker 2>from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually have to say yes,</v>

1030
00:54:23.671 --> 00:54:28.671
<v Speaker 2>like nodding is not sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so and so each stage has to be,</v>

1031
00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:32.400
<v Speaker 2>has to be proceeded by affirmative </v>
<v Speaker 2>consent and</v>

1032
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:34.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

1033
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:35.783
<v Speaker 1>which.</v>

1034
00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't,</v>

1035
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I won't say anything about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1036
00:54:38.301 --> 00:54:39.440
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's desert.</v>

1037
00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:40.453
<v Speaker 2>It's absurd to assume that that's how </v>
<v Speaker 2>human intimate relationships are </v>

1038
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:45.523
<v Speaker 2>supposed to proceed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have complicated laws </v>

1039
00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:52.340
<v Speaker 2>emerging that are part of that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1040
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:54.770
<v Speaker 2>this is the case in California as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it,</v>

1041
00:54:54.771 --> 00:54:58.100
<v Speaker 2>is that you cannot give affirmative </v>
<v Speaker 2>consent if you're intoxicated.</v>

1042
00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think about that.</v>

1043
00:55:00.221 --> 00:55:01.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1044
00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:02.383
<v Speaker 2>It means that like a lot of sex is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This unit has been illegal for a long </v>

1045
00:55:08.061 --> 00:55:09.620
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Including marital.</v>

1046
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Marital?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1047
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Next to me on my honeymoon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1048
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Well that is Marie thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems.</v>

1049
00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.650
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to mean.</v>

1050
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

1051
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:25.070
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me the California legislation that if</v>

1052
00:55:25.071 --> 00:55:30.071
<v Speaker 2>you have sex with your wife or husband </v>
<v Speaker 2>and either of you is intoxicated,</v>

1053
00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:34.370
<v Speaker 2>then you're either one of you or both is</v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty of rape.</v>

1054
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.740
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

1055
00:55:36.741 --> 00:55:39.680
<v Speaker 2>I was in a debate a few years ago at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Virginia Law School</v>

1056
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:44.090
<v Speaker 1>and I turned to my debate partner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1057
00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.730
<v Speaker 1>so if what you're saying is right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1058
00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.260
<v Speaker 1>two people can rate one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1059
00:55:51.261 --> 00:55:53.620
<v Speaker 1>She said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

1060
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

1061
00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can that be?</v>

1062
00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the question.</v>

1063
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1064
00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:01.693
<v Speaker 2>so then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's interesting because I think </v>

1065
00:56:04.371 --> 00:56:05.204
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of this confusion has emerged</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally as a consequence of the </v>

1066
00:56:08.241 --> 00:56:10.360
<v Speaker 2>birth control pill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

1067
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:11.203
<v Speaker 2>because you gotta think situationally </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you think ideologically or </v>

1068
00:56:13.431 --> 00:56:14.600
<v Speaker 2>psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1069
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:16.843
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that the 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be remembered for the hydrogen </v>

1070
00:56:19.851 --> 00:56:23.800
<v Speaker 2>bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the transistor and the birth control and</v>

1071
00:56:23.801 --> 00:56:24.634
<v Speaker 2>those are unbelievably radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological innovations and maybe the </v>

1072
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:29.540
<v Speaker 2>most common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1073
00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:34.550
<v Speaker 2>but on my fair lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just dependent on the transistor</v>

1074
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:37.143
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the big technological innovation </v>

1075
00:56:38.801 --> 00:56:39.634
<v Speaker 2>that spawned all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of the three I would say that the </v>

1076
00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.830
<v Speaker 2>birth control pill is probably the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger hydrogen bomb.</v>

1077
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.413
<v Speaker 2>So because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changed the fundamental biological </v>

1078
00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:50.284
<v Speaker 2>nature of women and men and because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave women for the first time in </v>

1079
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:57.063
<v Speaker 2>biological history the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the option of choosing their </v>

1080
00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.980
<v Speaker 2>reproductive status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1081
00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.450
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's abs.</v>

1082
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes and no.</v>

1083
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.713
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1084
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:08.583
<v Speaker 2>we like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not something that's come </v>

1085
00:57:10.151 --> 00:57:11.740
<v Speaker 2>without a tremendous.</v>

1086
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:16.750
<v Speaker 2>Well it's come with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fellow.</v>

1087
00:57:16.751 --> 00:57:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you been reading align with?</v>

1088
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:19.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no I haven't.</v>

1089
00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:20.570
<v Speaker 2>You'll find them interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

1090
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:21.463
<v Speaker 2>He writes about that I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making a case for the abolition </v>

1091
00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:26.890
<v Speaker 2>of the birth control pill by any stretch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the imagination,</v>

1092
00:57:26.891 --> 00:57:30.910
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pointing at its complexity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so because one of the questions is,</v>

1093
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:32.373
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you can regulate your reproductive </v>

1094
00:57:33.341 --> 00:57:34.174
<v Speaker 2>function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what attitude should you have toward </v>

1095
00:57:36.581 --> 00:57:37.414
<v Speaker 2>sex?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one answer might be the more of it </v>

1096
00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:44.920
<v Speaker 2>under the more varied circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better because why not?</v>

1097
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:46.203
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that was actually part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the attitude that emerged in the </v>

1098
00:57:49.481 --> 00:57:52.090
<v Speaker 2>aftermath of the birth control pill in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 19 sixties.</v>

1099
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.080
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

1100
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:54.423
<v Speaker 2>it was a reasonable response in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense because it's such a cataclysmic </v>

1101
00:57:57.761 --> 00:57:59.680
<v Speaker 2>change that you don't know what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>implies.</v>

1102
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the consequence of that?</v>

1103
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1104
00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:05.253
<v Speaker 2>people aren't reliable enough to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth control in an entirely reliable </v>

1105
00:58:08.771 --> 00:58:09.604
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though it can work at near 100 </v>

1106
00:58:12.071 --> 00:58:12.904
<v Speaker 2>percent efficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to take it extraordinarily </v>

1107
00:58:14.501 --> 00:58:17.050
<v Speaker 2>regularly and in a discipline manner for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to work.</v>

1108
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.153
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was still the problem of unwanted </v>

1109
00:58:21.491 --> 00:58:22.630
<v Speaker 2>pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

1110
00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:23.793
<v Speaker 2>And then there was the problem of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proliferation of sexual epidemics and </v>

1111
00:58:27.941 --> 00:58:28.774
<v Speaker 2>that culminated in aids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which could have easily wiped all of us </v>

1112
00:58:31.601 --> 00:58:32.434
<v Speaker 2>out but didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was other sexual epidemics </v>

1113
00:58:34.181 --> 00:58:35.660
<v Speaker 2>that could have had the same effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we've,</v>

1114
00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.990
<v Speaker 2>we've been fortunate enough to escape </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1115
00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:43.060
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then more recently there's been this</v>

1116
00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.380
<v Speaker 2>weird inversion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially on the radical left</v>

1117
00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:53.180
<v Speaker 2>that points to the reemergence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like a set of sexual taboos,</v>

1118
00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:57.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think the idea that sex is casual</v>

1119
00:58:57.381 --> 00:58:58.214
<v Speaker 2>and that it's a form of entertainment is</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an absolutely preposterous </v>

1120
00:59:02.661 --> 00:59:04.100
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that</v>

1121
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:06.543
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's psychologically shallow beyond </v>

1122
00:59:08.441 --> 00:59:13.441
<v Speaker 2>belief to hold that as a core </v>
<v Speaker 2>proposition because it forces you to,</v>

1123
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:16.203
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1124
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:17.083
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's repetitive sex with multiple </v>

1125
00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:19.354
<v Speaker 2>partners at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it forces you to treat people as if </v>

1126
00:59:22.041 --> 00:59:22.874
<v Speaker 2>they're interchangeable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't see how that's good for you </v>

1127
00:59:25.851 --> 00:59:29.000
<v Speaker 2>psychologically or for the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using interchangeably.</v>

1128
00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:31.043
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it implies that you can divorce </v>

1129
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:39.041
<v Speaker 2>sexuality from play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the desire for a relationship,</v>

1130
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:42.230
<v Speaker 2>from emotional fragility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from love,</v>

1131
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:45.350
<v Speaker 2>from family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from responsibility,</v>

1132
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:46.243
<v Speaker 2>all of those things that are part and </v>
<v Speaker 2>parcel of every one and I don't think </v>

1133
00:59:48.471 --> 00:59:49.304
<v Speaker 2>you can and I don't think people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience indicates that you can and </v>

1134
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:58.220
<v Speaker 2>especially on the emotional front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's partly what's driving</v>

1135
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:59.323
<v Speaker 2>and there's also a residual sense that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about sex that's </v>

1136
01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:06.200
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally dangerous and maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous emotionally and personally and</v>

1137
01:00:06.201 --> 01:00:08.720
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's dangerous socially and </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically,</v>

1138
01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:11.480
<v Speaker 2>which most certainly is because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful force.</v>

1139
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.840
<v Speaker 2>And the way the left is reacting to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is by insisting that all forms of sexual</v>

1140
01:00:16.971 --> 01:00:19.630
<v Speaker 2>behavior are valid and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1141
01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.010
<v Speaker 2>and that it's reasonable to manifest all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them,</v>

1142
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:23.203
<v Speaker 2>but that it's simultaneously so </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous that absolutely every aspect </v>

1143
01:00:25.881 --> 01:00:30.020
<v Speaker 2>of it has to be state regulated and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>an increasingly draconian form.</v>

1144
01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.213
<v Speaker 2>And so I think what needs to happen is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the left and the right have to get </v>

1145
01:00:34.611 --> 01:00:35.444
<v Speaker 2>together and have like a real discussion</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what constitutes valid sexual </v>

1146
01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:39.674
<v Speaker 2>morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the conversation you have to </v>

1147
01:00:41.511 --> 01:00:42.344
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way before you worry about solving like </v>

1148
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:47.660
<v Speaker 2>the abortion debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very divisive and very and very</v>

1149
01:00:47.661 --> 01:00:48.290
<v Speaker 2>intractable.</v>

1150
01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:49.123
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we talked about </v>

1151
01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:50.893
<v Speaker 3>actually just last week on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>is this cover story in the Atlantic </v>

1152
01:00:53.481 --> 01:00:54.314
<v Speaker 3>about the sexual recession amongst young</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that despite the advent of the </v>

1153
01:00:58.491 --> 01:01:01.250
<v Speaker 3>birth control pill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abortion is going down.</v>

1154
01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1155
01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:03.920
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a,</v>

1156
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:06.720
<v Speaker 3>there's lexus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's less thing is going down,</v>

1157
01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:07.983
<v Speaker 3>fewer things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what have you looked into that you </v>

1158
01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:11.423
<v Speaker 3>worry about that?</v>

1159
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you raise the cost of something,</v>

1160
01:01:13.991 --> 01:01:15.990
<v Speaker 2>you decrease its prevalence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1161
01:01:15.991 --> 01:01:17.340
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that it's,</v>

1162
01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:19.590
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1163
01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:20.623
<v Speaker 2>your wrists now to look up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda think that it's also a </v>

1164
01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:25.264
<v Speaker 2>reflection of the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bloomberg reported on just a few days </v>

1165
01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.310
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said that across businesses,</v>

1166
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:31.503
<v Speaker 2>men are thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not spending any time with a single </v>

1167
01:01:33.581 --> 01:01:34.920
<v Speaker 2>woman that isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1168
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:37.180
<v Speaker 2>associated with me in some formal </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>

1169
01:01:37.181 --> 01:01:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Like my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do it.</v>

1170
01:01:38.831 --> 01:01:41.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to mentor young women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be in a room alone</v>

1171
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.313
<v Speaker 3>because I could face career annihilation</v>
<v Speaker 3>and instantly they're frightened of </v>

1172
01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:46.604
<v Speaker 3>young women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1173
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Kate Julian said that's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can overexaggerate the part.</v>

1174
01:01:50.091 --> 01:01:50.924
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety and depression is going up </v>

1175
01:01:52.131 --> 01:01:57.050
<v Speaker 3>amongst both young men and young women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A suicide is going up,</v>

1176
01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.221
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1177
01:01:58.221 --> 01:01:58.970
<v Speaker 3>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1178
01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:02.180
<v Speaker 3>it's not just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1179
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:06.500
<v Speaker 3>most people I think are not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about an elite demographic</v>

1180
01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:07.334
<v Speaker 3>who is into the consent and political </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctness and workplace [inaudible] </v>

1181
01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:12.920
<v Speaker 3>this is across the board and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>global.</v>

1182
01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:14.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1183
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:14.833
<v Speaker 3>it's happening even in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really happening in Japan and </v>

1184
01:02:18.171 --> 01:02:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1185
01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.353
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1186
01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.220
<v Speaker 4>that speaks to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and especially in Japan,</v>

1187
01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:24.054
<v Speaker 4>they just have people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially young men have given up on </v>

1188
01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:30.390
<v Speaker 4>intimacy and that having sex is </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

1189
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that had too much trouble.</v>

1190
01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 4>Sex robots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1191
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:34.500
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1192
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.041
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1193
01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:35.930
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my last question.</v>

1194
01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:37.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's pornography.</v>

1195
01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:42.260
<v Speaker 4>There's basically zero risk when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>allow for pornography that,</v>

1196
01:02:42.261 --> 01:02:43.094
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the men and women will sort of </v>

1197
01:02:44.851 --> 01:02:46.220
<v Speaker 4>separate that from their actual.</v>

1198
01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we were seeing a whole,</v>

1199
01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:51.310
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>collapse of intimacy,</v>

1200
01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.620
<v Speaker 3>let alone sex and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1201
01:02:53.621 --> 01:02:54.191
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1202
01:02:54.191 --> 01:02:57.640
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think that's just explained </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the political nature.</v>

1203
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'd be interested in your thoughts.</v>

1204
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:02.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1205
01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:03.194
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature on the decline in sexual </v>

1206
01:03:06.021 --> 01:03:08.690
<v Speaker 2>activity well enough to know if it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>valid or reliable,</v>

1207
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:11.600
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

1208
01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a stable society you take lots of </v>

1209
01:03:14.241 --> 01:03:15.710
<v Speaker 2>things for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take,</v>

1210
01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.633
<v Speaker 2>you take the fact that men and women are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be sexually attracted to one </v>

1211
01:03:19.401 --> 01:03:23.360
<v Speaker 2>another for granted and even though it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>more fragile than it appears,</v>

1212
01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:26.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's suppressed more easily than you</v>

1213
01:03:26.301 --> 01:03:27.720
<v Speaker 2>might think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1214
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.083
<v Speaker 2>and you take the idea that men and women</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to move together towards the </v>

1215
01:03:32.541 --> 01:03:35.480
<v Speaker 2>establishment of longterm intimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships for granted.</v>

1216
01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:36.733
<v Speaker 2>But that's partly because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what invisible preconditions </v>

1217
01:03:39.981 --> 01:03:44.390
<v Speaker 2>exists to make that self evident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1218
01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:45.643
<v Speaker 2>And when those invisible preconditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>are disrupted by rapid technological or </v>

1219
01:03:49.461 --> 01:03:50.294
<v Speaker 2>sociological change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then things shift underneath you when </v>

1220
01:03:52.071 --> 01:03:52.970
<v Speaker 2>you don't know why.</v>

1221
01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:56.670
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is traced to the advent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the smartphone,</v>

1222
01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.350
<v Speaker 3>especially in the generation z that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kate was explaining this to us that</v>

1223
01:04:01.351 --> 01:04:02.184
<v Speaker 3>you could see it was broadband internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the smartphone that led to this </v>

1224
01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:10.740
<v Speaker 3>increasing fall off of relationship.</v>

1225
01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:11.903
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the abstract is more interesting </v>

1226
01:04:13.011 --> 01:04:13.850
<v Speaker 2>than right proximal.</v>

1227
01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:16.170
<v Speaker 4>See that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to.</v>

1228
01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:17.143
<v Speaker 4>I want to know the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever been with somebody you </v>

1229
01:04:18.891 --> 01:04:20.390
<v Speaker 4>loved?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I'm fascinated in all that,</v>

1230
01:04:20.391 --> 01:04:22.700
<v Speaker 4>but you really wanted to get back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>your smartphone.</v>

1231
01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:23.563
<v Speaker 4>Has that ever happened?</v>

1232
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1233
01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.470
<v Speaker 2>it happens all the time.</v>

1234
01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.540
<v Speaker 4>Happens to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Happens during our podcast.</v>

1235
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:34.230
<v Speaker 4>Tell you to put your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1236
01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:37.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm researching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very addictive,</v>

1237
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:39.110
<v Speaker 4>very addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1238
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:44.360
<v Speaker 4>I read the other day that</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they are kind of going together.</v>

1239
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.193
<v Speaker 4>The preferred method</v>

1240
01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.073
<v Speaker 2>method of interpersonal communication </v>
<v Speaker 2>between young people now is testing </v>

1241
01:04:49.871 --> 01:04:51.520
<v Speaker 2>rather than face to face communication.</v>

1242
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the swiping that apes.</v>

1243
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:54.543
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1244
01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:56.860
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very interesting topic to the,</v>

1245
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:59.510
<v Speaker 2>the like the tinder phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1246
01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.513
<v Speaker 2>Because that that's also a major </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological revolution because what </v>

1247
01:05:04.061 --> 01:05:08.890
<v Speaker 2>it's done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say for the first time is reduce</v>

1248
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:10.023
<v Speaker 2>the cost of rejection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two males to zero because it hides it </v>

1249
01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 2>you the only people you ever hear from </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who haven't rejected</v>

1250
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:18.821
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although,</v>

1251
01:05:18.821 --> 01:05:20.020
<v Speaker 4>although they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>

1252
01:05:20.021 --> 01:05:20.854
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was one man who had to make </v>

1253
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.060
<v Speaker 4>300.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He key actually tallied it.</v>

1254
01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:29.080
<v Speaker 4>You had to make 300 requests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a swiping right or whatever.</v>

1255
01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:32.080
<v Speaker 4>So I think he had the sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>

1256
01:05:32.081 --> 01:05:32.711
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1257
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:37.150
<v Speaker 4>But it's massively attenuated because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not being humiliated.</v>

1258
01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:38.380
<v Speaker 4>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not at all.</v>

1259
01:05:38.381 --> 01:05:39.214
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really at arm's length and you </v>

1260
01:05:40.731 --> 01:05:41.680
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can swipe very,</v>

1261
01:05:41.681 --> 01:05:42.514
<v Speaker 4>very rapidly and so you can get all that</v>
<v Speaker 4>rejection over within a very short </v>

1262
01:05:45.101 --> 01:05:45.934
<v Speaker 4>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like losing a video gamers or will </v>

1263
01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:50.040
<v Speaker 4>last because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1264
01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:51.100
<v Speaker 4>not nearly as bad.</v>

1265
01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:52.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1266
01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:57.260
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know what tinder also </v>
<v Speaker 2>reduces the.</v>

1267
01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:58.633
<v Speaker 2>One of the other things that things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to think about with regards to </v>

1268
01:06:00.621 --> 01:06:01.454
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is probably </v>

1269
01:06:02.121 --> 01:06:02.954
<v Speaker 2>particularly true for women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that to what degree is it in women's </v>

1270
01:06:05.811 --> 01:06:09.380
<v Speaker 2>interests to allow the cost of sex to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall to zero,</v>

1271
01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.360
<v Speaker 2>because with pornography certainly does </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and it just seems to me that that's</v>

1272
01:06:14.361 --> 01:06:15.194
<v Speaker 2>not a very good longterm strategy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships between men and women </v>

1273
01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:19.093
<v Speaker 2>because whatever sex is worth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cost of zero is the wrong price and </v>

1274
01:06:23.031 --> 01:06:24.380
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1275
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.473
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You heard it from Bunny ranch and pay </v>

1276
01:06:26.091 --> 01:06:27.650
<v Speaker 4>quite a bit for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well true,</v>

1277
01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:29.300
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

1278
01:06:29.301 --> 01:06:30.134
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

1279
01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:31.403
<v Speaker 2>do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard from a number of women what </v>

1280
01:06:34.201 --> 01:06:35.034
<v Speaker 2>written read blog reports on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustration with their attempts to be </v>

1281
01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:40.913
<v Speaker 2>relatively sexually selective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like let's say they decide that they're </v>

1282
01:06:43.801 --> 01:06:48.270
<v Speaker 2>not going to sleep with their new </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner on the first date.</v>

1283
01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:49.733
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're frustrated by the fact that to </v>

1284
01:06:51.961 --> 01:06:55.860
<v Speaker 2>the degree that they're being cautious </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their sexual behavior,</v>

1285
01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:56.903
<v Speaker 2>which I think is actually an admirable </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that they're instantly out </v>

1286
01:07:00.961 --> 01:07:01.794
<v Speaker 2>competed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if their partners are </v>

1287
01:07:03.391 --> 01:07:08.310
<v Speaker 2>somewhat impulsive by women who will say</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes at the drop of a hat and so,</v>

1288
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:09.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1289
01:07:09.841 --> 01:07:12.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what the goal is.</v>

1290
01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:15.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing is that there's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>short terms there,</v>

1291
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:16.833
<v Speaker 2>short term sexual gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the literature indicates that </v>

1292
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.770
<v Speaker 2>married couples for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or couples in a permanent long term,</v>

1293
01:07:22.771 --> 01:07:23.604
<v Speaker 2>monogamous relationship are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually satisfied than single people </v>

1294
01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:27.263
<v Speaker 2>and maybe the single people have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>parsed out into those who are sexually </v>

1295
01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:31.163
<v Speaker 2>successful and those who aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I suspect that wouldn't make that </v>

1296
01:07:34.621 --> 01:07:36.270
<v Speaker 2>much difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>

1297
01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:37.923
<v Speaker 2>There's the utility of relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate sexual gratification for </v>

1298
01:07:41.431 --> 01:07:42.264
<v Speaker 2>whatever that's worth and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventurousness that goes along with </v>

1299
01:07:44.011 --> 01:07:47.010
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the hunt and the excitement of</v>

1300
01:07:47.011 --> 01:07:47.844
<v Speaker 2>having a new partner and all of that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even the danger that's associated </v>

1301
01:07:50.611 --> 01:07:53.700
<v Speaker 2>with that because people like to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of danger in their life.</v>

1302
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:57.240
<v Speaker 2>But what's the goal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what do people want?</v>

1303
01:07:57.241 --> 01:07:58.074
<v Speaker 2>And I mean there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a great book called a billion </v>

1304
01:08:00.001 --> 01:08:00.834
<v Speaker 2>wicked thoughts that was written by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Google engineers and so it contains </v>

1305
01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:04.374
<v Speaker 2>great psychology because Google </v>
<v Speaker 2>engineers don't care about political </v>

1306
01:08:06.781 --> 01:08:08.890
<v Speaker 2>correctness and they just write down </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they find.</v>

1307
01:08:08.970 --> 01:08:11.250
<v Speaker 2>They don't even notice that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically incorrect.</v>

1308
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:12.263
<v Speaker 2>Hence James Demore for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what they found was that women use </v>

1309
01:08:16.731 --> 01:08:17.564
<v Speaker 2>pornography just as much as men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the pornography that women use is </v>

1310
01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:23.090
<v Speaker 2>verbal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not in logistic.</v>

1311
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:28.540
<v Speaker 2>And the pornographic novels essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow the same extraordinarily standard</v>

1312
01:08:29.241 --> 01:08:33.020
<v Speaker 2>plot line to the degree that publishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>houses like Harlequin,</v>

1313
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:35.840
<v Speaker 2>which was going to say it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the bodice rippers the veteran.</v>

1314
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:38.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the Harlequin series,</v>

1315
01:08:38.211 --> 01:08:41.600
<v Speaker 2>you have the ones that were published </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the 19 seventies that are pretty</v>

1316
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:43.740
<v Speaker 2>tame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a small bit,</v>

1317
01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.040
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty hot actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1318
01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.930
<v Speaker 2>there's a variety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They range from.</v>

1319
01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:51.560
<v Speaker 2>They range from red team to essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hardcore pornography,</v>

1320
01:08:51.561 --> 01:08:52.394
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the plots are quite similar in the </v>

1321
01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:56.010
<v Speaker 2>plot is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1322
01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:56.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>

1323
01:08:56.781 --> 01:08:59.870
<v Speaker 2>relatively innocent woman finds </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>

1324
01:08:59.871 --> 01:09:00.704
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous male tames him and then they </v>

1325
01:09:03.741 --> 01:09:06.980
<v Speaker 2>live happily ever after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the beauty and the beast plot,</v>

1326
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:09.990
<v Speaker 2>which is a fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to search for women on pornhub.</v>

1327
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:13.730
<v Speaker 2>We discovered we did an episode on porn </v>
<v Speaker 2>was for women.</v>

1328
01:09:13.731 --> 01:09:14.370
<v Speaker 2>It was getting</v>

1329
01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:15.203
<v Speaker 3>rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't that like there's no lesbianism </v>

1330
01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:18.980
<v Speaker 3>or at least that was your port.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1331
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:20.510
<v Speaker 3>that was me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1332
01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.353
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like porn is going to the </v>

1333
01:09:23.401 --> 01:09:26.610
<v Speaker 3>William Sonoma store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it is.</v>

1334
01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:28.210
<v Speaker 3>It is female.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those</v>

1335
01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:32.940
<v Speaker 3>losses</v>
<v Speaker 3>or Bill Maher,</v>

1336
01:09:32.941 --> 01:09:37.800
<v Speaker 3>one said that men and women should never</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell one another their fantasies because</v>

1337
01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:42.660
<v Speaker 3>when are outraged by what we say and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're totally bored by what they say.</v>

1338
01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:46.740
<v Speaker 3>And I thought like women have kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these scenarios and you know,</v>

1339
01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Unicorns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they're doing.</v>

1340
01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:50.160
<v Speaker 3>Storylines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>storylines,</v>

1341
01:09:50.161 --> 01:09:53.850
<v Speaker 3>and it's just like A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say this to you,</v>

1342
01:09:53.851 --> 01:09:57.660
<v Speaker 3>but it is a lot of just close ups of </v>
<v Speaker 3>female body parts.</v>

1343
01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well men are much more visually oriented</v>

1344
01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.920
<v Speaker 3>sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now they're being shamed.</v>

1345
01:10:01.921 --> 01:10:04.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean now that it's called the male </v>
<v Speaker 3>gaze,</v>

1346
01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:05.780
<v Speaker 3>and so there's all of this sick.</v>

1347
01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:09.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sports illustrated is exploiting the</v>

1348
01:10:09.601 --> 01:10:11.060
<v Speaker 3>female figure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1349
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:16.070
<v Speaker 3>been men like it and I'm worried that </v>
<v Speaker 3>now sort of the way in the past,</v>

1350
01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual sub,</v>

1351
01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gays were shamed.</v>

1352
01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:24.120
<v Speaker 3>We're now reversing it in shaming like </v>
<v Speaker 3>heterosexual.</v>

1353
01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:25.013
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's definitely,</v>

1354
01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:25.913
<v Speaker 3>that's definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember we had the young woman who </v>

1355
01:10:26.941 --> 01:10:28.680
<v Speaker 3>complained about being whistled at and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1356
01:10:28.681 --> 01:10:29.670
<v Speaker 3>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it stops.</v>

1357
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:30.643
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we have a little bit of time for a </v>

1358
01:10:33.151 --> 01:10:33.984
<v Speaker 3>couple more topics with you because one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things that are just coming out </v>

1359
01:10:37.831 --> 01:10:40.170
<v Speaker 3>of this younger generation and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a chapter of in your</v>

1360
01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:41.003
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I wanted to finish what the line </v>

1361
01:10:42.631 --> 01:10:46.110
<v Speaker 2>that we were pursuing to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well with sexual behavior.</v>

1362
01:10:46.111 --> 01:10:49.650
<v Speaker 2>The question is what's the end game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this is what people have to ask</v>

1363
01:10:49.651 --> 01:10:50.484
<v Speaker 2>themselves is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the corollaries to the female </v>

1364
01:10:54.001 --> 01:10:54.834
<v Speaker 2>pornographic romance is actually the </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment of a longterm </v>

1365
01:10:57.690 --> 01:10:59.730
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question is,</v>

1366
01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:01.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny because I got pilloried in</v>

1367
01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:03.170
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1368
01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:04.503
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for talking about enforced monogamy was </v>

1369
01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.793
<v Speaker 2>quite interesting because that gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought up like in every scene was so </v>

1370
01:11:12.181 --> 01:11:14.820
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I to that woman for two days.</v>

1371
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.863
<v Speaker 2>I know it is just like a little side </v>
<v Speaker 2>comment and then that became like the </v>

1372
01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:21.210
<v Speaker 2>center showcase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like like enforced monogamy,</v>

1373
01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:22.880
<v Speaker 2>you mean forced marriage or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1374
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:23.723
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was an anthropological term </v>
<v Speaker 2>which she knew perfectly well because </v>

1375
01:11:26.851 --> 01:11:27.684
<v Speaker 2>she's a very smart person and all it </v>
<v Speaker 2>means is that there's a pronounced </v>

1376
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.943
<v Speaker 2>proclivity in human societies around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world to enforce monogamous </v>

1377
01:11:35.971 --> 01:11:39.420
<v Speaker 2>relationships at multiple levels of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociological hierarchy.</v>

1378
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.240
<v Speaker 2>You do it culturally do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do have an expectation.</v>

1379
01:11:42.241 --> 01:11:43.074
<v Speaker 2>You do it legally enforced monogamy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my son was just married and if he </v>

1380
01:11:47.731 --> 01:11:49.250
<v Speaker 2>came to me next year and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1381
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Hey dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

1382
01:11:50.311 --> 01:11:51.144
<v Speaker 2>I've managed to have four affairs in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last year with hot women and my wife </v>

1383
01:11:54.031 --> 01:11:54.864
<v Speaker 2>hasn't found out about any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to pat them on the back </v>

1384
01:11:57.601 --> 01:11:58.650
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good job,</v>

1385
01:11:58.730 --> 01:11:59.940
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1386
01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:01.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is up with you?</v>

1387
01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:02.334
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you violated the vow that you took your </v>

1388
01:12:03.781 --> 01:12:04.614
<v Speaker 2>putting your whole future risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're betraying yourself and your wife </v>

1389
01:12:06.751 --> 01:12:08.790
<v Speaker 2>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's enforced monogamy.</v>

1390
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:09.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1391
01:12:09.210 --> 01:12:10.043
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that the social norm is the </v>

1392
01:12:12.121 --> 01:12:12.954
<v Speaker 2>establishment of a long term monogamous </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship and that there are </v>

1393
01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.480
<v Speaker 2>structures put in place to support that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also to punish deviation from it and</v>

1394
01:12:21.271 --> 01:12:21.871
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1395
01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:22.704
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

1396
01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.640
<v Speaker 2>maybe not so much on the punishment in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can,</v>

1397
01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:26.220
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>

1398
01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:27.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like what do you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1399
01:12:27.481 --> 01:12:28.314
<v Speaker 2>what is it that you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want a longterm stable relationship </v>

1400
01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.940
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if that's the goal,</v>

1401
01:12:32.941 --> 01:12:33.774
<v Speaker 2>then your behavior should be devoted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that facilitates that </v>

1402
01:12:36.751 --> 01:12:38.640
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't see that.</v>

1403
01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't see that casual and </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive sex fits that bill now,</v>

1404
01:12:43.131 --> 01:12:43.964
<v Speaker 2>not in the least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of the evidence with regards to </v>

1405
01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:47.513
<v Speaker 2>living together shows that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually detrimental to the </v>

1406
01:12:50.161 --> 01:12:52.050
<v Speaker 2>establishment of a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

1407
01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:54.780
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>common law marriage,</v>

1408
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.170
<v Speaker 2>people who are in a common law marriage </v>
<v Speaker 2>are much more likely to be be divorced.</v>

1409
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:59.323
<v Speaker 2>So that's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second thing is people who live </v>

1410
01:13:01.621 --> 01:13:02.454
<v Speaker 2>together before they get married are </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more likely to be divorced after </v>

1411
01:13:04.951 --> 01:13:05.784
<v Speaker 2>they get married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that while you can try </v>

1412
01:13:07.741 --> 01:13:08.574
<v Speaker 2>someone on for size and see how it works</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you're going to see if you're </v>

1413
01:13:10.981 --> 01:13:13.260
<v Speaker 2>compatible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's one story.</v>

1414
01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.093
<v Speaker 2>Another story is how about you and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived together for a little while and </v>

1415
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

1416
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:19.663
<v Speaker 2>you're not so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe I can find someone better and </v>

1417
01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:22.350
<v Speaker 2>if I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1418
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:25.290
<v Speaker 2>in the next year and a half or so </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're not hooked together in any</v>

1419
01:13:25.291 --> 01:13:27.090
<v Speaker 2>formal way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just trade you in.</v>

1420
01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.250
<v Speaker 2>It's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do the same to me,</v>

1421
01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:34.320
<v Speaker 2>but I don't really see that as the sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of complimentary mutual interaction that</v>

1422
01:13:34.321 --> 01:13:37.230
<v Speaker 2>leads to the formulation of longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>

1423
01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:38.633
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's a better story for </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpreting what constitutes living </v>

1424
01:13:40.951 --> 01:13:41.940
<v Speaker 2>together then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1425
01:13:41.941 --> 01:13:42.774
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to try each other out </v>

1426
01:13:43.621 --> 01:13:45.890
<v Speaker 2>because that's what mature people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

1427
01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:47.490
<v Speaker 2>So our rental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1428
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Well that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rental car.</v>

1429
01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1430
01:13:50.491 --> 01:13:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1431
01:13:51.391 --> 01:13:51.870
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1432
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:53.610
<v Speaker 2>but what more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most importantly,</v>

1433
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.593
<v Speaker 2>the data indicate that it doesn't work </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you're more likely to get </v>

1434
01:13:57.421 --> 01:13:57.780
<v Speaker 2>divorced.</v>

1435
01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Not less likely because maybe the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude is,</v>

1436
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.733
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably about as flawed as me </v>

1437
01:14:03.151 --> 01:14:05.220
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're lucky that we found each other and</v>

1438
01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:06.323
<v Speaker 2>so let's see if we can make a commitment</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're engaging in something </v>

1439
01:14:09.391 --> 01:14:10.590
<v Speaker 2>that's very risky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1440
01:14:10.591 --> 01:14:11.424
<v Speaker 2>an intimate relationship and we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to commit to each other and see if we </v>

1441
01:14:13.781 --> 01:14:18.250
<v Speaker 2>can build something of value across time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a definite risk in that,</v>

1442
01:14:18.251 --> 01:14:19.900
<v Speaker 2>but there is a compliment to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner.</v>

1443
01:14:19.901 --> 01:14:20.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1444
01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:25.210
<v Speaker 2>I think you're worth making a sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 2>for and what's the sacrifice?</v>

1445
01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:28.820
<v Speaker 2>While it's everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big sacrifice and there's.</v>

1446
01:14:28.890 --> 01:14:29.723
<v Speaker 2>If you don't see that as a compliment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I don't think you're thinking </v>

1447
01:14:32.861 --> 01:14:33.694
<v Speaker 2>because not only is it a compliment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like the ultimate </v>

1448
01:14:35.891 --> 01:14:36.724
<v Speaker 2>compliment and maybe you don't get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a marriage that works without that </v>

1449
01:14:40.301 --> 01:14:41.134
<v Speaker 2>compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's so difficult to establish a </v>

1450
01:14:43.301 --> 01:14:44.134
<v Speaker 2>longterm relationship that's functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to make a walloping </v>

1451
01:14:46.901 --> 01:14:49.360
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice very early on in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

1452
01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:51.610
<v Speaker 2>In order for that to even be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>

1453
01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not because what the hell do we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know about what binds people together,</v>

1454
01:14:55.811 --> 01:14:56.644
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that easy to stay with </v>

1455
01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:00.400
<v Speaker 2>someone for a long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1456
01:15:00.401 --> 01:15:01.540
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real,</v>

1457
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:04.720
<v Speaker 2>it's a real commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a tremendous amount of effort.</v>

1458
01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:06.043
<v Speaker 3>So actually you're bringing us back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning and your time with Tammy </v>

1459
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.460
<v Speaker 3>and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about.</v>

1460
01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.660
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to guess this is a bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an overlooked part in your chapter in</v>

1461
01:15:16.661 --> 01:15:19.480
<v Speaker 3>your book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just was like one of my favorites.</v>

1462
01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:22.180
<v Speaker 3>It was your book on modern parenting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

1463
01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.033
<v Speaker 3>And that was good.</v>

1464
01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.600
<v Speaker 2>I thought I would get most trouble for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1465
01:15:25.601 --> 01:15:28.030
<v Speaker 2>but it reminds me don't read that far </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the book.</v>

1466
01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:28.973
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1467
01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:30.110
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mother,</v>

1468
01:15:30.111 --> 01:15:30.944
<v Speaker 3>when I had my first child gave me a 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>fifties copy of Dr Spock and he was </v>

1469
01:15:35.001 --> 01:15:35.834
<v Speaker 3>considered so controversial and yet he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just like the most sensible person </v>

1470
01:15:39.291 --> 01:15:40.940
<v Speaker 3>made new children very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very well.</v>

1471
01:15:40.941 --> 01:15:41.774
<v Speaker 3>Was a pediatrician and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your rule for parenting is do not let </v>

1472
01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:50.291
<v Speaker 3>your children do anything that makes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>dislike them and you kind of in that one</v>

1473
01:15:51.801 --> 01:15:54.080
<v Speaker 3>chapter and it's not even one of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>longest chapters,</v>

1474
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:55.663
<v Speaker 3>just did this wonderful sweeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>overview of modern parenting and the </v>

1475
01:15:59.601 --> 01:16:00.434
<v Speaker 3>problems and in some ways that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>producing maybe some of these kids who </v>

1476
01:16:04.491 --> 01:16:08.780
<v Speaker 3>are prolonging adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prolonging the markers of adulthood,</v>

1477
01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:10.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1478
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:12.540
<v Speaker 3>that you feel that parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1479
01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:16.310
<v Speaker 3>you said you see today's parents is </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrified by their children,</v>

1480
01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.940
<v Speaker 3>not least because they've denied credit </v>
<v Speaker 3>for their role as benevolent,</v>

1481
01:16:19.941 --> 01:16:23.060
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary agents of discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>order and conventionality.</v>

1482
01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.193
<v Speaker 3>And then you told some hilarious stories</v>
<v Speaker 3>about when your wife ran a daycare </v>

1483
01:16:26.481 --> 01:16:27.314
<v Speaker 3>center out of your house and you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would get into tests of wills with </v>

1484
01:16:30.621 --> 01:16:31.710
<v Speaker 3>some of the two year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1485
01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.150
<v Speaker 2>sun is ordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It here,</v>

1486
01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.510
<v Speaker 2>he got married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations.</v>

1487
01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:41.290
<v Speaker 2>He still doesn't want to do anything he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to do.</v>

1488
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:44.020
<v Speaker 2>He's very charming and very emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>stable.</v>

1489
01:16:44.021 --> 01:16:46.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's like he's easy to get along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1490
01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:48.730
<v Speaker 2>but trying to get him to do something he</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to do.</v>

1491
01:16:48.731 --> 01:16:49.564
<v Speaker 2>It's like he had my wife defeated when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was nine months old and she's tough </v>

1492
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:55.060
<v Speaker 2>like seriously she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's no pushover,</v>

1493
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:56.103
<v Speaker 2>but he would just sit there with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth closed and glare adders like I'm </v>

1494
01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:01.540
<v Speaker 2>not eating out and I can take more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

1495
01:17:01.541 --> 01:17:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Dish out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was really something to see,</v>

1496
01:17:03.761 --> 01:17:04.594
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see that kind of force of will and </v>

1497
01:17:05.711 --> 01:17:06.850
<v Speaker 2>someone that small.</v>

1498
01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:09.733
<v Speaker 3>Talk a little bit about that and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>the modern roles between men and women </v>

1499
01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.160
<v Speaker 3>were less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1500
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:15.223
<v Speaker 3>you don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not really supposed to </v>

1501
01:17:16.401 --> 01:17:17.234
<v Speaker 3>distinguish between fathers and mothers </v>
<v Speaker 3>even though that seems to inevitably </v>

1502
01:17:20.361 --> 01:17:21.290
<v Speaker 3>happen in most.</v>

1503
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:22.833
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens in large part because the </v>

1504
01:17:23.631 --> 01:17:26.900
<v Speaker 2>children differentiate between them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like parents are under the delusion that</v>

1505
01:17:26.901 --> 01:17:27.734
<v Speaker 2>most of what you do with your children </v>
<v Speaker 2>is driven by what you want to do with </v>

1506
01:17:30.261 --> 01:17:31.094
<v Speaker 2>your children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When in fact it's driven to a massive </v>

1507
01:17:33.021 --> 01:17:36.170
<v Speaker 2>degree by what your children want you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with them.</v>

1508
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:41.590
<v Speaker 2>And so there were studies done 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago on feminist parents who decided that</v>

1509
01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:46.310
<v Speaker 2>they were going to raise their children </v>
<v Speaker 2>in non-gender differentiated matters.</v>

1510
01:17:46.311 --> 01:17:49.430
<v Speaker 2>And when they were studied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found that the parents who had that</v>

1511
01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:53.060
<v Speaker 2>explicit philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just as gender differentiated with</v>

1512
01:17:53.061 --> 01:17:55.400
<v Speaker 2>their children as the parents who didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the philosophy.</v>

1513
01:17:55.401 --> 01:17:56.234
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a parent that has any sense at </v>

1514
01:17:59.361 --> 01:18:00.194
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't respond to your children as a </v>

1515
01:18:02.751 --> 01:18:03.584
<v Speaker 2>rigid idea log.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You respond to them as whatever it is </v>

1516
01:18:05.721 --> 01:18:08.300
<v Speaker 2>the child man manifests it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

1517
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:10.400
<v Speaker 2>him or herself as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1518
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:11.263
<v Speaker 2>with any individualized relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take your cue from the person and </v>

1519
01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:17.810
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well a child has no intrinsic nature,</v>

1520
01:18:17.811 --> 01:18:18.644
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think that you either don't have </v>

1521
01:18:20.451 --> 01:18:25.451
<v Speaker 2>children or you've never seen a child or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so blinded by your radiology that</v>

1522
01:18:25.941 --> 01:18:26.930
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a child.</v>

1523
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:27.763
<v Speaker 2>You just have a blank projection screen </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto which you project your </v>

1524
01:18:30.591 --> 01:18:33.410
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions and then heaven help </v>
<v Speaker 2>your child.</v>

1525
01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:35.570
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1526
01:18:35.571 --> 01:18:36.404
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of the gender differentiation </v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually driven by the children's </v>

1527
01:18:38.841 --> 01:18:41.120
<v Speaker 2>demands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's all for the good.</v>

1528
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:42.313
<v Speaker 2>That chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I would get into tremendous </v>

1529
01:18:44.151 --> 01:18:46.790
<v Speaker 2>trouble for writing that chapter because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's contentious,</v>

1530
01:18:46.791 --> 01:18:49.100
<v Speaker 2>right on the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to the rule,</v>

1531
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:50.083
<v Speaker 2>because the rule first implies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>children can be dislikable and then I </v>

1532
01:18:53.091 --> 01:18:54.360
<v Speaker 2>would say again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1533
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:55.383
<v Speaker 2>like have you met children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every child where their children you </v>

1534
01:18:57.891 --> 01:19:01.730
<v Speaker 2>didn't like obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so lots of children or dislikable,</v>

1535
01:19:01.731 --> 01:19:02.564
<v Speaker 2>but it's taboo to admit that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all sweetness and light and </v>

1536
01:19:04.761 --> 01:19:07.210
<v Speaker 2>innocence ever since Rousseau,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1537
01:19:07.230 --> 01:19:11.390
<v Speaker 2>was so put all five of his children in </v>
<v Speaker 2>an orphanage where they all died.</v>

1538
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:15.500
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we won't talk too much about Rousseau</v>

1539
01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:17.043
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the next taboo is while that </v>

1540
01:19:19.761 --> 01:19:21.770
<v Speaker 2>parents can dislike their children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1541
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:22.603
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a clinician and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that parents can dislike their </v>

1542
01:19:25.311 --> 01:19:27.230
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then well then,</v>

1543
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:28.663
<v Speaker 2>well then you're not a clinician because</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you constantly see is </v>

1544
01:19:31.491 --> 01:19:32.324
<v Speaker 2>that path all within families is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly common common source of </v>

1545
01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.250
<v Speaker 2>psychological destabilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1546
01:19:40.251 --> 01:19:41.084
<v Speaker 2>And it's terrible tension between </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents and their children in between </v>

1547
01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:46.580
<v Speaker 2>siblings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I suggest in the book,</v>

1548
01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:50.000
<v Speaker 2>which I think is radical by today's </v>
<v Speaker 2>standards,</v>

1549
01:19:50.001 --> 01:19:55.001
<v Speaker 2>is that your fundamental job as a parent</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to ensure that by the time your child</v>

1550
01:19:57.111 --> 01:19:57.944
<v Speaker 2>is four years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they are maximally desirable to </v>

1551
01:20:01.311 --> 01:20:02.144
<v Speaker 2>other children and to adults because </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is that after the age of </v>

1552
01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:07.493
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you aren't the primary agent of </v>

1553
01:20:09.241 --> 01:20:10.074
<v Speaker 2>socialization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The social world becomes the primary </v>

1554
01:20:12.991 --> 01:20:13.824
<v Speaker 2>agent of socialization and if your child</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the sort of child that's invited to </v>

1555
01:20:18.151 --> 01:20:18.984
<v Speaker 2>play by other children because your </v>
<v Speaker 2>child is capable of for stolen </v>

1556
01:20:22.201 --> 01:20:26.270
<v Speaker 2>gratification and taking turns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing someone else's game when,</v>

1557
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:27.183
<v Speaker 2>when it's necessary and abiding by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules and not having a temper tantrum </v>

1558
01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:33.100
<v Speaker 2>when they lose and not getting to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1559
01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:37.800
<v Speaker 2>high on their horse when they win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than many children will invite them.</v>

1560
01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1561
01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:42.950
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you mean.</v>

1562
01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.360
<v Speaker 4>Just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you want me to do?</v>

1563
01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:44.640
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1564
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:45.720
<v Speaker 4>I know we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>

1565
01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:48.440
<v Speaker 4>we have our limited time and so I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to.</v>

1566
01:20:48.441 --> 01:20:49.274
<v Speaker 4>I was actually saying</v>

1567
01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.370
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

1568
01:20:51.370 --> 01:20:52.203
<v Speaker 4>so this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was selfish of me because I really </v>

1569
01:20:54.991 --> 01:20:57.780
<v Speaker 4>wanted to hear you talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I just want to let him take this.</v>

1570
01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.430
<v Speaker 4>I'll take 15 seconds to wrap that up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then stop.</v>

1571
01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:01.920
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so look,</v>

1572
01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:03.083
<v Speaker 2>you get married when you have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>children and you're flawed and your </v>

1573
01:21:06.121 --> 01:21:06.954
<v Speaker 2>partner slaughtered and hopefully you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>flawed in different ways and so you put </v>

1574
01:21:09.271 --> 01:21:10.104
<v Speaker 2>the two of you together and you make one</v>
<v Speaker 2>approximately normal person and then </v>

1575
01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:18.390
<v Speaker 2>hopefully and then your child has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with that dyad.</v>

1576
01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:19.253
<v Speaker 2>That is a reasonable representative of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social norms and if they disagree or if </v>

1577
01:21:24.241 --> 01:21:27.450
<v Speaker 2>your child disappoints you with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

1578
01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:31.680
<v Speaker 2>the probability that they will </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappoint other people is very high and</v>

1579
01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:32.514
<v Speaker 2>so you have an ethical obligation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ensure that your child is behaving in a </v>

1580
01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:41.160
<v Speaker 2>manner that makes them optimally </v>
<v Speaker 2>desirable to their playmates and also to</v>

1581
01:21:41.161 --> 01:21:41.994
<v Speaker 2>other adults because then the kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>invite them to play and they get to be </v>

1582
01:21:46.081 --> 01:21:47.760
<v Speaker 2>socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1583
01:21:47.761 --> 01:21:49.800
<v Speaker 2>They get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have friends for God's sake.</v>

1584
01:21:49.801 --> 01:21:51.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want for your kids?</v>

1585
01:21:51.091 --> 01:21:51.924
<v Speaker 2>How about some friends?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't that be nice and maybe what </v>

1586
01:21:54.301 --> 01:21:55.134
<v Speaker 2>you'd like is that they regulate their </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior well enough so that when you </v>

1587
01:21:57.691 --> 01:22:00.630
<v Speaker 2>take them places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurants to see your friends,</v>

1588
01:22:00.631 --> 01:22:01.464
<v Speaker 2>to see your relatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they behave in a manner that's </v>

1589
01:22:03.271 --> 01:22:04.104
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so their intrinsic charm winds over the </v>

1590
01:22:07.921 --> 01:22:11.610
<v Speaker 2>adults and everywhere they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are smiling and welcoming instead</v>

1591
01:22:11.611 --> 01:22:12.444
<v Speaker 2>of wishing with fake smiles that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn Brat would leave along with their </v>

1592
01:22:16.381 --> 01:22:18.750
<v Speaker 2>foolish parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not a good.</v>

1593
01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:19.763
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good environment to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>your child constantly exposed to no </v>

1594
01:22:24.571 --> 01:22:29.571
<v Speaker 2>friends because they're too selfish and </v>
<v Speaker 2>immature and irritated era irritating to</v>

1595
01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:34.200
<v Speaker 2>adults so that they're barely tolerated </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the mask of false smiles.</v>

1596
01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:35.483
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have an ethical obligation</v>
<v Speaker 2>to regulate your child's behavior so </v>

1597
01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:42.090
<v Speaker 2>that they're optimally acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially and that is not how people look</v>

1598
01:22:42.091 --> 01:22:44.100
<v Speaker 2>at children in the modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>

1599
01:22:44.101 --> 01:22:44.934
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you raising their self esteem or you're </v>

1600
01:22:46.351 --> 01:22:47.184
<v Speaker 2>enhancing their creativity or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to put constraints on their </v>

1601
01:22:49.471 --> 01:22:50.304
<v Speaker 2>behavior because you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interfere with the flowering of their </v>

1602
01:22:52.651 --> 01:22:55.390
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic self and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all roost,</v>

1603
01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:59.880
<v Speaker 2>soliah nonsense and there's no evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>to support it.</v>

1604
01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Father,</v>

1605
01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:06.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was such a corrupt</v>

1606
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.353
<v Speaker 1>and he had these babies with this poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>scullery maid and left them all in a </v>

1607
01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:15.430
<v Speaker 1>actually a place where they would just </v>
<v Speaker 1>languish and die.</v>

1608
01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:16.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1609
01:23:16.001 --> 01:23:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Five of them Russo.</v>

1610
01:23:17.370 --> 01:23:18.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1611
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.931
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1612
01:23:18.931 --> 01:23:20.210
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

1613
01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.920
<v Speaker 2>that is intrinsically good.</v>

1614
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:23.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One example,</v>

1615
01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:24.960
<v Speaker 4>I just remember</v>

1616
01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:30.450
<v Speaker 1>a few weeks ago I was reading about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in somehow I got onto somebody's twitter</v>

1617
01:23:30.581 --> 01:23:33.850
<v Speaker 1>feed whom I will not mention because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

1618
01:23:33.851 --> 01:23:37.630
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a difficult person and she was attacking</v>

1619
01:23:37.631 --> 01:23:38.464
<v Speaker 1>you and had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a selection from your book a bit where </v>

1620
01:23:42.281 --> 01:23:45.100
<v Speaker 1>you would called two-year-olds little </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters.</v>

1621
01:23:45.610 --> 01:23:46.443
<v Speaker 1>And so suddenly all of these distraught </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter followers of this feminist were </v>

1622
01:23:51.761 --> 01:23:52.594
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1623
01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:53.770
<v Speaker 1>called them.</v>

1624
01:23:55.710 --> 01:23:57.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little monsters and everybody.</v>

1625
01:23:57.551 --> 01:23:59.290
<v Speaker 4>And then occasionally there'd be a</v>

1626
01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:04.250
<v Speaker 1>apparent who would take a two year olds </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of are monsters,</v>

1627
01:24:04.251 --> 01:24:07.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there'd be kind of art and they</v>

1628
01:24:07.791 --> 01:24:12.240
<v Speaker 1>had taken this out of context and shown </v>
<v Speaker 1>it like something to deplore and,</v>

1629
01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:13.940
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was so amusing to me.</v>

1630
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:15.130
<v Speaker 1>This little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully they'll soon be cursed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

1632
01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:22.610
<v Speaker 4>My son was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't say which one was two years old,</v>

1633
01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.473
<v Speaker 1>had he was a good boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had an insane meltdown in a </v>

1634
01:24:27.381 --> 01:24:29.150
<v Speaker 1>supermarket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was with my mother.</v>

1635
01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.560
<v Speaker 1>We both pretended we didn't know</v>

1636
01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:36.420
<v Speaker 4>to be the parent and we heard people </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1637
01:24:36.450 --> 01:24:37.283
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that child and watching a two </v>

1638
01:24:39.031 --> 01:24:43.140
<v Speaker 4>year old have a Tantrum is I didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be associated with</v>

1639
01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:47.300
<v Speaker 2>boy who used to be like when my wife was</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken care of more kids than ours.</v>

1640
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:51.140
<v Speaker 2>There was a little boy who who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had learned to throw a pretty decent</v>

1641
01:24:51.141 --> 01:24:51.974
<v Speaker 2>town and and he would do that and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't work in our house because we'd </v>

1642
01:24:55.581 --> 01:24:56.414
<v Speaker 2>just leave him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have his tantrum and going into a </v>

1643
01:24:57.741 --> 01:24:59.890
<v Speaker 2>different room and then he'd kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up out of it.</v>

1644
01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.700
<v Speaker 2>There wouldn't be anybody around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that</v>

1645
01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:04.640
<v Speaker 4>like if you put all that work to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dramatic difference</v>

1646
01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:06.500
<v Speaker 2>play and you have zero audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1647
01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:09.630
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to sustain it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could actually turn,</v>

1648
01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:13.660
<v Speaker 2>hold his breath until he turned blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you should try that.</v>

1649
01:25:13.710 --> 01:25:15.820
<v Speaker 2>Go home and see if you can do that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of the mirror man.</v>

1650
01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Like it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

1651
01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:19.990
<v Speaker 2>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you do.</v>

1652
01:25:19.991 --> 01:25:21.250
<v Speaker 2>It was impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1653
01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:22.260
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1654
01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:24.390
<v Speaker 2>two year olds are very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>

1655
01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:28.510
<v Speaker 2>They have unbelievable outbursts of rage</v>
<v Speaker 2>and disinhibited emotion.</v>

1656
01:25:28.511 --> 01:25:30.010
<v Speaker 2>And your job is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1657
01:25:30.011 --> 01:25:30.844
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're driven by these underlying </v>

1658
01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.513
<v Speaker 2>motivational systems that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably powerful and as part of </v>

1659
01:25:36.101 --> 01:25:38.500
<v Speaker 2>what makes them delightful because when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're happy,</v>

1660
01:25:38.501 --> 01:25:40.780
<v Speaker 2>they're insanely happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they're playful,</v>

1661
01:25:40.781 --> 01:25:45.070
<v Speaker 2>they're incredibly playful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the positive end of the MS is way</v>

1662
01:25:45.071 --> 01:25:46.700
<v Speaker 2>exaggerated compared to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1663
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:47.623
<v Speaker 2>or rather drab adult and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it makes two year olds </v>

1664
01:25:49.691 --> 01:25:51.040
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily interesting.</v>

1665
01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.800
<v Speaker 2>But the same is true on the negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion side.</v>

1666
01:25:53.801 --> 01:25:56.320
<v Speaker 2>They're completely dysregulated and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard on them.</v>

1667
01:25:56.350 --> 01:26:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Like to have a two year old who isn't in</v>
<v Speaker 2>control of their emotions means that you</v>

1668
01:26:00.461 --> 01:26:04.310
<v Speaker 2>have a child who's developing central </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>

1669
01:26:04.311 --> 01:26:04.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

1670
01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:06.590
<v Speaker 2>their ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better word,</v>

1671
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:11.120
<v Speaker 2>is constantly being swamped by these </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful underlying emotional systems.</v>

1672
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:12.163
<v Speaker 2>You know what it's like if you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>enraged for any period of time or if </v>

1673
01:26:14.931 --> 01:26:17.600
<v Speaker 2>you're engulfed by grief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's exhausting.</v>

1674
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:18.643
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's demeaning and it's exhausting and </v>

1675
01:26:20.631 --> 01:26:21.464
<v Speaker 2>it's the same with a little candidates </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a real defeat for the </v>

1676
01:26:24.231 --> 01:26:29.231
<v Speaker 2>developing integrated individual to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjugated by those catastrophic,</v>

1677
01:26:29.931 --> 01:26:30.764
<v Speaker 2>really powerful emergency motions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of your job as a parent is to </v>

1678
01:26:34.581 --> 01:26:35.414
<v Speaker 2>scaffold the part of the child that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulate and inhibit those powerful </v>

1679
01:26:39.951 --> 01:26:42.530
<v Speaker 2>underlying system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with my son for example,</v>

1680
01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:46.130
<v Speaker 2>when he used to misbehave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would count say you're going to go sit</v>

1681
01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:46.964
<v Speaker 2>on the steps.</v>

1682
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:47.751
<v Speaker 2>He'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

1683
01:26:47.751 --> 01:26:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1684
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes you are.</v>

1685
01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:54.080
<v Speaker 2>And then usually I'd have to chase the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morale because he wouldn't go sit on the</v>

1686
01:26:54.081 --> 01:26:54.914
<v Speaker 2>steps and so I put them on the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say you're going to sit there until </v>

1687
01:26:57.201 --> 01:27:00.440
<v Speaker 2>you've got yourself under control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he'd say no,</v>

1688
01:27:00.441 --> 01:27:01.274
<v Speaker 2>I not say yes you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he tried to get up and I just </v>

1689
01:27:03.661 --> 01:27:04.494
<v Speaker 2>told him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

1690
01:27:04.730 --> 01:27:05.563
<v Speaker 2>you're going to sit there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hold you until you sit </v>

1691
01:27:06.951 --> 01:27:08.030
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1692
01:27:08.031 --> 01:27:08.864
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I could out wait a two year </v>

1693
01:27:11.151 --> 01:27:11.984
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I usually won those battles and then </v>

1694
01:27:14.061 --> 01:27:15.260
<v Speaker 2>he'd sit there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look kid,</v>

1695
01:27:15.261 --> 01:27:17.450
<v Speaker 2>this is the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say two things like you want to have</v>

1696
01:27:17.451 --> 01:27:18.980
<v Speaker 2>a bad day or you want to have a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

1697
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:20.960
<v Speaker 2>you think about that because if you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a good day,</v>

1698
01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:25.480
<v Speaker 2>have a bad day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could have a bad days.</v>

1699
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:26.323
<v Speaker 2>You sit here and as soon as you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>control of yourself and you're ready to </v>

1700
01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:31.220
<v Speaker 2>be civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can come back and we can have a</v>

1701
01:27:31.221 --> 01:27:33.110
<v Speaker 2>good day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'd sit there</v>

1702
01:27:34.650 --> 01:27:35.660
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1703
01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:39.380
<v Speaker 2>it was unbelievable to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the developed with rage,</v>

1704
01:27:39.381 --> 01:27:40.214
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just trying to get himself under </v>

1705
01:27:42.021 --> 01:27:42.831
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1706
01:27:42.831 --> 01:27:45.080
<v Speaker 2>And so I'd come back 30 seconds later </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd say,</v>

1707
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:48.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but got yourself,</v>

1708
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:49.280
<v Speaker 2>got your act together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1709
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.810
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I wait.</v>

1710
01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:57.290
<v Speaker 2>And usually it took them two or three </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes and he'd calm down and then he'd</v>

1711
01:27:57.291 --> 01:27:59.690
<v Speaker 2>come back out and he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to have a good day.</v>

1712
01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:00.920
<v Speaker 2>And he meant it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1713
01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:04.190
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell he meant it too because </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever resentment,</v>

1714
01:28:04.191 --> 01:28:05.024
<v Speaker 2>I was harboring towards him for his </v>
<v Speaker 2>misbehavior and you have to watch that </v>

1715
01:28:08.631 --> 01:28:11.490
<v Speaker 2>when you're an adult would vanish </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he'd come and he'd,</v>

1716
01:28:12.150 --> 01:28:12.983
<v Speaker 2>he was done.</v>

1717
01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.360
<v Speaker 2>He was ready to just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1718
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:15.383
<v Speaker 2>to proceed on a civilized basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was really interesting to watch </v>

1719
01:28:18.711 --> 01:28:22.670
<v Speaker 2>that because it took them every time he </v>
<v Speaker 2>sat on the steps,</v>

1720
01:28:22.671 --> 01:28:25.400
<v Speaker 2>it took them a shorter and shorter </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time to attain mastery.</v>

1721
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Until,</v>

1722
01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.033
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got to the point where he could only </v>

1723
01:28:28.551 --> 01:28:33.290
<v Speaker 2>have to sit for 15 seconds or so when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would bring himself under control.</v>

1724
01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.153
<v Speaker 2>And that was a victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you imagine the neurological </v>

1725
01:28:36.981 --> 01:28:40.400
<v Speaker 2>systems developed that are responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for personality integration,</v>

1726
01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:41.373
<v Speaker 2>it was a victory for those systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were attaining the ability </v>

1727
01:28:44.061 --> 01:28:48.410
<v Speaker 2>to regulate the lower order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spontaneous emotions and you know,</v>

1728
01:28:48.411 --> 01:28:49.430
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

1729
01:28:49.431 --> 01:28:50.264
<v Speaker 2>he turned into an individual who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of a tremendous level of self </v>

1730
01:28:53.151 --> 01:28:56.750
<v Speaker 2>control and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he had large daymond's defined with.</v>

1731
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1732
01:28:58.780 --> 01:28:59.250
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1733
01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:01.290
<v Speaker 2>and while it turned out well for my </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter too,</v>

1734
01:29:01.291 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 2>because she ended</v>

1735
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:06.750
<v Speaker 4>up being very ill and he ended up being </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily levelheaded and reliable</v>

1736
01:29:06.751 --> 01:29:08.760
<v Speaker 4>and thank God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you,</v>

1737
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:12.360
<v Speaker 4>could you come to my house and do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>for my little multiport izzy?</v>

1738
01:29:12.690 --> 01:29:15.540
<v Speaker 4>Because I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

1739
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:17.910
<v Speaker 4>I can't train her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's nice.</v>

1740
01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:19.980

<v Speaker 4>just to satisfy the dog.</v>

1745
01:29:32.461 --> 01:29:36.960
<v Speaker 4>It didn't satisfy satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't satisfy them.</v>
