1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.123
<v Speaker 1>I got a video yesterday from a group in </v>
<v Speaker 1>California that are trying to refocus </v>

2
00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:06.674
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats and I want to tell you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit about it today and take it </v>

3
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>apart and analyze it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're all in luck,</v>

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.600
<v Speaker 1>given the importance of a stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.463
<v Speaker 1>functional two party political system in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s and in consequence everywhere </v>

6
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:23.864
<v Speaker 1>else in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video will make a reasonable case </v>

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.733
<v Speaker 1>for something approximating and returned</v>
<v Speaker 1>to normative political debate in image </v>

8
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.503
<v Speaker 1>and word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you the whole thing first and </v>

9
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.070
<v Speaker 1>then we'll take it apart.</v>

10
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 2>We stand for the working men and women </v>
<v Speaker 2>always have,</v>

11
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.283
<v Speaker 2>always will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we define ourselves by what we've </v>

12
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 2>done to help them get their shot at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American dream,</v>

13
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 2>social security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Gi bill,</v>

14
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 2>the Civil Rights Act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicare saving an auto industry,</v>

15
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.843
<v Speaker 2>23 million people with health insurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first time in their lives and </v>

16
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 2>all along it was American workers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers and factory workers,</v>

17
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.670
<v Speaker 2>immigrants and engineers of every color </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking every language we're building,</v>

18
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 2>the highest standard of living the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>had ever seen.</v>

19
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.843
<v Speaker 2>Who's innovations were changing history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose courage made America of beacon of </v>

20
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 2>hope and freedom for those living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny around the world?</v>

21
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Working People made America work.</v>

22
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.683
<v Speaker 2>Then something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people in Washington took the side </v>

23
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 2>of the powerful against American </v>
<v Speaker 2>workers.</v>

24
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 2>That game got fixed for an entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation and come flatline.</v>

25
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Big donors made sure lawmakers cared </v>
<v Speaker 2>more about Wall Street than your street.</v>

26
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.803
<v Speaker 2>Back in the 80s a CEO made 30 times what</v>
<v Speaker 2>is workers made now they make 300 times </v>

27
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 2>since the great recession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all of the income gains have gone</v>

28
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:09.711
<v Speaker 2>to the top 0.01% not 1% 0.01% instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>raising your salary,</v>

29
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 2>they buy back stock to increase their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own bonuses.</v>

30
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.353
<v Speaker 2>They merged companies and reduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition so they can make even more </v>

31
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All while your cable bill gets bigger,</v>

32
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 2>your cell phone bill gets higher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're internet gets slower,</v>

33
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.463
<v Speaker 2>the seat on your flight gets smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their taxes get lower and your health </v>

34
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 2>bills get raised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's looking out for you?</v>

35
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.363
<v Speaker 2>The people in power are so busy giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>tax breaks to the wealthiest that they </v>

36
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 2>blow up the deficit and leave nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>for roads and bridges,</v>

37
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 2>nothing for veterans or Medicare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing for job training.</v>

38
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Something has to change</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to change it.</v>

39
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.613
<v Speaker 2>A new generation of leaders who know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what needs to be done and who have the </v>

40
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:58.200
<v Speaker 2>will to stand up to those who would hold</v>
<v Speaker 2>us back.</v>

41
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.393
<v Speaker 2>We want our America back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The land of decency and fairness of </v>

42
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.513
<v Speaker 2>generous hearts and big dreams and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom for anyone who wants to work </v>

43
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 2>hard to make those dreams come true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what your politics are.</v>

44
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what God you pray to or </v>
<v Speaker 3>what color your skin is.</v>

45
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.663
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if you ride a tractor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>run a business and I hope your business </v>

46
00:03:20.071 --> 00:03:23.820
<v Speaker 3>is a big success as long as everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>plays by the same rules,</v>

47
00:03:23.821 --> 00:03:25.740
<v Speaker 3>the same rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same rules,</v>

48
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.430
<v Speaker 3>because this is America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is America,</v>

49
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.470
<v Speaker 3>this is America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this</v>

50
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.630
<v Speaker 2>is our generation's great calling to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rise to the challenge like those who had</v>

51
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 2>the courage before us to build a future </v>
<v Speaker 2>for all Americans.</v>

52
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Not just a few to fight for the higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay working people have more than earned</v>

53
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>to fight to make healthcare available to</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone who needs it.</v>

54
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.993
<v Speaker 2>Just stop those who would try to cut the</v>
<v Speaker 2>social security and Medicare benefits </v>

55
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 2>that are rightfully yours to protect the</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment instead of selling it to the</v>

56
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:00.604
<v Speaker 2>highest bidder to fight for a government</v>
<v Speaker 2>free of corruption where your </v>

57
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:05.014
<v Speaker 2>representatives work only for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to build a future that is just and free </v>

58
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 2>full of hope and opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our Future,</v>

59
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.460
<v Speaker 2>our children thank us for leaving </v>
<v Speaker 2>because democracy is built not bought by</v>

60
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 2>the strong and the free.</v>

61
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.710
<v Speaker 1>So that's the statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story,</v>

62
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.210
<v Speaker 1>the appeal to voters and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment of direction.</v>

63
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.410
<v Speaker 1>We want to take a look at the images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assessed the text,</v>

64
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.603
<v Speaker 1>determine what's in the video and </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally importantly determine what is </v>

65
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:00.570
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you some background first.</v>

66
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 1>This is about the group that's created </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

67
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.263
<v Speaker 1>After the election in 2016 we created a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political organization to work on the </v>

68
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:15.690
<v Speaker 1>important issue of expanding the reach </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Democrats and focusing on shared core</v>

69
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:18.660
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Future majority.</v>

70
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.913
<v Speaker 1>That's the name of the organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Under the leadership of Mark Rydell </v>

71
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 1>continues to work on a vast scale to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebrand and define the party,</v>

72
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.090
<v Speaker 1>particularly in red and purple states </v>
<v Speaker 1>and districts.</v>

73
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.260
<v Speaker 1>In an effort to shore up our base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak to swing voters and turn out those</v>

74
00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:38.820
<v Speaker 1>voters who we lost in the last election </v>
<v Speaker 1>built,</v>

75
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.970
<v Speaker 1>not bought created by Marshall </v>
<v Speaker 1>Herskovitz,</v>

76
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:42.804
<v Speaker 1>Gregg Hurwitz and Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corey is the cornerstone of a new </v>

77
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:51.021
<v Speaker 1>initiative that answers the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do Democrats stand for?</v>

78
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.580
<v Speaker 1>The four minute film celebrates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>singular importance of working people in</v>

79
00:05:56.581 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>the creation of modern America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

80
00:05:58.731 --> 00:05:59.564
<v Speaker 1>calling out the big donor influences </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have eroded our democratic </v>

81
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>institutions over the past few decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a patriotic,</v>

82
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>optimistic solutions oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>affirmation of core American values,</v>

83
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>decency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair play,</v>

84
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>the belief in a boundless future that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem too often forgotten in our partisan</v>

85
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:18.674
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a call to action to build a future </v>

86
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>that has just in free full of hope and </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

87
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>First is the name of the video itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>built,</v>

88
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 1>not bought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is obviously a direct appeal to the</v>

89
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:34.334
<v Speaker 1>idea of labor as opposed to capital and </v>
<v Speaker 1>is in keeping with the traditional </v>

90
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 1>Democrat emphasis on the contribution of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the working class.</v>

91
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.123
<v Speaker 1>I think it skews a little left and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate manners strategically </v>

92
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.413
<v Speaker 1>because the amazing infrastructure </v>
<v Speaker 1>around us was built and bought since </v>

93
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:51.404
<v Speaker 1>people need to be paid for their labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>because capital contributes just like </v>

94
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:55.784
<v Speaker 1>labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps that's a forgivable </v>

95
00:06:57.411 --> 00:06:58.610
<v Speaker 1>rhetorical flourish.</v>

96
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.160
<v Speaker 4>Let's turn from that to the opening </v>
<v Speaker 4>shot.</v>

97
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.403
<v Speaker 4>We stand for the working men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We opened moving forward to a sun </v>

98
00:07:10.421 --> 00:07:11.254
<v Speaker 4>dappled mountain vista that indicates </v>
<v Speaker 4>the possibility of awkward movement </v>

99
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.920
<v Speaker 4>progress and we switched to an image of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a typical American nuclear family.</v>

100
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.770
<v Speaker 4>I liked the choice of that image a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>to open.</v>

101
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.540
<v Speaker 4>The opening scene of a film is </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly important and the fact that</v>

102
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:29.374
<v Speaker 4>these filmmakers chose to highlight the </v>
<v Speaker 4>typical American nuclear family strikes </v>

103
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:35.590
<v Speaker 4>me as a reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent,</v>

104
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.220
<v Speaker 4>cautious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and somewhat traditional initial choice</v>

105
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.993
<v Speaker 2>and we define ourselves by what we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done to help them get their shot at the </v>

106
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 2>American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social Security,</v>

107
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 2>the Gi bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Civil Rights Act,</v>

108
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.063
<v Speaker 2>medicare saving an auto industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>23 million people with health insurance </v>

109
00:07:57.081 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 2>for the first time in their lives.</v>

110
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:00.543
<v Speaker 4>This is followed by a 22nd section </v>
<v Speaker 4>detailing the Democrats contribution to </v>

111
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:05.404
<v Speaker 4>the higher standards of living currently</v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoyed by working class people in the </v>

112
00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:10.024
<v Speaker 4>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This seems to me to be handled with </v>

113
00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:13.750
<v Speaker 4>reasonable credibility.</v>

114
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was American workers,</v>

115
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.593
<v Speaker 2>farmers and factory workers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants and engineers of every color </v>

116
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.610
<v Speaker 2>speaking every language we're building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest standard of living the world</v>

117
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 2>had ever seen who's innovations were </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing.</v>

118
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:29.504
<v Speaker 2>History,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose courage made America a beacon of </v>

119
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 2>hope and freedom for those living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny around the world,</v>

120
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.370
<v Speaker 2>working people make America work.</v>

121
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.520
<v Speaker 4>I like this section quite a bit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>found it surprising.</v>

122
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.240
<v Speaker 4>It was surprising because of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unabashed appreciation shown by the film</v>

123
00:08:51.391 --> 00:08:52.224
<v Speaker 4>makers for the effort put in by working </v>
<v Speaker 4>class people to produce a higher </v>

124
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:59.334
<v Speaker 4>standard of living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some genuine appreciation for </v>

125
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:02.184
<v Speaker 4>the fact that this occurred,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I see this as standing at quite </v>

126
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:10.881
<v Speaker 4>marked contrast to the all too typical </v>
<v Speaker 4>dialogue on the radical left,</v>

127
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:16.251
<v Speaker 4>concentrating on the pernicious effects </v>
<v Speaker 4>of modern culture by image and word.</v>

128
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:17.094
<v Speaker 4>The filmmakers in this section testified</v>
<v Speaker 4>the utility of the efforts of people in </v>

129
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:21.774
<v Speaker 4>the working class to producing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>productive and relatively wealthy </v>

130
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 4>society that exists in the United States</v>
<v Speaker 4>and elsewhere today.</v>

131
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:28.643
<v Speaker 4>So I thought that was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also think it's important not to miss </v>

132
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 4>the positivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Radical inclusion of a young boy playing</v>

133
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:36.894
<v Speaker 4>in army helmet with an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a bit of respect shown both to </v>

134
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 4>the way boys typically play in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>military all simultaneously.</v>

135
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 4>So that's quite something.</v>

136
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.813
<v Speaker 2>Then something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people in Washington took the side </v>

137
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 2>of the powerful against American </v>
<v Speaker 2>workers.</v>

138
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 2>The game got fixed for an entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation.</v>

139
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.253
<v Speaker 2>Income flatlined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big donors made sure lawmakers cared </v>

140
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 2>more about Wall Street than you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

141
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.790
<v Speaker 2>Back in the 80s a CEO made 30 times what</v>
<v Speaker 2>is workers made now?</v>

142
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:15.810
<v Speaker 2>They make 300 times since the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>recession,</v>

143
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.870
<v Speaker 2>almost all of the income gains have gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the top 0.01% not 1% 0.01% instead of</v>

144
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:24.564
<v Speaker 2>raising your salary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they buy back stock to increase their </v>

145
00:10:26.671 --> 00:10:27.504
<v Speaker 2>own bonuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They merged companies and reduce </v>

146
00:10:29.341 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 2>competition so they can make even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

147
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.910
<v Speaker 2>All while your cable bill gets bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your cell phone bill gets higher,</v>

148
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.510
<v Speaker 2>you're internet gets slower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seat on your flight gets smaller,</v>

149
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 2>their taxes get lower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your health bills get raised.</v>

150
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Who's looking out for you?</v>

151
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that the section we just watched</v>

152
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.293
<v Speaker 4>is the weakest part of the film and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's inclusion was an error of </v>

153
00:10:51.881 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 4>other reasons to decry access </v>
<v Speaker 4>inequality.</v>

154
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:55.523
<v Speaker 4>I thought the emphasis on the unnamed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they and the images of wealth is under </v>

155
00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:01.890
<v Speaker 4>and luxury were unsophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cliched,</v>

156
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:02.724
<v Speaker 4>and unnecessarily divisive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is absolutely necessary for the </v>

157
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:09.750
<v Speaker 4>Democrats and for all those who wish for</v>
<v Speaker 4>return to politics as usual,</v>

158
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.610
<v Speaker 4>to distinguish between the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wealthy individuals in the US who are in</v>

159
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:17.550
<v Speaker 4>their money honestly and through benefit</v>
<v Speaker 4>to society,</v>

160
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.413
<v Speaker 4>freely chosen by consumers and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>minority who gathered their position </v>

161
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.613
<v Speaker 4>through unsavory or counterproductive </v>
<v Speaker 4>means there is almost nothing more </v>

162
00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:27.204
<v Speaker 4>important than distinguishing between </v>
<v Speaker 4>the successful who earn their success </v>

163
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.673
<v Speaker 4>and those who managed it through </v>
<v Speaker 4>exploitation and conflating the two is </v>

164
00:11:34.931 --> 00:11:37.890
<v Speaker 4>an assault on the ideas of competence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aspiration,</v>

165
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:39.960
<v Speaker 4>and accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As such,</v>

166
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.830
<v Speaker 4>I truly believe that all this section </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a regressive mistake,</v>

167
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.873
<v Speaker 4>a call to resentment as a reason for </v>
<v Speaker 4>civic engagement and an insult to the </v>

168
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:49.164
<v Speaker 4>hardworking people of the u s whose </v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplishments were celebrated just </v>

169
00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 4>prior to the deliverance of this darker </v>
<v Speaker 4>message.</v>

170
00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:57.163
<v Speaker 2>The people in power are so busy giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>tax breaks to the wealthiest that they </v>

171
00:12:00.561 --> 00:12:03.710
<v Speaker 2>blow up the deficit and leave nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>for roads and bridges,</v>

172
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.780
<v Speaker 2>nothing for veterans or Medicare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing for job training.</v>

173
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Something has to change.</v>

174
00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.930
<v Speaker 4>Now I found this section problematic to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people in power.</v>

175
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.303
<v Speaker 4>Well for a lot of the last while those </v>
<v Speaker 4>people were also Democrats and the tone </v>

176
00:12:22.521 --> 00:12:24.470
<v Speaker 4>in this section in the film we just </v>
<v Speaker 4>watched,</v>

177
00:12:24.471 --> 00:12:27.320
<v Speaker 4>it implies that it was someone other </v>
<v Speaker 4>than the people who are addressing you,</v>

178
00:12:27.321 --> 00:12:30.980
<v Speaker 4>her responsible for the current mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this part of the film would have</v>

179
00:12:30.981 --> 00:12:31.814
<v Speaker 4>been a lot stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had the Democrats taking some </v>

180
00:12:33.771 --> 00:12:34.604
<v Speaker 4>responsibility for the corruption that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there decrying instead of attributing </v>

181
00:12:38.571 --> 00:12:42.920
<v Speaker 4>its existence to unnamed others lurking </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow in the background.</v>

182
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:44.443
<v Speaker 4>This was a great opportunity in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>course of the film for the Democrats to </v>

183
00:12:47.181 --> 00:12:48.014
<v Speaker 4>note their own contributions to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>current state of affairs and to promise </v>

184
00:12:51.351 --> 00:12:52.184
<v Speaker 4>to do better</v>

185
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.223
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A new generation of leaders who know </v>

186
00:12:58.471 --> 00:13:02.070
<v Speaker 2>what needs to be done and who have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>will to stand up to those who would hold</v>

187
00:13:02.071 --> 00:13:02.904
<v Speaker 2>us back.</v>

188
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.800
<v Speaker 4>They're at a disability to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's appearance again.</v>

189
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.500
<v Speaker 4>It's not good to look for the cause of </v>
<v Speaker 4>trouble outside.</v>

190
00:13:09.501 --> 00:13:12.680
<v Speaker 4>It's an ethical error.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's another place where the film makers</v>

191
00:13:12.681 --> 00:13:13.514
<v Speaker 4>missed an opportunity to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility on the part of the </v>

192
00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Democrats for what's happening around us</v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

193
00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.240
<v Speaker 4>That's an ethical mistake.</v>

194
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.433
<v Speaker 2>We want our America back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the land of decency and fairness of </v>

195
00:13:25.731 --> 00:13:26.564
<v Speaker 2>generous hearts and big dreams and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom for anyone who wants to work </v>

196
00:13:30.261 --> 00:13:34.400
<v Speaker 2>hard to make those dreams come true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what your politics are.</v>

197
00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what God you pray to or </v>
<v Speaker 2>what color your skin is.</v>

198
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you ride a tractor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>run a business.</v>

199
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.890
<v Speaker 4>Your Business is a big success as long </v>
<v Speaker 4>as everybody plays by the same rules,</v>

200
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:49.030
<v Speaker 4>the same rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same rules because this is America.</v>

201
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.640
<v Speaker 4>This is America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is America.</v>

202
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.390
<v Speaker 4>I like this section a lot and again </v>
<v Speaker 4>found its inclusion.</v>

203
00:13:55.391 --> 00:13:56.224
<v Speaker 4>Quite surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's even a bit of nostalgia for the </v>

204
00:13:58.481 --> 00:13:59.314
<v Speaker 4>past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something never seen on the progressive </v>

205
00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:04.690
<v Speaker 4>landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's emphasis on generosity,</v>

206
00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:05.524
<v Speaker 4>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also real consideration given to </v>

207
00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:09.790
<v Speaker 4>aspirations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big dreams,</v>

208
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 4>something that has been woefully lacking</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the discourse generated by the left.</v>

209
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:18.580
<v Speaker 4>This is reiterated in the statement and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the freedom for anyone who wants to work</v>

210
00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:19.414
<v Speaker 4>hard to make those dreams come true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is again remarkable for its </v>

211
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:24.334
<v Speaker 4>unabashed insistence that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship between hard work and </v>

212
00:14:27.131 --> 00:14:30.670
<v Speaker 4>success and that success in itself is </v>
<v Speaker 4>desirable,</v>

213
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.530
<v Speaker 4>admirable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and worth pursuing.</v>

214
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:34.883
<v Speaker 4>Then there's a positive disavowal in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion of identity politics with each </v>

215
00:14:38.581 --> 00:14:39.414
<v Speaker 4>speaker alone and identified visually as</v>
<v Speaker 4>an individual and insistence on fair </v>

216
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:46.230
<v Speaker 4>play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an analog of equality,</v>

217
00:14:46.231 --> 00:14:47.064
<v Speaker 4>of opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not outcome and this direct statement </v>

218
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.543
<v Speaker 4>from a policeman no less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I hope that your business is </v>

219
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:54.554
<v Speaker 4>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very radical in a time where success is </v>

220
00:14:57.261 --> 00:15:00.770
<v Speaker 4>all too often reflexively equated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>privilege and oppression.</v>

221
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.173
<v Speaker 4>I think the ethos in this section stands</v>
<v Speaker 4>in powerful contradiction to that </v>

222
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:06.014
<v Speaker 4>presented earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're wealth and success was negatively </v>

223
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 4>portrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which attitude is going to prevail?</v>

224
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.423
<v Speaker 4>It's obvious to me that the ladder </v>
<v Speaker 4>message is most desirable and also most </v>

225
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:20.270
<v Speaker 4>likely to generate a favorable majority </v>
<v Speaker 4>response.</v>

226
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 4>People vote their dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the realities,</v>

227
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:24.643
<v Speaker 4>and it is perfectly reasonable for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Democrats to reconstitute themselves as </v>

228
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:28.724
<v Speaker 4>the party that can make the dreams of </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals come true even if those </v>

229
00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Speaker 4>individuals occupy a lower rung on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>economic ladder.</v>

230
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.720
<v Speaker 4>And to do so by insisting upon a fair </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing field the same rules and to know</v>

231
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:42.853
<v Speaker 4>finally that this characterizes America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this borders on stating that a shared </v>

232
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:47.954
<v Speaker 4>value structure is a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 4>precondition for social harmony and for </v>

233
00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:53.780
<v Speaker 4>the possibility of progress and upward </v>
<v Speaker 4>mobility.</v>

234
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:55.423
<v Speaker 4>Much more of this on the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Democrats is necessary and would be </v>

235
00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 4>widely applauded and welcomed.</v>

236
00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:01.763
<v Speaker 2>And this is our generation's great </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling to rise to the challenge like </v>

237
00:16:06.491 --> 00:16:11.020
<v Speaker 2>those who had the courage before us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>build a future for all Americans,</v>

238
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:16.590
<v Speaker 2>not just the few to fight for the higher</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay working people have more than earned</v>

239
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:18.303
<v Speaker 2>to fight to make healthcare available to</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone who needs it to stop those who </v>

240
00:16:22.361 --> 00:16:23.194
<v Speaker 2>would try to cut the social security and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Medicare benefits that are rightfully </v>

241
00:16:25.961 --> 00:16:30.580
<v Speaker 2>yours to protect the environment instead</v>
<v Speaker 2>of selling it to the highest bidder,</v>

242
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.193
<v Speaker 2>to fight for a government free of </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption where your representatives </v>

243
00:16:35.021 --> 00:16:35.854
<v Speaker 2>work only for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to build a future that is just and free </v>

244
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.490
<v Speaker 2>full of hope and opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our Future,</v>

245
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.520
<v Speaker 2>our children thank us for leaving </v>
<v Speaker 2>because democracy is built not bought by</v>

246
00:16:52.751 --> 00:16:54.910
<v Speaker 2>the strong and the free.</v>

247
00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.493
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

248
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:08.650
<v Speaker 4>The film ends positively with a call to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the future to build something promising.</v>

249
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.093
<v Speaker 4>It's marred once again in my opinion by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the reference to those who had cut </v>

250
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.250
<v Speaker 4>benefits and sell the environment to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>highest bidder.</v>

251
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.533
<v Speaker 4>More politics of resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uses positive imagery of </v>

252
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:21.044
<v Speaker 4>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>productive work and aspirational </v>

253
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:23.834
<v Speaker 4>engagement presents a promise to fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>corruption and closes with something </v>

254
00:17:27.831 --> 00:17:29.930
<v Speaker 4>positive about both strength and </v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom.</v>

255
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.610
<v Speaker 4>It could have been better for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons I outlined,</v>

256
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.770
<v Speaker 4>but it could have been a lot worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's much less of the radical left is</v>

257
00:17:38.771 --> 00:17:39.604
<v Speaker 4>tilt towards identity politics that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>characterized so much of the recent </v>

258
00:17:42.711 --> 00:17:43.544
<v Speaker 4>democratic conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a strong sense of shared </v>

259
00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:47.264
<v Speaker 4>American society values.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's tremendous emphasis on a fair </v>

260
00:17:50.191 --> 00:17:53.440
<v Speaker 4>playing field and the importance of </v>
<v Speaker 4>promise of hard work,</v>

261
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 4>not something typical of those who </v>
<v Speaker 4>insist,</v>

262
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.920
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on equity or equality of outcome,</v>

263
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 4>and do claim that our whole societies of</v>
<v Speaker 4>patriarchal tyranny,</v>

264
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.653
<v Speaker 4>in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this film is a welcome move towards </v>

265
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:07.194
<v Speaker 4>classical liberal values and away from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the divisive politics of political </v>

266
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:13.680
<v Speaker 4>correctness and naive but dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 4>utopianism.</v>
