1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.280
<v Speaker 1>We focus on the idea of happiness too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much in the.</v>

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.263
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes our focus away from ames that </v>

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>would be more productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much better to aim for meaning then</v>

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.133
<v Speaker 1>for happiness.</v>

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 2>12 rules for life is about how to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly in the face of vulnerability,</v>

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.000
<v Speaker 2>tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and malevolence.</v>

7
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.553
<v Speaker 2>One of the propositions in 12 rules for </v>
<v Speaker 2>life is that life existence is usefully </v>

8
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:34.990
<v Speaker 2>characterized as an interplay of order </v>
<v Speaker 2>and chaos or unknown unknown.</v>

9
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.390
<v Speaker 2>You're always striving to balance those </v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

10
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.953
<v Speaker 2>If if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if what you're doing is too familiar </v>

11
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:43.600
<v Speaker 2>your board and if what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to unfamiliar,</v>

12
00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:47.320
<v Speaker 2>then you're anxious and what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is find the,</v>

13
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the harmonious line between those two,</v>

14
00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:54.250
<v Speaker 2>but that's signified by leaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can get those two things right,</v>

15
00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:55.840
<v Speaker 2>then you can have your cake and eat it </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

16
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I hope people can take away the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is a motive being in the face</v>

17
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:04.144
<v Speaker 2>of the vulnerability and tragedy of life</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is noble and powerful and capable </v>

18
00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:12.454
<v Speaker 2>of sustaining them through the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible times without becoming corrupt </v>

19
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:18.004
<v Speaker 2>and bitter.</v>
