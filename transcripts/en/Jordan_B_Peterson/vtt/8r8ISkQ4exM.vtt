1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Psychoanalytic thought today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depth psychology.</v>

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a better way to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis.</v>

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud is not the only contributor to the</v>

4
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Corpus of psychoanalytic ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adler who we won't talk much about</v>

5
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>was certainly that there was smart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

6
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>he's under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's underrated.</v>

7
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't as charismatic as Freud and you</v>

8
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't have the same flare for</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing I suppose.</v>

10
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ideas foreshadow the development of</v>

11
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cybernetic ideas,</v>

12
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:40.430
<v Speaker 1>which we'll talk about by a good margin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So add,</v>

13
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>they're really had some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some smart things to say.</v>

14
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoni is the first one we're going to</v>

15
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>talk about day and next time I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about him in some ways</v>

16
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>indirectly because the best way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand healing is to show you what</v>

17
00:00:55.891 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>you do with his ideas rather than really</v>
<v Speaker 1>presenting the ideas themselves.</v>

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>But I can give you a bit of an overview.</v>

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.630
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that differentiates</v>

20
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>the depths psychologists from say</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior therapists and even from</v>

21
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>cognitive scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you might say in one way they're</v>

22
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>more mystical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means more from the romantic</v>

23
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the cognitive scientists in the</v>

24
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>behaviorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a temperamental split their</v>

25
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>aid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people who are high in openness</v>

26
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>and both Freud and young were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high in trade.</v>

27
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:38.811
<v Speaker 1>Openness are very interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of the imagination and the domain</v>

28
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>of fantasy because they have very active</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginations and they have very active</v>

29
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>fantasy lights and they're good</v>
<v Speaker 1>visualizers.</v>

30
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:47.120
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've noticed in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice,</v>

32
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>there's always been a joke about depth</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists that if you go see a</v>

33
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Friday and you have Freud and dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you go see a union,</v>

34
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>you have union dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose that means if you go to a</v>

35
00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>behavioral therapist that you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>any dreams at all.</v>

36
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>But I actually think there's some truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that because the more pragmatic</v>

37
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.280
<v Speaker 1>people that more practical people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to be attractive to therapists</v>

38
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>who deal with issues that have to do say</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the imagination and fantasy.</v>

39
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a natural parsing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I've noticed in my</v>

40
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:22.941
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that that people,</v>

41
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>so those would be open and creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

42
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a dream life.</v>

43
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>That big cries out to be interpreted in</v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural terms.</v>

44
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I've had clients number of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

45
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.640
<v Speaker 1>I have one right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

46
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.890
<v Speaker 1>it's his dream life is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's so remote.</v>

47
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 1>It's so rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's remarkable.</v>

48
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's a genius dreamer,</v>

49
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>every time he comes in and it's like he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has two dreams or three dreams,</v>

50
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>they're coherent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're complex sleep plotted,</v>

51
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>they're interesting and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they chart what's going on in his</v>

52
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>life and they tell him what he should</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

53
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

54
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone is like that.</v>

55
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I also have clients who never dreamed at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

56
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 1>And then I've also seen when I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>lectured to people,</v>

57
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I see this most particularly in medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>students cause I've lectured a bit to</v>

58
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>medical students is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe I'll do a seminar for the,</v>

59
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>for the medical students and tell them a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit about the symbols of</v>

60
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 1>transformation really because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in,</v>

61
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>first of all transforming because their</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical students and so you have to</v>

62
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>transform it into a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also of course they're helping</v>

63
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>people through transformations all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

64
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>often negative but not always soft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes positive because sometimes you</v>

65
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's useful possibly for them to</v>

66
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>understand those processes or deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally with the medical school</v>

67
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>students I do half lecture that's more</v>
<v Speaker 1>on like trade psychology,</v>

68
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>the more behavioral and half of it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more symbolic stuff,</v>

69
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:50.610
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of like this class is.</v>

70
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's always about half the</v>

71
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>medical students on whom the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic stuff just falls flat.</v>

72
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't,</v>

73
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>it's like talking about color that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are coming are blind.</v>

74
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.851
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

75
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:07.520
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about this a lot and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>really do think it's face to</v>

76
00:04:07.521 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>temperamental differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't,</v>

77
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 1>if you have an active fantasy life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have Mac and imagination and you're</v>

78
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:17.761
<v Speaker 1>a good visualizer and you dream a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's the sort of person you are.</v>

79
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're on the other end of the</v>

80
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be that you're very</v>

81
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

82
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>and very low in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also tends to make you more</v>

83
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>conservative in your political</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>

84
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then dream analysis is probably not for</v>

85
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because you're just not going to</v>

86
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 1>come up with that many dreams.</v>

87
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>And even if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you do,</v>

88
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.270
<v Speaker 1>they won't necessarily be informative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

89
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:49.240
<v Speaker 1>there's been a very long battle in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways in the psychological and</v>

90
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric community between people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>take different perspectives on how you</v>

91
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>might address psychological problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know if the,</v>

92
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.200
<v Speaker 1>the issue of tight has been thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>about seriously enough in that regard</v>

93
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.980
<v Speaker 1>because we're really only just starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand the dimensions,</v>

94
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>the actual dimensions of personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>

95
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>and to figure out what it means to be on</v>
<v Speaker 1>one end of say,</v>

96
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 1>openness and versus the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're intelligent,</v>

97
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>you can be intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not open.</v>

98
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Those are complicated people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got very analytical minds to make</v>

99
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>good lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like lawyers are often,</v>

100
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>and this is something you might think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about if you're planning to become a</v>

101
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:24.920
<v Speaker 1>lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

102
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>if you're high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad job for you.</v>

103
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>You will not be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to be really conscientious,</v>

104
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>like off the scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it helps to be disagreeable to so</v>

105
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>because if you're too agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're supposed to weigh in if</v>

106
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>you're a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I supposed to like nicely let the</v>

107
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:45.370
<v Speaker 1>other person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know you're supposed to fight</v>

108
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to be kind of fighting</v>

109
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're high in agreeableness than</v>

110
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a job that's kind of grates against</v>
<v Speaker 1>your temperament.</v>

111
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.560
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so young</v>

112
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>you work you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the best way to think about</v>

113
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 1>yoga is that he was a student of two</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

114
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>He was a student of Friedrich Nietzsche</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who was a student of Freud.</v>

115
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 1>And although the Friday ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they write the history of</v>

116
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:16.160
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pretty much portray young is up as</v>

117
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>like a derivative thinker of Freud.</v>

118
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the right way to think about is</v>

119
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.130
<v Speaker 1>positioning historically because in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways what,</v>

120
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.350
<v Speaker 1>what young was trying to do was to</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer the question that needs opposed</v>

121
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the 19th century because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that no one was trying to</v>

122
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>answer it was because he believed it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important question that had</v>

123
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>been posed at the end of the 19th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

124
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:42.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a famous quote by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

126
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've all heard it and that's</v>

127
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:45.780
<v Speaker 1>the boat that God is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

128
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.880
<v Speaker 1>but needs just said essentially was God</v>
<v Speaker 1>is dead and we have killed him.</v>

129
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a different idea and we'll never</v>
<v Speaker 1>find enough water to wash away the</v>

130
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it wasn't like a triumphal state,</v>

131
00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>but on each as part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though when you hear it quoted,</v>

132
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>you always hear it quoted that way.</v>

133
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a sort of victory</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>

134
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:04.671
<v Speaker 1>her dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 1>or something to celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what nature thought at all.</v>

136
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought all hell was going to break</v>

137
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:13.800
<v Speaker 1>loose because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he predicted as much like in the,</v>

138
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.750
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 1870 [inaudible].</v>

139
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean he predicted what was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in the 20th century with re it's</v>

140
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like uncanny.</v>

141
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of it because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature was one of these people like</v>

142
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>young who are very grounded in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

143
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep imaginations and so they get wind</v>

144
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>of the currents that are moving through</v>
<v Speaker 1>society long before normal people do.</v>

145
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine that in any given</v>
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

147
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 1>even within you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some of you guys who were living</v>

148
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 1>in like 50 years ago and there's some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you living now and there's somebody that</v>

149
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>you live in 50 years in the future.</v>

150
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginative versus how conservative you</v>

151
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's not like everyone develops at</v>

152
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same historical rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get people like Nicha for</v>

153
00:07:56.871 --> 00:07:58.010
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or dusty Yefsky,</v>

154
00:07:58.011 --> 00:07:59.930
<v Speaker 1>they're like a hundred years ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>

155
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:02.240
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't even know what to do with</v>

156
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But stendhal was like that too though.</v>

157
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.210
<v Speaker 1>The writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote the 1830s and he was convinced</v>

158
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>that he was a hundred years ahead of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

159
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 1>And stylistically that was probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>about right.</v>

160
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people who are profits regarded</v>

161
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>as profits in isn't say old testament</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

162
00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:20.630
<v Speaker 1>They were the same sort of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they had their ear to the</v>

163
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:25.160
<v Speaker 1>ground in a sense and they could tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was going on underneath everybody's</v>

164
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>facade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It echoed in them.</v>

165
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 1>And often as the stories go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure they have,</v>

166
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.710
<v Speaker 1>they have a mythological accuracy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

167
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 1>The people who are picking up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>underground currency indicating often</v>

168
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:43.490
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe felt absolutely compelled</v>
<v Speaker 1>even at the risk of their own skin to</v>

169
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>warn people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

170
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.080
<v Speaker 1>so navy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so young was definitely one of these</v>

171
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:50.810
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now this question,</v>

172
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:56.050
<v Speaker 1>God is dead and we have killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Led me to pose another question,</v>

173
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

174
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do to replace him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because need to believe.</v>

175
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 1>And I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was absolutely right about</v>

176
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see how it could be otherwise.</v>

177
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 1>He believed that the morality that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>

178
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:13.161
<v Speaker 1>Western society was predicated on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental axiom of divinity.</v>

179
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 1>And so like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as nature was concerned,</v>

180
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 1>the whole Corpus of morality was</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on there on that,</v>

181
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>that axiom being true or at least being</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted as true.</v>

182
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 1>And when that accident was knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 1>by saying that conflict between science</v>

183
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:30.090
<v Speaker 1>and religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in some sense that's what did</v>

184
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

185
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Then the whole system no longer had</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to stand on and could become</v>

186
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>entirely questionable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Nicha pointed that out.</v>

187
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 1>And then Dostoyevsky who was writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically at the same time said,</v>

188
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's no god than anything is</v>

189
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 1>permitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he meant by that was really,</v>

190
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he meant by that was morality turns</v>

191
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:56.271
<v Speaker 1>into what what you can get away with</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's nothing final about it.</v>

192
00:09:56.761 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing transcendent about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like we've played these problem own</v>

193
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.060
<v Speaker 1>intellectually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are still right in the middle</v>

194
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.680
<v Speaker 1>of this battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you know it or not.</v>

195
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happened in the 20th century was</v>

196
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:12.531
<v Speaker 1>that one of the consequences of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>loss of an UN fundamental underpinning</v>

197
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 1>led Europe to swing radically to</v>
<v Speaker 1>political extremes.</v>

198
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis were to think of that,</v>

199
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.130
<v Speaker 1>to think of the Nazis without thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that as it religious transformation</v>

200
00:10:23.131 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 1>is that's just not right.</v>

201
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.600
<v Speaker 1>It was religious transformation and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a good one.</v>

202
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.500
<v Speaker 1>So like it was a regression in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense too,</v>

203
00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:32.640
<v Speaker 1>to a morality that was way pre</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian.</v>

204
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't not good.</v>

205
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had the same,</v>

206
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 1>it was like the rise of the state as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative to God.</v>

207
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Well we s we saw what that produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It produced hundreds of millions of</v>

208
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:47.430
<v Speaker 1>painful deaths and it just about</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed the world.</v>

209
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.460
<v Speaker 1>So it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a bad problem.</v>

210
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.770
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we sort of skirted our way through</v>

211
00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:55.200
<v Speaker 1>that miraculously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 1>that all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think World War II came</v>

213
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:02.250
<v Speaker 1>to an end until 1980 1989 you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was the whole cold war</v>

214
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 1>period after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the Germans and the Japanese had</v>

215
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:08.160
<v Speaker 1>surrendered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean we just went from one war to</v>

216
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:10.410
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just went to another one that</v>

217
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>everyone was too afraid to fight.</v>

218
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 1>It was still a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

219
00:11:14.491 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 1>And that didn't end until 1989 first by</v>
<v Speaker 1>some miracle,</v>

220
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.790
<v Speaker 1>God only knows why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

221
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 1>it never degenerated into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thermonuclear exchange and then it was</v>

222
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:25.044
<v Speaker 1>close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

223
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 1>we just barely squeaked through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>

224
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:32.210
<v Speaker 1>there were two times during that period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in 1964 during the Cuban missile</v>

225
00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:36.360
<v Speaker 1>crisis where they had those buddy icbm</v>
<v Speaker 1>is primed.</v>

226
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.780
<v Speaker 1>And so the way they work with in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>control panel,</v>

227
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:44.550
<v Speaker 1>which kind of looked like a star trek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the old star Trek sets,</v>

228
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.480
<v Speaker 1>there'd be like a panel here and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a little place you can put a key and</v>

229
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.160
<v Speaker 1>about 20 feet over there and there'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>another guy with a key.</v>

230
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And if he turned his key and held it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 seconds at the same time,</v>

231
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 1>he turned his key and held it for 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

232
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Then the missile launched and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intercontinental ballistic missile is a</v>

233
00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:07.540
<v Speaker 1>bullet and I mean that technically it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a guided missile.</v>

234
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Once you launch it like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shoot a bullet,</v>

235
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.040
<v Speaker 1>it's gone and you don't get to tell the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullet to come back.</v>

236
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Once it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can turn around like a cruise</v>

237
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Speaker 1>missile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an intercontinental ballistic missile.</v>

238
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.530
<v Speaker 1>It goes where you aimed it and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to bring it back.</v>

239
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 1>And so during the Cuban missile crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the keys were in the locks.</v>

240
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 1>So we were 10 seconds away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

241
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a tight keyhole.</v>

242
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:36.420
<v Speaker 1>We've barely squeaked through that wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>and looks like by about 1989 then that</v>

243
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 1>collective consciousness or human would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the collective unconscious of the</v>

244
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:45.070
<v Speaker 1>human race had decided that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe having it all end in like</v>

245
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:49.960
<v Speaker 1>apocalyptic annihilation and wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily for the best.</v>

246
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:57.640
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because writers like</v>
<v Speaker 1>girth f he wrote Faust and faust as this</v>

247
00:12:57.641 --> 00:13:02.440
<v Speaker 1>tale of a man who makes a bet with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>devil so that he can acquire infinite</v>

248
00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:06.420
<v Speaker 1>knowledge essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the devil in faust is named</v>

249
00:13:06.421 --> 00:13:11.421
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles and dirt that was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to explain what human evil,</v>

250
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.210
<v Speaker 1>evil per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's motive was.</v>

251
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.240
<v Speaker 1>And he did a lovely job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so smart what he said and he said,</v>

252
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.030
<v Speaker 1>the devil is basic hypothesis and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course spirit,</v>

253
00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:27.031
<v Speaker 1>the expresses this and poetry is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is so unbearably cruel and random</v>

254
00:13:28.151 --> 00:13:32.590
<v Speaker 1>and tragic that it would be better if it</v>
<v Speaker 1>had never existed at all.</v>

255
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.380
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe me,</v>

256
00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:38.290
<v Speaker 1>there'll be times in your life where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that you know where something has</v>

257
00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:41.530
<v Speaker 1>just knocked you off your feet</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely on,</v>

258
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.440
<v Speaker 1>on just manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

259
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.600
<v Speaker 1>and that thought it will rise up.</v>

260
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 1>And like it's a compelling thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the thought that he</v>

261
00:13:49.841 --> 00:13:53.080
<v Speaker 1>would means we're wrestling with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we've been wrestling with it</v>

262
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:56.140
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't really vote on it until</v>

263
00:13:56.141 --> 00:13:59.620
<v Speaker 1>1989 you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and life barely one.</v>

264
00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:02.110
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life isn't troublesome businesses.</v>

265
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

266
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.080
<v Speaker 1>everyone asks himself now and then is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>their consciousness is worth the pain</v>

267
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.630
<v Speaker 1>while the answer that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you live.</v>

268
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.710
<v Speaker 1>That is the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

269
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.340
<v Speaker 1>that's a complicated answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just because you know that answer,</v>

270
00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:21.460
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that you know how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>live anyways.</v>

271
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.550
<v Speaker 1>What's happened since 1989 as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

272
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:28.510
<v Speaker 1>is that intellectuals who were often</v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed by the worst sorts of demons</v>

273
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.870
<v Speaker 1>because they actually think that their</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence can guide the property in,</v>

274
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.150
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like the complex moral landscape.</v>

275
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see most intellectuals,</v>

276
00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:40.770
<v Speaker 1>and this is certainly a case of most</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals in the universities in</v>

277
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the late 20th century,</v>

278
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.720
<v Speaker 1>they were committed marxists like way</v>
<v Speaker 1>past wouldn't intuitively,</v>

279
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell,</v>

280
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:50.860
<v Speaker 1>by 1955 he was a left winger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy.</v>

281
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.850
<v Speaker 1>He'd already figured out that whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going on in the Soviet Union was not</v>

282
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

283
00:14:57.111 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you had your eyes open,</v>

284
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you were done with that by you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years after World War II.</v>

285
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:05.720
<v Speaker 1>But people like Sean Paul Sartre were</v>
<v Speaker 1>members of the Communist Party way</v>

286
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:08.900
<v Speaker 1>longer than they had any ethical right</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever to be.</v>

287
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:09.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

288
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.310
<v Speaker 1>was it absolutely murderous philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

289
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but intellectuals toyed with that,</v>

290
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 1>they still toy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the universities,</v>

291
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except it's turned into postmodernism,</v>

292
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.870
<v Speaker 1>which has Marxism under a new guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:15:22.871 --> 00:15:27.871
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the postmodern thought is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only left wing disguised,</v>

294
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's also nihilistic.</v>

295
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually the other problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the death of God produces.</v>

296
00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:34.760
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

297
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a religious foundation.</v>

298
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any foundation under my</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet to buttress my moral claims or even</v>

299
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:46.010
<v Speaker 1>to sort of help me determine what life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is worth in the face of tragedy.</v>

300
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 1>So I need something to replace that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Poof,</v>

301
00:15:48.561 --> 00:15:51.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really bad replacement cause</v>

302
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.410
<v Speaker 1>if you think God's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you just try stellan on for try it</v>

303
00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.010
<v Speaker 1>on for size for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Mao as well,</v>

304
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hitler as well.</v>

305
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:04.841
<v Speaker 1>It's not like this was a phenomena that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was only linked to one say culture of</v>

306
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody became susceptible to it.</v>

307
00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:10.610
<v Speaker 1>And the same murderous thing happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time people try that.</v>

308
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.920
<v Speaker 1>So it was China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cambodia,</v>

309
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wherever the communists got into</v>

310
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 1>power man pit people died by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands.</v>

311
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.160
<v Speaker 1>So Paul Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who emptied the Cambodian cities</v>

312
00:16:22.161 --> 00:16:23.930
<v Speaker 1>had killed 7 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

313
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 3 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got his,</v>

314
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.340
<v Speaker 1>he got his graduate degree at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorbonne in France and he said what he</v>

315
00:16:31.341 --> 00:16:33.350
<v Speaker 1>was going to do when he went back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cambodia.</v>

316
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't outline the whole</v>

317
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.850
<v Speaker 1>murderousness element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he certainly had all the theory laid</v>

318
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:40.820
<v Speaker 1>down in his fine French academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

319
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we missed with ideas in the universities</v>

320
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.830
<v Speaker 1>and if we don't do it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people die.</v>

321
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.860
<v Speaker 1>It's important to get your ideas right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one answer to the death of God is</v>

322
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.280
<v Speaker 1>worshiped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worship the state,</v>

323
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.710
<v Speaker 1>the other is doership nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

324
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.920
<v Speaker 1>it's nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no distinction between anything</v>

325
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.190
<v Speaker 1>and everything is pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there,</v>

326
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:05.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a massive strain of that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>underground theorizing in postmodernism</v>

327
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.000
<v Speaker 1>and a psychoanalyst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a union,</v>

328
00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:13.001
<v Speaker 1>would look at the postmodern response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is nihilistic and the fascist</v>

329
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:17.030
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of recourse to the state</v>

330
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 1>as motivated by something even deeper</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

331
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's the sort of process that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nisha was describing now for young is he</v>

332
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 1>wrote a book called Ion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

333
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:28.820
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to have nightmares for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your life,</v>

334
00:17:28.821 --> 00:17:31.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good book to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

335
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 1>it's that book just terrified me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

336
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:39.860
<v Speaker 1>what he did in that book basically was</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate the fantasy that he believed</v>

337
00:17:39.861 --> 00:17:44.420
<v Speaker 1>that all of Western civilization had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been predicated on for the last 4,000</v>

338
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:48.920
<v Speaker 1>years now because you really believed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what drove human beings,</v>

339
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:54.160
<v Speaker 1>and it's a Piagetian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's some weird ways was the revelation</v>

340
00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:00.020
<v Speaker 1>of the success of unconscious revelation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fantasies were at the forefront of</v>

341
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.610
<v Speaker 1>our movement into unknown territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like there's unknown territory</v>

342
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.510
<v Speaker 1>and then there is known territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's this weird intermediaries</v>

343
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 1>space between them and that intermediary</v>
<v Speaker 1>space where you kind of know but kind of</v>

344
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:14.580
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

345
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.580
<v Speaker 1>That's where your imagination place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's the case,</v>

346
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you encounter something and</v>

347
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:21.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't really don't know much about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

348
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.690
<v Speaker 1>you imagine what it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it takes on the structures of</v>

349
00:18:24.691 --> 00:18:27.570
<v Speaker 1>your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense what you're dealing</v>

350
00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:31.020
<v Speaker 1>with as you move through history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you expand your domain of knowledge into</v>

351
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:35.310
<v Speaker 1>the unknown is you encounter your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of the seat anyways,</v>

352
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.130
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could read like volume nine and</v>

353
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine one and nine,</v>

354
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:43.470
<v Speaker 1>two of you once called archetypes of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>collective unconscious and the other's</v>

355
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 1>called ion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like it'll take you a while to crack</v>

356
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:47.850
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to beat your head against those</v>

357
00:18:47.851 --> 00:18:51.270
<v Speaker 1>folks quite a bit because what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what young is outlining in some sense,</v>

358
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.810
<v Speaker 1>so shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible to grasp once you</v>

359
00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:55.710
<v Speaker 1>get the picture.</v>

360
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.010
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden things flipped around</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you understand what he's talking</v>

361
00:18:59.011 --> 00:19:00.130
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before then,</v>

362
00:19:00.131 --> 00:19:00.481
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

363
00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:01.770
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough going.</v>

364
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.700
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because you who has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

365
00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:09.410
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy named Richard Nole who</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a biography of yoga.</v>

366
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 1>He was a jealous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was crooked too,</v>

367
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:17.991
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>his book was called the area in Christ</v>

368
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:22.560
<v Speaker 1>and he used like Nazi imagery on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cover and it was his publisher that</v>

369
00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:24.900
<v Speaker 1>talked him into doing that because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought the book would sell more.</v>

370
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't do that well,</v>

371
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.690
<v Speaker 1>or if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that indicates really what you're up to,</v>

372
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the,</v>

373
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.220
<v Speaker 1>because of what you're willing to allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen to your work.</v>

374
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:40.410
<v Speaker 1>So anybody who would have thought about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't have used Nazi imagery to</v>

375
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 1>gain economic utility out of writing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism of young,</v>

376
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.930
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

377
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a crooked maneuver.</v>

378
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.410
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

379
00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's he up to?</v>

380
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Why is he doing this now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youngest being sold,</v>

381
00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:54.690
<v Speaker 1>he accused you in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

382
00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 1>of basically starting a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can understand that.</v>

383
00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:02.820
<v Speaker 1>But what I found so amusing about Noah's</v>
<v Speaker 1>book is that what Yoga was actually up</v>

384
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:07.821
<v Speaker 1>to was so much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much more terrifying than a mere</v>

385
00:20:08.911 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Speaker 1>cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was sort of like accusing a,</v>

386
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a serial killer of stealing a loaf</v>

387
00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:15.810
<v Speaker 1>of bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

388
00:20:15.811 --> 00:20:17.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe he stole a loaf of bread,</v>

389
00:20:17.371 --> 00:20:19.440
<v Speaker 1>but compared to what he was actually up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

390
00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:21.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really not relevant.</v>

391
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.520
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ewan was trying to bring the primordial</v>

392
00:20:26.521 --> 00:20:30.690
<v Speaker 1>imagination back into the world and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make people conscious of it,</v>

393
00:20:30.691 --> 00:20:32.110
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whew,</v>

394
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.750
<v Speaker 1>that's something that really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really something.</v>

395
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:41.220
<v Speaker 1>So that reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read everything you wrote except the</v>

396
00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:45.270
<v Speaker 1>books that were published after his</v>
<v Speaker 1>collected works.</v>

397
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I read some of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took me a long time and it just tore</v>

398
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:51.430
<v Speaker 1>me into bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't know what the hell,</v>

399
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 1>which way was up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Halfway through those books,</v>

400
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>niche is bad enough because Nietzsche</v>

401
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.710
<v Speaker 1>will set out to destroy your</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>

402
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.600
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a client right now who's being</v>

403
00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 1>left late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed for five years because he</v>

404
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:07.830
<v Speaker 1>wasn't particularly educated and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 1>he started reading nature and he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a Christian and he thought,</v>

406
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:11.591
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Christian.</v>

407
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:13.360
<v Speaker 1>I can take on each end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

408
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.253
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

409
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't like leach.</v>

410
00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Who was so smart that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mind boggling.</v>

411
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:25.360
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came up with the best narcissistic</v>

412
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:27.490
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's ever been written.</v>

413
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.790
<v Speaker 1>And this is when he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he,</v>

414
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.920
<v Speaker 1>he was very sick man and he could only</v>
<v Speaker 1>great for very short periods of time.</v>

415
00:21:32.921 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 1>So we try to cram everything he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a single sentence.</v>

416
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.900
<v Speaker 1>And so each sentence is like little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb.</v>

417
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.520
<v Speaker 1>One of his now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd write something self</v>

418
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.020
<v Speaker 1>referential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one phrase of his is,</v>

419
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:48.190
<v Speaker 1>I write more in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write in a sentence what other people</v>

420
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.600
<v Speaker 1>write in a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

421
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a good bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he talked it right away after</v>

422
00:21:54.101 --> 00:21:56.860
<v Speaker 1>he said what other people can't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>write in a book.</v>

423
00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

424
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Narcissism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like he just punched through</v>

425
00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:06.190
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's true.</v>

426
00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

427
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.990
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't narcissism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for anyone else,</v>

428
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.450
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean for him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just true.</v>

429
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.510
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

430
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.220
<v Speaker 1>So back to human</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

431
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.450
<v Speaker 1>sort of hypothesize that in order for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to overcome the psychological</v>

432
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:28.600
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the destruction of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious underpinnings,</v>

433
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.310
<v Speaker 1>they would have to transform themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>into virtually into the thing that they</v>

434
00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:35.530
<v Speaker 1>had killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So natures,</v>

435
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.510
<v Speaker 1>and this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me for nature,</v>

436
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.100
<v Speaker 1>this was like a revelatory solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came up with this in a book called</v>

437
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.400
<v Speaker 1>bus fakes there too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stroke.</v>

438
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Now everybody who reads nature starts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

439
00:22:44.921 --> 00:22:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Thus there's is there a booster because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got such a cool title,</v>

440
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:50.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't read that book,</v>

441
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.970
<v Speaker 1>at least not until you've read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say beyond good and evil and other books</v>

442
00:22:54.971 --> 00:22:57.820
<v Speaker 1>that he wrote because thus fakes there a</v>
<v Speaker 1>booster is a weird book.</v>

443
00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like the old testament revelation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really is,</v>

444
00:23:00.701 --> 00:23:03.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This man comes down from the mountain</v>

445
00:23:03.761 --> 00:23:08.761
<v Speaker 1>and he starts to spout off like poetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>revelations and niches.</v>

446
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:13.780
<v Speaker 1>The rest of each punks are like very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very clear and cutting thought,</v>

447
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.800
<v Speaker 1>where's this one is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a Shakespearean drama almost.</v>

448
00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:19.840
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because</v>

449
00:23:19.841 --> 00:23:24.160
<v Speaker 1>nature was reaching beyond the grip of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his intellect to try to formulate</v>

450
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:28.270
<v Speaker 1>answers to questions that he could not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could not grasp because what he was</v>

451
00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:30.400
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

452
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:32.920
<v Speaker 1>as human beings have developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitively,</v>

453
00:23:32.921 --> 00:23:35.920
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've escaped from our culture and our</v>

454
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:40.600
<v Speaker 1>instincts and when we're embedded in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and our instincts were invented</v>

455
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.880
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously within a religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>framework.</v>

456
00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:46.430
<v Speaker 1>It's the framework of presuppositions</v>
<v Speaker 1>from which we emerged.</v>

457
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Like people didn't think up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>

458
00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.080
<v Speaker 1>what he has is there some little weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

459
00:23:51.081 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Speaker 1>what we call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy going on for 3000 years.</v>

460
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.363
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

461
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not about power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it can be twisted to be</v>

462
00:23:58.491 --> 00:24:01.190
<v Speaker 1>about power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything can be or twist it to be</v>

463
00:24:01.191 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 1>about economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about fantasy.</v>

464
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:08.000
<v Speaker 1>You know that all that you look inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>here at the cathedral,</v>

465
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.400
<v Speaker 1>all you see is fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in,</v>

466
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.550
<v Speaker 1>it's in brilliant lights portrayed</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

467
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.820
<v Speaker 1>It's trying to say something to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

468
00:24:16.821 --> 00:24:17.900
<v Speaker 1>what's it trying to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

469
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 1>it turned out when people ask themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>that instead of just acting it out,</v>

470
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.720
<v Speaker 1>they hadn't got a clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it said,</v>

471
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea what it said any more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys know why you have Christmas</v>

472
00:24:27.621 --> 00:24:30.470
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you have Christmas trees?</v>

473
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

474
00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

475
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.680
<v Speaker 1>I never noticed we had Christmas trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

476
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point is,</v>

477
00:24:38.181 --> 00:24:41.000
<v Speaker 1>my point is that in a culture you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow,</v>

478
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.910
<v Speaker 1>you follow the customs because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do.</v>

479
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you wake up a bit and just</v>

480
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:46.310
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

481
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:51.310
<v Speaker 1>you're just like the Ph Jedi and child</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is taken out of the game and forced</v>

482
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:52.370
<v Speaker 1>to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

483
00:24:52.371 --> 00:24:53.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you playing that game and what</v>

484
00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:54.890
<v Speaker 1>are the rules?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

485
00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I'd never thought about it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

486
00:24:56.961 --> 00:25:00.230
<v Speaker 1>as soon as people started to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the games they were playing,</v>

487
00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.560
<v Speaker 1>it was often because they encountered</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people who thought apparently</v>

488
00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:04.700
<v Speaker 1>thought differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

489
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.360
<v Speaker 1>So if you're like a Rottie Christian and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd go into the east and all of a</v>

490
00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:11.000
<v Speaker 1>sudden you've come up with a Buddhist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's smart.</v>

491
00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:13.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like you to have big problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

492
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're smart and he's smart and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think the same way.</v>

493
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:18.650
<v Speaker 1>At least apparently you don't think the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way at all.</v>

494
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.010
<v Speaker 1>So even if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well who was Buddhist?</v>

495
00:25:22.011 --> 00:25:23.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should just wipe them out.</v>

496
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:28.070
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter because their thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 1>are already there and they've been</v>

497
00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:31.970
<v Speaker 1>working on them for like a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand years and whether you like it</v>

498
00:25:31.971 --> 00:25:34.130
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to make you think.</v>

499
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:36.680
<v Speaker 1>And once you start thinking about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

500
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.800
<v Speaker 1>you're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the situation we're in</v>

501
00:25:39.801 --> 00:25:43.700
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So young took this problem that needs</v>

502
00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you to had posed seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause young was caught up quite</v>

503
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:50.330
<v Speaker 1>dramatically in the events of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

504
00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.520
<v Speaker 1>of Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

505
00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 1>when we think about Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think of course that it was perfectly</v>

506
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:59.780
<v Speaker 1>obvious that the Nazis were the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were the perpetrators and that,</v>

507
00:25:59.781 --> 00:26:01.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else was the victim.</v>

508
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.190
<v Speaker 1>And that if we were there we would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly seen that and we wouldn't have</v>

509
00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:06.200
<v Speaker 1>be Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like that's not true.</v>

510
00:26:06.201 --> 00:26:09.140
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how it worked because these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things happen slowly.</v>

511
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.880
<v Speaker 1>They sorta happened piece by piece.</v>

512
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:12.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started seeing a similar thing</v>

513
00:26:12.861 --> 00:26:17.450
<v Speaker 1>happened I think after the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the twin towers fell in New York,</v>

514
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:19.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like people gave up five,</v>

515
00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:22.760
<v Speaker 1>10% of their civil liberties in like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>

516
00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

517
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was okay.</v>

518
00:26:27.801 --> 00:26:30.200
<v Speaker 1>It was like wasn't okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't okay.</v>

519
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.310
<v Speaker 1>And it just shows you how easy that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing can,</v>

520
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.680
<v Speaker 1>can start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

521
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:37.580
<v Speaker 1>the Germans were under tremendous stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 1930s their whole economy blew</v>

522
00:26:37.581 --> 00:26:39.860
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to like take,</v>

523
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:43.710
<v Speaker 1>we'll book barrels full of billions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>marks to buy a piece of bread.</v>

524
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 1>The currency fell to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unemployment was staggeringly high.</v>

525
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:49.920
<v Speaker 1>They were paying off debts like mad</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the first world war.</v>

526
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Speaker 1>And there was a real threat that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>communists were going to start a</v>

527
00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:55.080
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't have problems like</v>

528
00:26:55.081 --> 00:26:59.550
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Germans had no idea what to do,</v>

529
00:26:59.580 --> 00:26:59.850
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

530
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.480
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hitler was a canny canny person with</v>

531
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:06.360
<v Speaker 1>a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant sense of drama.</v>

532
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a real,</v>

533
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 1>he was a master of dark fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>

534
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:13.680
<v Speaker 1>And I think his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his unconscious fantasy was,</v>

535
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.250
<v Speaker 1>let's see how much we could destroy</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we die in the,</v>

536
00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.440
<v Speaker 1>in the what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Purifying flames.</v>

537
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.510
<v Speaker 1>That was Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

538
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.740
<v Speaker 1>and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

539
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:27.540
<v Speaker 1>he was a compelling person and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy that he added the back of his</v>

540
00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:29.250
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you how that developed at one</v>

541
00:27:29.251 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very hard thing to escape from</v>

542
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:36.750
<v Speaker 1>and that's why the Germans became Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like this was like magic that</v>

543
00:27:36.751 --> 00:27:41.751
<v Speaker 1>had emerged and it was black magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So young was very interested in this</v>

544
00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:46.470
<v Speaker 1>because he was in the Germanic speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas of the world when this happened</v>

545
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:49.110
<v Speaker 1>and he fell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt himself pulled very strongly by</v>

546
00:27:49.111 --> 00:27:52.500
<v Speaker 1>what the Nazis were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the early stages of the</v>

547
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:56.550
<v Speaker 1>development of the political platform</v>
<v Speaker 1>because things did stabilize,</v>

548
00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they stabilize before they went</v>

549
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:00.870
<v Speaker 1>completely out of control.</v>

550
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:05.460
<v Speaker 1>And of course looking in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the seeds of what eventually</v>

551
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.360
<v Speaker 1>transpired to become such a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the time it was by no means self</v>

552
00:28:10.361 --> 00:28:12.660
<v Speaker 1>evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a thing was going to occur,</v>

553
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.900
<v Speaker 1>especially given all the other horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that were likely to occur.</v>

554
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:21.000
<v Speaker 1>So you only had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a vision at one point in on the</v>

555
00:28:21.001 --> 00:28:23.460
<v Speaker 1>train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in Switzerland that</v>

556
00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Europe had become so covered with blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the blood was starting to flow over</v>

557
00:28:27.991 --> 00:28:31.110
<v Speaker 1>the mountains into Switzerland because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course Switzerland is neutral and he</v>

558
00:28:31.111 --> 00:28:33.450
<v Speaker 1>said it was one of the most horrifying</v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmares of his life.</v>

559
00:28:33.451 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Speaker 1>And this was in I think 1930 it was late</v>
<v Speaker 1>late 1930s anyway,</v>

560
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:42.771
<v Speaker 1>so it was a premonition of war and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he spent a lot of time</v>

561
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:49.680
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand well if you going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become a fascist and worship the</v>

562
00:28:49.681 --> 00:28:52.770
<v Speaker 1>state and you weren't going to become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilist and worship nothing,</v>

563
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.090
<v Speaker 1>what in the world where you going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the Orient Yourself and how</v>

564
00:28:57.091 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 1>would you protect yourself against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractions of blind state</v>

565
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:02.700
<v Speaker 1>identification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

566
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.890
<v Speaker 1>or the attractions of nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

567
00:29:04.891 --> 00:29:07.260
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well nihilism has no traction at all</v>

568
00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:09.540
<v Speaker 1>because it says to you everything is</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>

569
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Nothing you do has any importance cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nihilistic basically.</v>

570
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.913
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

571
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.170
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalyst would say,</v>

572
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.140
<v Speaker 1>what's the secondary gain from that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

573
00:29:19.141 --> 00:29:20.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do say that's what you believe.</v>

574
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:23.370
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you even knocked it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you also say,</v>

575
00:29:23.371 --> 00:29:25.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've come to that conclusion through,</v>

576
00:29:25.501 --> 00:29:27.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rational process of deliberation at</v>

577
00:29:27.991 --> 00:29:32.160
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalyst would say it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>convenient that that also alleviates you</v>

578
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:34.230
<v Speaker 1>of all responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

579
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:39.540
<v Speaker 1>And it kind of sheds a little dampness</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your plane to pristine cognition as</v>

580
00:29:39.541 --> 00:29:41.280
<v Speaker 1>the driving force between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

581
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.990
<v Speaker 1>behind your adoption of that theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

582
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:46.570
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the Patriot who claims that,</v>

583
00:29:46.571 --> 00:29:48.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that he's kicking someone in</v>

584
00:29:48.251 --> 00:29:50.410
<v Speaker 1>the head is because he's patriotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

585
00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:50.921
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

586
00:29:50.921 --> 00:29:53.230
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're patriotic so that you can kick</v>

587
00:29:53.231 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 1>someone in the head and still look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the mirror in the morning,</v>

588
00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.110
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to do with rational</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberation.</v>

589
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.860
<v Speaker 1>And so the psychoanalysts and human was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this in particular,</v>

590
00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always extremely skeptical about</v>

591
00:30:05.441 --> 00:30:08.680
<v Speaker 1>people's rational claims about their</v>
<v Speaker 1>commitments to ideology.</v>

592
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:12.190
<v Speaker 1>And rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you said lawfully.</v>

593
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:16.390
<v Speaker 1>He said some things that were so</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant was that people didn't have</v>

594
00:30:16.391 --> 00:30:18.460
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ideas have people.</v>

595
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.440
<v Speaker 1>And when you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>

596
00:30:20.441 --> 00:30:21.280
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

597
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I think this is so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Dawkins idea of the meme,</v>

598
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:25.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you,</v>

599
00:30:25.841 --> 00:30:27.490
<v Speaker 1>how many of you read Dawkins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

600
00:30:27.491 --> 00:30:28.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

601
00:30:28.481 --> 00:30:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So dawkins has this idea of mean so</v>

602
00:30:31.301 --> 00:30:35.050
<v Speaker 1>funny to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkens cause it's like 20% of the way</v>

603
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:37.330
<v Speaker 1>to being a union without even knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

604
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.640
<v Speaker 1>And so he's produced this idea called</v>
<v Speaker 1>meme,</v>

605
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:41.920
<v Speaker 1>which is these I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ideas,</v>

606
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean is an idea that sort of has an</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent existence in a sense because</v>

607
00:30:45.731 --> 00:30:49.690
<v Speaker 1>it can affect different minds are moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>from mine to mine and he kind of thinks</v>

608
00:30:49.691 --> 00:30:50.980
<v Speaker 1>of it more like a fab.</v>

609
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 1>While the archetypes are means except</v>
<v Speaker 1>there no fats,</v>

610
00:30:55.870 --> 00:31:00.850
<v Speaker 1>they're memes that have lasted for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000 years or maybe 20 million years.</v>

611
00:31:00.851 --> 00:31:05.440
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea how old they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And young got where Dawkins was going,</v>

612
00:31:05.441 --> 00:31:06.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

613
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.970
<v Speaker 1>50 years before and 200 stories deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's so funny to read Dawkins because</v>

614
00:31:13.661 --> 00:31:16.360
<v Speaker 1>what he is searching for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has already been figured out by</v>

615
00:31:16.361 --> 00:31:18.550
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's so prejudiced against any kind</v>

616
00:31:18.551 --> 00:31:21.040
<v Speaker 1>of religious thinking that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>way he'll ever find it.</v>

617
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:27.700
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you did was he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's deeply,</v>

618
00:31:27.701 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 1>deeply study the substructures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

619
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:32.430
<v Speaker 1>So for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

620
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.520
<v Speaker 1>when we talked about piaget a bit and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>said for piaget,</v>

621
00:31:36.521 --> 00:31:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you kind of built your brain from your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body upward.</v>

622
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so smart,</v>

623
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.400
<v Speaker 1>but you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll has a lot of piaget in him it's,</v>

624
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:45.370
<v Speaker 1>it's more implicit.</v>

625
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.410
<v Speaker 1>But for young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only was your</v>

626
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.670
<v Speaker 1>sub structures of your thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological and so therefore based in</v>

627
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.950
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your body was also cultural and</v>

628
00:31:56.951 --> 00:32:00.430
<v Speaker 1>historical and also partly because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

629
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.730
<v Speaker 1>you're an evolved creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So God only knows what's in there.</v>

630
00:32:03.731 --> 00:32:08.290
<v Speaker 1>3.5 billion years worth of weirdness</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can draw on or that can,</v>

631
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.170
<v Speaker 1>that can move you where it wants to move</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

632
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:14.890
<v Speaker 1>But I'll also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being shaped by cultural dynamics</v>

633
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:17.380
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And human beings in particular,</v>

634
00:32:17.381 --> 00:32:21.790
<v Speaker 1>like we're just watching each other like</v>
<v Speaker 1>mad all the time to see what we're up</v>

635
00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:23.380
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people think of us,</v>

636
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:25.930
<v Speaker 1>how we should behaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we being boring?</v>

637
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Are People attracted to us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're social right to the core</v>

638
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.470
<v Speaker 1>and that's another way that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand an archetype.</v>

639
00:32:32.471 --> 00:32:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like part of the archetype is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are social to the core,</v>

640
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.040
<v Speaker 1>so we're interested in other people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more if you're extroverted and less if</v>

641
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.960
<v Speaker 1>you're introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter by the standards</v>

642
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:44.390
<v Speaker 1>of say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solitary animals.</v>

643
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:46.580
<v Speaker 1>We're so social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just unbelievable.</v>

644
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.400
<v Speaker 1>And so that's built in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's built in.</v>

645
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:52.490
<v Speaker 1>What's built in is that you find that</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

646
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The archetype is whatever it is that</v>

647
00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 1>makes you find that interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beyond your control.</v>

648
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interested in people.</v>

649
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.930
<v Speaker 1>You didn't decide that it decided it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

650
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.510
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

651
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your brain,</v>

652
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.380
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your limbic system.</v>

653
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:14.780
<v Speaker 1>One of the hell back means like we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what that means.</v>

654
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.100
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

655
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:18.560
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea how your brain produces</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

656
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious.</v>

657
00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:23.650
<v Speaker 1>We haven't got a clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that indicates to me,</v>

658
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.990
<v Speaker 1>since we've been hacking away at it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>say 400 years,</v>

659
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:32.090
<v Speaker 1>is that the way we think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is wrong because we're not</v>

660
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 1>getting anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we'd go a long ways with lots of</v>

661
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:35.444
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

662
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.430
<v Speaker 1>We're not getting anywhere with</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

663
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back to the archetypes.</v>

664
00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.180
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I can tell you how these things</v>

665
00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:44.660
<v Speaker 1>arise to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're interested in other people say</v>

666
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.890
<v Speaker 1>and so you're interested in them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're unbelievably useful resources,</v>

667
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:50.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they don't think they have</v>

668
00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:54.440
<v Speaker 1>resources that you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus he won even subtle things from</v>

669
00:33:54.441 --> 00:33:55.510
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want their attention,</v>

670
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.720
<v Speaker 1>you want to play with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

671
00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.240
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of things that you</v>

672
00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.000
<v Speaker 1>need and want from other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the social interactions are</v>

673
00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:06.260
<v Speaker 1>incredibly valuable and informative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the information is interesting</v>

674
00:34:06.261 --> 00:34:11.261
<v Speaker 1>because part of what every single person</v>
<v Speaker 1>is constantly broadcasting every other's</v>

675
00:34:11.781 --> 00:34:16.781
<v Speaker 1>person is how to behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now if you meet someone and,</v>

676
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.140
<v Speaker 1>and let's say you find them interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I can tell you that</v>

677
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:26.720
<v Speaker 1>the more ideal they are assuming you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to work,</v>

678
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.980
<v Speaker 1>the more ideal they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you've got to be interested in</v>

679
00:34:30.981 --> 00:34:33.440
<v Speaker 1>them because that actually is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>defines ideal.</v>

680
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Like as you become my heel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say that it's also the same as</v>

681
00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:39.380
<v Speaker 1>becoming high status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you become ideal,</v>

682
00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:44.590
<v Speaker 1>then you're interesting to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's interesting because that what</v>

683
00:34:45.351 --> 00:34:49.310
<v Speaker 1>that means is that you can read off</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's interest to find out when</v>

684
00:34:49.311 --> 00:34:52.490
<v Speaker 1>you're deviating from the ideal and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even know what the ideal is.</v>

685
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:57.500
<v Speaker 1>The ideal is that to which their</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention is an EXEC inexhaustibly drawn</v>

686
00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:02.660
<v Speaker 1>and they're always telling you when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should fall short of the ideal always.</v>

687
00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.820
<v Speaker 1>It's being broadcast at you all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

688
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:08.930
<v Speaker 1>And then your imagination back there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try and figure out just what is this</v>

689
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:09.980
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

690
00:35:09.981 --> 00:35:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Because your imagination is watching you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a phd had sense,</v>

691
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.580
<v Speaker 1>noticing what you do and then trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what that is.</v>

692
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:21.530
<v Speaker 1>So you'll have fantasies about the ideal</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that often happens in a romantic</v>

693
00:35:21.531 --> 00:35:23.390
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at the beginning of it,</v>

694
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:27.020
<v Speaker 1>cause you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you project your idealization onto the</v>

695
00:35:27.021 --> 00:35:28.790
<v Speaker 1>person that you're romantically</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to.</v>

696
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:32.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the projection of an archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So young would say the woman will</v>

697
00:35:32.781 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 1>project an animus onto the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animus is her conceptualization of</v>

698
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.790
<v Speaker 1>the ideal man is it's unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's rooted in fantasy and the</v>

699
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:45.990
<v Speaker 1>man will be in concordance with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>projection in some areas that's,</v>

700
00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:48.000
<v Speaker 1>those are the areas where she likes him</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

701
00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:52.170
<v Speaker 1>And we'll be discordant in other areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the areas where she</v>

702
00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:55.710
<v Speaker 1>constantly did disappoints him as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship develops.</v>

703
00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:01.260
<v Speaker 1>So their projection is there in part to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help the person to understand who it is</v>

704
00:36:01.261 --> 00:36:03.360
<v Speaker 1>that they're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you meet someone,</v>

705
00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:05.550
<v Speaker 1>you have to pee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to assume something about them.</v>

706
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.500
<v Speaker 1>It's the same as projection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to assume something about the</v>

707
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.170
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you find that fascinating,</v>

708
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:11.790
<v Speaker 1>which is what happens if you fall in</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

709
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:14.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because they smell good or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're symmetrical or something,</v>

710
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.110
<v Speaker 1>you immediately assume that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

711
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:17.190
<v Speaker 1>those things really mattered.</v>

712
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 1>You immediately assume that they embody</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideal.</v>

713
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.990
<v Speaker 1>It's an oversimplification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but oversimplification has a basis and</v>

714
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:27.540
<v Speaker 1>the basis is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's interesting to me,</v>

715
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.700
<v Speaker 1>it must be close to the ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

716
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:31.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the person that you're going out</v>

717
00:36:31.831 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 1>with the to is warped and Benton flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twisted,</v>

718
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:38.760
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 ways and you'll find that out soon</v>

719
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:42.510
<v Speaker 1>enough just as they will about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that often just blows the</v>

720
00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:44.550
<v Speaker 1>relationship into fits because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person will say,</v>

721
00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't who I thought she was like,</v>

722
00:36:47.431 --> 00:36:49.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who said whoever sends she was who you</v>

723
00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:51.270
<v Speaker 1>thought she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

724
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:54.450
<v Speaker 1>where did you get the misapprehension</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she was going to be who you thought</v>

725
00:36:54.451 --> 00:36:55.710
<v Speaker 1>she was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

726
00:36:55.711 --> 00:36:57.360
<v Speaker 1>why don't you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

727
00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:01.200
<v Speaker 1>here's let alone your lending referred</v>
<v Speaker 1>by your sense of smell and your ability</v>

728
00:37:01.201 --> 00:37:02.880
<v Speaker 1>to detect symmetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

729
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not very sophisticated.</v>

730
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:08.010
<v Speaker 1>So those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>

731
00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:12.120
<v Speaker 1>so the adamant ananymous are two primary</v>
<v Speaker 1>human archetypes and they're very</v>

732
00:37:12.121 --> 00:37:15.510
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that kind of gets at the surface the</v>

733
00:37:15.511 --> 00:37:20.511
<v Speaker 1>ideal that I was describing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people are broadcasting information</v>

734
00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:24.080
<v Speaker 1>to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the ideal bid will be ideal and</v>

735
00:37:24.081 --> 00:37:27.030
<v Speaker 1>it's like be my ideal obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's say,</v>

736
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:32.270
<v Speaker 1>let's say if if I took a thousand ideals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then average them or extracted out</v>

737
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.690
<v Speaker 1>the common ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideal of what was common to all of</v>

738
00:37:36.691 --> 00:37:38.670
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a savior figures.</v>

739
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:42.780
<v Speaker 1>That's what a savior figure is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then now,</v>

740
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:47.810
<v Speaker 1>now and then someone comes along who</v>
<v Speaker 1>acts quite a bit like that at booth</v>

741
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.550
<v Speaker 1>you've got yourself a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't be thinking that these images</v>

742
00:37:53.551 --> 00:37:57.570
<v Speaker 1>that people fall around like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know like what blood hounds on</v>

743
00:37:57.571 --> 00:37:59.610
<v Speaker 1>the trail do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be thinking that those</v>

744
00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:02.220
<v Speaker 1>things are like conscious cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructs.</v>

745
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.340
<v Speaker 1>It's like conscious cognitive constructs</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Marxism.</v>

746
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:11.070
<v Speaker 1>They last like 50 years and they kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 million people and then that's the</v>

747
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:14.670
<v Speaker 1>end of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good religious system,</v>

748
00:38:14.671 --> 00:38:16.230
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll keep the culture going for like</v>

749
00:38:16.231 --> 00:38:18.810
<v Speaker 1>3000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even at the end of it,</v>

750
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.510
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that the story of horace and no</v>

751
00:38:21.511 --> 00:38:22.620
<v Speaker 1>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

752
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:26.520
<v Speaker 1>drove Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Catholicism drove Europe for like</v>

753
00:38:26.521 --> 00:38:29.040
<v Speaker 1>3000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a long time.</v>

754
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.400
<v Speaker 1>And then it turned into Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds like it disappeared</v>

755
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.260
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of transmuted into Judaism and</v>

756
00:38:35.261 --> 00:38:39.010
<v Speaker 1>then turned into Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like the idea is disappear.</v>

757
00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.800
<v Speaker 1>They can disappear at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>

758
00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:45.850
<v Speaker 1>you're just as possessed by them as any</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Egyptian.</v>

759
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:49.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just that you're more of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragmented and conflict because what</v>

760
00:38:49.271 --> 00:38:52.510
<v Speaker 1>your unconscious assumes and what your</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious mind assumes aren't the same</v>

761
00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:53.261
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're like,</v>

762
00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:57.130
<v Speaker 1>you're all at war with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as part of what makes you attracted</v>

763
00:38:57.131 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 1>to like more on etiologies.</v>

764
00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.710
<v Speaker 1>By which I mean any of the Ology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're all,</v>

765
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:06.310
<v Speaker 1>they're all false idols and false gods</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's shallow,</v>

766
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.940
<v Speaker 1>they're shallow and deadly and they ruin</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

767
00:39:09.941 --> 00:39:14.740
<v Speaker 1>They destroy your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's just a catastrophic response</v>

768
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.250
<v Speaker 1>and that's why it's so terrible to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that discordance between your</v>

769
00:39:18.251 --> 00:39:22.060
<v Speaker 1>instinctual being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your deep instinctual b and your little</v>

770
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:23.080
<v Speaker 1>fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

771
00:39:23.081 --> 00:39:26.350
<v Speaker 1>halfway that conscious mind that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks it's in control.</v>

772
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're not in control of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

773
00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Leave me best you can do is follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's right.</v>

774
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:34.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the best you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

775
00:39:34.481 --> 00:39:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we even know this neurologically to some</v>

776
00:39:36.431 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at the hypothalamus,</v>

777
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a little part of the brain we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about quite a bit.</v>

778
00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:46.360
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of where the Freud Freud and</v>
<v Speaker 1>resides to the degree that it resides</v>

779
00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:48.700
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this collection of nuclei that do</v>

780
00:39:48.701 --> 00:39:52.240
<v Speaker 1>things like make you hungry or make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirsty or make you,</v>

781
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually desirous or um,</v>

782
00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:02.360
<v Speaker 1>make you defensively impressive or make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you terrified of an intruder who,</v>

783
00:40:02.361 --> 00:40:04.840
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who threatens your dominant status.</v>

784
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:06.340
<v Speaker 1>It's this little tiny part of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

785
00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:10.720
<v Speaker 1>It's hardly even there at all as massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>projections coming up into the CORTEX.</v>

786
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.750
<v Speaker 1>And then there's little tendrils going</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to regulate it.</v>

787
00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.950
<v Speaker 1>And so basically as long as everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pretty much perfect,</v>

788
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:23.760
<v Speaker 1>your conscious mind is in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as things deviate from the</v>

789
00:40:24.101 --> 00:40:27.850
<v Speaker 1>path to any degree whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the really smart parts of your brain</v>

790
00:40:27.851 --> 00:40:31.870
<v Speaker 1>take over and then you do what they tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to do or you suffer the</v>

791
00:40:31.871 --> 00:40:34.470
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see this with people who've been</v>

792
00:40:34.471 --> 00:40:39.070
<v Speaker 1>geed for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or sometimes people develop a condition</v>

793
00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:41.830
<v Speaker 1>called Polydypsia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is often a consequence of</v>

794
00:40:41.831 --> 00:40:45.640
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic damage attended on a stroke</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll drink water until they die.</v>

795
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.810
<v Speaker 1>You cannot stop because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ragingly thirsty.</v>

796
00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Like someone who is starving and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

797
00:40:53.291 --> 00:40:54.670
<v Speaker 1>well you've had enough water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

798
00:40:54.671 --> 00:40:56.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not going to cut it.</v>

799
00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting anywhere with that.</v>

800
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:03.280
<v Speaker 1>And you see the same thing with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have like obsessive compulsive</v>

801
00:41:03.281 --> 00:41:04.600
<v Speaker 1>disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

802
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.120
<v Speaker 1>When they're not in the grip of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

803
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:10.420
<v Speaker 1>they're perfectly normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get those people to touch something.</v>

804
00:41:10.421 --> 00:41:13.210
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to talk just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not the same person.</v>

805
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:17.140
<v Speaker 1>The second they do that and whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought of themselves,</v>

806
00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:19.780
<v Speaker 1>you know the themselves that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be in control.</v>

807
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.990
<v Speaker 1>That bloody thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a wagon with a child and it</v>

808
00:41:22.991 --> 00:41:24.880
<v Speaker 1>being towed behind an elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>

809
00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.330
<v Speaker 1>it's got no control at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have,</v>

810
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.940
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's terrifying</v>
<v Speaker 1>about yoga is that there,</v>

811
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:37.320
<v Speaker 1>there's no escaping the realization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the forces that are behind</v>

812
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:40.970
<v Speaker 1>the puppets that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

813
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.950
<v Speaker 1>in Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why Pinocchio was a puppet,</v>

814
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:45.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's pulling his strings.</v>

815
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:48.650
<v Speaker 1>He's a marionette and the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pulling the strings,</v>

816
00:41:48.651 --> 00:41:52.160
<v Speaker 1>while they might have his best interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>in mind,</v>

817
00:41:52.161 --> 00:41:55.190
<v Speaker 1>but they might not too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what Pinocchio was about</v>

818
00:41:55.191 --> 00:41:57.140
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also about how not to be a</v>

819
00:41:57.141 --> 00:41:59.780
<v Speaker 1>mannequin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that you have to go to the</v>

820
00:41:59.781 --> 00:42:03.770
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the ocean and find your father</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a whale and then drown.</v>

821
00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.570
<v Speaker 1>That's how you start from being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet.</v>

822
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:06.951
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

823
00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:08.870
<v Speaker 1>well you don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

824
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:09.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes you do.</v>

825
00:42:09.531 --> 00:42:11.540
<v Speaker 1>You went and watched the movie and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoyed it.</v>

826
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Not only that you understood it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you don't have any idea what</v>

827
00:42:15.621 --> 00:42:19.040
<v Speaker 1>it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also on the face of it,</v>

828
00:42:19.041 --> 00:42:22.910
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not a pocket first,</v>

829
00:42:22.911 --> 00:42:26.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a drawing of a puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's weird that like,</v>

830
00:42:26.031 --> 00:42:27.260
<v Speaker 1>that's two levels of weird.</v>

831
00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.110
<v Speaker 1>And then like what the hell is been the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cricket where he comes from,</v>

832
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:31.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's,</v>

833
00:42:31.101 --> 00:42:34.220
<v Speaker 1>what's his role and why is he the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience and why does he get like</v>

834
00:42:34.221 --> 00:42:37.520
<v Speaker 1>activated by a ferry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is the Pfarius starts like</v>

835
00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:38.241
<v Speaker 1>you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

836
00:42:38.241 --> 00:42:41.510
<v Speaker 1>like cletus the slack joy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll pull watching the screen</v>

837
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.010
<v Speaker 1>captivated by it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk out and you don't even notice</v>

838
00:42:46.011 --> 00:42:50.240
<v Speaker 1>that you're so peculiar that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just beyond belief.</v>

839
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't even notice that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so peculiar.</v>

840
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:54.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you doing in that</v>

841
00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:59.891
<v Speaker 1>theater watching this marionette follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bug route to an eight to a whale.</v>

842
00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:01.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like you walk out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

843
00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:02.750
<v Speaker 1>that was so touching.</v>

844
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

845
00:43:06.591 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are really crazy and weird.</v>

846
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like rhinoceroses the report</v>

847
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:15.200
<v Speaker 1>platypuses or ostriches or penguins</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

848
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.890
<v Speaker 1>we're right to the core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you start to,</v>

849
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.720
<v Speaker 1>the weirdness is so deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so ancient that even starting to</v>

850
00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:27.710
<v Speaker 1>touch consciousness of that just it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just rocks your boat.</v>

851
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

852
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.310
<v Speaker 1>but one thing or another will rock your</v>
<v Speaker 1>boat.</v>

853
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.390
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes it's nice to choose what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what thing it is and prepares you for</v>

854
00:43:35.391 --> 00:43:40.040
<v Speaker 1>things too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll tell you part of what an Lto</v>

855
00:43:40.041 --> 00:43:41.930
<v Speaker 1>needs and Nokia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary Nett,</v>

856
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:43.850
<v Speaker 1>anybody can pull the strings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

857
00:43:43.851 --> 00:43:46.250
<v Speaker 1>he's got a good heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's not worth nothing?</v>

858
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Virtually nothing because he's naive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

859
00:43:48.921 --> 00:43:50.690
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the Fox and the,</v>

860
00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.750
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stupid cat that manipulate him,</v>

861
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically behind them you'll see the</v>

862
00:43:57.261 --> 00:44:00.200
<v Speaker 1>devil because that devil pops out quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly and Pinocchio.</v>

863
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:04.670
<v Speaker 1>And he's the thing that's behind all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>local manifestations of evil that are</v>

864
00:44:04.671 --> 00:44:08.690
<v Speaker 1>trying to pope UN occhio strings and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets blown off the right path,</v>

865
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 1>pretty badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost turns into a unconsciously brain</v>

866
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:14.710
<v Speaker 1>donkey who ends up working in the slave</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds,</v>

867
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.430
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

868
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:17.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

869
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.170
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened to devout communist</v>
<v Speaker 1>who found themselves swallowed up by</v>

870
00:44:21.171 --> 00:44:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Stalins nightmare in the 1940s in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>1950s slow.</v>

871
00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Well we were so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did everything you wanted.</v>

872
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:27.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

873
00:44:27.651 --> 00:44:30.200
<v Speaker 1>well it turned out what we wanted is for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to die painfully.</v>

874
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.420
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulations.</v>

875
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:36.540
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that brilliantly laid out in an oak</v>

876
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:38.610
<v Speaker 1>hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in fact was written in the 1930s</v>

877
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.490
<v Speaker 1>brilliantly laid out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it's way,</v>

878
00:44:41.491 --> 00:44:45.240
<v Speaker 1>it's way more intelligent analysis of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1930s than anything you'll ever find</v>

879
00:44:45.241 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 1>that was written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Pinocchio,</v>

880
00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:52.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to cue the proper path and</v>

881
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.000
<v Speaker 1>he learns that he shouldn't lie.</v>

882
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:55.110
<v Speaker 1>That's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

883
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.980
<v Speaker 1>what do you call archetypal idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you why that is later.</v>

884
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:02.040
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that in order to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the horrible mess that he's put</v>

885
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:05.440
<v Speaker 1>himself in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly by being un UN Unsung,</v>

886
00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:09.810
<v Speaker 1>a slavish adherence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adherence to like momentary pleasure and</v>

887
00:45:09.811 --> 00:45:10.920
<v Speaker 1>nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

888
00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:14.760
<v Speaker 1>he ends up half a jackass who can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak properly without breaking.</v>

889
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:18.360
<v Speaker 1>So that makes him an idiot log.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way that he can get out of</v>

890
00:45:18.361 --> 00:45:22.710
<v Speaker 1>that is to go down to the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean as deep as he could possibly go</v>

891
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:26.550
<v Speaker 1>deeper than anything is willing to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find his father.</v>

892
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.750
<v Speaker 1>What's his father?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His father is the culture that he lost</v>

893
00:45:30.751 --> 00:45:32.580
<v Speaker 1>touch with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

894
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:34.410
<v Speaker 1>and to the degree that you guys are</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost,</v>

895
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.440
<v Speaker 1>like all human beings are lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason you're lost,</v>

896
00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:40.380
<v Speaker 1>it's because you've never rescued your</v>
<v Speaker 1>father from the bottom of the ocean.</v>

897
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.340
<v Speaker 1>You haven't gone deep enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't,</v>

898
00:45:43.341 --> 00:45:45.090
<v Speaker 1>you won't even know when it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

899
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.710
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a social historical cultural</v>

900
00:45:49.711 --> 00:45:53.610
<v Speaker 1>creature right down to where you become</v>
<v Speaker 1>a biological creature.</v>

901
00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:56.610
<v Speaker 1>And if that isn't part of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that part isn't functioning</v>

902
00:45:56.611 --> 00:45:58.470
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your,</v>

903
00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.660
<v Speaker 1>you can just be blown off course by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind.</v>

904
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.420
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not grounded in anything.</v>

905
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.660
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why the shoreham and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go down,</v>

906
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:10.230
<v Speaker 1>communicate with their ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're trying to do.</v>

907
00:46:10.231 --> 00:46:15.231
<v Speaker 1>And they're trying to pull up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural understructure of their,</v>

908
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.450
<v Speaker 1>of their societies up into consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make use of it.</v>

909
00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:22.170
<v Speaker 1>And you constantly have to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue with that because you know,</v>

910
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.930
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say your background just for the sake of</v>

911
00:46:24.931 --> 00:46:28.750
<v Speaker 1>argument has Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the lines of have,</v>

912
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture that you're embedded in was</v>

913
00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:32.760
<v Speaker 1>written down by people several thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

914
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to figure out what the</v>

915
00:46:34.081 --> 00:46:37.320
<v Speaker 1>hell those people were talking about or</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it's relevant to you.</v>

916
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.680
<v Speaker 1>So there has to be a dialogue</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually going on between the present</v>

917
00:46:40.681 --> 00:46:45.060
<v Speaker 1>and the past so that you can bring the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom forward without losing what's in</v>

918
00:46:45.061 --> 00:46:46.890
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you lose what's in it,</v>

919
00:46:46.891 --> 00:46:49.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're just nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

920
00:46:49.951 --> 00:46:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I see this all the time and you might in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my practice,</v>

921
00:46:53.341 --> 00:46:55.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often that happens to people who get</v>

922
00:46:55.171 --> 00:46:58.590
<v Speaker 1>divorced or who are living together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not married,</v>

923
00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.400
<v Speaker 1>which you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

924
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.140
<v Speaker 1>you're free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't want her to be that</v>

925
00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:02.310
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

926
00:47:02.311 --> 00:47:05.910
<v Speaker 1>you want to argue with your partner</v>
<v Speaker 1>about every single thing for the rest of</v>

927
00:47:05.911 --> 00:47:06.870
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

928
00:47:06.871 --> 00:47:09.240
<v Speaker 1>that's what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't let your culture guide you,</v>

929
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:10.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's no rules.</v>

930
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make up all the rules.</v>

931
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.110
<v Speaker 1>See how easy that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

932
00:47:16.111 --> 00:47:18.210
<v Speaker 1>that'll kill the average person in 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

933
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.540
<v Speaker 1>It's just such a weight and you only</v>
<v Speaker 1>have one life.</v>

934
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:24.150
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might as well let some tradition</v>

935
00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:26.430
<v Speaker 1>guide you so you have some pieces some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the time,</v>

936
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.100
<v Speaker 1>or you'll end up divorced and with</v>
<v Speaker 1>children's,</v>

937
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:31.293
<v Speaker 1>ew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ew.</v>

938
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:35.500
<v Speaker 1>That's cancer for lots of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get divorced,</v>

939
00:47:35.501 --> 00:47:38.260
<v Speaker 1>they have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get locked into a custody battle</v>

940
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 1>and they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of the ride.</v>

941
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:45.360
<v Speaker 1>They're ruined by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you step outside of the guidelines of</v>

942
00:47:46.031 --> 00:47:49.900
<v Speaker 1>your culture at your own peril and</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern people because they're so</v>

943
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:50.734
<v Speaker 1>coddled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

944
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:51.880
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we can handle it.</v>

945
00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:53.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure you can.</v>

946
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:57.460
<v Speaker 1>You wait until you get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll find out that you can't handle it</v>

947
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.100
<v Speaker 1>and it'll be too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will has,</v>

948
00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:03.490
<v Speaker 1>what will have happened is that you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way all that you were supposed to go</v>

949
00:48:03.491 --> 00:48:08.350
<v Speaker 1>confront and rescue your father from has</v>
<v Speaker 1>risen out of the water and taking you</v>

950
00:48:08.351 --> 00:48:10.030
<v Speaker 1>down and you're done.</v>

951
00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:15.010
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are serious issues.</v>

952
00:48:15.011 --> 00:48:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Like Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it was the most serious</v>

953
00:48:17.531 --> 00:48:19.810
<v Speaker 1>thinker of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was.</v>

954
00:48:19.811 --> 00:48:23.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so serious that the pseudo</v>

955
00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:26.470
<v Speaker 1>serious people who read them just bounce</v>
<v Speaker 1>off them.</v>

956
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:28.450
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know what the hell he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to.</v>

957
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:33.310
<v Speaker 1>So in young was one of those thinkers</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was addressing questions that most</v>

958
00:48:33.311 --> 00:48:37.270
<v Speaker 1>people don't know exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at the bottom of reality,</v>

959
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:42.810
<v Speaker 1>and who was also answering them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a twofold blow to the intellect.</v>

960
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.520
<v Speaker 1>First he tells you that you're so</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>

961
00:48:45.521 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know what's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even ask the right questions.</v>

962
00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:50.680
<v Speaker 1>And then he answers them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

963
00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:51.533
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

964
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll,</v>

965
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:54.933
<v Speaker 1>that'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

966
00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:58.540
<v Speaker 1>doing your intellectual pretentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

967
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.800
<v Speaker 1>and the contrast between darkens I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>in young is exactly the right contrast.</v>

968
00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:06.670
<v Speaker 1>It's the contrast between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent modern Dawkins in the sort</v>

969
00:49:06.671 --> 00:49:09.100
<v Speaker 1>of historically centered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is math?</v>

970
00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:12.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of painful for me to watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've kind of watched golf.</v>

971
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:14.133
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

972
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.280
<v Speaker 1>he's not a happy man and he's got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous resentment against the</v>

973
00:49:18.281 --> 00:49:19.690
<v Speaker 1>church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's something terrible.</v>

974
00:49:19.691 --> 00:49:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Must have happened to him when he was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

975
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:22.773
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

976
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:26.883
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

977
00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me show you some of this stuff</v>

978
00:49:29.601 --> 00:49:31.580
<v Speaker 1>because it's such fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such fuck,</v>

979
00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:35.040
<v Speaker 1>did it sound fun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

980
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to show you the opening in</v>

981
00:49:37.791 --> 00:49:38.780
<v Speaker 1>the lion king.</v>

982
00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

983
00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:54.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good,</v>

984
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.400
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good idea.</v>

985
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

986
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Like why not use a media player?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That works.</v>

987
00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:18.843
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

988
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what I'm going to play for you is the</v>

989
00:50:57.861 --> 00:50:59.960
<v Speaker 1>opening scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opening scene.</v>

990
00:50:59.961 --> 00:51:04.310
<v Speaker 1>It's very nicely designed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the music I find a little bit</v>

991
00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:08.870
<v Speaker 1>manipulative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little poppy and,</v>

992
00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.830
<v Speaker 1>and it's manipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's an interesting example of how</v>

993
00:51:12.831 --> 00:51:17.831
<v Speaker 1>art can go wrong because it's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>art design for a purpose and art cannot</v>

994
00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:22.901
<v Speaker 1>be designed for a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of art is art purpose,</v>

995
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:25.460
<v Speaker 1>not your purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're trying to bend the arc</v>

996
00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:27.440
<v Speaker 1>to your purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're,</v>

997
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:33.320
<v Speaker 1>you're like you're painting a picture of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stick man on a stained glass window.</v>

998
00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Like you just don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just haven't got the right</v>

999
00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:39.080
<v Speaker 1>orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Art is an exploratory process and it's</v>

1000
00:51:39.081 --> 00:51:40.940
<v Speaker 1>supposed to take you beyond what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1001
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:44.510
<v Speaker 1>If you take art and try to force it into</v>
<v Speaker 1>your precut pre conceptions,</v>

1002
00:51:44.511 --> 00:51:47.250
<v Speaker 1>then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a propagandist and an Nydia log</v>

1003
00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:50.330
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bending the greater to the lesser</v>

1004
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:52.730
<v Speaker 1>so in that makes it feel cheap and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1005
00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.050
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1006
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:58.880
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't fit well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like the Latin kings a pretty good</v>

1007
00:51:58.881 --> 00:52:01.010
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean from a,</v>

1008
00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:06.380
<v Speaker 1>from a psychological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it devolves into propaganda from time to</v>

1009
00:52:06.381 --> 00:52:08.600
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens isn't salts,</v>

1010
00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:10.070
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1011
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:12.860
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still a work.</v>

1012
00:52:12.861 --> 00:52:16.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a work of genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you will know it.</v>

1013
00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:19.700
<v Speaker 1>This is where you get your religion.</v>

1014
00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an archetypal image they open</v>

1015
00:52:35.821 --> 00:52:36.600
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1016
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's the dawn of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's the new day,</v>

1017
00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:42.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the dawn of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dawn of consciousness because you're a</v>

1018
00:52:42.661 --> 00:52:47.280
<v Speaker 1>visual creature and it's also the dawn</v>
<v Speaker 1>of consciousness because you wake up in</v>

1019
00:52:47.281 --> 00:52:50.640
<v Speaker 1>the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like sun rise,</v>

1020
00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:55.380
<v Speaker 1>light dawn of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the music is a celebration of</v>

1021
00:52:55.381 --> 00:52:57.660
<v Speaker 1>that and you can feel it in grips you</v>
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

1022
00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:59.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that part of the music is really,</v>

1023
00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:02.940
<v Speaker 1>really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the gospel singers from</v>

1024
00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:06.210
<v Speaker 1>South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is the guys that played with</v>

1025
00:53:06.211 --> 00:53:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Paul Simon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1026
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:13.460
<v Speaker 1>They're great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1027
00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.630
<v Speaker 1>So what are all the animals doing all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden</v>

1028
00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:24.840
<v Speaker 1>and you're waking up and they're paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to a call,</v>

1029
00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:26.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And call his musical.</v>

1030
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:28.140
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1031
00:53:28.141 --> 00:53:29.280
<v Speaker 1>what's music?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1032
00:53:29.281 --> 00:53:33.120
<v Speaker 1>music is a representation of like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic patterns of things.</v>

1033
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:36.210
<v Speaker 1>And so you get all of this complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>information that's going on right off</v>

1034
00:53:36.211 --> 00:53:37.770
<v Speaker 1>the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness dawns.</v>

1035
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:41.610
<v Speaker 1>And now there's a call and everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that San Diego is to pay attention to</v>

1036
00:53:41.611 --> 00:53:44.280
<v Speaker 1>the call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good for like five seconds</v>

1037
00:53:44.281 --> 00:53:45.114
<v Speaker 1>of film.</v>

1038
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:09.173
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1039
00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:15.640
<v Speaker 1>So now there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel makers hit you with a whole</v>

1040
00:54:15.641 --> 00:54:17.800
<v Speaker 1>succession of very beautiful images and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1041
00:54:17.801 --> 00:54:20.320
<v Speaker 1>they do that with a very beautiful music</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's underneath.</v>

1042
00:54:20.321 --> 00:54:22.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's to put you like in a state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmony with,</v>

1043
00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:26.420
<v Speaker 1>well normally with nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with your own conceptions of the</v>

1044
00:54:26.421 --> 00:54:29.220
<v Speaker 1>beetroot and your sense of aesthetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works quite nicely.</v>

1045
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Put pops into a dream very quickly.</v>

1046
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On</v>

1047
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:48.950
<v Speaker 2>staffing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See</v>

1048
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:56.120
<v Speaker 2>then can have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pc</v>

1049
00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:21.520
<v Speaker 2>small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1050
00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:26.200
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the lyrics are quite interesting</v>

1051
00:55:26.201 --> 00:55:30.400
<v Speaker 1>because the lyrics are making</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation to the,</v>

1052
00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:35.260
<v Speaker 1>to that state of being that I talked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about that William James had</v>

1053
00:55:35.261 --> 00:55:37.360
<v Speaker 1>experienced stay with is nitrous oxide</v>
<v Speaker 1>visions.</v>

1054
00:55:37.361 --> 00:55:40.660
<v Speaker 1>But then also the piaget and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructivist sort of think about as</v>

1055
00:55:40.661 --> 00:55:42.660
<v Speaker 1>the ground of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know the,</v>

1056
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:45.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lyricist made the case that what</v>

1057
00:55:45.161 --> 00:55:48.880
<v Speaker 1>surrounds you is informative to a degree</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will never be able to</v>

1058
00:55:48.881 --> 00:55:51.310
<v Speaker 1>comprehend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the implication under that is that</v>

1059
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:53.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that at least one of the ways of</v>

1060
00:55:53.531 --> 00:55:58.531
<v Speaker 1>construing the ground of experiential</v>
<v Speaker 1>being is as an information rich matrix</v>

1061
00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:00.940
<v Speaker 1>and the music is pushing you in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction too.</v>

1062
00:56:00.941 --> 00:56:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Because the music is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music is a representation of what</v>

1063
00:56:04.931 --> 00:56:09.931
<v Speaker 1>that information rich matrix is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if it's patterned and complex</v>

1064
00:56:09.971 --> 00:56:11.160
<v Speaker 1>but understandable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

1065
00:56:11.161 --> 00:56:14.320
<v Speaker 1>and it also evokes emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's reality.</v>

1066
00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.510
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of paradise imagery in</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1067
00:56:16.511 --> 00:56:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Two ways because it's sort of like all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these animals are,</v>

1068
00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.200
<v Speaker 1>they're all doing the same thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1069
00:56:21.201 --> 00:56:24.760
<v Speaker 1>sort of existing in harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like elephants covered with birds.</v>

1070
00:56:24.761 --> 00:56:28.480
<v Speaker 1>And so in a way it's a childish view of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world because you know those</v>

1071
00:56:28.481 --> 00:56:30.270
<v Speaker 1>elephants are covered with the text and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:33.160
<v Speaker 1>the lions are half starved because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a drought.</v>

1073
00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:34.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1074
00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so good out there on the</v>

1075
00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:37.840
<v Speaker 1>African plains because it's not all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1076
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.940
<v Speaker 2>that'll teach me,</v>

1077
00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:55.093
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1078
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:56.590
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're getting you in the mood.</v>

1079
00:56:56.591 --> 00:56:57.131
<v Speaker 1>Now the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1080
00:56:57.131 --> 00:56:59.500
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lyricist also made reference to the</v>

1081
00:56:59.501 --> 00:57:02.120
<v Speaker 1>fact that there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1082
00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:06.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an element of genesis in that</v>

1083
00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:10.900
<v Speaker 1>systems because she talks about our</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrival on the earth,</v>

1084
00:57:10.901 --> 00:57:13.600
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then are the dawning of</v>

1085
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:15.640
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this step into the sun.</v>

1086
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:19.270
<v Speaker 1>And so that's an archetype of multim</v>
<v Speaker 1>were placed on earth while here we are</v>

1087
00:57:19.271 --> 00:57:20.680
<v Speaker 1>after all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And poof,</v>

1088
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.230
<v Speaker 1>we woke up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

1089
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:26.020
<v Speaker 1>the reason that's an archetypal ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's what happens to everybody.</v>

1090
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poof,</v>

1091
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 1>you're placed on the earth bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day you wake up.</v>

1092
00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:34.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like the internal experience of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings and there's something</v>

1093
00:57:34.001 --> 00:57:35.230
<v Speaker 1>that's deeply real about it.</v>

1094
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:42.223
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1095
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:43.143
<v Speaker 1>that was cool.</v>

1096
00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:46.070
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to force them to watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>that again.</v>

1097
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:54.290
<v Speaker 1>So that's a revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1098
00:57:54.291 --> 00:57:56.450
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a very sneaky bit at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera work.</v>

1099
00:57:56.451 --> 00:57:57.500
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1100
00:57:57.501 --> 00:57:59.720
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your vision is obscured,</v>

1101
00:57:59.721 --> 00:58:02.390
<v Speaker 1>but then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's directed by the motion to this like</v>

1102
00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:04.220
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

1103
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

1104
00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:10.090
<v Speaker 1>It's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just what exactly is in pride Bra.</v>

1105
00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:15.520
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

1106
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.590
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Rock is where the king is.</v>

1107
00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:22.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the top of the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we remember those,</v>

1108
00:58:22.850 --> 00:58:25.280
<v Speaker 1>remember those trees I showed you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the showman?</v>

1109
00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.770
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just figured this out the other day.</v>

1110
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Inside that tree there was a mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mountain was surrounded by a</v>

1111
00:58:33.141 --> 00:58:34.190
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that?</v>

1112
00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a circle with the sneaker on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the structure of this</v>

1113
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:39.740
<v Speaker 1>lion king set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that?</v>

1114
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:41.300
<v Speaker 1>So you've got the mountain in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1115
00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.970
<v Speaker 1>What's on the outside?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyenas.</v>

1116
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:47.870
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chaos is out there where the light</v>

1117
00:58:47.871 --> 00:58:49.340
<v Speaker 1>won't touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1118
00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:53.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfect representation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavian world tree.</v>

1119
00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:54.980
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

1120
00:58:54.981 --> 00:58:59.600
<v Speaker 1>now obviously you and other animals are</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to lift up your eyes,</v>

1121
00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.220
<v Speaker 1>which is what the film maker made you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1122
00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:03.740
<v Speaker 1>And focus on this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a raw,</v>

1123
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:07.940
<v Speaker 1>what does the Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does a rock stand for?</v>

1124
00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:11.273
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1125
00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1126
00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Why balance structure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1127
00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Why is it rock a good metaphor for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great rocks there.</v>

1128
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 1>They're strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in an earthquake,</v>

1129
00:59:25.041 --> 00:59:26.540
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't liquefy.</v>

1130
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.000
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to stand on a rock,</v>

1131
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:31.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is what kind of rock do you</v>

1132
00:59:31.971 --> 00:59:34.370
<v Speaker 1>want to stand on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly,</v>

1133
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:38.300
<v Speaker 1>is it a physical rock that's one way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it or is there a metaphysical</v>

1134
00:59:38.301 --> 00:59:40.490
<v Speaker 1>rock that's even a better rock?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1135
00:59:40.491 --> 00:59:42.290
<v Speaker 1>that's partly what this is film</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigates,</v>

1136
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:46.400
<v Speaker 1>but at the moment there was a rock and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been there forever and the king has</v>

1137
00:59:46.401 --> 00:59:48.530
<v Speaker 1>been there forever and the king is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1138
00:59:48.531 --> 00:59:49.870
<v Speaker 1>You have to talk with the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

1139
00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.980
<v Speaker 1>which is why you lift up your eyes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1140
00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:55.310
<v Speaker 1>And the king here is a lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does that make sense?</v>

1141
00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Lions aren't kings after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe sense why</v>

1142
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:04.340
<v Speaker 1>they're up there at the top of the food</v>
<v Speaker 1>chain.</v>

1143
01:00:04.341 --> 01:00:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good one.</v>

1144
01:00:05.241 --> 01:00:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Any other possible reasons?</v>

1145
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1146
01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:12.831
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1147
01:00:12.831 --> 01:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

1148
01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>and the animators capitalized on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time and they're kind of noble</v>

1149
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:17.810
<v Speaker 1>looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1150
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.540
<v Speaker 1>cause they're muscular and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1151
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>and plus they could eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1152
01:00:22.821 --> 01:00:26.360
<v Speaker 1>So that sort of indicates that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain circumstances under which you</v>

1153
01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:29.990
<v Speaker 1>are at the bottom of the hierarchy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion is it in fact at the tall.</v>

1154
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>So cause a lion is also an on spiring</v>
<v Speaker 1>beast.</v>

1155
01:00:32.991 --> 01:00:33.824
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1156
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:37.040
<v Speaker 1>the shepherds in the old testament</v>
<v Speaker 1>around that time,</v>

1157
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shepherd,</v>

1158
01:00:38.241 --> 01:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well shepherd,</v>

1159
01:00:39.171 --> 01:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>he's dressed this little frilly hat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1160
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:44.240
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not much of a powerhouse at all,</v>

1161
01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:47.090
<v Speaker 1>but those guys used to fight off lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1162
01:00:47.091 --> 01:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1163
01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:51.350
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be really tough to fight off a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion with a steak,</v>

1164
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:52.910
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1165
01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1166
01:00:56.571 --> 01:00:58.370
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's the rock and the sun is</v>

1167
01:00:58.371 --> 01:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>shining on it.</v>

1168
01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>And what are the animals doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering around the rock.</v>

1169
01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Now we accept that as a narrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility,</v>

1170
01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:10.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't sit in their thinking and the</v>

1171
01:01:10.551 --> 01:01:12.490
<v Speaker 1>theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are those animals doing?</v>

1172
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Gathering around the Rock and the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not sitting there thinking</v>

1173
01:01:15.771 --> 01:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>that is an indication that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>following the archetypical trail of the</v>

1174
01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense to you that a diverse</v>

1175
01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>bunch of drawings of animals would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1176
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.800
<v Speaker 1>come together around a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1177
01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1178
01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.880
<v Speaker 1>it had something to do with our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our dawn higher proclivity and the fact</v>

1179
01:01:34.881 --> 01:01:38.450
<v Speaker 1>that we can recognize a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an authority and an authority structure</v>

1180
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>and we know how to interact with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these aren't animals after all,</v>

1181
01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:44.300
<v Speaker 1>they're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people,</v>

1182
01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.140
<v Speaker 1>while they're not cause their drawings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're certainly not animals.</v>

1183
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.840
<v Speaker 1>They're not acting like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1184
01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>or they're acting like half human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half animals.</v>

1185
01:01:58.690 --> 01:01:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right</v>

1186
01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.700
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's that little guy?</v>

1187
01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1188
01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:06.880
<v Speaker 1>What's he good for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Information.</v>

1189
01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1190
01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Why is he did frequent aging and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

1191
01:02:12.011 --> 01:02:16.030
<v Speaker 1>why is that relevant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get up there way the hell up</v>

1192
01:02:16.031 --> 01:02:18.130
<v Speaker 1>there with the king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't even see and he can see</v>

1193
01:02:18.131 --> 01:02:20.890
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horses.</v>

1194
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Argh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

1195
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Egyptian I that says pay</v>

1196
01:02:24.691 --> 01:02:27.140
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the birdies,</v>

1197
01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:31.170
<v Speaker 1>the divert his attention fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1198
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:35.550
<v Speaker 1>and the king by the same for the bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a little ratty.</v>

1199
01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Burton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of funny.</v>

1200
01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not English comedian so he's a bit</v>

1201
01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>of a comical character but the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the king will listen to him.</v>

1202
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>And so that shows that this king is</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly humble king because it's just a</v>

1203
01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>stupid bird and you could like fight it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and half in one bite,</v>

1204
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:54.530
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of what scar trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatens to do cause scarred is want to</v>

1205
01:02:54.531 --> 01:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>pay attention cause then he'd figured</v>
<v Speaker 1>out who he was.</v>

1206
01:02:57.730 --> 01:03:00.330
<v Speaker 1>So but the king he'll pay attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

1207
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.070
<v Speaker 1>you know this is also why in fairy tales</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often the youngest son,</v>

1208
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:07.950
<v Speaker 1>the oldest son is usually the one who</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone likes and admires.</v>

1209
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:09.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like the football,</v>

1210
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to football quarterback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1211
01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:15.090
<v Speaker 1>of the fairytale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the younger son is like,</v>

1212
01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:20.130
<v Speaker 1>well he's kind of little weaselly</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless guide and the older son always</v>

1213
01:03:20.131 --> 01:03:22.160
<v Speaker 1>fails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then usually the second son fails</v>

1214
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:23.520
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's usually because they're</v>

1215
01:03:23.521 --> 01:03:24.870
<v Speaker 1>arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the third son,</v>

1216
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:26.910
<v Speaker 1>he's so clueless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know what to do,</v>

1217
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:29.070
<v Speaker 1>but they kicked them out because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just assume get rid of him and,</v>

1218
01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.770
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not let them go and you don't want</v>

1219
01:03:31.771 --> 01:03:34.320
<v Speaker 1>them around anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he wanted out in the bush and you</v>

1220
01:03:34.321 --> 01:03:36.180
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he comes across out of nome or something</v>

1221
01:03:36.181 --> 01:03:36.601
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1222
01:03:36.601 --> 01:03:38.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like you just ignore it.</v>

1223
01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.280
<v Speaker 1>The other brothers did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't know what the hell he's</v>

1224
01:03:41.281 --> 01:03:43.740
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the talks to many thanks while our</v>

1225
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.110
<v Speaker 1>plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk to this known,</v>

1226
01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:47.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the gnome tells them what to do</v>

1227
01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:50.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then then the youngest son wins.</v>

1228
01:03:50.791 --> 01:03:54.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's an archetypal story too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you don't know what you're</v>

1229
01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:57.870
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sure that you know who to</v>

1230
01:03:57.871 --> 01:03:59.250
<v Speaker 1>ignore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1231
01:03:59.251 --> 01:04:01.590
<v Speaker 1>that's our very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very useful piece of advice.</v>

1232
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.440
<v Speaker 1>But then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know when you don't know what</v>

1233
01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:07.860
<v Speaker 1>you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you have any thoughts on that?</v>

1234
01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:10.530
<v Speaker 1>How is it that you would know if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know what you were doing?</v>

1235
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's one that's very good,</v>

1236
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:18.270
<v Speaker 1>that's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's one more thing that goes</v>

1237
01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:19.800
<v Speaker 1>along with that all and I'll just add</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1238
01:04:19.801 --> 01:04:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's lets you know a bit of a trek</v>
<v Speaker 1>and substance and it's bothering you,</v>

1239
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:26.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

1240
01:04:26.131 --> 01:04:30.030
<v Speaker 1>there's failure plus suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the inferences that you can</v>

1241
01:04:30.031 --> 01:04:35.031
<v Speaker 1>draw from failure plus suffering is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature is your enemy and you're a victim</v>

1242
01:04:36.601 --> 01:04:41.601
<v Speaker 1>of the great father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like very standard presupposition,</v>

1243
01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:45.200
<v Speaker 1>especially of young people because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course you're failing here young.</v>

1244
01:04:45.201 --> 01:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1245
01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:49.050
<v Speaker 1>you know when you go to a whole bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to learn yet before you can be</v>

1246
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:51.840
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1247
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:55.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's an art that's an architectural</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation in large part.</v>

1248
01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.113
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1249
01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:06.943
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1250
01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:10.270
<v Speaker 1>So now we see the cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do we notice about the cake?</v>

1251
01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a tough looking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not one of these defeated lobster</v>

1252
01:05:15.071 --> 01:05:17.600
<v Speaker 1>types of lion kings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like an upstanding of,</v>

1253
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.033
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1254
01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:25.320
<v Speaker 1>you saw he was also in the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1255
01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:29.250
<v Speaker 1>So if the sun shines on the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because the king is awake and</v>

1256
01:05:29.251 --> 01:05:31.710
<v Speaker 1>the sun also illuminates it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not know this,</v>

1257
01:05:31.711 --> 01:05:33.840
<v Speaker 1>but you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen coins,</v>

1258
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.540
<v Speaker 1>of course silver coin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the mood.</v>

1259
01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:40.620
<v Speaker 1>The head of the Queen was the head of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the queen on the mood and gold coins</v>

1260
01:05:40.621 --> 01:05:42.870
<v Speaker 1>with the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're hanging clothes.</v>

1261
01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:45.660
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that the thing that's at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top,</v>

1262
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is it like the sun?</v>

1263
01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Because the sun is consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is this unconsciousness?</v>

1264
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Because you're awake during the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a bunch of other reasons as</v>

1265
01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:57.480
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sun is also the thing that defeats</v>

1266
01:05:57.481 --> 01:05:59.580
<v Speaker 1>darkness and that's what the king should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

1267
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's right in their coins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're simple.</v>

1268
01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.540
<v Speaker 1>They're symbols of value.</v>

1269
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1270
01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.590
<v Speaker 1>so they're all on the wind is blowing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1271
01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:10.530
<v Speaker 1>but just not bothering you by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a,</v>

1272
01:06:10.531 --> 01:06:12.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a divine wind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's PNEUMA.</v>

1273
01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:16.890
<v Speaker 1>PNEUMA that's spirit because spirit is</v>
<v Speaker 1>often win as an inspiration and</v>

1274
01:06:16.891 --> 01:06:18.960
<v Speaker 1>respiration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all spirit.</v>

1275
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.170
<v Speaker 1>So spirit came here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to the bird.</v>

1276
01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's his friend.</v>

1277
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:39.150
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

1278
01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Now who in the world is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Carl Young.</v>

1279
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Who's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Virgin Mary and Christ.</v>

1280
01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:15.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the virgin and the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a way older idea.</v>

1281
01:07:15.521 --> 01:07:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Then the Christian idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been around forever.</v>

1282
01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because any culture that doesn't worship</v>

1283
01:07:21.521 --> 01:07:26.521
<v Speaker 1>the mother and child dies obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an archetypal image of value.</v>

1284
01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you don't have to think about</v>

1285
01:07:31.121 --> 01:07:31.954
<v Speaker 1>that much.</v>

1286
01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.960
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1287
01:07:44.570 --> 01:07:45.403
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

1288
01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:48.813
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

1289
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:51.810
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two things always happen when I</v>

1290
01:07:51.811 --> 01:07:54.960
<v Speaker 1>showed this always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it evokes archetypal emotions.</v>

1291
01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:58.200
<v Speaker 1>So you were all going nick invoice from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cute noises,</v>

1292
01:07:58.201 --> 01:08:00.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of noises are those</v>

1293
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.160
<v Speaker 1>babies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that noise.</v>

1294
01:08:05.161 --> 01:08:07.550
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're making that noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the baby like that though.</v>

1295
01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I still smile at you and then you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that the navy likes you even though</v>

1296
01:08:10.741 --> 01:08:12.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just a survival mechanism.</v>

1297
01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

1298
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.873
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the baby.</v>

1299
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that cute?</v>

1300
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not real.</v>

1301
01:08:22.071 --> 01:08:22.930
<v Speaker 1>You might notice that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1302
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Why is that cute?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What means of cute?</v>

1303
01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:30.151
<v Speaker 1>They guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1304
01:08:30.151 --> 01:08:31.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1305
01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.100
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of it.</v>

1306
01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Aliens have big eyes too though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

1307
01:08:38.190 --> 01:08:39.190
<v Speaker 1>It's kindly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1308
01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a Mammalian,</v>

1309
01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.580
<v Speaker 1>that's how small the lizard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1310
01:08:42.610 --> 01:08:45.010
<v Speaker 1>so that's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got first so you can pet it sort of</v>

1311
01:08:45.011 --> 01:08:47.890
<v Speaker 1>invites be petted and it moves like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1312
01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:49.560
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so cute.</v>

1313
01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little polar bear.</v>

1314
01:08:52.141 --> 01:08:53.850
<v Speaker 1>I did watch a little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1315
01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.400
<v Speaker 1>that's like pathologically acute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>

1316
01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:57.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1317
01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.850
<v Speaker 1>part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of wobbling around and it's</v>

1318
01:08:59.851 --> 01:09:01.890
<v Speaker 1>like the poor thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's trying to walk.</v>

1319
01:09:01.891 --> 01:09:03.510
<v Speaker 1>It's having a rough time and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks,</v>

1320
01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:04.373
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so cute.</v>

1321
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:06.420
<v Speaker 1>That was happening to you.</v>

1322
01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:08.880
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't think it was cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1323
01:09:08.881 --> 01:09:09.840
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

1324
01:09:10.690 --> 01:09:13.810
<v Speaker 1>first range of mammalian species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no cute.</v>

1325
01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:17.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they tend to respond to like big</v>

1326
01:09:17.831 --> 01:09:20.590
<v Speaker 1>guide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetrical small nose,</v>

1327
01:09:20.650 --> 01:09:22.390
<v Speaker 1>flat faced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1328
01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:26.860
<v Speaker 1>helpless movement cuddly and not eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1329
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:27.480
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1330
01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:29.020
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an inhibitory,</v>

1331
01:09:29.350 --> 01:09:32.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a set of inhibitory perceptual</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms in large part.</v>

1332
01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:35.200
<v Speaker 1>But since we're also mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better think that thing is cute</v>

1333
01:09:35.201 --> 01:09:38.620
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to be taken care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it for a long time.</v>

1334
01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.920
<v Speaker 1>So you know there has to be a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

1335
01:09:41.921 --> 01:09:45.460
<v Speaker 1>deep biological connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's forged almost immediately.</v>

1336
01:09:45.461 --> 01:09:48.760
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's mediated in women</v>
<v Speaker 1>in particular by Oxytocin,</v>

1337
01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:52.120
<v Speaker 1>which is released in tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantities after birth and during</v>

1338
01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:53.560
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1339
01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.110
<v Speaker 1>and it's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1340
01:09:56.111 --> 01:09:59.320
<v Speaker 1>it turns on new circuits and there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>circuits you need cause like one day</v>

1341
01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:01.240
<v Speaker 1>you're not a mother and then the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>day you are,</v>

1342
01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:04.120
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are not the same creature at that</v>

1343
01:10:04.121 --> 01:10:06.670
<v Speaker 1>point and you don't want to even be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same creature.</v>

1344
01:10:06.671 --> 01:10:08.140
<v Speaker 1>You're pretty happy about the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

1345
01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.213
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>

1346
01:10:19.210 --> 01:10:23.690
<v Speaker 1>So that's very interesting image j</v>
<v Speaker 1>because first of all he was playing with</v>

1347
01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.510
<v Speaker 1>the little lion king with those balls</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>

1348
01:10:25.511 --> 01:10:27.850
<v Speaker 1>so there's sort of globe thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracting them.</v>

1349
01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:30.550
<v Speaker 1>So it was like representations of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sun and you might think,</v>

1350
01:10:30.551 --> 01:10:33.930
<v Speaker 1>well you're just reading that into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then of course this happens.</v>

1351
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:37.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like he's breaking open the sun</v>

1352
01:10:37.601 --> 01:10:40.660
<v Speaker 1>to release the essence of the sun onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little lion king.</v>

1353
01:10:41.190 --> 01:10:43.630
<v Speaker 1>And he is because the sun represents</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold.</v>

1354
01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Gold is pure gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't mix with any other metals.</v>

1355
01:10:46.961 --> 01:10:48.670
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly why it's a symbol of</v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

1356
01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a noble metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sun is made out of gold so to speak,</v>

1357
01:10:52.931 --> 01:10:56.890
<v Speaker 1>except it's like medical from a symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective because it's like the gold</v>

1358
01:10:56.891 --> 01:11:00.640
<v Speaker 1>of higher consciousness and it feed</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumped on the middle lion king because</v>

1359
01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.540
<v Speaker 1>for the tribe sake and then maybe even</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of the whole ecosystem</v>

1360
01:11:04.541 --> 01:11:06.880
<v Speaker 1>around the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that king better be awake.</v>

1361
01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:10.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's what this Carl Young baboons</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is trying to get.</v>

1362
01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Get going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1363
01:11:35.411 --> 01:11:37.450
<v Speaker 1>so now you notice two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lovely.</v>

1364
01:11:37.451 --> 01:11:40.030
<v Speaker 1>This is lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very well put together seeing third</v>

1365
01:11:40.031 --> 01:11:42.280
<v Speaker 1>bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the animal is started to lift up your</v>

1366
01:11:42.281 --> 01:11:45.130
<v Speaker 1>head so you can get the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>heightened interest in the music is</v>

1367
01:11:45.131 --> 01:11:47.630
<v Speaker 1>starting to rise a little bit in speed</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in camp a better,</v>

1368
01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:49.840
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's going to happen here at</v>

1369
01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.570
<v Speaker 1>pinnacle of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

1370
01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.793
<v Speaker 1>of the rock there.</v>

1371
01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This little thing was now represents</v>

1372
01:12:35.411 --> 01:12:39.040
<v Speaker 1>what will become the guiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness of the land is revealed</v>

1373
01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:41.740
<v Speaker 1>and the automatic response of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

1374
01:12:41.741 --> 01:12:45.010
<v Speaker 1>it's first to file.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're in awe as they should be.</v>

1375
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:47.730
<v Speaker 1>And then to celebrate and then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1376
01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:49.630
<v Speaker 1>well that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty impressive.</v>

1377
01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:53.860
<v Speaker 1>But then God himself gets in the act</v>
<v Speaker 1>because just at the opportune time,</v>

1378
01:12:54.010 --> 01:12:57.360
<v Speaker 1>the sun breaks and shines on the little</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion at the same time.</v>

1379
01:12:57.390 --> 01:13:00.370
<v Speaker 1>They moved the music up like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed the key of the music.</v>

1380
01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:04.900
<v Speaker 1>And so if it causes an up swelling of</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and that's,</v>

1381
01:13:04.901 --> 01:13:07.030
<v Speaker 1>y'all would call that if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1382
01:13:07.031 --> 01:13:10.300
<v Speaker 1>and when that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he would call a synchronous</v>

1383
01:13:10.301 --> 01:13:12.340
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a demonstration of a</v>

1384
01:13:12.341 --> 01:13:15.520
<v Speaker 1>synchronous event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's where they're very rare.</v>

1385
01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:18.070
<v Speaker 1>These things there from a union</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1386
01:13:18.071 --> 01:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They occur in very emotionally intense</v>

1387
01:13:22.181 --> 01:13:26.770
<v Speaker 1>situations where they context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the external context of the occurrence</v>

1388
01:13:26.771 --> 01:13:29.140
<v Speaker 1>seems to match the meaning of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurrence.</v>

1389
01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:32.350
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you believe such things</v>

1390
01:13:32.351 --> 01:13:34.960
<v Speaker 1>are possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is exactly what this little film</v>

1391
01:13:34.961 --> 01:13:36.100
<v Speaker 1>clip is trying to demonstrate.</v>

1392
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty decent or right.</v>

1393
01:13:59.831 --> 01:14:03.110
<v Speaker 1>So you go up the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the stone hierarchy,</v>

1394
01:14:03.111 --> 01:14:05.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the thing that's at the top</v>

1395
01:14:05.681 --> 01:14:07.720
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the little pyramid on the back</v>

1396
01:14:07.721 --> 01:14:09.790
<v Speaker 1>of the American dollar bill with the eye</v>
<v Speaker 1>on talk.</v>

1397
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the idea is that the thing</v>

1398
01:14:13.391 --> 01:14:17.260
<v Speaker 1>that's at the very top of the pyramid</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't part of the fear of it.</v>

1399
01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:19.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's not stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little lion king,</v>

1400
01:14:19.871 --> 01:14:23.350
<v Speaker 1>he isn't stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the thing that produces stone as he</v>

1401
01:14:23.351 --> 01:14:24.940
<v Speaker 1>moves through time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1402
01:14:24.941 --> 01:14:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Because he's the culture producing</v>
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

1403
01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:32.880
<v Speaker 1>And so this is setup to demonstrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>visually that at the center of being is</v>

1404
01:14:32.981 --> 01:14:37.780
<v Speaker 1>culture at the top of culture is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture producing process or force.</v>

1405
01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:42.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's the illuminated savior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what all the animals worship</v>

1406
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:44.530
<v Speaker 1>instinctively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1407
01:14:44.650 --> 01:14:46.390
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1408
01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 1>That's how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see you on</v>

1409
01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
