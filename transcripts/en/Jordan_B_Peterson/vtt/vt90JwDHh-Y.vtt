1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know how I been telling you guys</v>

2
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>about the hierarchical model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where the motor actions on the</v>

3
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:14.931
<v Speaker 1>bottom and then higher order abstract</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptions at the top so you can be a</v>

4
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>good person if you're a good parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how to take care of your</v>

5
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can keep your house orderly and</v>

6
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can make dinner,</v>

7
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>if you can set a table and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way decomposed all the way down</v>

8
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>to motor actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>So it brings you from the level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract to the level of concrete.</v>

10
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now think about this,</v>

11
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.000
<v Speaker 1>so keep that in your mind first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the second thing you want to keep in</v>

12
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>your mind is the kind of models that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about a little bit last</v>

13
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're the,</v>

14
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>their expectancy models that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>derived from vinegar,</v>

15
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Nova and soca law and so forth and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.691
<v Speaker 1>and really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>finalized in some sense by great.</v>

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what those models say fundamentally is</v>

19
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:03.861
<v Speaker 1>that if you're moving towards a target,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conservatory target,</v>

20
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>which would be specified by hypothalamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>or other underlying motivational systems</v>

21
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>or some combination of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it can be a higher order goal.</v>

22
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Then anything that occurs while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>proceeding towards that goal,</v>

23
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>that indicates that you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or move closer to it,</v>

24
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>produces positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

25
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's mediated by the hypothalamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory,</v>

26
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>paused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an effect circuit that runs through</v>

27
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>the nucleus accumbens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it basically runs on dopamine.</v>

28
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's positive emotion.</v>

29
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's positive emotion in relationship to</v>

30
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you attain the goal,</v>

31
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>which is the consumer story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reward is it satisfies you,</v>

32
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.250
<v Speaker 1>and that's also a form of reward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not associated with as much</v>

33
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more associated with</v>

34
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>the lack of necessity to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

35
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're done with that and that can be</v>

36
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>satisfying and it does seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated mediated by Serotonin,</v>

37
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>which is basically a satiating agent</v>
<v Speaker 1>among its other properties.</v>

38
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's on the positive emotion end of</v>

39
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an incentive reward is also equivalent</v>

41
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>to a conditioned reward in classical</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior theory,</v>

42
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>so that's actually something you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably know,</v>

43
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>but all talk about it a bit more because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of need,</v>

44
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>you need to know how behavior is theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed across time because behaviors,</v>

45
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>theory has been incredibly instill is</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly influential in neuroscience,</v>

46
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>especially in the real neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is almost always done with</v>

47
00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

48
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>so that's one of the positive emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

49
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Now let's go to the negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now you're proceeding towards a</v>

50
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 1>goal and something gets in your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>you're walking across the carpet to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work and you step on a dog bone,</v>

52
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's maybe a little painful,</v>

53
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>but we'll keep that apart from this</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion for a moment.</v>

54
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>It constitutes an impediment to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress forward,</v>

55
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>or maybe your kid left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a piece of furniture in the</v>

57
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 1>hallway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a better example.</v>

58
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's a bit of an obstacle and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at that,</v>

59
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to produce negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

60
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>And the negative emotion is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an obstacle in your path.</v>

61
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much negative emotion should you</v>

62
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>experienced when you encounter an</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle?</v>

63
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember if I got,</v>

64
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>if I assigned you guys the entropy paper</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wrote with Jacob Hersch and</v>

65
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Raymond Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

66
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we took a long time to figure out how</v>

67
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>you might calibrate how upset you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>get when something negative happens.</v>

68
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:54.631
<v Speaker 1>And what we realized fundamentally was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was proportional to the place in</v>

69
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy where your goals were</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupted.</v>

70
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you just have to make a minor</v>

71
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>course correction by walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of upset you should get is</v>

72
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>basically proportional to the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra energy that you have to expand</v>

73
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>correcting your course.</v>

74
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.990
<v Speaker 1>And so a minor obstacle is just going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

75
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce a little bit of arousal and</v>

76
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you go out to try to start</v>

77
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:26.011
<v Speaker 1>your car and it won't start well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's gonna make you more upset,</v>

78
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>experience more negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

79
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read that you're,</v>

80
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>the business you work in has just</v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed because of the CEO was a</v>

81
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>crook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's bankrupt,</v>

82
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.320
<v Speaker 1>that's going to cause you even more</v>
<v Speaker 1>distressed.</v>

83
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 1>And the distress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

84
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:46.531
<v Speaker 1>should be proportional to the level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy in your expectancy network</v>

85
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>or desire network more accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's disrupted by the occurrence.</v>

86
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that,</v>

87
00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's solid.</v>

88
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

89
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's the special case of things</v>

90
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 1>you don't know about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:04.740
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

92
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>and often when something gets in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

93
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>the problem with what gets in your way</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you actually can't compute how much</v>

94
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 1>time and energy it's going to take you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fix it.</v>

95
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very hard to calibrate how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much negative emotion you're going to</v>

96
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 1>feel under those circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

98
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.140
<v Speaker 1>how anxious should you get if your car</v>
<v Speaker 1>quits working while they answered that</v>

99
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:30.481
<v Speaker 1>is you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because maybe it'll never work</v>

100
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>and then it would depend on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

102
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have enough money to replace it?</v>

103
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>And how much trouble will you run into</v>
<v Speaker 1>practically speaking,</v>

104
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>if you use that money to replace it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it might also depend on,</v>

105
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your baseline levels of neuroticism</v>

106
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>because what a neuroticism neuroticism</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

107
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 1>it's the negative emotion factor in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>big five.</v>

108
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 1>What neuroticism is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

109
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

110
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a role of the genetic dice which</v>
<v Speaker 1>says that your body should output x</v>

111
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:09.701
<v Speaker 1>amount of physiological energy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation for energy in response to x</v>

112
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>amount of disruption.</v>

113
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 1>And X varies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

114
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're calibrated for a</v>

115
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>dangerous environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on average,</v>

116
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary design dice has</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed your genetic system so that</v>

117
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>you're much more reactive to a normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>list or punishing things,</v>

118
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.710
<v Speaker 1>anomalous or threatening things more</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately punishing as well than the</v>

119
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 1>typical person might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

120
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:36.620
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

121
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that wrong?</v>

122
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Is there something wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's nothing wrong with</v>

123
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it turns out that on average,</v>

124
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 1>the environment tends to be much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous than the typical human</v>

125
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

126
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:53.270
<v Speaker 1>now it might be kind of rough on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have a nervous system</v>

127
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>that's high in neuroticism when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually not at that much risk,</v>

128
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there'd be a mismatch between the</v>

129
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 1>genetic roll of the dice and the average</v>
<v Speaker 1>safety of the environment.</v>

130
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern environments are pretty safe.</v>

131
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>So we all worry about being anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is funny because we're anxious</v>

132
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 1>about being anxious and the reason we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can afford to be anxious about being</v>

133
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 1>anxious is because we actually don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that many punishments</v>

134
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 1>compared to what we might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced 120 years ago.</v>

135
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the average daily income incorrect</v>

136
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 1>to dollars for people in North America</v>
<v Speaker 1>was under a dollar a day,</v>

137
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was hard.</v>

138
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.220
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

139
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.340
<v Speaker 1>your neuroticism is one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that helps determine how much upset</v>

140
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:43.460
<v Speaker 1>you should experience per unit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty or threat.</v>

141
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing is your status among other</v>

142
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:49.970
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>

143
00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else should determine how anxious</v>

144
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 1>you get when something you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens?</v>

145
00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:55.910
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

146
00:07:55.911 --> 00:08:00.890
<v Speaker 1>your competence and your competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking should be how good on</v>

147
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:05.810
<v Speaker 1>average are you compared to other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>at dealing with problems when they</v>

148
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:06.644
<v Speaker 1>arise.</v>

149
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.500
<v Speaker 1>And so competence is actually one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

150
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

151
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Cognitive elements of what you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>call self esteem,</v>

152
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it turns out that you're pretty good</v>

153
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:22.301
<v Speaker 1>at problem solving or it turns out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually have a very wide network of</v>

154
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 1>social resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically boils down to the same</v>

155
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:26.370
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

156
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.460
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter if you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve a problem,</v>

157
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.650
<v Speaker 1>if you know someone who can solve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

158
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:36.100
<v Speaker 1>So social network and intrinsic</v>
<v Speaker 1>computational resources are comparable</v>

159
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:39.110
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you turn out to be a good problem</v>

160
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 1>solver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then on average you should be less upset</v>

161
00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:45.710
<v Speaker 1>when something is upsetting than someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who isn't a good problem solver.</v>

162
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that makes sense.</v>

163
00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:55.901
<v Speaker 1>I presumed now here's something I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been thinking for a long time and</v>

164
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of debate about this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relevant literature.</v>

165
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 1>The terror management people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

166
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 1>they claim that people get anxious</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're afraid of death.</v>

167
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:14.130
<v Speaker 1>at a psychological level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's lurking at the back of their minds</v>

169
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an existential problem and I</v>

170
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 1>suppose that's because death is one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those threats that threatens you right</v>

171
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 1>at the very top of your hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

172
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Good person and dead person don't go</v>
<v Speaker 1>well together.</v>

173
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.240
<v Speaker 1>So death threatens the entire hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very anxiety provoking.</v>

174
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.670
<v Speaker 1>That seems quite reasonable as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>

175
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing that happens in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>terror management theorists,</v>

176
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 1>theories which are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are variants of the Freud Freud in</v>

177
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a further</v>

178
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.140
<v Speaker 1>claim made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that</v>

179
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.630
<v Speaker 1>belief systems protect you against death</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

180
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a complicated claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly it,</v>

181
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is extracted from Freud's observation</v>

182
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:09.060
<v Speaker 1>that religious systems are protective</v>
<v Speaker 1>against death anxiety.</v>

183
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:11.770
<v Speaker 1>He actually thought they were neurotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>protections against dense,</v>

184
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.390
<v Speaker 1>that they have anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was sort of like,</v>

185
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.430
<v Speaker 1>like a primitive faith in the ability of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the father roughly speaking to solve the</v>

186
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:23.760
<v Speaker 1>problem and protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he thought it was a projection of the</v>

187
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 1>infant tile world onto the broader world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and powerful critique.</v>

188
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes it's true and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>death anxiety people,</v>

189
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:37.560
<v Speaker 1>the terror management people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically developed their theories from</v>

190
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:42.561
<v Speaker 1>a book by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book's called the denial of death.</v>

191
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember the author in a moment</v>

192
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

193
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:54.170
<v Speaker 1>The theory was broadened out to to</v>
<v Speaker 1>propose that your belief systems as</v>

194
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:58.320
<v Speaker 1>such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I provided you with that protection and</v>

195
00:10:58.321 --> 00:11:00.450
<v Speaker 1>then there was a bit of a variation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that theory,</v>

196
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:05.451
<v Speaker 1>which was your vision of yourself as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>illusory climber upon value hierarchy</v>

197
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.730
<v Speaker 1>also protected you now exactly how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>protected you.</v>

198
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 1>It was never really explained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not taking issue with Becker.</v>

199
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Ernest Becker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Becker,</v>

200
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:16.050
<v Speaker 1>who wrote the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Becker is a smart guy.</v>

201
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerously wrong,</v>

202
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a great book.</v>

203
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of great books.</v>

204
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:22.284
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

205
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.180
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're wrong and an extraordinarily</v>

206
00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 1>interesting way and that makes them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can make them a great book.</v>

207
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I think Becker's wrong because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumes that are all everything we do to</v>

208
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:35.910
<v Speaker 1>cope with death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety is actually an illusion and I</v>

209
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:38.550
<v Speaker 1>think that's a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible idea.</v>

210
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:42.000
<v Speaker 1>It's extraordinarily dangerous idea and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also don't believe it's true for</v>

211
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:44.430
<v Speaker 1>reasons I'll talk to you about later</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

212
00:11:44.431 --> 00:11:49.431
<v Speaker 1>you can sort of see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then we can lay that on top of the</v>

213
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.650
<v Speaker 1>expectations theory in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

214
00:11:52.651 --> 00:11:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Because basically what the expectancy</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory people do do like gray is they</v>

215
00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 1>assume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

216
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 1>novelty itself is both threatening and</v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive rewarding.</v>

217
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's threatening because God only</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what might happen to you if you</v>

218
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:12.100
<v Speaker 1>run into something novel and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has an incentive reward element</v>

219
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 1>because if you dig around in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>novelty,</v>

220
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.800
<v Speaker 1>you never know what sort of treasure you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might bring to the surface and so people</v>

221
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:22.120
<v Speaker 1>have an ambivalent relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>novelty and I think you can actually</v>

222
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:24.790
<v Speaker 1>understand how that ambivalent</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship works.</v>

223
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.810
<v Speaker 1>If you think about the hierarchy again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's the,</v>

224
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.300
<v Speaker 1>here's the rough proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If an enormously emerges at the lowest</v>

225
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest resolution level,</v>

226
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 1>then it's sort of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

227
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.240
<v Speaker 1>so a baby might be playing with a fork</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

228
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.030
<v Speaker 1>find out that the forte makes a tinging</v>
<v Speaker 1>noise when he hits it on the table.</v>

229
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't terrify the baby.</v>

230
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.660
<v Speaker 1>It's funny though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you see babies on youtube</v>

231
00:12:53.661 --> 00:12:56.470
<v Speaker 1>now go absolutely pick it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely terrified if their mothers</v>

232
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:58.490
<v Speaker 1>sneezes or sometimes if she laughs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

233
00:12:58.491 --> 00:13:01.310
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever for if the baby's sort of</v>

234
00:13:01.311 --> 00:13:04.100
<v Speaker 1>mastered a fork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the fact that it makes a ticking</v>

235
00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:08.210
<v Speaker 1>noise is gonna make them curious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an incentive reward phenomena</v>

236
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.040
<v Speaker 1>more than frightened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:13:10.041 --> 00:13:12.890
<v Speaker 1>it's going to depend to some degree on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby's level of neuroticism.</v>

238
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.790
<v Speaker 1>And it might also depend on how close</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby is to the mother because it</v>

239
00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:21.710
<v Speaker 1>actually turns out that maternal</v>
<v Speaker 1>proximity proximity more dilates the</v>

240
00:13:21.711 --> 00:13:25.550
<v Speaker 1>expression of negative emotion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>children and touch really does that by</v>

241
00:13:25.551 --> 00:13:27.140
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite cool.</v>

242
00:13:27.141 --> 00:13:30.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's that strict site that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct physical physiology touches</v>

243
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.250
<v Speaker 1>calming and it's also analgesic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite cool.</v>

244
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.010
<v Speaker 1>So it quells pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

245
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.950
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby is making this ticking noise</v>

246
00:13:39.951 --> 00:13:42.290
<v Speaker 1>and he finds that quite interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it never happened before.</v>

247
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.680
<v Speaker 1>And so he's curious enough about it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>replicate it,</v>

248
00:13:45.681 --> 00:13:50.090
<v Speaker 1>to do it again and he's under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of his psychomotor approach</v>

249
00:13:50.091 --> 00:13:52.290
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they mediate exploration as well,</v>

250
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.020
<v Speaker 1>positive promotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

251
00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great big dog comes bounding in,</v>

252
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.270
<v Speaker 1>well the dog has teeth and it's big and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

253
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's got a deep bark and all that.</v>

254
00:14:05.671 --> 00:14:10.671
<v Speaker 1>So it's associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with unexpected movement power and</v>

255
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.010
<v Speaker 1>predatory features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

256
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.640
<v Speaker 1>lots of babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say toddlers will run and hide</v>

257
00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:21.430
<v Speaker 1>behind their mother that's a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>more novelty than they can really</v>

258
00:14:21.431 --> 00:14:23.560
<v Speaker 1>tolerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think that whether you</v>

259
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:27.860
<v Speaker 1>find something positive or negative when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a normal plus,</v>

260
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.650
<v Speaker 1>depends on how high up in the hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>the threat apparently exists.</v>

261
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's another corollary.</v>

262
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Let's assume that before you build your</v>
<v Speaker 1>map of the world,</v>

263
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.710
<v Speaker 1>which you could think about as a map of</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectancy or you think about as a map</v>

264
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:52.711
<v Speaker 1>of desire or of how to fulfill desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could think about it as a map of</v>

265
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:58.640
<v Speaker 1>how to organize your body and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts in the world so that when you</v>

266
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 1>express that in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world delivers you what it wants.</v>

267
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.510
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the most accurate</v>
<v Speaker 1>terminology.</v>

268
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

269
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.083
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

270
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.380
<v Speaker 1>the idea there is that as you build up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and differentiate this map,</v>

271
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:13.851
<v Speaker 1>you bring the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

272
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:18.770
<v Speaker 1>normally under control because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce it from God only knows what it is</v>

273
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.180
<v Speaker 1>to something you can either use or</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore and that regulates your nervous</v>

274
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:28.181
<v Speaker 1>system chronically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the a priori phenomena is novelty and</v>

275
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 1>that would be equivalent to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists thing that shines</v>

276
00:15:34.911 --> 00:15:35.744
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

277
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Same idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different derivation,</v>

278
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 1>and then you build a model that inhibits</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

279
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:48.550
<v Speaker 1>and the rule is the mortal inhibits it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if when you act out the model,</v>

280
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:53.030
<v Speaker 1>it delivers what you want it to deliver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of a form of pragmatism</v>

281
00:15:53.031 --> 00:15:56.180
<v Speaker 1>from a philosophical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you understand that.</v>

282
00:15:56.181 --> 00:16:01.181
<v Speaker 1>So then the next proposition is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>model inhibits anxiety.</v>

283
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can see that that idea is akin</v>

284
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.640
<v Speaker 1>to the idea that your culture inhibits</v>
<v Speaker 1>death anxiety.</v>

285
00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Although I would say it's a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>delineated model and it explains,</v>

286
00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:20.270
<v Speaker 1>it better be part of the problem with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>death anxiety idea is that first of all,</v>

287
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 1>your culture is not in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

288
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Where's your culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your beliefs there?</v>

289
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.280
<v Speaker 1>It's around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

290
00:16:28.281 --> 00:16:30.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a big part of the culture,</v>

291
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.410
<v Speaker 1>the culture is the fact that you're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there,</v>

292
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically clones of each other doing</v>

293
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:41.240
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same thing in this room at</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same time.</v>

294
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the damn culture and it means</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can all ignore each other and</v>

295
00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:49.400
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the culture is all like it's the</v>

296
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:51.740
<v Speaker 1>floor beneath your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the ceiling over your head.</v>

297
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:53.270
<v Speaker 1>It's the car you drive to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

298
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the traffic light system that</v>

299
00:16:55.851 --> 00:17:00.140
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everybody attends to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense the matches,</v>

300
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:05.170
<v Speaker 1>the culture is actually the match</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the technologies and and webs of</v>

301
00:17:06.501 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 1>comprehension that the individuals use</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and the world.</v>

302
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.050
<v Speaker 1>It's the match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the phenomena itself and it's</v>

303
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:17.420
<v Speaker 1>certainly not only what you believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head,</v>

304
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.500
<v Speaker 1>which is a little too much on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic and it doesn't take into</v>

305
00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:26.070
<v Speaker 1>account the pragmatics of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the things we act out and the</v>

306
00:17:26.071 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 1>technological phenomena that exist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole web of game,</v>

307
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:32.900
<v Speaker 1>like structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are all embedded in.</v>

308
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.060
<v Speaker 1>So that would be a of an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

309
00:17:35.061 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 1>All this stuff's organized and very much</v>
<v Speaker 1>high order games and as long as it works</v>

310
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.670
<v Speaker 1>the way you think will work in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

311
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:47.270
<v Speaker 1>So that keeps your anxiety under control</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no mismatch,</v>

312
00:17:47.271 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 1>but even better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are you not afraid of death at</v>

313
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:51.661
<v Speaker 1>every moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

314
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 1>actually don't die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is even better than not being</v>

315
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:57.630
<v Speaker 1>afraid of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

316
00:17:57.631 --> 00:18:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Because you're not freezing to death in</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and there's no insurrection and the</v>

317
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 1>probability that you're going to get run</v>
<v Speaker 1>over on the way home.</v>

318
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty damn low as long as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the rules.</v>

319
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:11.211
<v Speaker 1>And so we should never remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Culture is culture is not only</v>

320
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:15.360
<v Speaker 1>represented in the interior space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not only beliefs,</v>

321
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.180
<v Speaker 1>its actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we should also remember very,</v>

322
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:21.000
<v Speaker 1>very carefully that it's distributed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

323
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back to the match mismatch idea.</v>

324
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:31.310
<v Speaker 1>So you've got this map of how your of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what effects your behaviors are going to</v>

325
00:18:31.771 --> 00:18:33.330
<v Speaker 1>have in the world when you implement</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

326
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:38.040
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes that match works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case you're pretty happy</v>

327
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.390
<v Speaker 1>because that's an incentive reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're moving towards your goal and it's</v>

328
00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:44.220
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

329
00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:47.730
<v Speaker 1>and this is a secondary thing that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviorists could never get a handle on</v>

330
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:50.940
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't use hierarchical</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations in this way.</v>

331
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.630
<v Speaker 1>One of the advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

332
00:18:54.631 --> 00:18:59.190
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're trying to pick</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone up and it's going pretty well.</v>

333
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two sources of reward there.</v>

334
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:05.790
<v Speaker 1>One is it's going pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second is you're the sort of person</v>

335
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:10.170
<v Speaker 1>who in this situation can implement a</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy that's going well,</v>

336
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only is it a signal that you're</v>

337
00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 1>making progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a signal that the structure that</v>

338
00:19:15.661 --> 00:19:18.960
<v Speaker 1>you're using to guide your actions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your perceptions while you're making</v>

339
00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:23.961
<v Speaker 1>progress is working so it validates the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole damn theory and you know that will</v>

340
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:27.540
<v Speaker 1>echo through your entire hierarchy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition.</v>

341
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.650
<v Speaker 1>It's especially true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used an amazing scenario because you</v>

342
00:19:31.651 --> 00:19:35.550
<v Speaker 1>know those are particularly relevant to</v>
<v Speaker 1>self esteem,</v>

343
00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:37.320
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a word that no one should ever</v>

344
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:39.110
<v Speaker 1>be allowed to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but will.</v>

345
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a word that we'll use in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation on the less so and it's hard</v>

346
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:46.800
<v Speaker 1>to tell exactly what's being reinforced</v>
<v Speaker 1>or reward.</v>

347
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Reward is feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reinforcement is how the structures that</v>

348
00:19:50.911 --> 00:19:55.470
<v Speaker 1>you're using to perceive and approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're perceiving and approaching</v>

349
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.680
<v Speaker 1>are asked to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

350
00:19:58.681 --> 00:20:01.590
<v Speaker 1>so most of the time if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something happens that's rewarding,</v>

351
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.730
<v Speaker 1>what that means is the structures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have been using to bring about that</v>

352
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:08.820
<v Speaker 1>outcome are actually cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To grow a bit,</v>

353
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:13.080
<v Speaker 1>gets stronger and Dopa means seems to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as well as making you feel good and</v>

354
00:20:13.081 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly this because you can</v>

355
00:20:17.491 --> 00:20:22.260
<v Speaker 1>separate reward and reinforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes I wonder if the goodness</v>

356
00:20:22.261 --> 00:20:27.261
<v Speaker 1>of feeling isn't associated with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thriving and flourishing of neural</v>

357
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:28.571
<v Speaker 1>tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

358
00:20:28.571 --> 00:20:32.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's an invitation to grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of die because if you're being</v>

359
00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:36.990
<v Speaker 1>punished and threatened all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the systems that are leading you to</v>

360
00:20:36.991 --> 00:20:39.210
<v Speaker 1>be in those situations do get</v>
<v Speaker 1>extinguished.</v>

361
00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get starved of what gives them life</v>

362
00:20:42.151 --> 00:20:46.020
<v Speaker 1>and they wither away or are inhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's very pleasant.</v>

363
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you got your map and you got the</v>

364
00:20:53.911 --> 00:20:58.911
<v Speaker 1>world and you're acting out this map and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully the match between your map of</v>

365
00:21:00.031 --> 00:21:05.031
<v Speaker 1>the world is such that the Mac matches</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and if it doesn't,</v>

366
00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:09.030
<v Speaker 1>you get into normally and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>anomaly can be of different sizes</v>

367
00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:14.430
<v Speaker 1>proportionate to the hierarchy and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>your emotional response is proportionate</v>

368
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:19.230
<v Speaker 1>to where the anomaly seems to rest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy as well.</v>

369
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Subject to your own neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

370
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.570
<v Speaker 1>and your own competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we could think of as somewhat</v>

371
00:21:24.571 --> 00:21:26.340
<v Speaker 1>separate phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

372
00:21:26.341 --> 00:21:31.341
<v Speaker 1>So then you can say the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't like other people who are</v>

373
00:21:32.971 --> 00:21:37.971
<v Speaker 1>foreigners say or different ethnicity or</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have different belief systems is</v>

374
00:21:38.971 --> 00:21:42.330
<v Speaker 1>because they appeared to challenge the</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity of that map.</v>

375
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:47.850
<v Speaker 1>And so because their belief systems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they act first of all aren't</v>

376
00:21:47.851 --> 00:21:49.500
<v Speaker 1>very well mapped by the map.</v>

377
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.600
<v Speaker 1>So you don't know what the hell those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are up to,</v>

378
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the differences may be much smaller</v>

379
00:21:53.821 --> 00:21:55.170
<v Speaker 1>than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what do you know?</v>

380
00:21:55.171 --> 00:21:56.940
<v Speaker 1>You don't know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

381
00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.330
<v Speaker 1>plus if their belief systems come with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

382
00:22:00.331 --> 00:22:04.140
<v Speaker 1>which they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has an indeterminant effect on the</v>

383
00:22:04.141 --> 00:22:05.370
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the map,</v>

384
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:09.510
<v Speaker 1>and it also has an indeterminant effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your position within the map.</v>

385
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.050
<v Speaker 1>And so then those theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a part of that is the theory</v>

386
00:22:13.051 --> 00:22:17.940
<v Speaker 1>that I developed in the book called maps</v>
<v Speaker 1>of meaning that theory proposes at least</v>

387
00:22:17.941 --> 00:22:22.941
<v Speaker 1>in part that the reason that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>cling to their belief systems the way</v>

388
00:22:23.611 --> 00:22:28.500
<v Speaker 1>they do is because of their belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems are disrupted at a high level,</v>

389
00:22:28.501 --> 00:22:30.420
<v Speaker 1>low resolution level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that the,</v>

390
00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of action or way the hell up the</v>

391
00:22:33.181 --> 00:22:38.070
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in terms of the definition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good or what constitutes a redeemed</v>

392
00:22:38.071 --> 00:22:39.660
<v Speaker 1>person or something like that.</v>

393
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Then that brings out tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>disruption and then you'd expect to</v>

394
00:22:44.641 --> 00:22:47.750
<v Speaker 1>phenomena from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd expect that people would be afraid</v>

395
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.360
<v Speaker 1>say a foreigners are a strange ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that they'd be kind of</v>

396
00:22:51.361 --> 00:22:54.960
<v Speaker 1>interested in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think generally our interactions</v>

397
00:22:54.961 --> 00:22:59.580
<v Speaker 1>with people who aren't like us generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>or we think aren't like us,</v>

398
00:22:59.581 --> 00:23:04.581
<v Speaker 1>whatever take place at a level where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more curiosity than fear.</v>

399
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be almost the definition of a</v>

400
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.470
<v Speaker 1>of a sustainable tolerant society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

401
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Everything around you is functioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>well enough so that if someone comes</v>

402
00:23:14.251 --> 00:23:17.160
<v Speaker 1>along who's different in belief or</v>
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>

403
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.590
<v Speaker 1>they're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna.</v>

404
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Assume they're there a fatal threat to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the integrity of your hierarchy and fall</v>

405
00:23:24.571 --> 00:23:28.140
<v Speaker 1>apart because of terror and curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly tear.</v>

406
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you can vary that theory a bit</v>

407
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:33.510
<v Speaker 1>and you can say,</v>

408
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:41.640
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not just anxiety that gets</v>

409
00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 1>inhibited when your belief systems are</v>
<v Speaker 1>structured to some degree,</v>

410
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's more primordial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe what happens is that it's more</v>

411
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:55.541
<v Speaker 1>akin to the generalized stress response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be a more primordial and</v>

412
00:23:57.591 --> 00:24:02.591
<v Speaker 1>global reaction to threat or anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the generalized stress response</v>

413
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.700
<v Speaker 1>basically occurs or seems to occur when</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hippocampus.</v>

414
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:12.110
<v Speaker 1>So the hippocampus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the map seems to be associated with the</v>

415
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:15.650
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the hippocampus is also the part of</v>

416
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:20.480
<v Speaker 1>the brain that takes what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>observing and transforms Osho show short</v>

417
00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:24.260
<v Speaker 1>term attention and transforms it into</v>
<v Speaker 1>medium to longterm memory.</v>

418
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:29.030
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hippocampus keeps track of what it</v>

419
00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:32.720
<v Speaker 1>is that you're seeing and then it stores</v>
<v Speaker 1>it there for awhile and then later it</v>

420
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:36.560
<v Speaker 1>integrates it into the generalized map</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then the hippocampus seems to</v>

421
00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:41.561
<v Speaker 1>sort of stay at that nexus of the map</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is likely represented cortically</v>

422
00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:46.130
<v Speaker 1>to a large degree and what's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in the world.</v>

423
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.710
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grades hypothesis,</v>

424
00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:53.270
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking is you're watching what</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes on in the world and the map is</v>

425
00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:57.770
<v Speaker 1>telling you what's supposed to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when something else happens,</v>

426
00:24:57.771 --> 00:25:02.660
<v Speaker 1>the hippocampus detects that that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mismatch and then somehow it makes you</v>

427
00:25:02.661 --> 00:25:05.090
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's how it seems to make you</v>

428
00:25:05.091 --> 00:25:08.030
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This I don't think was really laid out</v>

429
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.330
<v Speaker 1>well until vinegar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dova discovered it when she was really</v>

430
00:25:11.331 --> 00:25:13.790
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she was doing most of her work in</v>

431
00:25:13.791 --> 00:25:16.010
<v Speaker 1>the early sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she laid this out.</v>

432
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in the early two</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands.</v>

433
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.440
<v Speaker 1>What she showed was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

434
00:25:21.441 --> 00:25:23.510
<v Speaker 1>so you have this part in the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

435
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.750
<v Speaker 1>of your nervous system way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell down there called the reticular</v>

436
00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:28.760
<v Speaker 1>activating system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's old,</v>

437
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the thing upon which your sleep</v>

438
00:25:31.941 --> 00:25:36.060
<v Speaker 1>wake cycles dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and your consciousness without your</v>

439
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.300
<v Speaker 1>particular activating system is down.</v>

440
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're unplugged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a car accident way back</v>

441
00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:44.750
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a car accident and your head</v>

442
00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:49.610
<v Speaker 1>twists enough to shear off the neural</v>
<v Speaker 1>projections from the reticular</v>

443
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:52.670
<v Speaker 1>activating system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a permanent and irreversible</v>

444
00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:55.070
<v Speaker 1>coma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty interesting a because it</v>

445
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:58.130
<v Speaker 1>means your consciousness depends on</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's not new.</v>

446
00:25:58.131 --> 00:26:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Like you're relatively new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your cortical cap,</v>

447
00:26:01.071 --> 00:26:05.000
<v Speaker 1>but something that's so damn old that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there before your whole brain.</v>

448
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.090
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

449
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:14.080
<v Speaker 1>what vinegar Dover proposed was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hippocampus,</v>

450
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.960
<v Speaker 1>the hippocampus decides that's what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

451
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Roughly matches what you expect or what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

452
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:25.640
<v Speaker 1>which is more accurate than it tells the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reticular activating system not to be in</v>

453
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:29.180
<v Speaker 1>a panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the reticular activating system</v>

454
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.640
<v Speaker 1>controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to assume it's on all the</v>

455
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:33.920
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except when it's told to be off.</v>

456
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 1>The hippocampus says you can more or</v>
<v Speaker 1>less stay off right now because</v>

457
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.440
<v Speaker 1>everything's going according to plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>

458
00:26:39.441 --> 00:26:41.360
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things don't go according to plan.</v>

459
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 1>The hippocampus tells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reticular re releases the reticular</v>

460
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:49.980
<v Speaker 1>activating system from inhibition and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the reticular activating system</v>

461
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:55.190
<v Speaker 1>wakes up all your sub cortical circuits</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that stress and so wake up would</v>

462
00:26:56.251 --> 00:26:59.610
<v Speaker 1>mean get afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would also mean prepared to get</v>

463
00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:02.880
<v Speaker 1>the hell out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So prepare to panic and then it might</v>

464
00:27:02.881 --> 00:27:06.690
<v Speaker 1>also mean ready other motivational</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

465
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.530
<v Speaker 1>just in case they might be useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that also means shut off your</v>

466
00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:12.510
<v Speaker 1>immune system because who the hell cares</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that?</v>

467
00:27:12.511 --> 00:27:15.450
<v Speaker 1>If you're being chased by a tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know and pull all the sugar out of</v>

468
00:27:15.451 --> 00:27:18.260
<v Speaker 1>your blood because you bloody well are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to need the energy.</v>

469
00:27:18.261 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 1>And so it's an emergency preparedness</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

470
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:25.490
<v Speaker 1>So then you could say that when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter in a normally what happens is</v>

471
00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:31.530
<v Speaker 1>that your body generates an emergency</v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation state and the magnitude of</v>

472
00:27:31.531 --> 00:27:36.531
<v Speaker 1>that is proportional to your perception</v>
<v Speaker 1>of where the threat of what level the</v>

473
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:41.040
<v Speaker 1>threat corresponds to in your map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

474
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.320
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that makes sense.</v>

475
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's something wrong with that</v>

476
00:27:46.891 --> 00:27:51.670
<v Speaker 1>theory and that's very annoying because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good theory and,</v>

477
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.960
<v Speaker 1>and people have been coming at it from</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of angles and it sort of</v>

478
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:59.400
<v Speaker 1>matches the phenomenological ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually matches heidegger's thinking</v>

479
00:27:59.401 --> 00:28:03.570
<v Speaker 1>quite nicely and that it was derived as</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell virtually</v>

480
00:28:03.571 --> 00:28:06.510
<v Speaker 1>independently of heidegger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it goes along well with the</v>

481
00:28:06.511 --> 00:28:09.960
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience of anxiety and motivation</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general.</v>

482
00:28:09.961 --> 00:28:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a vicious theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the problem.</v>

483
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.770
<v Speaker 1>So for a long time people debated about</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell was authoritarian,</v>

484
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you could say after the Second</v>

485
00:28:28.101 --> 00:28:30.950
<v Speaker 1>World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people assumed that all the damn</v>

486
00:28:30.951 --> 00:28:32.810
<v Speaker 1>authoritarians were on the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

487
00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:36.350
<v Speaker 1>They were the fascists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say that's an</v>

488
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.940
<v Speaker 1>exaggeration of conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get all that seems kind of reasonable.</v>

489
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:42.770
<v Speaker 1>But then people pointed out later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

490
00:28:42.771 --> 00:28:44.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's not forget about the radical</v>

491
00:28:44.811 --> 00:28:48.440
<v Speaker 1>left wingers because by the time they</v>
<v Speaker 1>become communist dictators,</v>

492
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:51.840
<v Speaker 1>they seem pretty damn old press of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerant to.</v>

493
00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say we don't understand what</v>

494
00:28:55.251 --> 00:28:59.270
<v Speaker 1>happens when political systems get too</v>
<v Speaker 1>far in any direction,</v>

495
00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:04.690
<v Speaker 1>but there are models which are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>development that basically indicate that</v>

496
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:12.390
<v Speaker 1>imagine this is agreeable list and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is disagreeableness,</v>

497
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:14.100
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can think about them as a</v>

498
00:29:14.101 --> 00:29:16.470
<v Speaker 1>continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's not do that.</v>

499
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Let's twist them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they form a circle,</v>

500
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.790
<v Speaker 1>all right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll say,</v>

501
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:22.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how agreeable should you be?</v>

502
00:29:22.351 --> 00:29:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're disagreeable and this</v>

503
00:29:24.151 --> 00:29:26.760
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable things are going pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>well for you.</v>

504
00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:29.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're this agreeable,</v>

505
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.250
<v Speaker 1>well then you turn into Freud's</v>
<v Speaker 1>devouring mother,</v>

506
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so damn easy to get along with</v>

507
00:29:35.101 --> 00:29:36.060
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

508
00:29:36.061 --> 00:29:39.450
<v Speaker 1>You just do everything for your child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely everything forever.</v>

509
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.850
<v Speaker 1>And by that doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you undermine their capabilities and</v>

510
00:29:42.851 --> 00:29:44.910
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they remain locked in the eatables</v>

511
00:29:44.911 --> 00:29:47.620
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's like too much mercy and pity.</v>

512
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Or You could be like the tyrannical</v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

513
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.490
<v Speaker 1>like the crumb brother's father who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like completely disagreeable and</v>

514
00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:57.250
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily punitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is it ends up in the same</v>

515
00:29:57.251 --> 00:29:58.084
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

516
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.520
<v Speaker 1>they both ended up in a variation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

517
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:05.730
<v Speaker 1>And so these models seem to seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>promote the idea that if you run any</v>

518
00:30:05.741 --> 00:30:10.741
<v Speaker 1>virtue too far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns into a vice and all the vices</v>

519
00:30:10.811 --> 00:30:14.350
<v Speaker 1>have more common in each other with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than they do with everything else,</v>

520
00:30:14.351 --> 00:30:18.460
<v Speaker 1>with anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bad things are lumped together more</v>

521
00:30:18.461 --> 00:30:23.200
<v Speaker 1>because they're bad than they are by</v>
<v Speaker 1>what variant of bad they happen to be.</v>

522
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.070
<v Speaker 1>And we kind of know that because if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

523
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.520
<v Speaker 1>when we developed the big five,</v>

524
00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.750
<v Speaker 1>when people develop the big five because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't me,</v>

525
00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.200
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they threw out all the,</v>

526
00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:37.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluative words.</v>

527
00:30:37.851 --> 00:30:40.570
<v Speaker 1>That was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They threw out all the evaluative boards</v>

528
00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:45.290
<v Speaker 1>like good and evil disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anything that seemed to have a moral</v>

529
00:30:45.291 --> 00:30:49.130
<v Speaker 1>overtone was arbitrarily thrown out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there was actually some statistical</v>

530
00:30:49.131 --> 00:30:52.100
<v Speaker 1>reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the statistical reason is,</v>

531
00:30:52.101 --> 00:30:54.830
<v Speaker 1>is if you just leave the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

532
00:30:54.831 --> 00:30:57.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adjectives that represent someone as</v>

533
00:30:57.771 --> 00:31:01.730
<v Speaker 1>good or the adjectives that represent</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone as evil.</v>

534
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.760
<v Speaker 1>If you leave those in the damn analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get one whopping factor,</v>

535
00:31:07.161 --> 00:31:09.140
<v Speaker 1>which is something like good versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

536
00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:13.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's not that helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe anyways,</v>

537
00:31:13.061 --> 00:31:17.390
<v Speaker 1>so you throw all those things out so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't distort your,</v>

538
00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.540
<v Speaker 1>your analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's when you get the five</v>

539
00:31:20.541 --> 00:31:22.010
<v Speaker 1>factors revealing themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

540
00:31:22.011 --> 00:31:24.020
<v Speaker 1>but if you throw the pejorative items</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in,</v>

541
00:31:24.021 --> 00:31:26.930
<v Speaker 1>then you get this whopping single</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

542
00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things you should think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>

543
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:32.270
<v Speaker 1>especially those of you who are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be researchers,</v>

544
00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:36.740
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that the evaluative words</v>
<v Speaker 1>were thrown out of the big five</v>

545
00:31:36.741 --> 00:31:40.280
<v Speaker 1>adjective pool before the big five were</v>
<v Speaker 1>derived,</v>

546
00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:46.150
<v Speaker 1>makes the correlation between the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>five factors and psychopathology much</v>

547
00:31:47.301 --> 00:31:50.210
<v Speaker 1>weaker than it would otherwise be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

548
00:31:50.211 --> 00:31:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Because with psychopathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:56.420
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it can't be described without</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly good versus evil.</v>

550
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:57.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on the cycle,</v>

551
00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.980
<v Speaker 1>pathological condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're describing like</v>

552
00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.780
<v Speaker 1>what murderous pedophilia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

553
00:32:05.781 --> 00:32:09.980
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to use adjectives that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>loading pretty hard on the negative end</v>

554
00:32:09.981 --> 00:32:12.310
<v Speaker 1>of the adjective distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

555
00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:14.960
<v Speaker 1>when that's the case with most</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality disorders,</v>

556
00:32:14.961 --> 00:32:17.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there seems to be an element of</v>

557
00:32:17.331 --> 00:32:22.200
<v Speaker 1>misbehavior and many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the big five isn't correlated all</v>

558
00:32:22.201 --> 00:32:25.670
<v Speaker 1>that strongly with most measures of say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality disorders,</v>

559
00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:29.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's partly because all the words</v>
<v Speaker 1>that weren't correlate were thrown out</v>

560
00:32:29.271 --> 00:32:32.390
<v Speaker 1>before the analysis was done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's something you really,</v>

561
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.400
<v Speaker 1>really need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

562
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:39.010
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>back one step,</v>

563
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:43.550
<v Speaker 1>because I said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a.</v>

564
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.550
<v Speaker 1>That there's a problem with the theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I presented to you.</v>

565
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem.</v>

566
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.370
<v Speaker 1>We're going to assume for the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

567
00:32:54.371 --> 00:32:58.000
<v Speaker 1>the easiest place to localize</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism is on the right hand</v>

568
00:32:58.001 --> 00:32:59.230
<v Speaker 1>end of the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

569
00:32:59.231 --> 00:33:01.690
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to think about fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly.</v>

570
00:33:01.691 --> 00:33:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Speak in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that totalitarian governments</v>

571
00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.470
<v Speaker 1>tend towards fascism whether they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>left or right wing,</v>

572
00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.050
<v Speaker 1>but how to sort that out hasn't been</v>
<v Speaker 1>established yet.</v>

573
00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:16.080
<v Speaker 1>We don't exactly know what makes left</v>
<v Speaker 1>wing authoritarian is like right wing</v>

574
00:33:16.571 --> 00:33:18.160
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something does,</v>

575
00:33:18.161 --> 00:33:20.590
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to ignore that for a moment</v>

576
00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:22.630
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to concentrate on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right wing,</v>

577
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.170
<v Speaker 1>on the right wing side of the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conservative side of the spectrum.</v>

578
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Now we know some things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>

579
00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.340
<v Speaker 1>They don't like foreigners that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty tradition heavy.</v>

580
00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:38.980
<v Speaker 1>They tend to frown on non normal forms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sexual interaction or even on many</v>

581
00:33:40.091 --> 00:33:44.050
<v Speaker 1>normal forms of sexual interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may not even be that happy about</v>

582
00:33:44.051 --> 00:33:45.940
<v Speaker 1>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

583
00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:49.900
<v Speaker 1>so you could say the conservative is</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically trying to destabilize society</v>

584
00:33:49.901 --> 00:33:54.040
<v Speaker 1>so that there isn't a lot that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable that's going to go on or</v>

585
00:33:54.041 --> 00:33:57.820
<v Speaker 1>that's going to go on in the future and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're trying to maintain stability</v>

586
00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:02.290
<v Speaker 1>and you can give them some credit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because it's the match between your</v>

587
00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:06.760
<v Speaker 1>expectations and the way the world lays</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself out that basically inhibit your</v>

588
00:34:06.761 --> 00:34:07.660
<v Speaker 1>stress response.</v>

589
00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.980
<v Speaker 1>So stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

590
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:14.930
<v Speaker 1>it's something you probably can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate until you've had it's</v>

591
00:34:14.931 --> 00:34:16.970
<v Speaker 1>complete absence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:18.680
<v Speaker 1>while the liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

593
00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:19.850
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their position is.</v>

594
00:34:19.851 --> 00:34:20.684
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

595
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is stability gets old unless</v>

596
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:26.180
<v Speaker 1>you keep updating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know you can't be,</v>

597
00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:30.620
<v Speaker 1>you can't clamp too hard down on change</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you do then the system gets</v>

598
00:34:30.621 --> 00:34:33.540
<v Speaker 1>stale and outdated and the stability</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes away anyway.</v>

599
00:34:33.541 --> 00:34:37.220
<v Speaker 1>So you go out to allow some change and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some exploration and some growth.</v>

600
00:34:37.221 --> 00:34:40.880
<v Speaker 1>And then the battle is between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who wants to ability and the</v>

601
00:34:40.881 --> 00:34:43.730
<v Speaker 1>people who want change and neither of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them is right.</v>

602
00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.680
<v Speaker 1>It's the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>

603
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:47.990
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got to keep arguing about it</v>

604
00:34:47.991 --> 00:34:50.960
<v Speaker 1>because whether we should be more stable</v>
<v Speaker 1>or more plastic,</v>

605
00:34:50.961 --> 00:34:55.250
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking depends on the context</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the time.</v>

606
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.300
<v Speaker 1>And so that's something to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>too because a lot of you are going,</v>

607
00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.650
<v Speaker 1>most of your left wingers because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>

608
00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:06.660
<v Speaker 1>you're open and that's a very big marker</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the proclivity towards left wing</v>

609
00:35:06.661 --> 00:35:08.730
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're all going to be thinking</v>

610
00:35:08.731 --> 00:35:10.770
<v Speaker 1>that the left wingers are right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

611
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a primitive attitude if your</v>

612
00:35:13.681 --> 00:35:16.770
<v Speaker 1>scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because really what seems to happen is</v>

613
00:35:16.771 --> 00:35:20.730
<v Speaker 1>that both attitudes are right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both adapted to slightly</v>

614
00:35:20.731 --> 00:35:25.650
<v Speaker 1>different evolutionary conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are variants of the damn big</v>

615
00:35:25.651 --> 00:35:27.060
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those political beliefs.</v>

616
00:35:27.061 --> 00:35:31.140
<v Speaker 1>So liberal people are high in openness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and low in conscientiousness.</v>

617
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Whereas right wing people are low in</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness and high in conscientiousness.</v>

618
00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:40.260
<v Speaker 1>And there's implications to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is liberal start the companies for</v>

619
00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:42.270
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but conservatives run them.</v>

620
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.793
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

621
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:51.180
<v Speaker 1>art artists settled territory and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>real estate values rise.</v>

622
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.420
<v Speaker 1>They're very open people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the conservatives swoop in and</v>

623
00:35:54.421 --> 00:35:56.650
<v Speaker 1>monetize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kinda hard on artists,</v>

624
00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:01.410
<v Speaker 1>but my point is is that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic between these two positions that</v>

625
00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:06.000
<v Speaker 1>has to be maintained dynamically in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order for the system to survive because</v>

626
00:36:06.001 --> 00:36:08.790
<v Speaker 1>you need to stabilize the damn thing so</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't fall apart,</v>

627
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.360
<v Speaker 1>but you have to keep it adapted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>continual change.</v>

628
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.710
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you can figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of that should be done on either</v>

629
00:36:16.711 --> 00:36:20.970
<v Speaker 1>side is to keep talking to the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't like because it's the</v>

630
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:24.300
<v Speaker 1>only way to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people pull this way and some</v>

631
00:36:24.301 --> 00:36:28.680
<v Speaker 1>people pull the other way and we hope</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the middle of the polling basically</v>

632
00:36:28.681 --> 00:36:33.681
<v Speaker 1>matches the line of optimal progression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a much better way of thinking</v>

633
00:36:33.901 --> 00:36:35.520
<v Speaker 1>about democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

634
00:36:35.521 --> 00:36:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so back to the problem.</v>

635
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is if you take this damn</v>

636
00:36:45.161 --> 00:36:50.161
<v Speaker 1>model and you think about conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna think those people should</v>

637
00:36:51.761 --> 00:36:54.610
<v Speaker 1>be higher in neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if that,</v>

638
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.750
<v Speaker 1>if their defining characteristic is</v>
<v Speaker 1>inability to tolerate it normally or one</v>

639
00:36:58.751 --> 00:37:01.510
<v Speaker 1>of their defining characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd think,</v>

640
00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be more timid.</v>

641
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.650
<v Speaker 1>On average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have more depression,</v>

642
00:37:05.651 --> 00:37:09.010
<v Speaker 1>they should be more anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have more negative emotion</v>

643
00:37:09.011 --> 00:37:09.890
<v Speaker 1>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'd.</v>

644
00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:13.330
<v Speaker 1>You'd think you'd see some reflection of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in neuroticism,</v>

645
00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:15.933
<v Speaker 1>but you don't</v>

646
00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.620
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

647
00:37:18.621 --> 00:37:21.500
<v Speaker 1>liberals seemed to be a little more</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurotic than conservatives,</v>

648
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:26.330
<v Speaker 1>so and in fact the most neurotic people</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be male liberals,</v>

649
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:28.940
<v Speaker 1>so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

650
00:37:28.941 --> 00:37:31.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could salvage the old theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you could say,</v>

651
00:37:31.161 --> 00:37:33.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the damn conservatives are so protected</v>

652
00:37:33.141 --> 00:37:38.141
<v Speaker 1>by the radiology that they mask their</v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying neuroticism so well that it</v>

653
00:37:38.931 --> 00:37:42.050
<v Speaker 1>actually reverses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're stupid theory can predict</v>

654
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:45.980
<v Speaker 1>the reverse of what it should predict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's not a very good theory and so</v>

655
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.510
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know you're pushing your luck at</v>

656
00:37:50.511 --> 00:37:51.770
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better to think,</v>

657
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:53.270
<v Speaker 1>hm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something screwy here.</v>

658
00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Something's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's also conservatives</v>

659
00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:02.180
<v Speaker 1>score higher in in wellbeing measures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing,</v>

660
00:38:02.181 --> 00:38:05.240
<v Speaker 1>which is basically extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minus neuroticism,</v>

661
00:38:05.241 --> 00:38:07.720
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With maybe a bit of conscientiousness</v>

662
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:12.470
<v Speaker 1>thrown in and they're conscientious</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior does tend to make their life</v>

663
00:38:12.471 --> 00:38:16.100
<v Speaker 1>turn out more stable across time so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're less likely conscientious.</v>

664
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:16.821
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

665
00:38:16.821 --> 00:38:21.821
<v Speaker 1>are less likely to get divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to reconcile the fact that</v>

666
00:38:22.821 --> 00:38:27.020
<v Speaker 1>those damn conservatives keep insisting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not neurotic with the</v>

667
00:38:27.021 --> 00:38:30.410
<v Speaker 1>theories that predict well they have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be because the reason they're so rigid,</v>

668
00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:33.530
<v Speaker 1>especially if you've cranked their</v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs over to the right is because</v>

669
00:38:33.531 --> 00:38:36.480
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of foreigners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new ideas and you know,</v>

670
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:39.520
<v Speaker 1>all the sorts of things that right</v>
<v Speaker 1>wingers are hypothetically afraid of,</v>

671
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.860
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they actually seem to be like,</v>

672
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.010
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they report that they're happier.</v>

673
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:45.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you could say,</v>

674
00:38:45.821 --> 00:38:46.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's naive,</v>

675
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:50.620
<v Speaker 1>happiness and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't say those things after you</v>

676
00:38:50.621 --> 00:38:51.730
<v Speaker 1>make the finding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

677
00:38:51.731 --> 00:38:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Because you're explaining it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to predict the damn thing.</v>

678
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:59.560
<v Speaker 1>You can backfill your theory later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

679
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:02.620
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are higher than</v>

680
00:39:02.621 --> 00:39:05.470
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying,</v>

681
00:39:05.471 --> 00:39:07.210
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell does that have to do with</v>

682
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:09.280
<v Speaker 1>emotional regulation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

683
00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:10.120
<v Speaker 1>when you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

684
00:39:10.121 --> 00:39:11.420
<v Speaker 1>they make more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are there,</v>

685
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:15.410
<v Speaker 1>their lives are more stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the external manifestations of the</v>

686
00:39:15.411 --> 00:39:19.000
<v Speaker 1>society that they encompass themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>in are more stable,</v>

687
00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:21.220
<v Speaker 1>so there's not as much normally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

688
00:39:21.221 --> 00:39:24.870
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However now and that's,</v>

689
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.560
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it may be even,</v>

690
00:39:26.561 --> 00:39:27.394
<v Speaker 1>it's part of it.</v>

691
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:33.430
<v Speaker 1>About seven years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some work with one of my students,</v>

692
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:35.560
<v Speaker 1>call Indian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a lot of this.</v>

693
00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had recognized by that time that</v>

694
00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.840
<v Speaker 1>the psychometric that the big five</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to be psychometrically</v>

695
00:39:44.841 --> 00:39:49.841
<v Speaker 1>differentiated or maybe more than it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>because at that point that the stage was</v>

696
00:39:50.001 --> 00:39:52.550
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were the big five that usually</v>

697
00:39:52.551 --> 00:39:57.551
<v Speaker 1>measured by an instrument called the neo</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the neo pii or the Neil Pei revised.</v>

698
00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:02.420
<v Speaker 1>You've got your five factors and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of them were broken down into what</v>

699
00:40:02.421 --> 00:40:06.470
<v Speaker 1>they called facet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were sub sections of the each</v>

700
00:40:06.471 --> 00:40:09.350
<v Speaker 1>trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with the damn facets as</v>

701
00:40:09.351 --> 00:40:11.300
<v Speaker 1>they weren't empirically derived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

702
00:40:11.301 --> 00:40:13.490
<v Speaker 1>the factors were derived from factor</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

703
00:40:13.491 --> 00:40:17.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just more or less arbitrary</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics or at least objective</v>

704
00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.660
<v Speaker 1>statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the facets where like a guess.</v>

705
00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:22.370
<v Speaker 1>And we thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

706
00:40:22.371 --> 00:40:25.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't rely on statistical reasoning</v>

707
00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.360
<v Speaker 1>to formulate the major part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

708
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Then just gas sat the higher resolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>detail,</v>

709
00:40:31.361 --> 00:40:36.361
<v Speaker 1>so calling factor analyzed our data set</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Ip Ip,</v>

710
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:42.010
<v Speaker 1>which is the international pool of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's item pool in international</v>

711
00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.880
<v Speaker 1>ip Ip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it stands for.</v>

712
00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:50.180
<v Speaker 1>A guy named Lou Goldberg put it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>online and he was one of the founders of</v>

713
00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:53.060
<v Speaker 1>the big five theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adjective form of the Big Five</v>

714
00:40:53.061 --> 00:40:55.460
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Colin factor and analyze that very</v>

715
00:40:55.461 --> 00:40:59.300
<v Speaker 1>carefully and what he found in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated factor analysis was that</v>

716
00:40:59.301 --> 00:41:03.620
<v Speaker 1>you could take each of the big five and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could break them weirdly enough into</v>

717
00:41:03.621 --> 00:41:05.930
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So each of the big five had to.</v>

718
00:41:05.931 --> 00:41:10.931
<v Speaker 1>So extroversion had enthusiasm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness and then neuroticism had</v>

719
00:41:11.931 --> 00:41:16.910
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal and volatility and actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some evidence showing that those</v>

720
00:41:16.911 --> 00:41:20.180
<v Speaker 1>actually have different neurological</v>
<v Speaker 1>underpinnings was quite cool.</v>

721
00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:25.840
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness factors out into</v>
<v Speaker 1>politeness and compassion and liberals</v>

722
00:41:27.471 --> 00:41:30.020
<v Speaker 1>are higher on compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the bleeding heart.</v>

723
00:41:30.021 --> 00:41:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Liberal and Conservatives are higher on</v>
<v Speaker 1>politeness.</v>

724
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.170
<v Speaker 1>If you mangled the two together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get any difference in</v>

725
00:41:36.171 --> 00:41:38.660
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness between the political</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>

726
00:41:38.661 --> 00:41:41.630
<v Speaker 1>but if you separate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the liberals are compassionate and</v>

727
00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:46.400
<v Speaker 1>the Conservatives are polite and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that politeness may be the more</v>

728
00:41:46.401 --> 00:41:48.870
<v Speaker 1>conforming end of agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

729
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:49.860
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

730
00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Nan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness.</v>

731
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:52.940
<v Speaker 1>This is a good one.</v>

732
00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness seems to fragment into openness</v>

733
00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:05.891
<v Speaker 1>to experience and intellect and openness</v>
<v Speaker 1>to experience predicts whether you're</v>

734
00:42:06.561 --> 00:42:11.120
<v Speaker 1>going to take the humanities versus the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sciences and it's the factor that's most</v>

735
00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:16.121
<v Speaker 1>strongly associated with artistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity and aesthetic sensibility and</v>

736
00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:19.700
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical idiation and</v>

737
00:42:19.701 --> 00:42:23.000
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial ability because</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs load with the bloody</v>

738
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:25.010
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty hard on your basic</v>

739
00:42:25.011 --> 00:42:26.270
<v Speaker 1>conservative capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

740
00:42:26.271 --> 00:42:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Because they'd rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that way,</v>

741
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:31.970
<v Speaker 1>but it does turn out that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works out and then</v>

742
00:42:31.971 --> 00:42:35.540
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness fragments into</v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness,</v>

743
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.780
<v Speaker 1>which we do not understand at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

744
00:42:38.781 --> 00:42:43.340
<v Speaker 1>We just don't have no idea what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>trait is like.</v>

745
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Why do people work hard towards their</v>
<v Speaker 1>goals?</v>

746
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:51.820
<v Speaker 1>We can't find a single bloody laboratory</v>
<v Speaker 1>task that industrious people do better</v>

747
00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:56.210
<v Speaker 1>than non industrious people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite the fact that industriousness is</v>

748
00:42:56.211 --> 00:42:59.270
<v Speaker 1>an excellent predictor of longterm life</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcomes,</v>

749
00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.620
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

750
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't boil that down to a task in the</v>

751
00:43:03.111 --> 00:43:05.330
<v Speaker 1>lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had people do things like count</v>

752
00:43:05.331 --> 00:43:06.620
<v Speaker 1>ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends,</v>

753
00:43:06.621 --> 00:43:08.090
<v Speaker 1>ams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and use in many,</v>

754
00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:12.800
<v Speaker 1>many sentences a count the use Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd think that that would be something</v>

755
00:43:12.801 --> 00:43:15.260
<v Speaker 1>that an industrious conservative could</v>
<v Speaker 1>get right into,</v>

756
00:43:15.261 --> 00:43:16.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

757
00:43:16.371 --> 00:43:20.900
<v Speaker 1>there's no effect whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can find some things that industrious</v>

758
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:24.740
<v Speaker 1>and conscientious people do worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have lab tests where they do</v>

759
00:43:24.741 --> 00:43:25.960
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

760
00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.350
<v Speaker 1>that's something but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

761
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:33.350
<v Speaker 1>it's a great mystery and I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to crack that for like six years</v>

762
00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:38.090
<v Speaker 1>with no success at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We keep getting industrious people to do</v>

763
00:43:38.091 --> 00:43:42.770
<v Speaker 1>things and they seem just as useless as</v>
<v Speaker 1>non industrious people even though we</v>

764
00:43:42.771 --> 00:43:45.560
<v Speaker 1>know that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good predictor of academic</v>

765
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:46.311
<v Speaker 1>grades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

766
00:43:46.311 --> 00:43:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure it's the industrious</v>

767
00:43:48.861 --> 00:43:51.080
<v Speaker 1>component.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just about as powerful as Iq.</v>

768
00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Openness,</v>

769
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:58.210
<v Speaker 1>creativity and ICU.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intellect is roughly icu except the</v>

770
00:43:58.731 --> 00:44:01.370
<v Speaker 1>intellect measure of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of bad because if I asked you</v>

771
00:44:01.371 --> 00:44:03.650
<v Speaker 1>how smart you are on a scale from one to</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

772
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:07.220
<v Speaker 1>you'll tell me and that will correlate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your Iq,</v>

773
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.790
<v Speaker 1>but Iq measures way more accurate than</v>
<v Speaker 1>how smart you think you are.</v>

774
00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.730
<v Speaker 1>So that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a cool division.</v>

775
00:44:14.731 --> 00:44:17.790
<v Speaker 1>That's very useful division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

776
00:44:17.791 --> 00:44:21.870
<v Speaker 1>but on now on the conscientious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got orderliness and industrious</v>

777
00:44:21.871 --> 00:44:26.871
<v Speaker 1>now turns out that the conservatives are</v>
<v Speaker 1>more orderly than the liberals.</v>

778
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Not more industrious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's now you think,</v>

779
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of cool because one of the</v>

780
00:44:33.691 --> 00:44:36.120
<v Speaker 1>things you might say about the Germans</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

781
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:40.680
<v Speaker 1>is that they are orderly and you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly say that about Hitler because</v>

782
00:44:40.681 --> 00:44:45.270
<v Speaker 1>he was damn orderly and orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People we know conscientiousness is</v>

783
00:44:45.271 --> 00:44:48.750
<v Speaker 1>associated with anti immigration</v>
<v Speaker 1>attitudes and,</v>

784
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:53.990
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a moral stance against non normative</v>

785
00:44:54.001 --> 00:44:59.001
<v Speaker 1>forms of sexual behavior and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but conscientious people all,</v>

786
00:44:59.661 --> 00:45:03.870
<v Speaker 1>she'll wash their hands more and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards of hygiene are better and they</v>

787
00:45:03.871 --> 00:45:06.750
<v Speaker 1>are healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting.</v>

788
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:07.251
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

789
00:45:07.251 --> 00:45:11.910
<v Speaker 1>that's an unsettling lake because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's these positive things that are</v>

790
00:45:11.911 --> 00:45:13.830
<v Speaker 1>associated with orderliness that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

791
00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.950
<v Speaker 1>are obviously positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's these other things that</v>

792
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:21.240
<v Speaker 1>seem to be associated with stigma or</v>
<v Speaker 1>stigmatism and,</v>

793
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:23.910
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

794
00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:24.853
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

795
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:26.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong Ingroup,</v>

796
00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:30.450
<v Speaker 1>outgroup divisions and derogation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outgroup and all the things that you</v>

797
00:45:30.451 --> 00:45:34.740
<v Speaker 1>might see going extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologically in something like</v>

798
00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:36.570
<v Speaker 1>genocidal fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

799
00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was starting to sort this out,</v>

800
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I was reading Hitler's spontaneous talks</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the dinner table which were recorded</v>

801
00:45:47.041 --> 00:45:50.310
<v Speaker 1>over about a three year period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I came to realize</v>

802
00:45:50.311 --> 00:45:53.880
<v Speaker 1>was that he didn't really see him afraid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Jews and Gypsies.</v>

803
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.590
<v Speaker 1>He seemed disgusted by them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemptuous of them,</v>

804
00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:01.800
<v Speaker 1>which is not the same thing [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed.</v>

805
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:04.680
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't load on neuroticism or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much.</v>

806
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:08.640
<v Speaker 1>It loads on orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was a weird surprise because</v>

807
00:46:08.641 --> 00:46:11.010
<v Speaker 1>we thought all the damn negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions clumped together in</v>

808
00:46:11.011 --> 00:46:13.590
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was that and the problem,</v>

809
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:17.890
<v Speaker 1>but discussed which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which hadn't been studied very much load</v>

810
00:46:17.891 --> 00:46:21.050
<v Speaker 1>zone orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we thought hot,</v>

811
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.420
<v Speaker 1>we've got the biological basis of half</v>
<v Speaker 1>of conscientiousness.</v>

812
00:46:24.421 --> 00:46:27.420
<v Speaker 1>The biological basis is disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity.</v>

813
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:34.570
<v Speaker 1>That hasn't been published yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

814
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:38.730
<v Speaker 1>So I was thinking about that and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler washed his hands a lot.</v>

815
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:42.990
<v Speaker 1>He bathed four times a day and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>also a real</v>

816
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:48.660
<v Speaker 1>worshiper of willpower and orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have strong willpower is one of</v>

817
00:46:48.661 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 1>the things about anorexic people you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

818
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:55.650
<v Speaker 1>they're often anorexics are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange because they tend to be like</v>

819
00:46:55.651 --> 00:46:57.780
<v Speaker 1>high achieving women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>

820
00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.580
<v Speaker 1>They're usually smart and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually very,</v>

821
00:46:59.581 --> 00:47:02.820
<v Speaker 1>very dedicated and industrious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing is they're orderly.</v>

822
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:06.330
<v Speaker 1>And so what seems to happen with the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you this before with the</v>

823
00:47:06.331 --> 00:47:11.160
<v Speaker 1>anorexics is the disgust system goes off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wires and it's too much happens with</v>

824
00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:14.730
<v Speaker 1>obsessive compulsive disorder too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is usually classified as an</v>

825
00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:17.480
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorder but really doesn't seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be one.</v>

826
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's also an anxiety disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mostly what people with ocd hate is</v>

827
00:47:21.811 --> 00:47:22.920
<v Speaker 1>to be contaminated.</v>

828
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:28.170
<v Speaker 1>So I had to know CD client once who she</v>
<v Speaker 1>had lost her husband and her children</v>

829
00:47:28.171 --> 00:47:31.240
<v Speaker 1>and everything and she in the hospital</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she'd actually gone so far as to</v>

830
00:47:31.241 --> 00:47:36.241
<v Speaker 1>build like a pseudo airlock on her house</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that her children and her husband</v>

831
00:47:37.241 --> 00:47:40.180
<v Speaker 1>would have to decontaminate themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>before they entered the house,</v>

832
00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:41.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

833
00:47:41.181 --> 00:47:43.900
<v Speaker 1>And that was too much for her marriage</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sustain.</v>

834
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:49.590
<v Speaker 1>And whenever she was walking down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hall at the hospital and the guys,</v>

835
00:47:49.871 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 1>the janitors walked by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she flattened herself up against the</v>

836
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:53.314
<v Speaker 1>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

837
00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:55.360
<v Speaker 1>and then she'd run off and wash your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

838
00:47:55.361 --> 00:47:57.490
<v Speaker 1>And if you're really OCD is really out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of control,</v>

839
00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:00.250
<v Speaker 1>you wash your hands until the skin is</v>
<v Speaker 1>raw basically.</v>

840
00:48:00.251 --> 00:48:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Or until you run out of soap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you try running out of soap.</v>

841
00:48:03.731 --> 00:48:07.300
<v Speaker 1>When you're using a bar of soap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to wash your hands a lot or you</v>

842
00:48:07.301 --> 00:48:09.460
<v Speaker 1>shower until you run out of hot water.</v>

843
00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.520
<v Speaker 1>You can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're never cleaned enough.</v>

844
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.760
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing exposure therapy with her,</v>

845
00:48:15.761 --> 00:48:20.761
<v Speaker 1>which means you have to sort of make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person make contact with what they don't</v>

846
00:48:20.921 --> 00:48:23.180
<v Speaker 1>want to make contact with and you do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>step wise,</v>

847
00:48:23.181 --> 00:48:25.320
<v Speaker 1>like you just don't throw them into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage can,</v>

848
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:29.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get them to agree to,</v>

849
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:31.450
<v Speaker 1>to what degree they're willing to expose</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

850
00:48:31.451 --> 00:48:35.680
<v Speaker 1>And so this is what I could get her to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do if I took a garbage can that was new.</v>

851
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:40.830
<v Speaker 1>And I took a garbage bag that was new</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I put them over there and I gave her</v>

852
00:48:41.381 --> 00:48:45.070
<v Speaker 1>a pool cue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would touch the new garbage can with</v>

853
00:48:45.071 --> 00:48:46.930
<v Speaker 1>the new garbage bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the pool cue.</v>

854
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.630
<v Speaker 1>That was the best she could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even then,</v>

855
00:48:49.631 --> 00:48:53.020
<v Speaker 1>like I was talking to her perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal appearing person,</v>

856
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

857
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.370
<v Speaker 1>in many respects touch whack.</v>

858
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Like she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to that sake and she's going</v>

859
00:48:59.511 --> 00:49:03.490
<v Speaker 1>to wash your hands right now and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do re response prevention,</v>

860
00:49:03.491 --> 00:49:05.530
<v Speaker 1>which is why you don't get to wash your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

861
00:49:05.531 --> 00:49:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And so that turns out to be a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>awkward thing to do in the middle of a</v>

862
00:49:08.471 --> 00:49:12.430
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric ward because I was standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the door trying not to let her</v>

863
00:49:12.431 --> 00:49:14.950
<v Speaker 1>get to the bathroom and she was wanting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get to the bathroom.</v>

864
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:17.710
<v Speaker 1>So all the other psychiatric patients</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up and you know,</v>

865
00:49:17.711 --> 00:49:21.790
<v Speaker 1>they started accusing me of basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>being an authoritarian and interfering</v>

866
00:49:21.791 --> 00:49:24.070
<v Speaker 1>with her rights and it's wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing,</v>

867
00:49:24.071 --> 00:49:24.840
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

868
00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:29.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was she given me permission five minutes</v>

869
00:49:30.341 --> 00:49:34.900
<v Speaker 1>before when she was in the normal state</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mind and now she was retracting it.</v>

870
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:37.330
<v Speaker 1>So who the hell did I ever contract</v>
<v Speaker 1>with?</v>

871
00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:41.620
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is her now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't sell yourself into</v>

872
00:49:41.621 --> 00:49:44.080
<v Speaker 1>slavery roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that.</v>

873
00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe I was interfering with their</v>

874
00:49:47.171 --> 00:49:47.980
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

875
00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:52.870
<v Speaker 1>it's a tricky thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>while she was hospitalized,</v>

876
00:49:52.871 --> 00:49:55.410
<v Speaker 1>so obviously something had gone wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

877
00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.360
<v Speaker 1>you get the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it gives you an example of how</v>

878
00:49:58.361 --> 00:50:01.300
<v Speaker 1>powerful contamination concern can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

879
00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Now then there was a paper published in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plos one awhile back</v>

880
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:12.790
<v Speaker 1>looking at the prevalence of infectious</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases in route in countries around</v>

881
00:50:12.791 --> 00:50:15.160
<v Speaker 1>the world and then in provinces within</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

882
00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:19.780
<v Speaker 1>and then they measured the authoritarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>attitudes using an authoritarian</v>

883
00:50:19.781 --> 00:50:24.610
<v Speaker 1>attitudes scale logically enough and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they found was the higher the</v>

884
00:50:24.611 --> 00:50:27.770
<v Speaker 1>prevalence of infectious diseases in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>geographical locale,</v>

885
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:32.120
<v Speaker 1>the more authoritarian people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>locally in their individual political</v>

886
00:50:32.121 --> 00:50:34.880
<v Speaker 1>attitudes and the correlation wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>point two,</v>

887
00:50:34.881 --> 00:50:39.190
<v Speaker 1>which is the general correlation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>a personality trait and some phenomena.</v>

888
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:40.910
<v Speaker 1>Point two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point three,</v>

889
00:50:40.911 --> 00:50:42.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're really lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point five,</v>

890
00:50:42.471 --> 00:50:44.570
<v Speaker 1>if it's ICU with that's the best he ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

891
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:46.490
<v Speaker 1>It was like point seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

892
00:50:46.491 --> 00:50:48.320
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unbelievable.</v>

893
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.310
<v Speaker 1>It's something to do with contamination</v>
<v Speaker 1>and infection transmission,</v>

894
00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:56.420
<v Speaker 1>and so then I was thinking this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>really annoying because this whole</v>

895
00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.480
<v Speaker 1>expectation theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>

896
00:50:59.481 --> 00:51:01.470
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works at a neurological level.</v>

897
00:51:01.471 --> 00:51:04.910
<v Speaker 1>It works at neuro psychological level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can understand it pharmacologically,</v>

898
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:09.680
<v Speaker 1>it makes conceptual sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that it unites theories that</v>

899
00:51:09.681 --> 00:51:11.570
<v Speaker 1>were derived from all sorts of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

900
00:51:11.571 --> 00:51:16.010
<v Speaker 1>If it has all the classic elements of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful theory and and it's wrong,</v>

901
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.050
<v Speaker 1>and so then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

902
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:21.710
<v Speaker 1>what the hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its orderliness and discussed what is</v>

903
00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:24.950
<v Speaker 1>going on there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sticking point was I could</v>

904
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:25.790
<v Speaker 1>understand</v>

905
00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:32.660
<v Speaker 1>how your brain could calculate how upset</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should get when you hit an anomaly by</v>

906
00:51:33.541 --> 00:51:36.750
<v Speaker 1>referring to this hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That took me a long time to figure that</v>

907
00:51:36.751 --> 00:51:40.140
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 years probably to map that out</v>

908
00:51:40.141 --> 00:51:40.890
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

909
00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:44.790
<v Speaker 1>and then you know how neurotic you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how high in esteem you're held by</v>

910
00:51:44.791 --> 00:51:46.200
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by your,</v>

911
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:48.090
<v Speaker 1>the people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

912
00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:51.540
<v Speaker 1>But then what does disgust do about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

913
00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Disgust doesn't seem to undo your damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief system.</v>

914
00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can encounter something</v>

915
00:51:59.611 --> 00:52:01.050
<v Speaker 1>disgusting and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

916
00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:03.270
<v Speaker 1>you may be revolted by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

917
00:52:03.271 --> 00:52:05.640
<v Speaker 1>very physiological sensation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

918
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll even throw up if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's bad enough and maybe you'll be</v>

919
00:52:09.571 --> 00:52:12.270
<v Speaker 1>shocked to the point where you're damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>near traumatized,</v>

920
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:14.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's disgust related trauma,</v>

921
00:52:14.731 --> 00:52:18.900
<v Speaker 1>which we don't really understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to give up your</v>

922
00:52:18.901 --> 00:52:21.360
<v Speaker 1>damn beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Most of the time it doesn't seem to</v>

923
00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:25.380
<v Speaker 1>represent a direct challenge to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>validity of your,</v>

924
00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:28.830
<v Speaker 1>like Islam faith or Islamic faith or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

925
00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:34.160
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I was talking to one of my</v>

926
00:52:34.331 --> 00:52:36.730
<v Speaker 1>graduates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's graduate students this morning,</v>

927
00:52:36.731 --> 00:52:39.700
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to sort this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking,</v>

928
00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:42.520
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would happen?</v>

929
00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Here's an experiment we're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about running.</v>

930
00:52:44.321 --> 00:52:45.940
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell me what you think about this.</v>

931
00:52:45.941 --> 00:52:46.774
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

932
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:52.630
<v Speaker 1>we thought we would take people have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different range of appearance,</v>

933
00:52:52.631 --> 00:52:54.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from really not so beautiful too,</v>

934
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.740
<v Speaker 1>quite attractive and different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different races and different</v>

935
00:52:59.741 --> 00:53:02.230
<v Speaker 1>ethnicities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we would announce the</v>

936
00:53:02.231 --> 00:53:03.620
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

937
00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Jewish Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd show them a picture black,</v>

938
00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:11.560
<v Speaker 1>show them a picture Caucasian Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show them a picture and the pictures</v>

939
00:53:11.561 --> 00:53:15.190
<v Speaker 1>would vary in attractiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then what we're gonna do is we're</v>

940
00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:18.130
<v Speaker 1>going to morph them with snakes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats.</v>

941
00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:21.130
<v Speaker 1>So then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can take a morphing program,</v>

942
00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:22.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could,</v>

943
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I could make you like 10 percent snake</v>
<v Speaker 1>our percent wrapped.</v>

944
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.250
<v Speaker 1>You've seen that movies all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question would be,</v>

945
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:34.740
<v Speaker 1>would you be more likely a to see an</v>
<v Speaker 1>unattractive person as a rat or a snake?</v>

946
00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:38.130
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you be more likely to see a person</v>

947
00:53:38.131 --> 00:53:41.670
<v Speaker 1>who isn't a member of your ethnic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial group as a rat or a snake?</v>

948
00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's interesting because the thing</v>

949
00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:46.380
<v Speaker 1>to do with rats and snakes is get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

950
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a problem.</v>

951
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.750
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we thought we would also</v>

952
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:54.600
<v Speaker 1>measure how orderly people were to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that mediated,</v>

953
00:53:54.601 --> 00:53:59.130
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which they were willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive and be in place at perception.</v>

954
00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally whether this person was</v>
<v Speaker 1>rat or snake.</v>

955
00:54:02.131 --> 00:54:07.131
<v Speaker 1>Like we've got some other experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments that are of the same sort</v>

956
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.050
<v Speaker 1>device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's a great experiment.</v>

957
00:54:10.051 --> 00:54:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm really curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we'd have people rate them.</v>

958
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:15.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like how afraid are you of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>

959
00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:19.680
<v Speaker 1>How happy does this person make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how,</v>

960
00:54:19.681 --> 00:54:20.820
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

961
00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:23.310
<v Speaker 1>how contemptuous are you have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

962
00:54:23.311 --> 00:54:25.290
<v Speaker 1>how disgusted are you by this person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

963
00:54:25.291 --> 00:54:29.670
<v Speaker 1>a whole emotional response scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully what we would find is the</v>

964
00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:34.850
<v Speaker 1>orderly people were more contemptuous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and disgusted but not more afraid by the</v>

965
00:54:36.001 --> 00:54:40.590
<v Speaker 1>morphed faces and they would be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to categorize them as rat and</v>

966
00:54:40.591 --> 00:54:43.290
<v Speaker 1>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like especially if they were from a</v>

967
00:54:43.291 --> 00:54:48.180
<v Speaker 1>different ethnic group or race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a scary experiment,</v>

968
00:54:48.181 --> 00:54:50.890
<v Speaker 1>but it would allow us to distinguish</v>
<v Speaker 1>between fear and,</v>

969
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:52.590
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and contempt.</v>

970
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:58.070
<v Speaker 1>And then I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well still why do the hell do you care?</v>

971
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Why is the disgusting so important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell does it have to do with</v>

972
00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:07.430
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I was remembering maybe,</v>

973
00:55:07.431 --> 00:55:09.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this game doesn't even exist</v>

974
00:55:09.741 --> 00:55:11.810
<v Speaker 1>anymore because the world has changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I bet it does.</v>

975
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.700
<v Speaker 1>When I was a little kid in like grade</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

976
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:22.470
<v Speaker 1>we used to play this game in school and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game was,</v>

977
00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:25.170
<v Speaker 1>I think on the simpsons they call it</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooties,</v>

978
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 1>but we called it flees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we'd play this recess and some</v>

979
00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:32.280
<v Speaker 1>person would have fleas and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would chase you around and they touched</v>

980
00:55:32.281 --> 00:55:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you had fleas and everyone ran</v>

981
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:36.600
<v Speaker 1>away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the game often start,</v>

982
00:55:36.601 --> 00:55:40.530
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it was just spontaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often the game could take a vicious</v>

983
00:55:40.531 --> 00:55:43.860
<v Speaker 1>twist and one of the lower status kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the room would get,</v>

984
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:46.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accused of having fleas and that just</v>

985
00:55:46.501 --> 00:55:49.140
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be just a game that'd be a</v>

986
00:55:49.141 --> 00:55:53.160
<v Speaker 1>source of taunting and exclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you can remember games</v>

987
00:55:53.161 --> 00:55:55.380
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

988
00:55:55.381 --> 00:55:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

989
00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.750
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that shows all this political</v>

990
00:55:57.751 --> 00:56:00.660
<v Speaker 1>correctness hasn't done a goddamn thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to how children behave,</v>

991
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:02.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually that's a relief to me.</v>

992
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:03.900
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

993
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:07.560
<v Speaker 1>so then you think what the hell's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on there?</v>

994
00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.730
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing that's going out is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the kids are playing out the idea</v>

995
00:56:11.731 --> 00:56:14.280
<v Speaker 1>of contamination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

996
00:56:14.281 --> 00:56:17.460
<v Speaker 1>So let's say your contempt dibble and</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting,</v>

997
00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you,</v>

998
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:23.680
<v Speaker 1>you have syphilis because you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call your,</v>

999
00:56:23.681 --> 00:56:24.514
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1000
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:27.200
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dissolute and they botched and you</v>

1001
00:56:27.201 --> 00:56:29.350
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gone to the final stage and it's</v>

1002
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 1>just horrific.</v>

1003
00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:36.140
<v Speaker 1>So anybody who is going to look at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to have a reaction like this.</v>

1004
00:56:36.141 --> 00:56:36.711
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1005
00:56:36.711 --> 00:56:39.170
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna want to look away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1006
00:56:39.171 --> 00:56:40.070
<v Speaker 1>So then I was thinking,</v>

1007
00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:43.910
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you touch someone like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1008
00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:45.501
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1009
00:56:45.501 --> 00:56:46.370
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

1010
00:56:46.371 --> 00:56:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it for a minute.</v>

1011
00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1012
00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:50.960
<v Speaker 1>in a place where there's lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious diseases,</v>

1013
00:56:50.961 --> 00:56:54.260
<v Speaker 1>what happens is then you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not a good thing you know,</v>

1014
00:56:54.261 --> 00:56:58.460
<v Speaker 1>or if you're near anything corrupt like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a carcass that has been rotting,</v>

1015
00:56:58.461 --> 00:57:01.850
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to eat it because then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>die like you gotta be sensitive to</v>

1016
00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:05.990
<v Speaker 1>discussed because otherwise you'll run</v>
<v Speaker 1>into contamination and the contamination</v>

1017
00:57:05.991 --> 00:57:09.890
<v Speaker 1>will kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is how contagious is</v>

1018
00:57:09.891 --> 00:57:13.280
<v Speaker 1>contamination?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the issue.</v>

1019
00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:16.130
<v Speaker 1>So now you've put yourself in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

1020
00:57:16.131 --> 00:57:19.370
<v Speaker 1>so you're on a dating site and you find</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

1021
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:24.410
<v Speaker 1>and this might even be more powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially for women than for men because</v>

1022
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but women rank 85 percent of men as</v>

1023
00:57:28.821 --> 00:57:30.410
<v Speaker 1>below average in attractiveness.</v>

1024
00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Now men get the revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>

1025
00:57:33.171 --> 00:57:37.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to make a case that women</v>
<v Speaker 1>are more demanded when it comes to men</v>

1026
00:57:37.431 --> 00:57:38.780
<v Speaker 1>than men are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to women.</v>

1027
00:57:38.781 --> 00:57:40.580
<v Speaker 1>It's just they're demented in different</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

1028
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.200
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you think it's interesting</v>

1029
00:57:45.201 --> 00:57:47.150
<v Speaker 1>because I've watched my daughter go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through tinder,</v>

1030
00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of painful.</v>

1031
00:57:48.441 --> 00:57:49.221
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

1032
00:57:49.221 --> 00:57:49.761
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1033
00:57:49.761 --> 00:57:50.241
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

1034
00:57:50.241 --> 00:57:50.721
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>

1035
00:57:50.721 --> 00:57:51.531
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1036
00:57:51.531 --> 00:57:52.580
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's Kinda,</v>

1037
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:55.550
<v Speaker 1>she kinda thinks it's funny and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose it is,</v>

1038
00:57:55.551 --> 00:57:57.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's cruel as hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1039
00:57:57.021 --> 00:58:00.410
<v Speaker 1>If all these poor we easily guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just getting sorted into the,</v>

1040
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:03.320
<v Speaker 1>you should not be in the damn meeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool pile.</v>

1041
00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:04.911
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1042
00:58:04.911 --> 00:58:08.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's a fundamental judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should not be in the meeting pool.</v>

1043
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're off on a genocidal spree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what you're trying to do.</v>

1044
00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.390
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to prevent that.</v>

1045
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:15.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1046
00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying my daughter's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>genocidal tendencies,</v>

1047
00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:21.860
<v Speaker 1>although she probably does because she</v>
<v Speaker 1>is human by the way.</v>

1048
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:23.510
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1049
00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:28.810
<v Speaker 1>So now</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you've categorized some</v>

1050
00:58:29.181 --> 00:58:33.320
<v Speaker 1>person in there as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to respond to their</v>

1051
00:58:33.321 --> 00:58:38.321
<v Speaker 1>damn email and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've put them down as a one out of 10,</v>

1052
00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:39.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no,</v>

1053
00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:43.580
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then someone says you have to go out</v>

1054
00:58:43.581 --> 00:58:45.140
<v Speaker 1>with that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to act.</v>

1055
00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Ask that person out and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1056
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.390
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to react to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea?</v>

1057
00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing is I think you're going</v>

1058
00:58:52.091 --> 00:58:54.740
<v Speaker 1>to be angry at the person who's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>force you to do that.</v>

1059
00:58:54.741 --> 00:58:59.030
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be anger and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second thing is how are you going to</v>

1060
00:58:59.031 --> 00:59:02.330
<v Speaker 1>feel when you bring that person into</v>
<v Speaker 1>public with you,</v>

1061
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:05.180
<v Speaker 1>around your friends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1062
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:08.330
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is</v>

1063
00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:13.930
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel disgusted and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ashamed and the reason for that is</v>

1064
00:59:13.931 --> 00:59:18.770
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1065
00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:20.300
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's contaminating,</v>

1066
00:59:20.301 --> 00:59:23.030
<v Speaker 1>it's catching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then that puts the damn theories</v>

1067
00:59:23.031 --> 00:59:24.470
<v Speaker 1>together and this is why</v>

1068
00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:31.410
<v Speaker 1>if I forced you to go out with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's low status and will say low</v>

1069
00:59:31.631 --> 00:59:34.030
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll put the whole package together,</v>

1070
00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:37.180
<v Speaker 1>low attractiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low socioeconomic status,</v>

1071
00:59:37.181 --> 00:59:40.060
<v Speaker 1>no real hope for the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really unlikable.</v>

1072
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:42.670
<v Speaker 1>We can put all those sorts of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and you're going to think no</v>

1073
00:59:42.671 --> 00:59:45.340
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you bring that person out on a</v>

1074
00:59:45.341 --> 00:59:47.530
<v Speaker 1>date with all your friends and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1075
00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:51.130
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is up with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you're an eight,</v>

1076
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:54.490
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get to go visit five land</v>

1077
00:59:54.491 --> 00:59:56.590
<v Speaker 1>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1078
00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.410
<v Speaker 1>now what happens to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>

1079
00:59:59.411 --> 01:00:02.230
<v Speaker 1>This is where it gets tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know</v>

1080
01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>that you liked the lobster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a counter way down in the bottom of</v>

1081
01:00:10.401 --> 01:00:12.530
<v Speaker 1>your brain that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really old.</v>

1082
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>It's pre-cognitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's even pre emotional.</v>

1083
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.770
<v Speaker 1>It's way down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our reticular activating level.</v>

1084
01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:23.690
<v Speaker 1>And what it does is scan the world to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out where you are in the</v>

1085
01:00:23.691 --> 01:00:27.200
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and it actually matters</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're low,</v>

1086
01:00:27.201 --> 01:00:31.070
<v Speaker 1>then you die or you're stressed or your</v>
<v Speaker 1>children die.</v>

1087
01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:32.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

1088
01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:34.520
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's worrisome to you because</v>

1089
01:00:34.521 --> 01:00:37.550
<v Speaker 1>you're barely clinging onto the edge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence and you will only take</v>

1090
01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>impulsive pleasures because that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>longest span that you can count on</v>

1091
01:00:42.021 --> 01:00:47.021
<v Speaker 1>having pleasures over and it's rough at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom and you get low status mates</v>

1092
01:00:47.571 --> 01:00:52.571
<v Speaker 1>if you get any at all and it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you actually do not want to be there.</v>

1093
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:55.400
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas at the cop,</v>

1094
01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:56.600
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1095
01:00:56.601 --> 01:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get preferential access to</v>

1096
01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1097
01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:05.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's better to be there and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>say what you want about egalitarianism</v>

1098
01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of arguments to be held</v>
<v Speaker 1>on both sides,</v>

1099
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:12.110
<v Speaker 1>but given a choice you will go up rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than down.</v>

1100
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:19.930
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you associate with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's contaminated and it knocks your</v>

1101
01:01:20.121 --> 01:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>status down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now how does it do that?</v>

1102
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might do it a variety of ways.</v>

1103
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>You feel bad about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be low self esteem.</v>

1104
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:31.460
<v Speaker 1>So that means the part of your brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's evaluating you as a high status</v>

1105
01:01:31.461 --> 01:01:35.780
<v Speaker 1>competent being is now doubtful about</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you actually fit that</v>

1106
01:01:35.781 --> 01:01:38.180
<v Speaker 1>description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all your peers because</v>

1107
01:01:38.181 --> 01:01:40.600
<v Speaker 1>they're judging you like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they're basically doing is</v>

1108
01:01:40.601 --> 01:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>status evaluation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you like a lowly,</v>

1109
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:47.750
<v Speaker 1>a crumb brother who's absolutely outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meeting hierarchy completely?</v>

1110
01:01:47.751 --> 01:01:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Or are you like Mr Vampire billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the,</v>

1111
01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:51.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1112
01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.753
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1113
01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>dawn linen vampire billionaire who's at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pinnacle of generic female literary</v>

1114
01:02:00.331 --> 01:02:02.670
<v Speaker 1>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's basically the,</v>

1115
01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:07.820
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is is that if you take a</v>

1116
01:02:07.951 --> 01:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit</v>

1117
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>your serotonin level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall,</v>

1118
01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>what that does is increase your negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and decrease your positive</v>

1119
01:02:18.241 --> 01:02:22.770
<v Speaker 1>emotion and increase the probability</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when anything abnormal is so curves</v>

1120
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to have a generalized</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress response.</v>

1121
01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:29.280
<v Speaker 1>So that's the connection between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn theories.</v>

1122
01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>If you're associated with the disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 1>your status falls.</v>

1123
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's what these stabilizes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief hierarchy.</v>

1124
01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not a direct effect on belief.</v>

1125
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And that puts the problem in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different light in many ways.</v>

1126
01:02:56.521 --> 01:02:57.051
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1127
01:02:57.051 --> 01:02:59.400
<v Speaker 1>What the hell are you supposed to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that?</v>

1128
01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it looks like</v>

1129
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:09.390
<v Speaker 1>there's no denying the fact that the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bottom or top of the dominant</v>

1130
01:03:09.391 --> 01:03:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Turkey's a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1131
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I got to put one more twist in that.</v>

1132
01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:17.480
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1133
01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.350
<v Speaker 1>the terror management theories and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like basically say that it's</v>

1134
01:03:21.351 --> 01:03:24.710
<v Speaker 1>your belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stabilizes your emotions.</v>

1135
01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:27.980
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I vary that a bit and said,</v>

1136
01:03:27.981 --> 01:03:28.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1137
01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:32.270
<v Speaker 1>It's your expectation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire,</v>

1138
01:03:32.271 --> 01:03:36.830
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and the match between that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world that stabilizes your emotions.</v>

1139
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:42.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not freezing to death or</v>

1140
01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.100
<v Speaker 1>overheated or starving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because you can sit in a room</v>

1141
01:03:46.101 --> 01:03:49.250
<v Speaker 1>like this with all the other conformance</v>
<v Speaker 1>to feel like no one's going to,</v>

1142
01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:52.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up screaming and become murderous,</v>

1143
01:03:52.551 --> 01:03:54.800
<v Speaker 1>which is a really good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1144
01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:02.810
<v Speaker 1>but here's a twist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The twist would be the degree to which</v>

1145
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:08.180
<v Speaker 1>the expectancy desire map regulates your</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and your general response.</v>

1146
01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Your general stress response is</v>
<v Speaker 1>proportionate to your position in the</v>

1147
01:04:13.171 --> 01:04:15.090
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1148
01:04:15.091 --> 01:04:20.091
<v Speaker 1>So it's more dilated by the degree of</v>
<v Speaker 1>success that you have and that's an</v>

1149
01:04:20.671 --> 01:04:25.410
<v Speaker 1>important sale because it means the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the integrity of your theory about the</v>

1150
01:04:25.411 --> 01:04:30.411
<v Speaker 1>world works better as well as that</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory of the world is in fact working</v>

1151
01:04:30.841 --> 01:04:32.670
<v Speaker 1>well for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you're near the top of the</v>

1152
01:04:32.671 --> 01:04:34.980
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it really regulates your</v>

1153
01:04:34.981 --> 01:04:38.550
<v Speaker 1>emotions as it should because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment is less dangerous for you.</v>

1154
01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:42.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not psychological man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're hiring the dominance</v>

1155
01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:44.250
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in Canada and you have someone</v>

1156
01:04:44.251 --> 01:04:47.390
<v Speaker 1>who's sick in your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get to see the doctor a lot,</v>

1157
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:51.570
<v Speaker 1>long time before someone who has a low</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq and no social connections and it's</v>

1158
01:04:51.571 --> 01:04:53.480
<v Speaker 1>not just corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1159
01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:55.920
<v Speaker 1>there's an element of that who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1160
01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:00.570
<v Speaker 1>it's just successful conscientious</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are open.</v>

1161
01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:04.890
<v Speaker 1>They have access to all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies and plans and ways of</v>

1162
01:05:04.891 --> 01:05:07.230
<v Speaker 1>figuring out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring things out that people who are</v>

1163
01:05:07.231 --> 01:05:11.430
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom of the dominant Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just can't even muster.</v>

1164
01:05:11.431 --> 01:05:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Plus they're way more likely to be taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously when they go see a doctor</v>

1165
01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:16.050
<v Speaker 1>because they're articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1166
01:05:16.051 --> 01:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>so it's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1167
01:05:18.851 --> 01:05:23.851
<v Speaker 1>so then we're saying the degree to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>your theory protects you from the world</v>

1168
01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:29.110
<v Speaker 1>and your theory and its incarnation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual world is proportional to</v>

1169
01:05:29.111 --> 01:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>where you are in the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

1170
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:34.660
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever associate with anything or anyone</v>

1171
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:38.330
<v Speaker 1>that lowers your status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you forfeit the protection of the</v>

1172
01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>associate cultural confines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the best way to do that is to</v>

1173
01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>associate yourself with someone who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting or contemptible.</v>

1174
01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Now the next problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think I was thrilled about that</v>

1175
01:05:51.011 --> 01:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>

1176
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:54.700
<v Speaker 1>because I've been trying to figure this</v>
<v Speaker 1>out for like six years.</v>

1177
01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:57.220
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do these things tied</v>

1178
01:05:57.221 --> 01:05:58.500
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

1179
01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's absolutely right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's,</v>

1180
01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:04.330
<v Speaker 1>it's pushing towards something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1181
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:08.260
<v Speaker 1>But then the problem that comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what do you do about it?</v>

1182
01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one,</v>

1183
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a real bind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1184
01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Because you're just not going to get rid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the damn hierarchies.</v>

1185
01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:19.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not even clear that you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because you know,</v>

1186
01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:21.760
<v Speaker 1>you can be cynical like a postmodernist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can say,</v>

1187
01:06:21.761 --> 01:06:24.580
<v Speaker 1>well hierarchies are just based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

1188
01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:27.510
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's such a stupid theory that it's</v>

1189
01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.880
<v Speaker 1>just painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some hierarchies are based on power,</v>

1190
01:06:30.881 --> 01:06:32.920
<v Speaker 1>but lot of them are based on competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1191
01:06:32.921 --> 01:06:36.250
<v Speaker 1>In a functioning society it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do you want to do your brain</v>

1192
01:06:36.251 --> 01:06:37.750
<v Speaker 1>surgery?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1193
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:42.130
<v Speaker 1>do you want to have the person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>really knows how to do brain surgery or</v>

1194
01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:43.840
<v Speaker 1>do you want some person who's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1195
01:06:43.841 --> 01:06:45.910
<v Speaker 1>sort of they're doing it as an amateur</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1196
01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:48.120
<v Speaker 1>in the back alley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1197
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:51.880
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to assume that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody hierarchy and that it's based on</v>

1198
01:06:51.881 --> 01:06:55.900
<v Speaker 1>competence and that you're going to peel</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the top and so they're going to be</v>

1199
01:06:55.901 --> 01:06:58.690
<v Speaker 1>more powerful obviously because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top of the hierarchy.</v>

1200
01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:01.300
<v Speaker 1>But you're going to be pretty damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrilled about that when you're looking</v>

1201
01:07:01.301 --> 01:07:03.670
<v Speaker 1>for competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you often are.</v>

1202
01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:06.190
<v Speaker 1>And to think about all that is power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1203
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:08.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really like live in the world.</v>

1204
01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Some of its power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lots of it isn't so.</v>

1205
01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:17.110
<v Speaker 1>So if it's our proclivity to arrange</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in dominance hierarchies and</v>

1206
01:07:17.111 --> 01:07:22.111
<v Speaker 1>our dislike of our associated anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks contaminated in a disgusting</v>

1207
01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:27.610
<v Speaker 1>sort of way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that,</v>

1208
01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:31.510
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll lower are visible status in her</v>

1209
01:07:31.511 --> 01:07:33.490
<v Speaker 1>own eyes and in the eyes of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1210
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:35.860
<v Speaker 1>How the hell do you get people to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerant?</v>

1211
01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.070
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>

1212
01:07:40.071 --> 01:07:43.970
<v Speaker 1>you're not tolerant and for all the talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about egalitarianism,</v>

1213
01:07:43.971 --> 01:07:48.971
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you the egalitarian thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do is to date the next person who asks</v>

1214
01:07:49.701 --> 01:07:54.020
<v Speaker 1>you and you're not going to do that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bloody wonder.</v>

1215
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:56.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can talk around that all you</v>

1216
01:07:56.541 --> 01:07:57.374
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1217
01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.950
<v Speaker 1>we know if you're going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologist about this sort of thing,</v>

1218
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:03.620
<v Speaker 1>which is useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should only view</v>

1219
01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:07.160
<v Speaker 1>people through biological lenses because</v>
<v Speaker 1>our biological lenses aren't very</v>

1220
01:08:07.161 --> 01:08:10.100
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know it's pretty damn hard to</v>

1221
01:08:10.101 --> 01:08:14.210
<v Speaker 1>argue with the idea that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned roughly speaking with two</v>

1222
01:08:14.211 --> 01:08:17.720
<v Speaker 1>things and one is or not you survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other is whether or not your</v>

1223
01:08:17.721 --> 01:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>progeny survive and thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you can just boil that</v>

1224
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>down to the desire to have healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competent,</v>

1225
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.450
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive,</v>

1226
01:08:26.451 --> 01:08:27.800
<v Speaker 1>successful children.</v>

1227
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:31.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a vice or a virtue?</v>

1228
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't make that egalitarianism,</v>

1229
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:38.810
<v Speaker 1>like good luck with the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like smoke and mirrors.</v>

1230
01:08:38.811 --> 01:08:42.140
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to alleviate suffering</v>

1231
01:08:42.141 --> 01:08:44.030
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom of the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

1232
01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:47.370
<v Speaker 1>although even that's much more difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you think because you know,</v>

1233
01:08:47.371 --> 01:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>if you pump resources from the top to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom,</v>

1234
01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:53.060
<v Speaker 1>what happens is the resources fly right</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to the top again,</v>

1235
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:54.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost,</v>

1236
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.920
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's like pumping water up</v>
<v Speaker 1>hill.</v>

1237
01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:01.460
<v Speaker 1>It's bad analogy because it's backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're fighting against a very,</v>

1238
01:09:01.461 --> 01:09:06.461
<v Speaker 1>very powerful tendency for resources to</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggregate themselves into single</v>

1239
01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:08.900
<v Speaker 1>locations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll talk to you a lot about that</v>

1240
01:09:08.901 --> 01:09:11.400
<v Speaker 1>when we get to intelligence because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1241
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:15.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like a bloody natural law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to fight against it.</v>

1242
01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:19.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's like that inequality is</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of all societies.</v>

1243
01:09:19.401 --> 01:09:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Even egalitarian societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to get rid of it and</v>

1244
01:09:23.511 --> 01:09:25.490
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get rid of it in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual world.</v>

1245
01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:26.773
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

1246
01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:32.820
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about,</v>

1247
01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've talked a lot about in this</v>

1248
01:09:36.331 --> 01:09:38.430
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sections on phenomenology and</v>

1249
01:09:38.431 --> 01:09:41.610
<v Speaker 1>existentialism and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that there's something</v>

1250
01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:45.770
<v Speaker 1>redemptive about living in truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1251
01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:50.790
<v Speaker 1>and that that seems to protect people</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the worst elements of rigid and</v>

1252
01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:54.540
<v Speaker 1>judgmental dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I think discussed can even</v>

1253
01:09:54.541 --> 01:09:58.920
<v Speaker 1>get more out of hand when you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogant and superior,</v>

1254
01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:01.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're looking down on the</v>

1255
01:10:01.441 --> 01:10:04.230
<v Speaker 1>contemptible from a High Place of</v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissism.</v>

1256
01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:09.350
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe part of living in truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps you not fall prey to that.</v>

1257
01:10:10.230 --> 01:10:12.870
<v Speaker 1>What narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>judgmental tendency,</v>

1258
01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.000
<v Speaker 1>and that'll keep some of this under</v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

1259
01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.980
<v Speaker 1>but how to deal with the underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of,</v>

1260
01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.170
<v Speaker 1>of disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity.</v>

1261
01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:26.140
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Orderly.</v>

1262
01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:29.200
<v Speaker 1>That's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1263
01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.440
<v Speaker 1>now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that you might think about is</v>

1264
01:10:32.441 --> 01:10:35.020
<v Speaker 1>that compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of agreeableness might</v>

1265
01:10:35.021 --> 01:10:38.530
<v Speaker 1>moderate the judgmental tendency of</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness.</v>

1266
01:10:38.531 --> 01:10:39.700
<v Speaker 1>They're not opposites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1267
01:10:39.701 --> 01:10:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Because they're on different dimensions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of one of the liberal</v>

1268
01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:45.160
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though liberals are mostly high in</v>

1269
01:10:45.161 --> 01:10:48.520
<v Speaker 1>openness and low in orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're also higher in compassion than</v>

1270
01:10:48.521 --> 01:10:50.310
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conservatives,</v>

1271
01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:54.850
<v Speaker 1>liberals debate a lot about the role of</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion because the Conservatives</v>

1272
01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:57.250
<v Speaker 1>think you're just being a new mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1273
01:10:57.251 --> 01:10:59.110
<v Speaker 1>and the Liberals think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1274
01:10:59.111 --> 01:11:03.100
<v Speaker 1>you're just being a totalitarian father</v>
<v Speaker 1>and both of those things can and are</v>

1275
01:11:03.101 --> 01:11:05.310
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that there's</v>

1276
01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:10.320
<v Speaker 1>something about compassion that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>might serve at least to some degree as</v>

1277
01:11:11.831 --> 01:11:16.500
<v Speaker 1>an antidote for the pathological</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of orderliness,</v>

1278
01:11:16.501 --> 01:11:17.340
<v Speaker 1>which include,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1279
01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:20.280
<v Speaker 1>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the ordinary ones are also</v>

1280
01:11:20.281 --> 01:11:25.281
<v Speaker 1>much more judgemental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you present to them someone who's</v>

1281
01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:30.450
<v Speaker 1>committed a moral crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like careless prostitution,</v>

1282
01:11:30.451 --> 01:11:35.160
<v Speaker 1>say they will and you ask them how long</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person should be in prison,</v>

1283
01:11:35.161 --> 01:11:38.160
<v Speaker 1>then the orderly person will say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be in prison longer than the</v>

1284
01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:40.810
<v Speaker 1>person who's disorderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1285
01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:47.520
<v Speaker 1>so then I guess the question is can</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion mediate that without it</v>

1286
01:11:48.130 --> 01:11:51.940
<v Speaker 1>falling into like the hellish Friday</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anita Pool pit</v>

1287
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:55.621
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1288
01:11:55.621 --> 01:11:57.150
<v Speaker 1>that's about as far as I've got with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1289
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:03.260
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I'd tell you that because I</v>

1290
01:12:07.151 --> 01:12:11.080
<v Speaker 1>think it's worth knowing and because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was too excited about it.</v>

1291
01:12:11.081 --> 01:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Not too so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see you on Thursday.</v>
