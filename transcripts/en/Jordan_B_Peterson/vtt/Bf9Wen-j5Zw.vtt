00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Give him a warm welcome Dr Jordan b </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson.</v>

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

3
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very nice to be here and to see you</v>

4
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:41.041
<v Speaker 1>all come out to spend a couple of hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about difficult things.</v>

5
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be an appetite for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really something.</v>

6
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>So let's exploit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

7
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.353
<v Speaker 1>I started working on the ideas that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlined in 12 rules for life while a </v>

8
00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>long time ago and really started when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was about 13.</v>

9
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.680
<v Speaker 1>I was a junior high school student and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.730
<v Speaker 1>I met this librarian who's kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>eccentric person,</v>

11
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>very well educated person</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>

12
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>we are used to hang around with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>delinquent friends in the library,</v>

13
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.703
<v Speaker 1>which tells you how eccentric the </v>
<v Speaker 1>librarian was because that's not </v>

14
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 1>normally the place where the delinquent </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids hang out,</v>

15
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she talked to us like we were adults</v>

16
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.000
<v Speaker 1>and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

17
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:43.840
<v Speaker 1>A refreshing.</v>

18
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Speaker 1>That was a refreshing experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

19
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>she knew that I liked to read and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>started giving me real books.</v>

20
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 1>She gave me one day in the life of Ivan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Denisovich,</v>

21
00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:00.034
<v Speaker 1>which was the first book published by Al</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in the Soviet </v>

22
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.183
<v Speaker 1>Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a story about the day of a </v>

23
00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>political prisoner in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

24
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.233
<v Speaker 1>in a work camp and brave new world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 1984 and animal farm and Ayn rand's </v>

25
00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:16.684
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was quite interesting because she </v>

26
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:19.114
<v Speaker 1>was the wife of our member of parliament</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was the only member of the </v>

27
00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:26.650
<v Speaker 1>opposition in our province and he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist,</v>

28
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.700
<v Speaker 1>an NDP new Democratic Party leader as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter of fact.</v>

29
00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:32.590
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but despite that,</v>

30
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:33.424
<v Speaker 1>she gave me Ayn rand's books because she</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that I should be exposed to the </v>

31
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.870
<v Speaker 1>other side of the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I read atlas shrugged and,</v>

32
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fountain head and well,</v>

33
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 1>she was the first person who helped me </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover literature,</v>

34
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.143
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

35
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.393
<v Speaker 1>And while at the same time I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in what had happened in Nazi </v>

36
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.173
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wrote an essay about that when I </v>

37
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>was about 13 or 14 about Auschwitz and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what had happened there.</v>

38
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And I never read that really never left </v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind.</v>

39
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.713
<v Speaker 1>I would say I think I read Viktor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankl's man's search for meaning at </v>

40
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:14.914
<v Speaker 1>that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a book I would highly </v>

41
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:16.654
<v Speaker 1>recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a reading list on my website by </v>

42
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:19.294
<v Speaker 1>the way at Jordan Peterson Dotcom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a variety of books there </v>

43
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:27.541
<v Speaker 1>that have really influenced me and I put</v>
<v Speaker 1>them up for other people's use</v>

44
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.423
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never what what I learned about </v>

45
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:33.814
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz and about Nazi Germany never </v>
<v Speaker 1>really left my mind and because I </v>

46
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>couldn't understand how people could act</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

47
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.643
<v Speaker 1>how they could not only be possessed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>an ideology to the degree that the </v>

48
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Germans were very civilized country </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

49
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:48.964
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was I suppose even more </v>

50
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>spectacular shock that something so </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic happened there,</v>

51
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't just the ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession.</v>

52
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.573
<v Speaker 1>It was the cruelty and the gratuitous </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruelty in the service of that </v>

53
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>ideological possession that I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

54
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:03.694
<v Speaker 1>It didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't establish a relationship </v>

55
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>between my own being and those patterns </v>
<v Speaker 1>of action.</v>

56
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.403
<v Speaker 1>And as I got older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that concern transformed itself into an </v>

57
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:17.524
<v Speaker 1>obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say not so much with what had </v>

58
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>happened in Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with I think what happened,</v>

59
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 1>what was happening as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the collectivist philosophy per se,</v>

60
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.693
<v Speaker 1>which you might think of something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested itself both on the right in </v>

61
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:35.734
<v Speaker 1>Nazi Germany and then on the left in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the multitudinous and catastrophic </v>

62
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.373
<v Speaker 1>communist regimes that characterized the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bulk of the 20th century and they're </v>

63
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.494
<v Speaker 1>insane murderousness and that probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>culminated for me in the 19 seventies </v>

64
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>when I Read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago,</v>

65
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.513
<v Speaker 1>which is another book that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>should read because in some sense it </v>

66
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:02.554
<v Speaker 1>might be the defining document of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century and the fact that everyone </v>

67
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:07.503
<v Speaker 1>in the West isn't familiar with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>book is actually a signal of our </v>

68
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic moral failing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

69
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.113
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started writing this book called maps </v>

70
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:23.140
<v Speaker 1>of meaning in about 1985,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it had been working on variance</v>

71
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:23.974
<v Speaker 1>of it before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I was trying to understand was </v>

72
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe the psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations for the Cold War.</v>

73
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

74
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Many of you are old enough to remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was like in the 19 eighties.</v>

75
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.973
<v Speaker 1>We just went and visited the house in in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reykjavik where Gorbachev and Reagan </v>

76
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.793
<v Speaker 1>met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was quite something to see and </v>

77
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:50.224
<v Speaker 1>when they decided they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring at least some of the insanity to </v>

78
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>irrelative Hallt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God,</v>

79
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>and the eighties were a very contentious</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

80
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:58.784
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cold War sort of peaked in two at </v>

81
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:01.334
<v Speaker 1>two times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That peaked in 1962 during the Cuban </v>

82
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 1>missile crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this,</v>

83
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:11.141
<v Speaker 1>but when I visited a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nuclear missile site in Arizona</v>

84
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>about 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a decommissioned missile site,</v>

85
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.803
<v Speaker 1>intercontinental ballistic missile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intercontinental ballistic missile is a </v>

86
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:24.470
<v Speaker 1>very large rockets and can go halfway </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world and its ballistic,</v>

87
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.903
<v Speaker 1>which means it has the same function as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bullet and the bullet is ballistic </v>

88
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 1>because once you fire it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>

89
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't control it after it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It leaves.</v>

90
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>So once you launch a ballistic missile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's launched,</v>

91
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.303
<v Speaker 1>there's no calling it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they told us they did a simulation </v>

92
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 1>launch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was very eerie thing.</v>

93
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 1>And so to launch a nuclear missile is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big console.</v>

94
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.560
<v Speaker 1>It sort of looks like the star Trek </v>
<v Speaker 1>control a control module,</v>

95
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:53.714
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one person stands here and one </v>

96
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:57.104
<v Speaker 1>person stands about 20 feet away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each have a key around their neck and </v>

97
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.543
<v Speaker 1>they put the key in the lock </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and then turn it for 10 </v>

98
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:09.281
<v Speaker 1>seconds and at the end of 10 seconds the</v>
<v Speaker 1>missile is gone and that's that and they</v>

99
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:15.221
<v Speaker 1>both had their keys in the lock in 1962,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and we came close again in 1984 when,</v>

100
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.533
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Soviet missile detection system </v>

101
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 1>signal the launch of four or five </v>
<v Speaker 1>missiles from North America and a single</v>

102
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:27.494
<v Speaker 1>Russian soldier decided that it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>false alarm and refused to push the </v>

103
00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 1>button would have resulted in major </v>
<v Speaker 1>retaliation.</v>

104
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 1>He just died about a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can read about him on wikipedia.</v>

105
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.483
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read Solzhenitsyn in 1976 and that </v>

106
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.793
<v Speaker 1>made me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me even I would say more obsessed with </v>

107
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 1>what was happening in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in on the world stage.</v>

108
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to understand why it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

109
00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.083
<v Speaker 1>the systems of belief that we inhabited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say one typifying the Soviet </v>

110
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in similar states,</v>

111
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.703
<v Speaker 1>Mao's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

112
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.723
<v Speaker 1>North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful places like that versus the </v>

113
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:12.404
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We each had our own way of construing </v>

114
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:15.374
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ways of construing the world were </v>

115
00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:22.580
<v Speaker 1>set at odds with one another and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that they were set at odds with one</v>

116
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:27.581
<v Speaker 1>another appeared to be so significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've armed ourselves with</v>

117
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder hydrogen bombs on each side.</v>

118
00:08:35.701 --> 00:08:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how much you knew about</v>

119
00:08:37.771 --> 00:08:39.180
<v Speaker 1>a hydrogen bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

120
00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:40.014
<v Speaker 1>you know about atomic bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that a hydrogen bomb has an </v>

121
00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:44.670
<v Speaker 1>atomic bomb for the trigger.</v>

122
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

123
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.370
<v Speaker 1>so like the atom bomb that was dropped </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Hiroshima,</v>

124
00:08:50.371 --> 00:08:52.890
<v Speaker 1>that was something that was a fission </v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb,</v>

125
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 1>not standard atomic bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first generation,</v>

126
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.800
<v Speaker 1>but hydrogen bomb is incontestably more </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful than that.</v>

127
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.640
<v Speaker 1>And we were producing them in the tens </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thousands.</v>

128
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.503
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we don't have any now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was really some insanity in the </v>

129
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 1>19 eighties and people seem to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very itchy trigger finger.</v>

130
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 1>So I was very confused about this in two</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

131
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.883
<v Speaker 1>One from a psychological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because by that time I just started </v>

132
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>decided to study psychology instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political science,</v>

133
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 1>which was my original major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

134
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:29.903
<v Speaker 1>I got disenchanted with political </v>
<v Speaker 1>science because I didn't believe that </v>

135
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 1>people were fundamentally motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic issues.</v>

136
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.873
<v Speaker 1>I still don't believe that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're motivated by whatever they're </v>

137
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:41.460
<v Speaker 1>motivated by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be captured by economics,</v>

138
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.673
<v Speaker 1>not not precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very curious about what it was </v>

139
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:47.064
<v Speaker 1>that was so important about a belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that people would risk putting </v>

140
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:52.134
<v Speaker 1>the entire planet to the torch to ensure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their particular motive construing </v>

141
00:09:56.941 --> 00:10:00.480
<v Speaker 1>the world prevailed is an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological problem.</v>

142
00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:01.314
<v Speaker 1>What was so important about belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that would justify destroying </v>

143
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:06.280
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

144
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.113
<v Speaker 1>or risking destroying everything because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was certainly the situation we put </v>

145
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:10.404
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in</v>

146
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.900
<v Speaker 1>and more to the point of I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or equally to the point I was interested</v>

147
00:10:22.901 --> 00:10:24.430
<v Speaker 1>in two other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was</v>

148
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.950
<v Speaker 1>were these differences in belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems?</v>

149
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:29.784
<v Speaker 1>Just arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually a postmodern </v>

150
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:32.634
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that at the time now </v>

151
00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:35.364
<v Speaker 1>because you might say the postmodernists</v>
<v Speaker 1>do say there's a very large number of </v>

152
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:43.071
<v Speaker 1>ways of interpreting the world and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't obvious how you determine which of</v>

153
00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 1>those ways are correct and so perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't determine that any of them are</v>

154
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:48.354
<v Speaker 1>correct and then as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your inability to determine if any of </v>

155
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:52.944
<v Speaker 1>them are correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to turn to something like </v>

156
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.003
<v Speaker 1>power dispute to establish which </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation is going to take </v>

157
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:03.300
<v Speaker 1>precedence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say in a nutshell,</v>

158
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.403
<v Speaker 1>that's a postmodern is theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's tainted to some degree with </v>

159
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Marxist preconceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we won't get into that.</v>

160
00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:10.464
<v Speaker 1>But that's basically the idea and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea with a certain amount of </v>

161
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.663
<v Speaker 1>justification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a very large number of ways of </v>

162
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.543
<v Speaker 1>interpreting the world and it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious which way or ways are right or </v>

163
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:25.980
<v Speaker 1>why they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a complicated problem.</v>

164
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:30.660
<v Speaker 1>And so I was curious is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was this merely a difference of opinion?</v>

165
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.033
<v Speaker 1>The West had a certain set of axioms </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was acting out in the world and </v>

166
00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:36.984
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet bloc and the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist countries have another set of </v>

167
00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:40.524
<v Speaker 1>axioms and they were both arbitrary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a matter of power or was there </v>

168
00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 1>something deeper at stake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was question number two.</v>

169
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Question number three was,</v>

170
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.233
<v Speaker 3>was there an to brutal combat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was there an alternative way of solving </v>

171
00:12:01.201 --> 00:12:06.201
<v Speaker 3>the dispute too brutal group combat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that and because I always</v>

172
00:12:06.211 --> 00:12:09.960
<v Speaker 3>believed that if you understood the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem that you could solve it.</v>

173
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.560
<v Speaker 3>In fact that if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if when you analyze the problem,</v>

174
00:12:13.561 --> 00:12:15.750
<v Speaker 3>a solution didn't emerge from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis,</v>

175
00:12:15.751 --> 00:12:18.150
<v Speaker 3>then you actually didn't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

176
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.960
<v Speaker 3>And so I thought if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>delved into the problem deeply enough,</v>

177
00:12:24.261 --> 00:12:27.240
<v Speaker 3>then maybe I could figure out what might</v>
<v Speaker 3>constitute a solution.</v>

178
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.140
<v Speaker 3>Assuming there was such a thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't.</v>

179
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.040
<v Speaker 3>I knew after writing a fair bit of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we were.</v>

180
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.480
<v Speaker 3>That there was a real problem because</v>

181
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.003
<v Speaker 3>you can get belief systems that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>locked in combat and then obviously the </v>

182
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.150
<v Speaker 3>terrible consequence of that is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>combat.</v>

183
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:46.853
<v Speaker 3>But then I also knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was probably more from reading </v>

184
00:12:48.571 --> 00:12:51.870
<v Speaker 3>Nicha than anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if your belief system collapses,</v>

185
00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:52.471
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

186
00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:56.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to fight with you about </v>
<v Speaker 3>whose belief system is correct.</v>

187
00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:57.234
<v Speaker 3>I'll just let my mind go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is if you let your </v>

188
00:13:00.211 --> 00:13:01.044
<v Speaker 3>belief system go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're swamped by nihilism and </v>

189
00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:06.690
<v Speaker 3>hopelessness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not helpful.</v>

190
00:13:06.691 --> 00:13:07.740
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very.</v>

191
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.623
<v Speaker 3>It's not helpful psychologically because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it produces emotional pain and anxiety </v>

192
00:13:12.601 --> 00:13:16.230
<v Speaker 3>and maybe at unbearable levels you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a pointless life.</v>

193
00:13:16.231 --> 00:13:17.090
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

194
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.660
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a suffering,</v>

195
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.763
<v Speaker 3>a pointless life is pointless suffering </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people can't sustain that without </v>

196
00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:27.060
<v Speaker 3>becoming demoralized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's only where they start.</v>

197
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.200
<v Speaker 3>Demoralized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitter,</v>

198
00:13:28.201 --> 00:13:29.520
<v Speaker 3>cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>resentful,</v>

199
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.050
<v Speaker 3>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hostile,</v>

200
00:13:31.051 --> 00:13:32.520
<v Speaker 3>murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genocidal.</v>

201
00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Like all those things follow one from </v>
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>

202
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.530
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if things are sufficiently hopeless,</v>

203
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.930
<v Speaker 3>scared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just let your belief system go.</v>

204
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.490
<v Speaker 3>But if you're locked into it and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>another one that you're competing with,</v>

205
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.180
<v Speaker 3>then the consequences war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

206
00:13:48.181 --> 00:13:49.014
<v Speaker 3>so what is it nihilism on the one hand </v>
<v Speaker 3>in war on the other that didn't seem </v>

207
00:13:51.751 --> 00:13:52.584
<v Speaker 3>like especially given outcome of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>say the Third World War that neither of </v>

208
00:13:57.571 --> 00:13:59.490
<v Speaker 3>those seemed like acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternatives,</v>

209
00:13:59.491 --> 00:14:00.324
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't see any other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't see that there was anything </v>

210
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:04.374
<v Speaker 3>else other than those two alternatives </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's what I tried to layout in </v>

211
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.400
<v Speaker 3>in this book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maps of meaning and most of the thoughts</v>

212
00:14:11.401 --> 00:14:15.570
<v Speaker 3>that I expressed in 12 rules for life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all of them and in the lectures that</v>

213
00:14:15.571 --> 00:14:17.520
<v Speaker 3>I've done that have become popular on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Youtube,</v>

214
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.743
<v Speaker 3>were all developed during the 15 year </v>
<v Speaker 3>period that I worked on that book and I </v>

215
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.440
<v Speaker 3>worked on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say obsessively really.</v>

216
00:14:25.441 --> 00:14:26.274
<v Speaker 3>I wrote about three hours a day and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought about it for pretty much 12 </v>

217
00:14:30.901 --> 00:14:34.410
<v Speaker 3>other hours and so I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

218
00:14:34.411 --> 00:14:36.780
<v Speaker 3>It was not an obvious why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

219
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:37.733
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you why for some reason all of </v>

220
00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:42.150
<v Speaker 3>that manifested itself to me as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cardinal problem,</v>

221
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.890
<v Speaker 3>but I concluded and tried to lay out the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rationale for this,</v>

222
00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

223
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.950
<v Speaker 3>the fight between these two belief </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>

224
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.810
<v Speaker 3>but let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's look at the belief systems.</v>

225
00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:57.644
<v Speaker 3>It's not communism versus the West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not communism versus the free </v>

226
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:02.090
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different than that.</v>

227
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 3>It's collectivism in it's far right </v>
<v Speaker 3>form,</v>

228
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.063
<v Speaker 3>let's say the far right form of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nazis and the far left form of the </v>

229
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.993
<v Speaker 3>radical leftists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the communists sets collectivism versus </v>

230
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:15.194
<v Speaker 3>individualism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the fundamental conflict and </v>

231
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.420
<v Speaker 3>there are variants of the collectivist </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewpoint,</v>

232
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:21.254
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can be grouped under the rubric of </v>

233
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:24.890
<v Speaker 3>Collectivism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's important differences,</v>

234
00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 3>but we don't have to get into that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the western take wasn't collectivist.</v>

235
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:29.774
<v Speaker 3>It was individualist and the central </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of the West was that although </v>

236
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:34.814
<v Speaker 3>people are obviously obviously aggregate</v>
<v Speaker 3>into groups and many different groups </v>

237
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:43.550
<v Speaker 3>because all of you are members of very </v>
<v Speaker 3>of many different groups,</v>

238
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 3>ethnicities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genders,</v>

239
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.940
<v Speaker 3>sexes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>races,</v>

240
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.070
<v Speaker 3>family groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>community groups.</v>

241
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.593
<v Speaker 3>You can be grouped a very large number </v>
<v Speaker 3>of ways and and you tend towards the </v>

242
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 3>adoption of something approximating a </v>
<v Speaker 3>group identity because you know,</v>

243
00:15:57.561 --> 00:15:58.394
<v Speaker 3>you take care of your family and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>a member of your community and you have </v>

244
00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:02.084
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount of justifiable </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriotism in relationship to your </v>

245
00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:05.930
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

246
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.510
<v Speaker 3>The group identity is definitely part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you are.</v>

247
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:10.543
<v Speaker 3>The question is what is the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>defining characteristic of who you are </v>

248
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.093
<v Speaker 3>and the collectivist definition is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are the Avatar of a collective and </v>

249
00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:26.120
<v Speaker 3>that's fundamentally who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the western perspective is not that.</v>

250
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:26.954
<v Speaker 3>The Western perspective is that despite </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that people have an individual </v>

251
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:31.903
<v Speaker 3>level and a collective level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the individual level is to be regarded </v>

252
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:36.224
<v Speaker 3>as paramount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're to be treated above all else </v>

253
00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.030
<v Speaker 3>above all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an individual.</v>

254
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I looked into that very deeply and I</v>

255
00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:48.470
<v Speaker 3>thought that isn't arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually correct.</v>

256
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.170
<v Speaker 3>That's the right way of looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

257
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:52.641
<v Speaker 3>and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

258
00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:53.474
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean the right way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course that's the right question </v>

259
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:56.624
<v Speaker 3>because that is the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If something's the right way of looking </v>

260
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:00.434
<v Speaker 3>at something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why is it the right way of looking </v>

261
00:17:02.391 --> 00:17:03.224
<v Speaker 3>at it?</v>

262
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:04.483
<v Speaker 3>But I want to put a little spin on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>too because usually when we talk about </v>

263
00:17:08.811 --> 00:17:12.560
<v Speaker 3>individualism in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in the modern world,</v>

264
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.070
<v Speaker 3>maybe let's say for the last 50 years or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

265
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's after World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly the parameters.</v>

266
00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:19.904
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly since the 19 sixties when we </v>

267
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:25.220
<v Speaker 3>think about the tradition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuality in the west,</v>

268
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.293
<v Speaker 3>we think about the tradition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual rights and there's a problem </v>

269
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:31.034
<v Speaker 3>with that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fundamental individual tradition of </v>

270
00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:39.710
<v Speaker 3>the West is not individual rights and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights have a problem.</v>

271
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.430
<v Speaker 3>Rights are sort of like you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>privileged compared to other people.</v>

272
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:44.323
<v Speaker 3>I have these rights and don't tread on </v>
<v Speaker 3>them that that wall's me off and makes </v>

273
00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:52.620
<v Speaker 3>me privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In some sense.</v>

274
00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:54.840
<v Speaker 3>It means that I have the right to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

275
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:57.240
<v Speaker 3>have the right to pursue my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>interests.</v>

276
00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:00.030
<v Speaker 3>I have the right to pursue happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

277
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 3>that's explicitly laid out in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>American system.</v>

278
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.580
<v Speaker 3>The rights or what is special about me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so when you look at individuality or</v>

279
00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:13.140
<v Speaker 3>individualism from that perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think about it as a selfish idea</v>

280
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.243
<v Speaker 3>and it's often criticized by </v>
<v Speaker 3>collectivists precisely for that </v>

281
00:18:16.951 --> 00:18:17.784
<v Speaker 3>selfishness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fundamental idea of the </v>

282
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:22.770
<v Speaker 3>individual in the West isn't predicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>on rights.</v>

283
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Even though that's important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's predicated on responsibility.</v>

284
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.853
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your role as an individual in the </v>

285
00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:36.660
<v Speaker 3>West isn't to be the bearer of rights of</v>
<v Speaker 3>intrinsic rights,</v>

286
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:37.703
<v Speaker 3>even though those are important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your responsibility as an individual in </v>

287
00:18:41.431 --> 00:18:42.264
<v Speaker 3>the west is to bear the responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>of an individual and it's in bearing </v>

288
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:52.791
<v Speaker 3>that responsibility that you set </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself right and your family right and</v>

289
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:57.300
<v Speaker 3>you keep the state on track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not from expressing your rights,</v>

290
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.823
<v Speaker 3>it's from shouldering your </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility and I would say that the </v>

291
00:19:02.461 --> 00:19:03.294
<v Speaker 3>reason that you have rights in the West </v>
<v Speaker 3>is so that you can shoulder your </v>

292
00:19:07.051 --> 00:19:08.070
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

293
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.083
<v Speaker 3>It's not the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so that you can do what's best on </v>

294
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:13.344
<v Speaker 3>your behalf and in that manner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do what's best on your family's behalf </v>

295
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:21.681
<v Speaker 3>and in that manner contribute to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree that you can to the community and</v>

296
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.390
<v Speaker 3>that if you do all those things </v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously,</v>

297
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:27.330
<v Speaker 3>which means to accept the responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that,</v>

298
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.310
<v Speaker 3>then things move ahead as well as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can move ahead.</v>

299
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:33.443
<v Speaker 3>Which doesn't necessarily mean well </v>
<v Speaker 3>because life is very difficult and </v>

300
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.440
<v Speaker 3>there's no sure way through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only less bad approaches.</v>

301
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.233
<v Speaker 3>That might be a way of thinking about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the least bad approach you can </v>

302
00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:49.824
<v Speaker 3>manage is to shoulder your </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility as an individual and </v>

303
00:19:54.301 --> 00:19:55.134
<v Speaker 3>that's the and I would say that one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that drives the collectivist </v>

304
00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:00.864
<v Speaker 3>ethos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is often formulated in terms of </v>

305
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.793
<v Speaker 3>compassion for the oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is something we'll talk about a </v>

306
00:20:07.351 --> 00:20:08.184
<v Speaker 3>little bit later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is actually a deep desire to at all </v>

307
00:20:11.671 --> 00:20:12.504
<v Speaker 3>costs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid that responsibility and it's no </v>

308
00:20:16.531 --> 00:20:19.980
<v Speaker 3>wonder because the responsibility is </v>
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming.</v>

309
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Say The world fundamentally is a tragic </v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

310
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.313
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a place in which each of us is </v>

311
00:20:26.581 --> 00:20:27.414
<v Speaker 3>broken and it's contaminated by the ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>present reality of betrayal and </v>

312
00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:33.414
<v Speaker 3>malevolence and to shoulder the </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility first for even admitting </v>

313
00:20:38.401 --> 00:20:43.401
<v Speaker 3>to that and second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for assuming that you are duty bound,</v>

314
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 3>let's say to do something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

315
00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:48.934
<v Speaker 3>that's a task that anyone who has his or</v>
<v Speaker 3>her eyes open should be leery of </v>

316
00:20:53.381 --> 00:20:55.270
<v Speaker 3>accepting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say,</v>

317
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:56.853
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps there's no credible reason for </v>

318
00:20:58.781 --> 00:21:02.260
<v Speaker 3>accepting it except that every other </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative is worse.</v>

319
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:04.743
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a brutal fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the antidote to collectivism is </v>

320
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.493
<v Speaker 3>individualism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the individualism of the </v>

321
00:21:15.251 --> 00:21:16.084
<v Speaker 3>privileged person with rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the terrible burden of the </v>

322
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:20.944
<v Speaker 3>individual who determines that he or she</v>
<v Speaker 3>will shoulder their responsibility to </v>

323
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:26.350
<v Speaker 3>that most.</v>

324
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.410
<v Speaker 3>So I developed that idea in maps of </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning</v>

325
00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.060
<v Speaker 3>that and I made a lot of lectures about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that book,</v>

326
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:42.810
<v Speaker 3>many of which are on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of which have become widely viewed,</v>

327
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 3>I would say by one hundreds of thousands</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people now.</v>

328
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:47.523
<v Speaker 3>And so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that course always had a dramatic </v>

329
00:21:50.081 --> 00:21:54.010
<v Speaker 3>effect on my students and their most </v>
<v Speaker 3>typical comment.</v>

330
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.233
<v Speaker 3>There's two classes of typical comments </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I got from students about my maps </v>

331
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:02.800
<v Speaker 3>of meaning courses and it's the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments that I get from people now when</v>

332
00:22:02.801 --> 00:22:04.420
<v Speaker 3>they come and talk to me about my </v>
<v Speaker 3>lectures.</v>

333
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.320
<v Speaker 3>The first comment is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is about maybe a quarter of the</v>

334
00:22:08.321 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that</v>

335
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.290
<v Speaker 3>watching the lectures are taking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>course,</v>

336
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.560
<v Speaker 3>enabled them to put words to things they</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew,</v>

337
00:22:17.561 --> 00:22:21.070
<v Speaker 3>they knew but didn't know how to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so.</v>

338
00:22:21.071 --> 00:22:24.850
<v Speaker 3>And that's fine because that was an ex </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was actually an explicit purpose of</v>

339
00:22:24.851 --> 00:22:25.330
<v Speaker 3>the writing.</v>

340
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.163
<v Speaker 3>And the course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the second is that it helped people </v>

341
00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:32.560
<v Speaker 3>straightened out their lives and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>also not that surprising to me because a</v>

342
00:22:32.561 --> 00:22:33.394
<v Speaker 3>lot of what I integrated into that book </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the lectures and the lectures were </v>

343
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:39.214
<v Speaker 3>also associated with my personality </v>
<v Speaker 3>course were ideas from the great </v>

344
00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.750
<v Speaker 3>clinical psychologists and psychiatrists</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the 20th century.</v>

345
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.330
<v Speaker 3>There was a dozen of them or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe 20,</v>

346
00:22:49.331 --> 00:22:50.164
<v Speaker 3>who were all outstanding geniuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have slightly different types who </v>

347
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.833
<v Speaker 3>learned all sorts of things about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>people could put themselves self </v>

348
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.470
<v Speaker 3>together properly as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you learn about those things,</v>

349
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.453
<v Speaker 3>they're actually really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not surprising because they sit </v>

350
00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:10.840
<v Speaker 3>at the core of an entire domain of </v>
<v Speaker 3>science and art,</v>

351
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.360
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>devoted to improving people's individual</v>

352
00:23:13.361 --> 00:23:14.194
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wove the responsibility idea into 12 </v>

353
00:23:21.101 --> 00:23:24.430
<v Speaker 3>rules because that's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In some sense,</v>

354
00:23:24.431 --> 00:23:29.431
<v Speaker 3>it's a a call to the voluntary adoption </v>
<v Speaker 3>of maximal individual responsibility and</v>

355
00:23:32.381 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 3>it's a psychological work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a political work.</v>

356
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:35.703
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason that it's attracted </v>

357
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:38.644
<v Speaker 3>so much political attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say some of which couldn't log </v>

358
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 3>referred to in the introduction is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

359
00:23:46.101 --> 00:23:46.934
<v Speaker 3>there's two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is because I took what might be </v>

360
00:23:48.771 --> 00:23:49.604
<v Speaker 3>regarded as a political stance about </v>
<v Speaker 3>some compelled speech legislation in </v>

361
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:53.654
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never regarded that as a political </v>

362
00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:56.144
<v Speaker 3>move because I regarded the legislation </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself as something that wasn't a </v>

363
00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:00.554
<v Speaker 3>political move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I regarded it as an attempt by the </v>

364
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:04.094
<v Speaker 3>politicians to jump outside their domain</v>
<v Speaker 3>of acceptable conduct into the </v>

365
00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:09.254
<v Speaker 3>philosophical or even the theological </v>
<v Speaker 3>realm because you don't mess with the </v>

366
00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:14.144
<v Speaker 3>idea of free speech in a Western country</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's very sophisticated reasons </v>

367
00:24:19.071 --> 00:24:22.700
<v Speaker 3>for that and it doesn't matter what your</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons for doing it are.</v>

368
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:24.403
<v Speaker 3>You don't go there and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it happened to be the more radical </v>

369
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:33.410
<v Speaker 3>leftists that were pushing this forward </v>
<v Speaker 3>and because I objected to it than it was</v>

370
00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:38.411
<v Speaker 3>in their interest to assume that I must </v>
<v Speaker 3>be the worst sort of right wing die hard</v>

371
00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:44.471
<v Speaker 3>I suppose because otherwise they'd have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to contend with my actual arguments.</v>

372
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.273
<v Speaker 3>And so it's simpler just to shoot the </v>
<v Speaker 3>messenger than to contend with the </v>

373
00:24:49.611 --> 00:24:50.960
<v Speaker 3>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

374
00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:51.794
<v Speaker 3>if you stand up and say there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something wrong in a place like Canada </v>

375
00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 3>where most things aren't wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's reasonable.</v>

376
00:24:58.071 --> 00:25:01.640
<v Speaker 3>Also for people to assume there must be </v>
<v Speaker 3>something wrong with you because most of</v>

377
00:25:01.641 --> 00:25:02.474
<v Speaker 3>the time there isn't anything wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the country and so a certain amount of </v>

378
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 3>testing is a reasonable thing for people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

379
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.163
<v Speaker 3>I guess the other element of this that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>political in some sense though is that </v>

380
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.153
<v Speaker 3>within the collectivist viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something that's very </v>

381
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:19.334
<v Speaker 3>interesting with regard to free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really figure this out until a </v>

382
00:25:21.711 --> 00:25:22.544
<v Speaker 3>couple of weeks ago and although the </v>
<v Speaker 3>radical leftists and you see this </v>

383
00:25:25.671 --> 00:25:26.504
<v Speaker 3>particularly in the United States now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although the Americans have a very </v>

384
00:25:29.301 --> 00:25:30.134
<v Speaker 3>strong tradition of free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the radical leftists are opposed to </v>

385
00:25:34.101 --> 00:25:36.620
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not really right.</v>

386
00:25:36.621 --> 00:25:40.880
<v Speaker 3>It's not the way to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the radical leftist collectivist view</v>

387
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:41.714
<v Speaker 3>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's actually no such thing as free </v>

388
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:44.474
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in worst criticism then than </v>

389
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:48.223
<v Speaker 3>opposing it because the collectivists </v>
<v Speaker 3>believed that you're nothing but an </v>

390
00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:54.500
<v Speaker 3>Avatar of your group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

391
00:25:54.501 --> 00:25:55.334
<v Speaker 3>there is no you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're defined by your group membership </v>

392
00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.053
<v Speaker 3>and then the world is a landscape of </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups each vying for predominance and </v>

393
00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:05.924
<v Speaker 3>that's what there is and it's and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say that you're speaking your </v>

394
00:26:09.831 --> 00:26:10.664
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that isn't something that you can do </v>

395
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:14.480
<v Speaker 3>from the collectivist view point.</v>

396
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:15.733
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing is acting as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious Avatar of the power demands </v>

397
00:26:20.181 --> 00:26:22.430
<v Speaker 3>of your group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no you.</v>

398
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.280
<v Speaker 3>There was no free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no your opinion.</v>

399
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.233
<v Speaker 3>There's no facts for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is to be viewed in </v>

400
00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:30.464
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the power struggle </v>
<v Speaker 3>between groups that even in principle </v>

401
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:35.144
<v Speaker 3>cannot communicate and so the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason that I detest let's say the </v>

402
00:26:40.371 --> 00:26:41.204
<v Speaker 3>collectivist viewpoint is because I see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it leads nowhere but to conflict </v>

403
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.950
<v Speaker 3>because if people cannot speak as </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals between groups,</v>

404
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:57.840
<v Speaker 3>then all they can do is submit or fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the options,</v>

405
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Negotiation,</v>

406
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:06.110
<v Speaker 3>capitulation or warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the options and the only</v>

407
00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:13.530
<v Speaker 3>process that allows for negotiation in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the absence of capitulation or conflict.</v>

408
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.490
<v Speaker 3>His speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we can talk over our differences</v>

409
00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:19.623
<v Speaker 3>and that discussion is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>contentious because we actually have </v>

410
00:27:23.051 --> 00:27:23.884
<v Speaker 3>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but compared to the contentiousness of </v>

411
00:27:26.561 --> 00:27:30.250
<v Speaker 3>not talking over the differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a walk in the park.</v>

412
00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.383
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw something quite remarkable when I </v>

413
00:27:32.891 --> 00:27:33.724
<v Speaker 3>was in London a month and a half ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on this political show and one of </v>

414
00:27:38.441 --> 00:27:39.274
<v Speaker 3>the things they did in this section that</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have anything to do with me was </v>

415
00:27:42.011 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Speaker 3>to show a bunch of clips from the the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

416
00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:47.613
<v Speaker 3>There's a question period that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>British have evolved where the </v>

417
00:27:50.861 --> 00:27:51.694
<v Speaker 3>opposition can go after the prime </v>
<v Speaker 3>minister and the woman that was </v>

418
00:27:54.611 --> 00:27:55.444
<v Speaker 3>appearing with me on the show had </v>
<v Speaker 3>written a book about that called Punch </v>

419
00:27:59.051 --> 00:28:01.120
<v Speaker 3>and Judy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>

420
00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:06.300
<v Speaker 3>and they showed a bunch of clips of </v>
<v Speaker 3>English MPs attacking the prime minister</v>

421
00:28:06.671 --> 00:28:10.090
<v Speaker 3>and the prime minister's response all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way from Thatcher forward.</v>

422
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:15.230
<v Speaker 3>It was absolutely vicious in the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that well-educated British people can be</v>

423
00:28:15.401 --> 00:28:16.234
<v Speaker 3>vicious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very oppressive form of </v>

424
00:28:17.651 --> 00:28:22.651
<v Speaker 3>viciousness and was no holds barred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Verbal combat,</v>

425
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.190
<v Speaker 3>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

426
00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.370
<v Speaker 3>isn't that horrible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's certainly rife,</v>

427
00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.233
<v Speaker 3>let's say with microaggressions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not horrible because none of </v>

428
00:28:31.841 --> 00:28:34.690
<v Speaker 3>them had their hands around each other's</v>
<v Speaker 3>necks,</v>

429
00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all civilized.</v>

430
00:28:37.151 --> 00:28:37.984
<v Speaker 3>It was everyone was standing where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were supposed to stand and they were </v>

431
00:28:40.181 --> 00:28:41.014
<v Speaker 3>hurling invective and making criticisms </v>
<v Speaker 3>and making accusations and defending </v>

432
00:28:44.831 --> 00:28:45.664
<v Speaker 3>themselves and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was all contained within the </v>

433
00:28:49.151 --> 00:28:53.290
<v Speaker 3>peaceful confines of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the house of parliament,</v>

434
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.990
<v Speaker 3>and that's a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

435
00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a miracle and the British are </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly good at that,</v>

436
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.633
<v Speaker 3>and so you leave free speech alone </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the alternative to free speech </v>

437
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:09.561
<v Speaker 3>is capitulation or conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and unless you want one of those or both</v>

438
00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.073
<v Speaker 3>and you might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you don't interfere with the </v>

439
00:29:13.271 --> 00:29:18.271
<v Speaker 3>mechanism that enables people's people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to state the nature of their reality and</v>

440
00:29:18.431 --> 00:29:19.264
<v Speaker 3>to clarify that and to negotiate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>others even though that negotiation is </v>

441
00:29:22.631 --> 00:29:23.464
<v Speaker 3>painful and emotionally demanding and </v>
<v Speaker 3>threatening and anxiety provoking and </v>

442
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:31.000
<v Speaker 3>aggression instigating and all of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

443
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.950
<v Speaker 3>because the alternative is far worse.</v>

444
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:44.870
<v Speaker 3>I wove the idea of individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility through through 12 rules.</v>

445
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.480
<v Speaker 3>While we might say we might begin by </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about how that's related to the</v>

446
00:29:51.491 --> 00:29:53.860
<v Speaker 3>idea of free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>

447
00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:01.170
<v Speaker 3>you have to find your way in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say with all of your peculiarities</v>

448
00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:02.503
<v Speaker 3>or idiosyncrasies and your differences </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the way you do that is by acting in </v>

449
00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:07.474
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way you prepare to act is by </v>

450
00:30:10.181 --> 00:30:13.540
<v Speaker 3>thinking and really what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're thinking.</v>

451
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:14.583
<v Speaker 3>So philosopher named Alfred North </v>
<v Speaker 3>Whitehead who said something very </v>

452
00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:17.704
<v Speaker 3>intelligent about thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that the reason we think is so </v>

453
00:30:20.171 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 3>that our thoughts can die instead of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

454
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:24.574
<v Speaker 3>And it's a Darwinian idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the way animals adapt to the world </v>

455
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.630
<v Speaker 3>across time is that animals produced </v>
<v Speaker 3>variants,</v>

456
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.270
<v Speaker 3>variant offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of them,</v>

457
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.150
<v Speaker 3>and most of them were unsuccessful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>die,</v>

458
00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:42.780
<v Speaker 3>but a few of them are successful enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that time and place to reproduce.</v>

459
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:43.863
<v Speaker 3>And so the animal keeps living across </v>
<v Speaker 3>the millennia varying slightly as it </v>

460
00:30:49.091 --> 00:30:49.924
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to adapt to the transformations of </v>

461
00:30:51.581 --> 00:30:54.610
<v Speaker 3>the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human beings do the same thing,</v>

462
00:30:54.611 --> 00:30:57.100
<v Speaker 3>but we also have figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstract that.</v>

463
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.233
<v Speaker 3>And so what we do when we think is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we produce a fictional world that's an </v>

464
00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:03.843
<v Speaker 3>simulation of the real world and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>populate that simulated world with </v>

465
00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:08.554
<v Speaker 3>simulations of us and then we let those </v>
<v Speaker 3>simulations play out in the simulated </v>

466
00:31:12.671 --> 00:31:13.504
<v Speaker 3>world and the ones that are successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we embody and act out and the ones that </v>

467
00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:17.974
<v Speaker 3>are unsuccessful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we abandoned and let die and we do that </v>

468
00:31:21.131 --> 00:31:21.964
<v Speaker 3>when we're thinking in dreams and we'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that when we think in stories and we </v>

469
00:31:26.771 --> 00:31:27.604
<v Speaker 3>even do that when we think in words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although it's not as obvious when you </v>

470
00:31:30.761 --> 00:31:31.594
<v Speaker 3>argue internally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what you do when you think you </v>

471
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:34.683
<v Speaker 3>have an Avatar that manifests itself as </v>
<v Speaker 3>one point of view and an Avatar that </v>

472
00:31:37.811 --> 00:31:42.811
<v Speaker 3>manifests itself as another and you let </v>
<v Speaker 3>them engage in conflict and the one that</v>

473
00:31:43.241 --> 00:31:44.810
<v Speaker 3>loses you let go of.</v>

474
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:45.663
<v Speaker 3>That's a sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're discussing something with </v>

475
00:31:47.951 --> 00:31:48.784
<v Speaker 3>someone and it's important that you both</v>
<v Speaker 3>put your viewpoints forward and you </v>

476
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.530
<v Speaker 3>analyze the consequences of the dispute </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you walk away with any luck,</v>

477
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.413
<v Speaker 3>why is there then you were so that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can embody a motive being that's more </v>

478
00:32:00.971 --> 00:32:05.971
<v Speaker 3>likely to be successful and you do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>in part in large part by exercising your</v>

479
00:32:06.251 --> 00:32:08.890
<v Speaker 3>freedom of speech and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

480
00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:09.724
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freedom of speech and freedom of </v>

481
00:32:10.961 --> 00:32:11.794
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is don't be </v>

482
00:32:13.421 --> 00:32:18.421
<v Speaker 3>thinking that you think because thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>is very hard and most people can't think</v>

483
00:32:19.811 --> 00:32:20.644
<v Speaker 3>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even if you can think you're not </v>

484
00:32:22.481 --> 00:32:23.314
<v Speaker 3>very good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean think about what you have to do </v>

485
00:32:25.121 --> 00:32:27.400
<v Speaker 3>technically to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

486
00:32:27.401 --> 00:32:30.970
<v Speaker 3>you have to formulate the problem that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard enough and you have to formulate it</v>

487
00:32:30.971 --> 00:32:31.804
<v Speaker 3>precisely.</v>

488
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.733
<v Speaker 3>Then you have to generate multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential solutions to the problem and </v>

489
00:32:36.581 --> 00:32:39.080
<v Speaker 3>then you have to let those solutions </v>
<v Speaker 3>argue</v>

490
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:41.773
<v Speaker 3>into a hierarchy internally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you have to be able to tolerate </v>

491
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:46.310
<v Speaker 3>that stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

492
00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:47.144
<v Speaker 3>You can't just be one thing if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to think because thinking isn't </v>

493
00:32:49.251 --> 00:32:51.200
<v Speaker 3>just saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I think is right,</v>

494
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:52.423
<v Speaker 3>that's not thinking at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thinking is questioning whether or not </v>

495
00:32:54.471 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 3>what you think is right is right and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really hard.</v>

496
00:32:57.261 --> 00:33:01.160
<v Speaker 3>It's very demanding and so and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that to some degree,</v>

497
00:33:01.161 --> 00:33:02.750
<v Speaker 3>but you're not as good at it as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

498
00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:03.584
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're a pretty good thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly the way you think is by talking </v>

499
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.533
<v Speaker 3>and you talk and mostly when you talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>and think it's contentious as you know </v>

500
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:14.563
<v Speaker 3>if you've ever had an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with someone because an </v>

501
00:33:17.961 --> 00:33:19.220
<v Speaker 3>intimate relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it,</v>

502
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:20.203
<v Speaker 3>if it has any worth at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a place where there's tremendous </v>

503
00:33:23.211 --> 00:33:24.044
<v Speaker 3>contention but it's bounded within </v>
<v Speaker 3>something approximating mutual respect </v>

504
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:32.120
<v Speaker 3>and the willingness to continue to play </v>
<v Speaker 3>the game across time and the reason that</v>

505
00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:34.050
<v Speaker 3>an intimate relationship as contentious </v>
<v Speaker 3>as.</v>

506
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:34.883
<v Speaker 3>Because life is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult and people are different </v>

507
00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.460
<v Speaker 3>and we face extraordinarily complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems together.</v>

508
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:41.443
<v Speaker 3>Like how to make a living and how to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How to operate properly in our careers </v>

509
00:33:45.411 --> 00:33:47.420
<v Speaker 3>and how to rank order the importance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our careers.</v>

510
00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:48.254
<v Speaker 3>And how to manage our domestic economies</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how to discipline our kids and </v>

511
00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:52.003
<v Speaker 3>whether or not to have kids and how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>enter middle age and how to grow old </v>

512
00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:56.834
<v Speaker 3>gracefully and how to live productively </v>
<v Speaker 3>and where to vacation and all of these </v>

513
00:34:00.801 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 3>things which are extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult problems and the only way that</v>

514
00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:04.784
<v Speaker 3>we can solve them is by butting heads to</v>
<v Speaker 3>some degree and communicating freely </v>

515
00:34:08.571 --> 00:34:09.404
<v Speaker 3>about what the possibilities are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiating a solution and that's </v>

516
00:34:12.681 --> 00:34:15.380
<v Speaker 3>thinking and in order to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

517
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.453
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to speak freely and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you certainly have to be willing to </v>

518
00:34:19.731 --> 00:34:21.350
<v Speaker 3>offend someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

519
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:25.040
<v Speaker 3>of all the stupid questions I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>been asked by journalists,</v>

520
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.113
<v Speaker 3>the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes you think you have the right </v>

521
00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:33.251
<v Speaker 3>to offend someone by what you say is by </v>
<v Speaker 3>far the most miraculously ignorant.</v>

522
00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.140
<v Speaker 3>And I say that because,</v>

523
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.253
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

524
00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.733
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

525
00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:45.470
<v Speaker 3>it just sets me back on my heels to some</v>
<v Speaker 3>degree because I think,</v>

526
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:48.520
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your claim here?</v>

527
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.393
<v Speaker 3>Your claim is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your first claim is we could </v>

528
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:55.394
<v Speaker 3>hypothetically discussed something </v>
<v Speaker 3>important without one of us getting </v>

529
00:34:57.531 --> 00:34:59.320
<v Speaker 3>upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

530
00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.350
<v Speaker 3>that's not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ever discussed anything important</v>

531
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:04.184
<v Speaker 3>with anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including just discussing it with </v>

532
00:35:06.801 --> 00:35:10.100
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only are you going to get upset,</v>

533
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.550
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get so upset that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably won't even do it.</v>

534
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:14.751
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

535
00:35:14.751 --> 00:35:16.130
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a difficult problem.</v>

536
00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.380
<v Speaker 3>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your first reaction?</v>

537
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.423
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sit right here and think </v>

538
00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:21.440
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

539
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that isn't your reaction.</v>

540
00:35:22.641 --> 00:35:23.474
<v Speaker 3>Your reaction is to go like play a video</v>
<v Speaker 3>game or watch a youtube video or or </v>

541
00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:30.650
<v Speaker 3>vacuum your bedroom or do the dishes or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you can do.</v>

542
00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Not to think about that.</v>

543
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:34.400
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

544
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.193
<v Speaker 3>and then if you're going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion with your wife or your </v>

545
00:35:38.281 --> 00:35:41.040
<v Speaker 3>husband or your kids and it's about </v>
<v Speaker 3>something important.</v>

546
00:35:41.041 --> 00:35:41.874
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you're a normal person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your heart rate goes up and it's like </v>

547
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:46.614
<v Speaker 3>it's demanding and then you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it through and then you're </v>

548
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:49.044
<v Speaker 3>probably wrong and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stumble over your words and God only </v>

549
00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:52.254
<v Speaker 3>knows if you're going to reach a </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution and you can't tell if it's </v>

550
00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:54.714
<v Speaker 3>going to mean the end of your damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship and like the catastrophe </v>

551
00:35:58.201 --> 00:35:59.034
<v Speaker 3>lurks everywhere when you're discussing </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult issues and the rule is </v>

552
00:36:01.501 --> 00:36:04.200
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't offend anyone.</v>

553
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then okay,</v>

554
00:36:05.521 --> 00:36:06.354
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you never get to talk about </v>

555
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:09.690
<v Speaker 3>anything that's important with anyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever including yourself.</v>

556
00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.330
<v Speaker 3>So like that's supposed to be the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you think,</v>

557
00:36:12.331 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 3>well even if it's not quite that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like let's say,</v>

558
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:19.020
<v Speaker 3>so here I'm addressing about 850 people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

559
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the probability that I could talk</v>

560
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:22.974
<v Speaker 3>about anything that any of you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever want to listen to for more than </v>

561
00:36:25.711 --> 00:36:27.630
<v Speaker 3>about 15 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

562
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.493
<v Speaker 3>that would grip your interests without </v>
<v Speaker 3>me or offending at least one person in </v>

563
00:36:31.651 --> 00:36:35.430
<v Speaker 3>this room with each sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a thousand people in here.</v>

564
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:38.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some people are unbelievably easy to</v>

565
00:36:38.791 --> 00:36:39.990
<v Speaker 3>offend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that.</v>

566
00:36:39.991 --> 00:36:42.240
<v Speaker 3>They're just looking for a reason to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>offended,</v>

567
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.190
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's that problem.</v>

568
00:36:44.191 --> 00:36:46.620
<v Speaker 3>But if we're going to deal with things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>

569
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.513
<v Speaker 3>that are solid and contentious and why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about things that we already all </v>

570
00:36:52.381 --> 00:36:54.480
<v Speaker 3>agree on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've already solved those problems.</v>

571
00:36:54.481 --> 00:36:57.330
<v Speaker 3>We can only really talk about things we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't agree on.</v>

572
00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.313
<v Speaker 3>It's the only thing worth talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well of course everyone's going to be </v>

573
00:37:00.991 --> 00:37:04.410
<v Speaker 3>offended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so for a journalist to ask that,</v>

574
00:37:04.411 --> 00:37:06.630
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the Hell's with you?</v>

575
00:37:06.631 --> 00:37:09.000
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What planet do you inhabit?</v>

576
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.283
<v Speaker 3>Don't you understand that your entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>discipline is predicated on not only </v>

577
00:37:16.441 --> 00:37:17.274
<v Speaker 3>your right to offend someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the responsibility that you have to </v>

578
00:37:20.791 --> 00:37:24.240
<v Speaker 3>offend people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's it's</v>

579
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:44.750
<v Speaker 3>thinking is an offensive act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why tyrants hated,</v>

580
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:46.543
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because one of the rules and tyranny is </v>

581
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:49.603
<v Speaker 3>don't think why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I already know all the answers </v>

582
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:57.560
<v Speaker 3>and you're supposed to accept my answers</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the tyrant,</v>

583
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:59.840
<v Speaker 3>and so there's no need for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>

584
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:01.490
<v Speaker 3>And you might be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

585
00:38:01.491 --> 00:38:05.420
<v Speaker 3>my life isn't going as well as it could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the tyrant says,</v>

586
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.403
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to think that because in </v>

587
00:38:07.941 --> 00:38:11.060
<v Speaker 3>my utopian tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's perfect,</v>

588
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.343
<v Speaker 3>and if you're suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means you're politically suspect </v>

589
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:17.023
<v Speaker 3>because you're suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your inability to recognize that the </v>

590
00:38:19.461 --> 00:38:23.720
<v Speaker 3>utopia has already manifested itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your unhappiness is actually a political</v>

591
00:38:23.721 --> 00:38:26.000
<v Speaker 3>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you just keep it to yourself,</v>

592
00:38:26.001 --> 00:38:29.780
<v Speaker 3>well we'll let you keep your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you have the the.</v>

593
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.183
<v Speaker 3>If you're driven to the extreme where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to express the fact you're </v>

594
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.173
<v Speaker 3>unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps that your child doesn't have </v>

595
00:38:38.321 --> 00:38:39.154
<v Speaker 3>enough to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's off to the Gulag with you and </v>

596
00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 3>all your family as well because there'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>be no thinking here.</v>

597
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.550
<v Speaker 3>And even if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll certainly be no talking.</v>

598
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.510
<v Speaker 3>So here's something that happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently in Venezuela.</v>

599
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:53.943
<v Speaker 3>This is worth thinking about for all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who harbor collectivist Utopian </v>

600
00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.300
<v Speaker 3>Dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Venezuela,</v>

601
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.210
<v Speaker 3>the Venezuelan government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About two months ago,</v>

602
00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:08.260
<v Speaker 3>this was reported in the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not a newspaper,</v>

603
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:11.290
<v Speaker 3>I would say that would be intrinsically </v>
<v Speaker 3>biased against Venezuela,</v>

604
00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:12.903
<v Speaker 3>said that it was now illegal to diagnose</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cause of a child's death in a </v>

605
00:39:17.681 --> 00:39:22.681
<v Speaker 3>Venezuelan hospital as starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the Venezuelans,</v>

606
00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:28.320
<v Speaker 3>Venezuelan government's answer to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem of children starving was to make</v>

607
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:33.990
<v Speaker 3>it illegal to notice it in hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a tyranny,</v>

608
00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:35.403
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a place where thought is not </v>

609
00:39:36.671 --> 00:39:37.504
<v Speaker 3>allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a place where free speech is not </v>

610
00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:43.030
<v Speaker 3>allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it seems to me that that's not a good</v>

611
00:39:43.031 --> 00:39:43.864
<v Speaker 3>place to go to say the least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've gone there many times in the </v>

612
00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:52.120
<v Speaker 3>last hundred and 50 years and we should </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps think very hard about whether or</v>

613
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:53.740
<v Speaker 3>not we ever want to go there again.</v>

614
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:56.263
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first rule in 12 rules for life is </v>

615
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:02.170
<v Speaker 3>stand up straight with your shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and I want to tell you a little bit</v>

616
00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:06.340
<v Speaker 3>about the world in which that rule </v>
<v Speaker 3>applies and it's our world,</v>

617
00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:07.174
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't necessarily the world that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think of when you think of our </v>

618
00:40:11.051 --> 00:40:12.670
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although it's the world,</v>

619
00:40:12.671 --> 00:40:13.504
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because it's a world you </v>

620
00:40:15.191 --> 00:40:16.001
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't know.</v>

621
00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:18.580
<v Speaker 3>You know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a world that presents itself to you</v>

622
00:40:18.581 --> 00:40:22.840
<v Speaker 3>in literary form and in mythological </v>
<v Speaker 3>foreman and symbolic form.</v>

623
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.080
<v Speaker 3>And you all understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't articulate it.</v>

624
00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:30.610
<v Speaker 3>But I can articulate some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of you have seen the lion king?</v>

625
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many of you haven't?</v>

626
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's a better question.</v>

627
00:40:35.941 --> 00:40:36.774
<v Speaker 3>Hardly you guys should see the lion king</v>
<v Speaker 3>because obviously there's something </v>

628
00:40:38.671 --> 00:40:40.020
<v Speaker 3>wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

629
00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.150
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in any ways.</v>

630
00:40:42.151 --> 00:40:44.280
<v Speaker 3>I want to tell you about the world of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lion king.</v>

631
00:40:44.281 --> 00:40:45.114
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I want you to notice </v>

632
00:40:46.051 --> 00:40:49.380
<v Speaker 3>is that when you go see that movie or </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you show it to your kids,</v>

633
00:40:49.381 --> 00:40:52.590
<v Speaker 3>when you watch it at home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what you fall into it,</v>

634
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.960
<v Speaker 3>and that's very strange because first of</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

635
00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.760
<v Speaker 3>it's not a world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's drawings,</v>

636
00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:58.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's animated drawings of a world.</v>

637
00:40:58.951 --> 00:41:01.680
<v Speaker 3>It's very low resolution and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures aren't human.</v>

638
00:41:01.681 --> 00:41:05.010
<v Speaker 3>They're animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've all noticed that no doubt and the</v>

639
00:41:05.011 --> 00:41:05.844
<v Speaker 3>world is magical because things happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>in it that aren't the sorts of things </v>

640
00:41:09.661 --> 00:41:11.280
<v Speaker 3>that obviously happened in the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

641
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.960
<v Speaker 3>but you don't care about any of that.</v>

642
00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:16.800
<v Speaker 3>You don't care that the animals talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't care that the lions are kings.</v>

643
00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:18.143
<v Speaker 3>All of that makes perfect sense to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that means that which is a very </v>

644
00:41:21.241 --> 00:41:22.074
<v Speaker 3>strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it means that the manner in which </v>

645
00:41:25.471 --> 00:41:26.304
<v Speaker 3>the characters are represented and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world that they inhabit is somehow </v>

646
00:41:28.831 --> 00:41:29.664
<v Speaker 3>familiar to you because otherwise you </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't fall into it and you wouldn't </v>

647
00:41:33.231 --> 00:41:35.120
<v Speaker 3>even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'd noticed that what you're doing</v>

648
00:41:35.121 --> 00:41:37.340
<v Speaker 3>is so strange because it really is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange.</v>

649
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:38.174
<v Speaker 3>So imagine the opening of the lion king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is that the camera pans </v>

650
00:41:42.621 --> 00:41:46.010
<v Speaker 3>over the Great African plain and you see</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the animals gathering,</v>

651
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:46.903
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all coming together and there's </v>

652
00:41:47.391 --> 00:41:52.040
<v Speaker 3>this kind of thrilling Black Gospel </v>
<v Speaker 3>music going on in the background with an</v>

653
00:41:52.041 --> 00:41:55.220
<v Speaker 3>African beat and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's really well done.</v>

654
00:41:55.230 --> 00:42:00.230
<v Speaker 3>The opening of that movie and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera pans up like,</v>

655
00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:01.693
<v Speaker 3>like it's revealing something and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see this structure that's known in the </v>

656
00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:06.590
<v Speaker 3>movie as pride rock.</v>

657
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:07.933
<v Speaker 3>And so it's this structure that rises up</v>
<v Speaker 3>above the plane and it's shaped like </v>

658
00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:13.880
<v Speaker 3>it's a mountain essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although it's not,</v>

659
00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:16.190
<v Speaker 3>it's just a rock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a high place.</v>

660
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a place that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can view everything from.</v>

661
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:20.893
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a place that it's a place from </v>

662
00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:24.920
<v Speaker 3>which you can get an overview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a place from which you can see,</v>

663
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.473
<v Speaker 3>and you're introduced to the king's </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bird whose name I don't remember </v>

664
00:42:29.961 --> 00:42:32.360
<v Speaker 3>at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's the eyes of the king.</v>

665
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:33.283
<v Speaker 3>So the king is obviously something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has eyes because he has a bird and the </v>

666
00:42:36.531 --> 00:42:40.250
<v Speaker 3>bird can fly around from up above and </v>
<v Speaker 3>see everything and report to him.</v>

667
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:42.980
<v Speaker 3>So whatever the king is is associated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the bird.</v>

668
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.113
<v Speaker 3>Just like horace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ancient Egyptian God was associated </v>

669
00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:48.590
<v Speaker 3>with a Falcon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

670
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.633
<v Speaker 3>for exactly that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>falcons can see better than any other </v>

671
00:42:51.681 --> 00:42:54.290
<v Speaker 3>creature by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better even than human beings.</v>

672
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.123
<v Speaker 3>And we have very good eyesight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the king is the creature who can see </v>

673
00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:58.873
<v Speaker 3>and the king is Elian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason the lions that king is </v>

674
00:43:00.861 --> 00:43:03.200
<v Speaker 3>because the lions at the top of the food</v>
<v Speaker 3>chain,</v>

675
00:43:03.201 --> 00:43:05.600
<v Speaker 3>that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the line is a solar beast.</v>

676
00:43:05.601 --> 00:43:06.434
<v Speaker 3>He has a main.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's associated with the sun he's </v>

677
00:43:08.331 --> 00:43:09.164
<v Speaker 3>associated with the daytime is </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with power and majesty and </v>

678
00:43:11.961 --> 00:43:15.020
<v Speaker 3>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not a mouse that's king right?</v>

679
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:16.990
<v Speaker 3>It's not a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

680
00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.800
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lion and you think,</v>

681
00:43:18.801 --> 00:43:21.400
<v Speaker 3>well obviously the lion is king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

682
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:22.243
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows that even though animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have kings in case you didn't </v>

683
00:43:24.981 --> 00:43:25.814
<v Speaker 3>notice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not self evident that it should </v>

684
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:28.243
<v Speaker 3>be the lion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the lion is on the rock in the </v>

685
00:43:30.981 --> 00:43:32.620
<v Speaker 3>sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

686
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.493
<v Speaker 3>So the rock sticks up above everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>else and the lion is there and the lion </v>

687
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:37.363
<v Speaker 3>is a paternal line and he has a mate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scene opens with them giving birth </v>

688
00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:44.054
<v Speaker 3>and so it's a nativity scene and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's painfully obvious if you </v>

689
00:43:48.171 --> 00:43:50.240
<v Speaker 3>watch it with a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>detachment,</v>

690
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:51.463
<v Speaker 3>it's entity scene and Rififi who's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shaman priest lifts up the new Messiah </v>

691
00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:00.643
<v Speaker 3>to the sun and when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the music swells and all of the animals </v>

692
00:44:03.981 --> 00:44:05.060
<v Speaker 3>go don't own their knees.</v>

693
00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.610
<v Speaker 3>And it's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the,</v>

694
00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:13.050
<v Speaker 3>there's a drum beat and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the words the lion king come up on stage</v>

695
00:44:13.131 --> 00:44:16.040
<v Speaker 3>and it's beautifully done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's beautifully done.</v>

696
00:44:16.041 --> 00:44:16.874
<v Speaker 3>They they pan up to the revelation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lion cub to the sun two or three </v>

697
00:44:21.351 --> 00:44:22.610
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's really,</v>

698
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:27.560
<v Speaker 3>it's really emotional moment and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>because all of these levels of symbolism</v>

699
00:44:27.561 --> 00:44:31.530
<v Speaker 3>lock in at the same time you have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>the environment,</v>

700
00:44:31.531 --> 00:44:33.510
<v Speaker 3>the field where all the animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>gathered,</v>

701
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:34.403
<v Speaker 3>so all the animals are gathering to </v>
<v Speaker 3>review the revelation of something </v>

702
00:44:37.081 --> 00:44:37.914
<v Speaker 3>transcendent and the revelation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's transcendent is the birth of the </v>

703
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.070
<v Speaker 3>new hero to the king and Queen on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rock above the plane,</v>

704
00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:48.903
<v Speaker 3>and there's a universal truth in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why the animators worked as </v>

705
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:55.590
<v Speaker 3>hard as they did to make that scene and </v>
<v Speaker 3>why it opens.</v>

706
00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:59.040
<v Speaker 3>What was one of the most spectacularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful movies of all time.</v>

707
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:04.850
<v Speaker 3>And the way the filmmakers do it is when</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rafiki holds up the the infant Simba,</v>

708
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.930
<v Speaker 3>the clouds break and the sun shines on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

709
00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:14.970
<v Speaker 3>and that's the culminating moment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the revelation of the identity of</v>

710
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:18.240
<v Speaker 3>the newborn hero with the consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the sun.</v>

711
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.440
<v Speaker 3>And so we're light creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're daytime creatures.</v>

712
00:45:22.441 --> 00:45:23.910
<v Speaker 3>We're visual creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

713
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.870
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not.</v>

714
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.280
<v Speaker 3>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not nocturnal.</v>

715
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:27.533
<v Speaker 3>The night is when we're unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day is when we're conscious and the </v>

716
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.633
<v Speaker 3>terminology that we use that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with the furtherance of our </v>

717
00:45:36.091 --> 00:45:38.970
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is illumination and </v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment,</v>

718
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:40.163
<v Speaker 3>and so there's a tight relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>between waking up and letting the light </v>

719
00:45:43.921 --> 00:45:44.754
<v Speaker 3>shine in and developing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and the association </v>

720
00:45:49.561 --> 00:45:50.394
<v Speaker 3>between the rays of the sun and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifting up of the infant is the </v>

721
00:45:55.891 --> 00:45:59.040
<v Speaker 3>association,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ancient association between the hero</v>

722
00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:02.490
<v Speaker 3>who defeats the forces of darkness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Sun itself,</v>

723
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:03.803
<v Speaker 3>and you all know all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why that opening works and why </v>

724
00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:09.870
<v Speaker 3>it sets the scene for the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

725
00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.900
<v Speaker 3>And what's the rest of the movie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

726
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.420
<v Speaker 3>we can think about the landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

727
00:46:15.421 --> 00:46:18.180
<v Speaker 3>there's a scene where Simba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his father,</v>

728
00:46:18.181 --> 00:46:21.780
<v Speaker 3>takes him up on top of pride rock and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tells him that his kingdom,</v>

729
00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:26.130
<v Speaker 3>that he's the king and his kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 3>extends as far as the light touches.</v>

730
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:30.060
<v Speaker 3>So the landscape is a place with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramid in it.</v>

731
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:31.223
<v Speaker 3>There at the top of the pyramid on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>plane that's circumscribed by the light </v>

732
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:39.860
<v Speaker 3>and outside the light is darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the the mythological landscape in</v>

733
00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:45.291
<v Speaker 3>which this story reveals itself is light</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus darkness or order versus chaos,</v>

734
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:50.130
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that is because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is our landscape.</v>

735
00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:51.443
<v Speaker 3>We inhabit pyramid structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are hierarchies of other </v>

736
00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.330
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in our society,</v>

737
00:46:57.331 --> 00:46:59.160
<v Speaker 3>those are mostly hierarchies of </v>
<v Speaker 3>competence.</v>

738
00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:00.480
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

739
00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.460
<v Speaker 3>we inhabit hierarchical structures on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>plane that's defined,</v>

740
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:10.320
<v Speaker 3>defined by our understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by what we do not comprehend,</v>

741
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.560
<v Speaker 3>and that's the universal human world.</v>

742
00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:19.580
<v Speaker 3>And that hierarchy itself is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooperative structure that enables us to</v>

743
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.383
<v Speaker 3>live with a certain amount of peace in </v>
<v Speaker 3>productivity together and also to </v>

744
00:47:25.831 --> 00:47:26.664
<v Speaker 3>establish a value system with whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the pinnacle of the hierarchy </v>

745
00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 3>regarded as whatever's most valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now think about what happens in the lion</v>

746
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 3>king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

747
00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:40.563
<v Speaker 3>it's a voyage into what's most valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an examination of what's most </v>

748
00:47:44.141 --> 00:47:45.340
<v Speaker 3>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

749
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.173
<v Speaker 3>the old kingdom is threatened by scar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scar is the evil king of the evil </v>

750
00:47:54.101 --> 00:47:57.710
<v Speaker 3>brother of the king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The king is the PR,</v>

751
00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:01.150
<v Speaker 3>the entity that inhabits the pinnacle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pyramid.</v>

752
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:06.280
<v Speaker 3>The king always has an evil brother and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you knew that as well,</v>

753
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:07.773
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that is that there is</v>
<v Speaker 3>no hierarchy that's so pristine that it </v>

754
00:48:10.511 --> 00:48:15.511
<v Speaker 3>isn't threatened by corruption and scars</v>
<v Speaker 3>presented as a resentful intellect,</v>

755
00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.160
<v Speaker 3>and that's a very common trope as well.</v>

756
00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:21.160
<v Speaker 3>That's the evil scientist idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the only.</v>

757
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.310
<v Speaker 3>Only the evil scientist idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the mad scientist.</v>

758
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:26.380
<v Speaker 3>It's the evil genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

759
00:48:26.381 --> 00:48:27.214
<v Speaker 3>How many movies with a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 3>substrate have come out in the last 20 </v>

760
00:48:31.001 --> 00:48:34.480
<v Speaker 3>years that prominently feature an evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>genius?</v>

761
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:39.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's dozens of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an inexhaustible hunger for that</v>

762
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:42.220
<v Speaker 3>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning the last avengers movie,</v>

763
00:48:42.221 --> 00:48:43.530
<v Speaker 3>you had fat it toast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

764
00:48:43.531 --> 00:48:44.364
<v Speaker 3>He was basically the spirit of death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was an evil genius who thinks that </v>

765
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.153
<v Speaker 3>mass extinction is the answer to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>population problem of let's say the </v>

766
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:56.260
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something to think about very seriously.</v>

767
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:57.783
<v Speaker 3>While the reason for that is that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>estate is always threatened by </v>

768
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.713
<v Speaker 3>malevolence always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hierarchy can always be become </v>

769
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:04.953
<v Speaker 3>corrupt and tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that those are the forces of </v>

770
00:49:07.961 --> 00:49:08.794
<v Speaker 3>malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say they're conspiring behind the </v>

771
00:49:10.511 --> 00:49:11.344
<v Speaker 3>scenes tend to tilt every hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards tyranny and the proper attitude </v>

772
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:18.303
<v Speaker 3>to take towards that universal truth is </v>
<v Speaker 3>to stay in the light and keep your damn </v>

773
00:49:22.931 --> 00:49:23.764
<v Speaker 3>eyes open and so well what happens in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lion king is that the evil brother </v>

774
00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:34.360
<v Speaker 3>overthrows the rightful king,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that again is an unbelievably common</v>

775
00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:34.810
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

776
00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:35.643
<v Speaker 3>You see that idea echo throat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mythological landscape for </v>

777
00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:39.124
<v Speaker 3>centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that is it happens </v>

778
00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:43.840
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened in Nazi Germany.</v>

779
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:48.070
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happened in most of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical societies of the world,</v>

780
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:51.160
<v Speaker 3>and most societies in the world are </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical.</v>

781
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:52.743
<v Speaker 3>There's always the possibility that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies that we live in will become </v>

782
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.050
<v Speaker 3>corrupt and counterproductive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's multiple reasons for that,</v>

783
00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.770
<v Speaker 3>but there is summed up in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence of the arrogant intellect.</v>

784
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.630
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

785
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:08.950
<v Speaker 3>That's a very common idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the character of Milton Satan,</v>

786
00:50:08.951 --> 00:50:09.784
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's the ultimate in arrogant </v>

787
00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.240
<v Speaker 3>intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Milton,</v>

788
00:50:13.241 --> 00:50:14.074
<v Speaker 3>Satan is the figure who believes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>his knowledge is sufficient to do </v>

789
00:50:17.351 --> 00:50:18.184
<v Speaker 3>without the transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do without the idea that there's </v>

790
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:24.130
<v Speaker 3>something beyond or that there's still </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to learn.</v>

791
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:25.203
<v Speaker 3>All I know is all that I need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly the belief of the </v>

792
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:30.440
<v Speaker 3>fundamental tyrant.</v>

793
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:36.950
<v Speaker 3>The evil brother of the king kills the </v>
<v Speaker 3>king.</v>

794
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Simba loses his father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

795
00:50:39.561 --> 00:50:40.394
<v Speaker 3>that's another common idea because </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone loses their father in some </v>

796
00:50:43.341 --> 00:50:44.174
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People grow up and become cynical as </v>

797
00:50:45.531 --> 00:50:49.430
<v Speaker 3>teenagers and the reason they become </v>
<v Speaker 3>cynical as teenagers is because they see</v>

798
00:50:49.431 --> 00:50:54.431
<v Speaker 3>that the corruption of the state is </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficient to undermine their confidence</v>

799
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.790
<v Speaker 3>in the benevolence of the state and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>get cynical prematurely because what the</v>

800
00:50:58.791 --> 00:50:59.624
<v Speaker 3>hell do you know when you're a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're encouraged in your cynicism </v>

801
00:51:02.301 --> 00:51:05.300
<v Speaker 3>frequently in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a very bad idea.</v>

802
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.291
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

803
00:51:06.291 --> 00:51:07.124
<v Speaker 3>even though it is the case that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure is always threatened by </v>

804
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:12.200
<v Speaker 3>malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

805
00:51:12.201 --> 00:51:13.034
<v Speaker 3>and and human weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simba ends up fatherless and lost and </v>

806
00:51:18.351 --> 00:51:21.230
<v Speaker 3>alienated from his kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like King Arthur.</v>

807
00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:22.903
<v Speaker 3>It's the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The king is often the rightful king is </v>

808
00:51:25.401 --> 00:51:30.401
<v Speaker 3>often dissociated from his kingdom and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forced to occupy a domain that's outside</v>

809
00:51:30.981 --> 00:51:33.500
<v Speaker 3>the kingdom and that's what happens to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Simba.</v>

810
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.500
<v Speaker 3>He loses his father and what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

811
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:41.120
<v Speaker 3>He adopts the lifestyle of an impulsive </v>
<v Speaker 3>adolescent.</v>

812
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:43.183
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so he's out there in no man's land </v>

813
00:51:46.761 --> 00:51:47.594
<v Speaker 3>with his useless teenage friends doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing of any good except living for </v>

814
00:51:52.881 --> 00:51:53.714
<v Speaker 3>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the nihilistic retreat from </v>

815
00:51:56.721 --> 00:51:59.600
<v Speaker 3>the corrupt state and no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you might say,</v>

816
00:51:59.601 --> 00:52:01.160
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the state is corrupt,</v>

817
00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:04.250
<v Speaker 3>why should I participate in it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintenance?</v>

818
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:05.563
<v Speaker 3>Why should I do anything that's useful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If all I'm doing is furthering the </v>

819
00:52:08.181 --> 00:52:09.014
<v Speaker 3>development of a corrupt state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would say the message in the most </v>

820
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:17.180
<v Speaker 3>pathological university disciplines the </v>
<v Speaker 3>activist disciplines,</v>

821
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:21.260
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly the message that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly putting out two young men,</v>

822
00:52:21.261 --> 00:52:23.750
<v Speaker 3>which is you live in a corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy,</v>

823
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:28.430
<v Speaker 3>and that means any attempts that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>make to further yourself in this life as</v>

824
00:52:28.431 --> 00:52:30.680
<v Speaker 3>an individual with regards to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>

825
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:35.060
<v Speaker 3>another corrupt patriarchal institution </v>
<v Speaker 3>with regards to marriage or career,</v>

826
00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:38.210
<v Speaker 3>that all that is is furthering the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt patriarchy.</v>

827
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:39.463
<v Speaker 3>Everything you do that you think is good</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the productive sense is actually </v>

828
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:45.020
<v Speaker 3>doing nothing but contributing to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophic,</v>

829
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.170
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very demoralizing,</v>

830
00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:49.183
<v Speaker 3>but also opens the door for you to be as</v>
<v Speaker 3>useless as you possibly can because </v>

831
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.013
<v Speaker 3>there's always a temptation in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction because it's easier and you </v>

832
00:52:56.541 --> 00:52:58.220
<v Speaker 3>can justify it by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

833
00:52:58.700 --> 00:52:59.533
<v Speaker 3>if I did anything productive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all he would be doing is furthering the </v>

834
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.073
<v Speaker 3>dominance of the corrupt system anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you haven't met people who think </v>

835
00:53:07.011 --> 00:53:07.844
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you haven't met very many people </v>

836
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:13.730
<v Speaker 3>because that's an unbelievably common </v>
<v Speaker 3>way of thinking and it's an excuse,</v>

837
00:53:13.731 --> 00:53:14.564
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also a logical reaction to the </v>

838
00:53:16.851 --> 00:53:17.684
<v Speaker 3>confusion of competence with power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part and parcel of the </v>

839
00:53:20.511 --> 00:53:25.511
<v Speaker 3>collectivist landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Simba grows up so to speak,</v>

840
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:26.873
<v Speaker 3>gets older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least playing this impulsive day to </v>

841
00:53:29.941 --> 00:53:33.360
<v Speaker 3>day game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rule seven in my book is due.</v>

842
00:53:33.361 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 3>What is meaningful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not what is expedient,</v>

843
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:36.950
<v Speaker 3>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>symbols.</v>

844
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:41.160
<v Speaker 3>Lifestyle outside the rightful kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 3>is nothing but expedience.</v>

845
00:53:41.161 --> 00:53:44.700
<v Speaker 3>It's impulsive pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that lasts until,</v>

846
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:46.403
<v Speaker 3>until what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Until his old girlfriend shows up Nela </v>

847
00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:52.163
<v Speaker 3>and she's been dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe of the state and maybe </v>

848
00:53:54.571 --> 00:53:55.404
<v Speaker 3>that's because</v>

849
00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:58.473
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>

850
00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:00.643
<v Speaker 3>the demands of family fall heavier on </v>
<v Speaker 3>women at least initially and so there </v>

851
00:54:06.101 --> 00:54:08.690
<v Speaker 3>are more sensitive to the catastrophe of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the state.</v>

852
00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:13.790
<v Speaker 3>Now let's shows up and says to Simba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell do you think you're doing?</v>

853
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:17.510
<v Speaker 3>You're useless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked you when you were a kid.</v>

854
00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:18.433
<v Speaker 3>Here you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're completely useless and </v>

855
00:54:20.061 --> 00:54:20.894
<v Speaker 3>everything's falling apart and the state</v>
<v Speaker 3>has become corrupt and there isn't </v>

856
00:54:22.941 --> 00:54:23.774
<v Speaker 3>enough to eat and there's things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to be done and he falls in love </v>

857
00:54:26.991 --> 00:54:27.824
<v Speaker 3>with her of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably because she criticizes him and </v>

858
00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:32.443
<v Speaker 3>and then he's deeply ashamed of himself </v>
<v Speaker 3>because she rejects him because he's </v>

859
00:54:36.321 --> 00:54:37.154
<v Speaker 3>useless and so she should reject him </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's useless and if she didn't </v>

860
00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.360
<v Speaker 3>then he'd never figured out why I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>useless and do something about it.</v>

861
00:54:44.361 --> 00:54:47.150
<v Speaker 3>And that's when he meets his father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>

862
00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:47.984
<v Speaker 3>there's an initiation seen there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wise old baboon who was supposed to </v>

863
00:54:50.991 --> 00:54:51.824
<v Speaker 3>be a fool and in the early drafts of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie guides him down under ground so </v>

864
00:54:55.881 --> 00:55:00.100
<v Speaker 3>that he can reflect upon himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what he does in a pool down in,</v>

865
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.983
<v Speaker 3>in the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what he sees reflected in his own </v>

866
00:55:03.771 --> 00:55:06.470
<v Speaker 3>face is the spirit of his dead father.</v>

867
00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:10.370
<v Speaker 3>Mature face symbol looks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

868
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.960
<v Speaker 3>He looks like a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>caught in headlights.</v>

869
00:55:11.961 --> 00:55:12.794
<v Speaker 3>The animators have done a really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>job of capturing that naive and sort of </v>

870
00:55:18.681 --> 00:55:19.514
<v Speaker 3>rotten old adolescent innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's outlived its utility and but his </v>

871
00:55:24.321 --> 00:55:25.154
<v Speaker 3>father has a very set face which means </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's integrated his aggression and he </v>

872
00:55:29.091 --> 00:55:29.924
<v Speaker 3>sees his father in the water and then he</v>
<v Speaker 3>sees his father in the sky and his </v>

873
00:55:33.681 --> 00:55:37.160
<v Speaker 3>father says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've forgotten who you are.</v>

874
00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Wake the hell up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grow the hell up there or things to fix.</v>

875
00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:44.690
<v Speaker 3>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are things to fix.</v>

876
00:55:44.691 --> 00:55:48.500
<v Speaker 3>There's responsibilities to take on and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

877
00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:55.650
<v Speaker 3>simplest rather shocked by this </v>
<v Speaker 3>encounter and decides to leave his false</v>

878
00:55:56.381 --> 00:56:00.100
<v Speaker 3>adolescent paradise and to go back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the catastrophic.</v>

879
00:56:00.101 --> 00:56:00.934
<v Speaker 3>Lee demolished state and he takes his </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends and he sees this place that </v>

880
00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:10.020
<v Speaker 3>where there's nothing but starvation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>cruelty and malevolence and tyranny,</v>

881
00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.313
<v Speaker 3>and he fights a battle against evil and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he reclaims his kingdom and as soon as </v>

882
00:56:14.261 --> 00:56:15.094
<v Speaker 3>that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rain falls and the plants grow and </v>

883
00:56:18.221 --> 00:56:23.020
<v Speaker 3>harmony is restored and that's fascist </v>
<v Speaker 3>mysticism by the way,</v>

884
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:28.680
<v Speaker 3>so it seems to appeal to a very large </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of people given the popularity of</v>

885
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:31.480
<v Speaker 3>that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is that?</v>

886
00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:33.550
<v Speaker 3>What's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A responsibility.</v>

887
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.920
<v Speaker 3>It's a fundamental call to </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility,</v>

888
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:39.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that it is the case that we live in a</v>

889
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:41.343
<v Speaker 3>field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's defined by the extent of our </v>

890
00:56:42.551 --> 00:56:43.384
<v Speaker 3>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the case that we live in a </v>

891
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:47.980
<v Speaker 3>hierarchical structure on that plane.</v>

892
00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.010
<v Speaker 3>It is the case that there's a kingship </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the top.</v>

893
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:55.150
<v Speaker 3>It is the case that that's always </v>
<v Speaker 3>threatened by malevolence in sin.</v>

894
00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:59.950
<v Speaker 3>It is the case that that can make you </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt and cynical and irresponsible.</v>

895
00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:01.143
<v Speaker 3>It is the case that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate response and that it's </v>

896
00:57:04.601 --> 00:57:09.601
<v Speaker 3>your responsibility to repair the damage</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of tradition,</v>

897
00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:14.290
<v Speaker 3>despite the fact that it veers towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>corruption.</v>

898
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:18.370
<v Speaker 3>It is the case that if you take that </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility on yourself,</v>

899
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.640
<v Speaker 3>that the rain falls again and everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>flourishes.</v>

900
00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:23.283
<v Speaker 3>It's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the right way of looking at the </v>

901
00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:25.984
<v Speaker 3>world and if we didn't know that deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone in this room wouldn't have </v>

902
00:57:30.101 --> 00:57:32.530
<v Speaker 3>watched that movie and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

903
00:57:32.531 --> 00:57:36.670
<v Speaker 3>it's so strange that we can watch that </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie without understanding it.</v>

904
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:39.250
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can fall into it because you do.</v>

905
00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:41.200
<v Speaker 3>When you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might wonder,</v>

906
00:57:41.201 --> 00:57:43.810
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do people have religious experiences?</v>

907
00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Because people wonder about the truth of</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

908
00:57:46.961 --> 00:57:50.050
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not going to go very deeply into</v>

909
00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:50.884
<v Speaker 3>that issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can tell you that what you're </v>

910
00:57:51.731 --> 00:57:56.731
<v Speaker 3>doing when you go to a movie like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has that mythological structure and</v>

911
00:57:57.161 --> 00:58:00.220
<v Speaker 3>you fall into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what you do,</v>

912
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:01.323
<v Speaker 3>that what you're having is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable from a religious </v>

913
00:58:03.551 --> 00:58:04.384
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the revelation of knowledge that </v>

914
00:58:07.541 --> 00:58:08.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't know.</v>

915
00:58:08.771 --> 00:58:11.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's something about it that's so</v>

916
00:58:11.741 --> 00:58:12.574
<v Speaker 3>deeply engaging and meaningful that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>will line up and pay for the privilege </v>

917
00:58:17.201 --> 00:58:18.034
<v Speaker 3>of being exposed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is not an easy thing to </v>

918
00:58:20.321 --> 00:58:21.910
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you bring,</v>

919
00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:22.863
<v Speaker 3>your child will be very excited about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the possibility of going to the lion </v>

920
00:58:26.081 --> 00:58:27.370
<v Speaker 3>king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

921
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.150
<v Speaker 3>and maybe want to watch it 20 times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My son watched the,</v>

922
00:58:31.610 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 3>did the whale scene in Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bed.</v>

923
00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:38.440
<v Speaker 3>He watched that 115 times when he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>four or five years old.</v>

924
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:41.890
<v Speaker 3>He just watched it over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over.</v>

925
00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:43.420
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell are you doing,</v>

926
00:58:43.421 --> 00:58:44.500
<v Speaker 3>kid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

927
00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:46.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so interesting to watch that.</v>

928
00:58:46.601 --> 00:58:47.434
<v Speaker 3>He was so obsessed by it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a tremendous amount of </v>

929
00:58:49.781 --> 00:58:50.614
<v Speaker 3>information in that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an almost unlimited amount of </v>

930
00:58:53.141 --> 00:58:56.650
<v Speaker 3>information and he was gripped by it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>was trying.</v>

931
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:57.783
<v Speaker 3>However it is that a child's imagination</v>
<v Speaker 3>tries to come to terms with what the </v>

932
00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:05.170
<v Speaker 3>movie was representing and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like he enjoyed it.</v>

933
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not In the least.</v>

934
00:59:07.781 --> 00:59:08.830
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you.</v>

935
00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:09.411
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

936
00:59:09.411 --> 00:59:10.244
<v Speaker 3>if you watch the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many of you have seen the Movie </v>

937
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.180
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

938
00:59:13.181 --> 00:59:17.170
<v Speaker 3>So it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the 10 most highest grossing</v>

939
00:59:17.171 --> 00:59:18.430
<v Speaker 3>movies of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

940
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:21.710
<v Speaker 3>there's a scene where Pinocchio who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>turned in,</v>

941
00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:22.573
<v Speaker 3>he's a wooden puppet who's been turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a jackass and for some which is </v>

942
00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 3>supposed to make sense to you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently does,</v>

943
00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:29.043
<v Speaker 3>and he goes to the bottom of the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 3>to rescue his father who was somehow </v>

944
00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:33.980
<v Speaker 3>swallowed by a whale.</v>

945
00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:34.903
<v Speaker 3>So think about what you're watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're watching a drawing of a puppet </v>

946
00:59:38.271 --> 00:59:41.540
<v Speaker 3>turned into a Jack Ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the bottom of the ocean and rescue</v>

947
00:59:41.541 --> 00:59:46.070
<v Speaker 3>his father from a fire breathing whale </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're all perfectly okay with that.</v>

948
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:48.710
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's very peculiar.</v>

949
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:50.510
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's very frightening.</v>

950
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:51.403
<v Speaker 3>Like the whale is a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does breathe fire because it's </v>

951
00:59:54.771 --> 00:59:56.300
<v Speaker 3>actually a dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a whale.</v>

952
00:59:56.650 --> 00:59:58.670
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

953
00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:01.950
<v Speaker 3>the animators used locomotive noises to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

954
01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:02.943
<v Speaker 3>to add the audio background and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whale is hell bent on destroying the </v>

955
01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:09.920
<v Speaker 3>hero of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio and also Japan.</v>

956
01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:14.270
<v Speaker 3>And it's a very tense scene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so my son was just like this,</v>

957
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:16.520
<v Speaker 3>like the whole time watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't.</v>

958
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.620
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't think that he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

959
01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.513
<v Speaker 3>he's like these terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a rabbit who is being watched by a </v>

960
01:00:21.501 --> 01:00:26.060
<v Speaker 3>wolf and then it makes his heartbeat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>these all exhausted and it goes,</v>

961
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:28.370
<v Speaker 3>and then the first thing he wants to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>is to do it again.</v>

962
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the Hell's going?</v>

963
01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:30.541
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

964
01:00:30.541 --> 01:00:32.910
<v Speaker 3>What's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like it's a cake walk.</v>

965
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.973
<v Speaker 3>It's not that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he could hardly even stand to </v>

966
01:00:35.721 --> 01:00:37.220
<v Speaker 3>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so tense,</v>

967
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.640
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's bad enough when you're an</v>

968
01:00:40.641 --> 01:00:41.331
<v Speaker 3>adult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

969
01:00:41.331 --> 01:00:45.050
<v Speaker 3>and you've seen a thousand things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and at least in principle,</v>

970
01:00:45.051 --> 01:00:45.884
<v Speaker 3>your little tougher and a little wiser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you're for that just blows you </v>

971
01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:49.244
<v Speaker 3>away like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everything in the world does and </v>

972
01:00:51.051 --> 01:00:51.884
<v Speaker 3>yet all he would do is expose himself to</v>
<v Speaker 3>it over and over and over and over and </v>

973
01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:55.910
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the lion king,</v>

974
01:00:55.911 --> 01:00:58.160
<v Speaker 3>like if you watch children when they go </v>
<v Speaker 3>see that,</v>

975
01:00:58.161 --> 01:01:00.140
<v Speaker 3>they're just demolished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Simba,</v>

976
01:01:00.141 --> 01:01:01.760
<v Speaker 3>his father dies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

977
01:01:01.761 --> 01:01:02.594
<v Speaker 3>Just tears them apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't believe that you know the </v>

978
01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:10.001
<v Speaker 3>king has disappeared and yet they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch it over and over and over and over</v>

979
01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.890
<v Speaker 3>just like you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's because,</v>

980
01:01:12.891 --> 01:01:13.724
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole story we used to tell our son </v>

981
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.333
<v Speaker 3>when we took them to movies because he'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>get all shorted out by what was </v>

982
01:01:18.891 --> 01:01:23.150
<v Speaker 3>happening and unsurprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch the hero.</v>

983
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:24.733
<v Speaker 3>Keep your eye on the hero because that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pathway through and that's exactly </v>

984
01:01:28.881 --> 01:01:33.290
<v Speaker 3>right because you're supposed to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>your eye on the hero because that is the</v>

985
01:01:33.291 --> 01:01:37.730
<v Speaker 3>pathway through and there isn't anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's more true than that.</v>

986
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:41.120
<v Speaker 3>That's a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

987
01:01:41.121 --> 01:01:42.170
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fictional.</v>

988
01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:47.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like fiction presents abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abstractions aren't falsehoods.</v>

989
01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:51.740
<v Speaker 3>They're abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about numbers.</v>

990
01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:53.533
<v Speaker 3>Numbers are abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're abstracted away from individual </v>

991
01:01:57.021 --> 01:01:59.540
<v Speaker 3>entities in the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you know the numbers,</v>

992
01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.540
<v Speaker 3>you know abstractions of tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

993
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:04.543
<v Speaker 3>While the abstraction of the idea of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual hero from the collective of </v>

994
01:02:08.271 --> 01:02:12.890
<v Speaker 3>human action is the abstraction of it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>more true than true.</v>

995
01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:17.270
<v Speaker 3>Deep fiction is more true than truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a way of thinking about it.</v>

996
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:18.223
<v Speaker 3>It's more real than reality itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the same way that an abstraction can </v>

997
01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:27.120
<v Speaker 3>be more real than the thing that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstracted from all of the,</v>

998
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:29.783
<v Speaker 3>all of the landscape in a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 3>tale like the lion king is an abstract </v>

999
01:02:34.621 --> 01:02:35.454
<v Speaker 3>landscape.</v>

1000
01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:39.780
<v Speaker 3>What's common across all landscapes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1001
01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.990
<v Speaker 3>wherever you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are things that you know and there</v>

1002
01:02:42.991 --> 01:02:43.824
<v Speaker 3>are things that you don't know and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the human world and it doesn't </v>

1003
01:02:47.161 --> 01:02:51.990
<v Speaker 3>matter who the human being is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might know more than you do,</v>

1004
01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:53.123
<v Speaker 3>but doesn't matter because your </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge is still bounded by your </v>

1005
01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.513
<v Speaker 3>limitless ignorance and the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that domain of limitless ignorance </v>

1006
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:03.870
<v Speaker 3>will make mockery of what you know at </v>
<v Speaker 3>any moment.</v>

1007
01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:05.103
<v Speaker 3>It's a reality and it's a universal </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality and you have to orient yourself </v>

1008
01:03:10.291 --> 01:03:14.970
<v Speaker 3>in that landscape</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so does everyone else.</v>

1009
01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:16.283
<v Speaker 3>You have to deal with what you knew and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you don't know everywhere and the </v>

1010
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:19.764
<v Speaker 3>way you do that is by straddling the </v>
<v Speaker 3>divide between what you know and what </v>

1011
01:03:22.471 --> 01:03:23.304
<v Speaker 3>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do that by staying firmly grounded </v>

1012
01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:27.863
<v Speaker 3>to some degree in what you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by putting a tentative foot outward </v>

1013
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:34.650
<v Speaker 3>into what you don't understand so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can remain stable,</v>

1014
01:03:34.651 --> 01:03:38.700
<v Speaker 3>but you can stretch yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge yourself simultaneously.</v>

1015
01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the proper place to stand and</v>

1016
01:03:41.131 --> 01:03:41.964
<v Speaker 3>that's actually a real place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the line between chaos and order </v>

1017
01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:47.580
<v Speaker 3>and that's the place of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rule six,</v>

1018
01:03:47.581 --> 01:03:48.840
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real seventies,</v>

1019
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:49.913
<v Speaker 3>do what is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not what is expedient and when you do </v>

1020
01:03:52.501 --> 01:03:53.334
<v Speaker 3>what is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stay in the kingdom that you've </v>

1021
01:03:56.401 --> 01:03:57.234
<v Speaker 3>established,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't stay completely in it </v>

1022
01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:00.773
<v Speaker 3>because you need to challenge yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>and grow and so you put one foot </v>

1023
01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:06.683
<v Speaker 3>tentatively out into the domain that </v>
<v Speaker 3>supersedes your competence and you </v>

1024
01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:14.790
<v Speaker 3>maintain stability and grow at the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1025
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.013
<v Speaker 3>and when you're doing that properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the psychological consequences of </v>

1026
01:04:22.021 --> 01:04:26.280
<v Speaker 3>that is the immersement in a meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

1027
01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:30.060
<v Speaker 3>It said deep instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you know,</v>

1028
01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.470
<v Speaker 3>if you watch yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

1029
01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:33.330
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a particularly good day at work,</v>

1030
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:35.820
<v Speaker 3>and what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1031
01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.300
<v Speaker 3>it means that you lost your sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1032
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:40.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1033
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Because when you're having not a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>day at work,</v>

1034
01:04:42.121 --> 01:04:45.990
<v Speaker 3>it's like first it's one minute to three</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it's</v>

1035
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:50.790
<v Speaker 3>45 seconds to three and then it's 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds.</v>

1036
01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what school was like for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like</v>

1037
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.840
<v Speaker 3>click.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So funny.</v>

1038
01:04:57.841 --> 01:04:59.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to,</v>

1039
01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I went to my daughter's school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to get in trouble for talking all</v>

1040
01:05:03.661 --> 01:05:04.680
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>surprise,</v>

1041
01:05:04.681 --> 01:05:09.681
<v Speaker 3>surprise when I was a kid and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was bored stiff in school and,</v>

1042
01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:11.843
<v Speaker 3>and so I would misbehave upon occasion </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of pure boredom and vote 21 years </v>

1043
01:05:19.271 --> 01:05:24.271
<v Speaker 3>ago I went to my daughter's school to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sit for a class.</v>

1044
01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:25.594
<v Speaker 3>It was about an hour long and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting there and the teacher had all </v>

1045
01:05:30.011 --> 01:05:34.420
<v Speaker 3>the kids on the floor and was having </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the kids read to the others.</v>

1046
01:05:34.421 --> 01:05:38.260
<v Speaker 3>And some of the kids who were reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't read at all.</v>

1047
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Speaker 3>And I had exactly the same experience.</v>

1048
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.840
<v Speaker 3>I was sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like being like being seven years</v>

1049
01:05:43.841 --> 01:05:44.201
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ugly.</v>

1050
01:05:44.201 --> 01:05:47.650
<v Speaker 3>And I could see the clock going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tick,</v>

1051
01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:50.230
<v Speaker 3>tick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

1052
01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:51.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was in this classroom for three </v>

1053
01:05:51.911 --> 01:05:53.320
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would misbehave,</v>

1054
01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:54.653
<v Speaker 3>fit 40 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would miss behave exactly like ty did </v>

1055
01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:01.900
<v Speaker 3>when I was when I was six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1056
01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's no place to be right,</v>

1057
01:06:03.911 --> 01:06:04.744
<v Speaker 3>because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be in a place that </v>

1058
01:06:06.351 --> 01:06:08.800
<v Speaker 3>stultifying you don't want to be in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>place where there's no challenge.</v>

1059
01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:10.900
<v Speaker 3>You might even quit your job if there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>no challenge.</v>

1060
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.400
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's a good job.</v>

1061
01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:14.020
<v Speaker 3>It gives you security and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1062
01:06:14.021 --> 01:06:16.150
<v Speaker 3>I can't stand this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's eating away at my soul.</v>

1063
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:19.780
<v Speaker 3>It's all security and no challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why do you want to challenge?</v>

1064
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:21.063
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what you're built for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're built for your built </v>

1065
01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:26.890
<v Speaker 3>to take on a maximal load,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1066
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:27.723
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what strengthens you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to be strong because life is </v>

1067
01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:30.874
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily difficult and because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the evil king is always whittling away </v>

1068
01:06:34.271 --> 01:06:35.104
<v Speaker 3>at the structure of the state and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be awake and sharp to stop that </v>

1069
01:06:37.811 --> 01:06:38.644
<v Speaker 3>from happening so that you don't become </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupt and so that your family doesn't </v>

1070
01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:45.820
<v Speaker 3>become corrupt and so that your state </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have to be come become corrupt.</v>

1071
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.833
<v Speaker 3>You have to have your eyes open and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>which sharp and your words at the ready </v>

1072
01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.493
<v Speaker 3>and you have to be educated and you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know about your history and you know </v>

1073
01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:56.320
<v Speaker 3>have to know how to think and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to know how to read and you have to know</v>

1074
01:06:56.321 --> 01:06:57.154
<v Speaker 3>how to speak and you have to know how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>aim and you have to be willing to hoist </v>

1075
01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.680
<v Speaker 3>the troubles of the world upon your </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulders.</v>

1076
01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.890
<v Speaker 3>And what's so interesting about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So remarkable.</v>

1077
01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:06.813
<v Speaker 3>And this is something that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifested itself to me as I've been </v>

1078
01:07:09.731 --> 01:07:10.564
<v Speaker 3>doing these public lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been talking about responsibility </v>

1079
01:07:12.581 --> 01:07:13.414
<v Speaker 3>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't seem to happen very often </v>

1080
01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.650
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the audiences are dead quiet.</v>

1081
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:22.390
<v Speaker 3>And I lay out this idea that life is </v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedy tainted by malevolence,</v>

1082
01:07:22.391 --> 01:07:23.590
<v Speaker 3>and everyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1083
01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:27.520
<v Speaker 3>well we already always suspected that no</v>
<v Speaker 3>one has ever said it quite so bluntly,</v>

1084
01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.473
<v Speaker 3>and it's quite a relief to hear that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the only person who has those </v>

1085
01:07:31.691 --> 01:07:32.524
<v Speaker 3>suspicions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the second part of that is the </v>

1086
01:07:34.721 --> 01:07:36.700
<v Speaker 3>better part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the optimistic part,</v>

1087
01:07:36.701 --> 01:07:37.534
<v Speaker 3>which is despite the fact that life is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedy tainted by malevolence at every </v>

1088
01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:46.720
<v Speaker 3>level of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something about the human spirit</v>

1089
01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:51.721
<v Speaker 3>that can thrive under precisely those </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions if we allow that to occur.</v>

1090
01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:56.680
<v Speaker 3>Because as difficult as life is and as </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible as we are,</v>

1091
01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:57.843
<v Speaker 3>our capacity to deal with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe and to transcend that </v>

1092
01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:06.520
<v Speaker 3>malevolent spirit is more powerful than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the than that reality itself.</v>

1093
01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:07.623
<v Speaker 3>And that's the fundamental issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the fundamental issue of </v>

1094
01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:14.980
<v Speaker 3>the Judaeo Christian ethic with its </v>
<v Speaker 3>emphasis on the divinity,</v>

1095
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:20.080
<v Speaker 3>the individual as catastrophic as life </v>
<v Speaker 3>is and is malevolent as people can be,</v>

1096
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:25.310
<v Speaker 3>and that's malevolent beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally,</v>

1097
01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:31.520
<v Speaker 3>the a person has in spirit that nobility</v>
<v Speaker 3>to set that right and to defeat evil and</v>

1098
01:08:33.501 --> 01:08:34.334
<v Speaker 3>that and that more than that and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the antidote to the catastrophe of life </v>

1099
01:08:38.571 --> 01:08:39.404
<v Speaker 3>and the suffering of life and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedy of life that can drive you down </v>

1100
01:08:42.411 --> 01:08:43.244
<v Speaker 3>and destroy you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to take on exactly that </v>

1101
01:08:45.201 --> 01:08:47.780
<v Speaker 3>responsibility and to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1102
01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.673
<v Speaker 3>there's plenty of work to be done and </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that terrible and there isn't </v>

1103
01:08:51.921 --> 01:08:52.754
<v Speaker 3>anything so bad that we can't make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse and certainly try very hard to do </v>

1104
01:08:57.141 --> 01:08:57.974
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have it within me to decide that </v>

1105
01:09:00.711 --> 01:09:01.544
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to stand up against that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to strive to make the world a </v>

1106
01:09:03.921 --> 01:09:04.730
<v Speaker 3>better place.</v>

1107
01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:05.563
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to strive to constrain the </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence that's in my own heart and </v>

1108
01:09:08.571 --> 01:09:13.571
<v Speaker 3>to set my family's straight and to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>to work despite my tragic loss,</v>

1109
01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:17.570
<v Speaker 3>for the betterment of anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of everything that's in front of me.</v>

1110
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.553
<v Speaker 3>And the consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The immediate consequence of that is </v>

1111
01:09:21.681 --> 01:09:26.270
<v Speaker 3>that when you make the decision to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>on all of that voluntarily,</v>

1112
01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.640
<v Speaker 3>which is to stand up straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1113
01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.950
<v Speaker 3>with your shoulders back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take on that,</v>

1114
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.730
<v Speaker 3>all that on voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you make that decision,</v>

1115
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:35.833
<v Speaker 3>then all the catastrophe justifies </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself in the nobility of your striving </v>

1116
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:43.940
<v Speaker 3>and that's what it means to be an </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

1117
01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

1118
01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.070
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one is good.</v>

1119
01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:10.100
<v Speaker 1>The first one here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your take on universal income?</v>

1120
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:13.223
<v Speaker 1>Is it a fast track to new communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism killer or a possible way out </v>

1121
01:10:18.601 --> 01:10:21.630
<v Speaker 1>of starvation for humanity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1122
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:23.683
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it addresses the </v>

1123
01:10:24.811 --> 01:10:28.300
<v Speaker 1>fundamental problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>

1124
01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a mirror of the rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility problem.</v>

1125
01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

1126
01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:37.953
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has a right to the basics of </v>

1127
01:10:38.951 --> 01:10:41.290
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1128
01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:42.124
<v Speaker 1>that's a debatable proposition because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is who's going to provide </v>

1129
01:10:46.781 --> 01:10:47.614
<v Speaker 1>those necessities and the answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be someone else under </v>

1130
01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:52.480
<v Speaker 1>compulsion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1131
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.333
<v Speaker 1>because each rate comes at the expense </v>
<v Speaker 1>of someone else's responsibility and so </v>

1132
01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:00.620
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to multiply rights beyond</v>

1133
01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:06.900
<v Speaker 1>minimum necessity because you also </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiply diverse responsibilities beyond</v>

1134
01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.870
<v Speaker 1>tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly than that,</v>

1135
01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I would say is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's make it more concrete.</v>

1136
01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:20.220
<v Speaker 1>So let's imagine that as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological revolution progresses,</v>

1137
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.373
<v Speaker 1>more and more people will be in danger </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being replaced by intelligent </v>

1138
01:11:25.321 --> 01:11:27.540
<v Speaker 1>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't know if that's true because</v>

1139
01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:29.610
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't happened yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1140
01:11:29.611 --> 01:11:33.150
<v Speaker 1>And everyone has been predicting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was going to happen since like 1960</v>

1141
01:11:33.151 --> 01:11:33.984
<v Speaker 1>and it hasn't happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there may be an infinite amount </v>

1142
01:11:36.391 --> 01:11:38.160
<v Speaker 1>of work and we're never going to run out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of work.</v>

1143
01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:38.994
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that's probably the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's assume that people do get </v>

1144
01:11:41.971 --> 01:11:44.940
<v Speaker 1>dispossessed as technology's </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed,</v>

1145
01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.013
<v Speaker 1>and then we have the problem of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of people for who have no </v>

1146
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:54.390
<v Speaker 1>viable means of making a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question might be,</v>

1147
01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the fundamental problem there?</v>

1148
01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.830
<v Speaker 1>And one answer is while they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any money,</v>

1149
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:02.220
<v Speaker 1>but I actually don't think that that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental problem.</v>

1150
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:04.103
<v Speaker 1>I've had many people in my clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice who were unemployed and had </v>

1151
01:12:08.011 --> 01:12:09.870
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they didn't have a lot of money,</v>

1152
01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:14.760
<v Speaker 1>but they had enough money and enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to keep privation at bay,</v>

1153
01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:16.590
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and enough money to.</v>

1154
01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:17.873
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the rub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough money to get themselves into </v>

1155
01:12:19.861 --> 01:12:23.640
<v Speaker 1>plenty of trouble</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so one of my clients,</v>

1156
01:12:23.641 --> 01:12:24.690
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a.</v>

1157
01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I liked him quite a lot and he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

1158
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:28.343
<v Speaker 1>he had worked in a hospital and he'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>been hurt and and then he got onto </v>

1159
01:12:33.421 --> 01:12:34.254
<v Speaker 1>painkillers because he'd been hurt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he got addicted to painkillers and </v>

1160
01:12:36.901 --> 01:12:37.734
<v Speaker 1>then he got addicted to cocaine and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life took a bad nosedive and he is </v>

1161
01:12:43.501 --> 01:12:45.150
<v Speaker 1>actually pretty good unless he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1162
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.820
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as he had a check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1163
01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.590
<v Speaker 1>he was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in a ditch,</v>

1164
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.000
<v Speaker 1>he was in a bar.</v>

1165
01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:52.463
<v Speaker 1>He spent all his money and he was face </v>
<v Speaker 1>down in the ditch and that's where he </v>

1166
01:12:55.111 --> 01:12:55.944
<v Speaker 1>woke up the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm telling you that </v>

1167
01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:01.410
<v Speaker 1>story is because it wasn't that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have money.</v>

1168
01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:03.030
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1169
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:05.370
<v Speaker 1>The problem was that he didn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

1170
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.353
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have a place anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got thrown out of the structure that </v>

1171
01:13:09.721 --> 01:13:13.560
<v Speaker 1>would have enabled him to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive meaning,</v>

1172
01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:14.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you might've said,</v>

1173
01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:16.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he should have been able to conjure that</v>

1174
01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:18.090
<v Speaker 1>up on his own and perhaps that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

1175
01:13:18.091 --> 01:13:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Although he wasn't the world's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated person,</v>

1176
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:22.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people very substantially in their </v>

1177
01:13:23.701 --> 01:13:26.700
<v Speaker 1>sophistication and it and he didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good family,</v>

1178
01:13:26.701 --> 01:13:28.290
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have a support network around </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1179
01:13:28.291 --> 01:13:29.124
<v Speaker 1>He was kind of a last character in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways and so it was easy for him to </v>

1180
01:13:32.371 --> 01:13:33.204
<v Speaker 1>fall out of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what he did and providing him </v>

1181
01:13:36.151 --> 01:13:41.151
<v Speaker 1>with money was not going to fix that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>says what is going to fix that?</v>

1182
01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

1183
01:13:44.251 --> 01:13:45.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1184
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:46.123
<v Speaker 1>we have a program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you people might be interested </v>

1185
01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:50.670
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called.</v>

1186
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.863
<v Speaker 1>It's part of a suite of online writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs called the self authoring </v>

1187
01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:59.520
<v Speaker 1>suite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's outsell faltering Dotcom and one of</v>

1188
01:13:59.521 --> 01:14:04.521
<v Speaker 1>the programs is called future authoring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've experimented with this program</v>

1189
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:08.130
<v Speaker 1>in an attempt to address this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1190
01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:11.920
<v Speaker 1>So I mentioned to you tonight idea that</v>

1191
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>we live out a story and we need a </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose to live out that story properly,</v>

1192
01:14:17.171 --> 01:14:19.750
<v Speaker 1>and what that implies is that you need a</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

1193
01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.640
<v Speaker 1>You need a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a name,</v>

1194
01:14:22.290 --> 01:14:25.930
<v Speaker 1>you need to precise same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need an aim that's of sufficient</v>

1195
01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:30.470
<v Speaker 1>nobility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of any other word,</v>

1196
01:14:30.650 --> 01:14:35.650
<v Speaker 1>sufficient nobility to justify your </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable existence even to yourself and</v>

1197
01:14:36.051 --> 01:14:39.920
<v Speaker 1>you need to develop that aim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we built this program.</v>

1198
01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.113
<v Speaker 1>I started working on it about 15 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago when I was giving my students </v>

1199
01:14:44.121 --> 01:14:44.954
<v Speaker 1>exercises to do university and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the exercises I had them do was that </v>

1200
01:14:49.461 --> 01:14:50.294
<v Speaker 1>they had to pick a small problem maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their family or their room and fix </v>

1201
01:14:54.591 --> 01:14:56.240
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not try to fix it,</v>

1202
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:59.930
<v Speaker 1>but actually pick a problem that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>small that they could fix,</v>

1203
01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:02.150
<v Speaker 1>clean up the cigarette butts in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>yard,</v>

1204
01:15:02.151 --> 01:15:05.330
<v Speaker 1>outside the residence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean the room.</v>

1205
01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:08.720
<v Speaker 1>We had one kid whose mother had died in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the family,</v>

1206
01:15:08.721 --> 01:15:09.554
<v Speaker 1>got kind of fragmented and he decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was going to take over the </v>

1207
01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:12.374
<v Speaker 1>maternal duties in the household and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids were supposed to write about what </v>

1208
01:15:14.841 --> 01:15:15.674
<v Speaker 1>happened when they tried to put this </v>
<v Speaker 1>into practice because doing things like </v>

1209
01:15:17.631 --> 01:15:20.060
<v Speaker 1>that is way more difficult than anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever realized this.</v>

1210
01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:24.260
<v Speaker 1>And so he tried to become mother and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>family needed a mother and he,</v>

1211
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:27.050
<v Speaker 1>he encountered all sorts of terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance,</v>

1212
01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.540
<v Speaker 1>which is completely unsurprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1213
01:15:29.541 --> 01:15:30.374
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in his family were annoyed that </v>

1214
01:15:31.461 --> 01:15:34.100
<v Speaker 1>he would dare to try to take their dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother's place,</v>

1215
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he was trying to do it for </v>

1216
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.943
<v Speaker 1>the best of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we played with that for a couple of </v>

1217
01:15:39.771 --> 01:15:40.604
<v Speaker 1>years and that was very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized that I was teaching </v>

1218
01:15:44.001 --> 01:15:46.070
<v Speaker 1>students all these stories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>

1219
01:15:46.071 --> 01:15:51.071
<v Speaker 1>but nobody had ever had them write a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story about their purpose essentially.</v>

1220
01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.970
<v Speaker 1>So I thought was not interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are these,</v>

1221
01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:56.870
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids,</v>

1222
01:15:56.871 --> 01:16:00.110
<v Speaker 1>they've been in university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been in school for 15 years</v>

1223
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:04.400
<v Speaker 1>and no one has ever sat them down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1224
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:05.833
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of character do you want to </v>

1225
01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.353
<v Speaker 1>develop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who should you be and why don't you </v>

1226
01:16:10.301 --> 01:16:12.770
<v Speaker 1>write that out and justify it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1227
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:15.230
<v Speaker 1>six pages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that with the same amount</v>

1228
01:16:15.231 --> 01:16:17.510
<v Speaker 1>of care and attention that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend,</v>

1229
01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:20.270
<v Speaker 1>or even more on an essay about the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 18,</v>

1230
01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:22.340
<v Speaker 1>12 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think,</v>

1231
01:16:22.341 --> 01:16:24.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the more I thought about that,</v>

1232
01:16:24.201 --> 01:16:25.034
<v Speaker 1>the more</v>

1233
01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:28.980
<v Speaker 1>flabbergasted I would say I became </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I thought,</v>

1234
01:16:28.981 --> 01:16:29.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that,</v>

1235
01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:30.353
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it possible that we could set up </v>

1236
01:16:32.971 --> 01:16:33.804
<v Speaker 1>our education system and run people </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it for 15 years and never have </v>

1237
01:16:37.831 --> 01:16:38.664
<v Speaker 1>them forced so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out who they wanted to be in </v>

1238
01:16:42.761 --> 01:16:43.594
<v Speaker 1>to justify it in an articulate manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I built this program with my </v>

1239
01:16:46.831 --> 01:16:47.664
<v Speaker 1>colleagues to help people do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used my classes first and so I </v>

1240
01:16:50.191 --> 01:16:50.611
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1241
01:16:50.611 --> 01:16:51.444
<v Speaker 1>well here's the game and this is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule to treat yourself like you're </v>

1242
01:16:54.841 --> 01:16:55.674
<v Speaker 1>someone responsible for helping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean be good to </v>

1243
01:16:58.561 --> 01:17:01.140
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean me be nice to yourself.</v>

1244
01:17:01.141 --> 01:17:01.974
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean give yourself an easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>life that isn't actually what you do to </v>

1245
01:17:05.611 --> 01:17:06.840
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you care for them,</v>

1246
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:09.890
<v Speaker 1>you actually present them with something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an challenge.</v>

1247
01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:10.910
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do with kids.</v>

1248
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:11.743
<v Speaker 1>If you love them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you present them with an optimal </v>

1249
01:17:13.011 --> 01:17:13.844
<v Speaker 1>challenge so they can develop and grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you should do for </v>

1250
01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:18.110
<v Speaker 1>yourself if you're taking care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1251
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:19.400
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1252
01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:22.370
<v Speaker 1>well here's the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1253
01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.233
<v Speaker 1>assume that you're worth taking a care </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are worth taking care of and </v>

1254
01:17:25.911 --> 01:17:26.744
<v Speaker 1>that it's your responsibility to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't like yourself very </v>

1255
01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:29.894
<v Speaker 1>much and lots of people don't and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have their reasons because everybody is </v>

1256
01:17:32.841 --> 01:17:34.610
<v Speaker 1>very aware of their own flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1257
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more aware of your own flaws than</v>

1258
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:39.403
<v Speaker 1>have anyone else's flaws and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not very happy with yourself and </v>

1259
01:17:41.451 --> 01:17:42.284
<v Speaker 1>you don't think that you deserve to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an okay life and so you punish yourself </v>

1260
01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:48.080
<v Speaker 1>and you set yourself up for failure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all and all of that.</v>

1261
01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Now it happens all the time or you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't aim or you don't have any goals or</v>

1262
01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you know you're guilty and resentful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel that you should be punished,</v>

1263
01:17:56.211 --> 01:17:57.950
<v Speaker 1>so you have to abandon all that.</v>

1264
01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Treat yourself like you're someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for helping,</v>

1265
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:03.463
<v Speaker 1>responsible for helping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine yourself three to five years </v>

1266
01:18:06.741 --> 01:18:09.110
<v Speaker 1>into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to have what you need.</v>

1267
01:18:10.730 --> 01:18:12.650
<v Speaker 1>If you're taking care of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have it,</v>

1268
01:18:13.190 --> 01:18:14.023
<v Speaker 1>but you have to figure out what it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are not going to get it </v>

1269
01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:20.780
<v Speaker 1>unless you aim at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's rule 10 is be precise in your</v>

1270
01:18:20.781 --> 01:18:21.614
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I wrote that rule is is </v>

1271
01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:24.824
<v Speaker 1>because you can be bloody sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to hit a target unless </v>

1272
01:18:26.841 --> 01:18:27.674
<v Speaker 1>you a matte it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the more precise you make the </v>

1273
01:18:28.581 --> 01:18:29.414
<v Speaker 1>target,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the higher the probability that you'll </v>

1274
01:18:30.531 --> 01:18:32.630
<v Speaker 1>aim at nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll hit it when you aim at it.</v>

1275
01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.720
<v Speaker 1>So what do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

1276
01:18:35.721 --> 01:18:36.554
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to even think about what I </v>

1277
01:18:37.611 --> 01:18:39.680
<v Speaker 1>want because as soon as I figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I want,</v>

1278
01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:40.514
<v Speaker 1>then I've made clear Mike conditions for</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure and it's the last thing I'm </v>

1279
01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:45.320
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>

1280
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.153
<v Speaker 1>And so people envelop themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>vague this so they don't have to </v>

1281
01:18:49.281 --> 01:18:52.640
<v Speaker 1>confront their own failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they fail and just don't notice</v>

1282
01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.133
<v Speaker 1>except for maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two decades later when it's too bloody </v>

1283
01:18:56.691 --> 01:18:57.524
<v Speaker 1>late and then they're all catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hurt because they wasted their </v>

1284
01:19:01.281 --> 01:19:03.080
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very bad plan.</v>

1285
01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.513
<v Speaker 1>It's better just to figure out what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want and to tell yourself and then to </v>

1286
01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:07.933
<v Speaker 1>tell your partner and to tell the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you and maybe you can get it or </v>

1287
01:19:11.091 --> 01:19:13.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe at least while you're struggling </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards it,</v>

1288
01:19:13.221 --> 01:19:16.520
<v Speaker 1>you'll come up with a better plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more likely the case.</v>

1289
01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.510
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could have what you,</v>

1290
01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.553
<v Speaker 1>what was good for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from your intimate </v>

1291
01:19:23.271 --> 01:19:26.450
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to educate yourself?</v>

1292
01:19:26.451 --> 01:19:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't know enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for a career or job?</v>

1293
01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:31.693
<v Speaker 1>Because not everyone has a career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to spend your time </v>

1294
01:19:33.381 --> 01:19:35.660
<v Speaker 1>outside of work in a productive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful manner?</v>

1295
01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:36.613
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to resist the </v>
<v Speaker 1>temptations of drugs and alcohol and </v>

1296
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:41.960
<v Speaker 1>sexual misconduct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1297
01:19:41.961 --> 01:19:43.250
<v Speaker 1>because those are the big three.</v>

1298
01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:48.590
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to maintain yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically and mentally?</v>

1299
01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:53.630
<v Speaker 1>While those are seven good questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have what you want.</v>

1300
01:19:55.710 --> 01:19:56.543
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an operational realization of the </v>

1301
01:19:59.910 --> 01:20:00.743
<v Speaker 1>new testament principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ask and you will receive knock and the </v>

1302
01:20:04.651 --> 01:20:06.870
<v Speaker 1>door will open and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1303
01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:09.150
<v Speaker 1>there's no possibility that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

1304
01:20:09.151 --> 01:20:12.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like actually it is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't specify what you want,</v>

1305
01:20:12.781 --> 01:20:16.140
<v Speaker 1>you won't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you specify what you want and you</v>

1306
01:20:16.141 --> 01:20:16.974
<v Speaker 1>want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you're willing to make the </v>

1307
01:20:18.451 --> 01:20:19.284
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices necessary to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the probability that you'll get it </v>

1308
01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.340
<v Speaker 1>expands immensely and miraculously in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

1309
01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:27.181
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1310
01:20:27.181 --> 01:20:32.100
<v Speaker 1>it assumes that what you want is within </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bounds of appropriate reason,</v>

1311
01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:35.190
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could also dream big and there's</v>

1312
01:20:35.191 --> 01:20:37.170
<v Speaker 1>always the possibility that'll work out </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

1313
01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:42.720
<v Speaker 1>so people as answer those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they write for 15 minutes,</v>

1314
01:20:42.721 --> 01:20:43.554
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life is the way you want it to be </v>

1315
01:20:44.551 --> 01:20:47.580
<v Speaker 1>in four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it look like?</v>

1316
01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As much as you can,</v>

1317
01:20:50.341 --> 01:20:53.490
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about being too accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about grammar or spelling.</v>

1318
01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about getting it right </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not going to get it right</v>

1319
01:20:55.771 --> 01:20:58.050
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sketch the damn thing out.</v>

1320
01:20:58.350 --> 01:21:00.300
<v Speaker 1>If you could have what you wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it be,</v>

1321
01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:02.280
<v Speaker 1>and then we have them do the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1322
01:21:02.281 --> 01:21:04.860
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take stock of yourself for a minute with</v>

1323
01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:05.694
<v Speaker 1>all your weaknesses and inadequacies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitterness and resentments and sinful </v>

1324
01:21:09.541 --> 01:21:10.950
<v Speaker 1>tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>

1325
01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:11.993
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you let all of that goal </v>

1326
01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:19.700
<v Speaker 1>and occupy you just wear which little </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner of Hell would you occupy in three</v>

1327
01:21:20.251 --> 01:21:21.084
<v Speaker 1>to five years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you write about that and </v>

1328
01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:23.844
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows where they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they let themselves and so then you </v>

1329
01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:27.924
<v Speaker 1>have something to avoid and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to strive for and that makes </v>

1330
01:21:32.641 --> 01:21:36.690
<v Speaker 1>you optimally motivated because maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid,</v>

1331
01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:38.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out you don't like your job and</v>

1332
01:21:38.371 --> 01:21:41.010
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid to change your job and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>

1333
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:42.091
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1334
01:21:42.091 --> 01:21:42.924
<v Speaker 1>if I don't change my job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm heading for this little corner </v>

1335
01:21:44.821 --> 01:21:46.170
<v Speaker 1>of Hell that I outlined.</v>

1336
01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:46.771
<v Speaker 1>Think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1337
01:21:46.771 --> 01:21:47.604
<v Speaker 1>that's not a very good plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very threatening and stressful to </v>

1338
01:21:50.521 --> 01:21:51.354
<v Speaker 1>change my job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it beats the hell out of ending up </v>

1339
01:21:52.831 --> 01:21:53.664
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have your anxieties </v>

1340
01:21:55.021 --> 01:21:57.630
<v Speaker 1>behind you pushing your forward instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of in front of you,</v>

1341
01:21:57.631 --> 01:22:00.990
<v Speaker 1>stopping you cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we asked people to write a plan</v>

1342
01:22:01.170 --> 01:22:05.700
<v Speaker 1>to implement their paws division,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to justify it,</v>

1343
01:22:05.701 --> 01:22:06.534
<v Speaker 1>to come up with a strategy for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for making it into a real world </v>

1344
01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:10.794
<v Speaker 1>realization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we tested that on thousands of </v>

1345
01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:14.093
<v Speaker 1>university students now and the upshot </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that it decreased the probability </v>

1346
01:22:18.181 --> 01:22:20.490
<v Speaker 1>that they would drop out of university </v>
<v Speaker 1>by 30 percent.</v>

1347
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:21.743
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Canada we did it for 90 minutes </v>

1348
01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:29.330
<v Speaker 1>before kids went to college in the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came to their summer orientation,</v>

1349
01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:33.990
<v Speaker 1>neither road for 90 minutes about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that required writing,</v>

1350
01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:34.824
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't so relevant or they wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a plan and it dropped the dropout </v>

1351
01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:39.834
<v Speaker 1>rate among young men 50 percent in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first semester and it had the biggest </v>

1352
01:22:43.501 --> 01:22:44.334
<v Speaker 1>effect on young men who didn't do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>well in high school and who weren't </v>

1353
01:22:46.651 --> 01:22:47.484
<v Speaker 1>oriented towards a professional career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consequence of that was that the </v>

1354
01:22:50.671 --> 01:22:53.310
<v Speaker 1>university used it for one year and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop doing it.</v>

1355
01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:55.860
<v Speaker 1>So which was not surprising in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>least,</v>

1356
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:57.143
<v Speaker 1>but the reason that I'm laying out this </v>
<v Speaker 1>long story for you is because that's </v>

1357
01:23:01.681 --> 01:23:03.330
<v Speaker 1>what people need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need.</v>

1358
01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:06.790
<v Speaker 1>They need a differentiated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>delineated purpose.</v>

1359
01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:09.070
<v Speaker 1>It's way more important than the money.</v>

1360
01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:13.650
<v Speaker 1>It isn't money that you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you need money for God's sake.</v>

1361
01:23:13.651 --> 01:23:15.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm not ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody needs money.</v>

1362
01:23:15.421 --> 01:23:16.254
<v Speaker 1>That's not the point here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the provision of money without </v>

1363
01:23:19.171 --> 01:23:20.004
<v Speaker 1>purpose is not helpful and what people </v>
<v Speaker 1>need is a purpose and they need that to </v>

1364
01:23:24.271 --> 01:23:25.104
<v Speaker 1>develop that for themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously because it's something you </v>

1365
01:23:26.761 --> 01:23:27.594
<v Speaker 1>have to participate in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that society has to </v>

1366
01:23:29.101 --> 01:23:33.270
<v Speaker 1>foster and the reason they need that </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes because that's what gives their</v>

1367
01:23:33.271 --> 01:23:35.310
<v Speaker 1>life meaning think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1368
01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:36.144
<v Speaker 1>think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really think that you would be </v>

1369
01:23:38.641 --> 01:23:41.220
<v Speaker 1>satisfied if you had money without </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility?</v>

1370
01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:43.261
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1371
01:23:43.261 --> 01:23:46.290
<v Speaker 1>got no responsibility because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what everyone wants.</v>

1372
01:23:46.291 --> 01:23:47.124
<v Speaker 1>It's like I had a client,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to retire when he was kind of </v>

1373
01:23:50.641 --> 01:23:51.660
<v Speaker 1>young and he and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1374
01:23:51.661 --> 01:23:53.100
<v Speaker 1>what's your retirement dream?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1375
01:23:53.101 --> 01:23:53.934
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I envisioned myself on a beach in a </v>

1376
01:23:55.411 --> 01:23:57.600
<v Speaker 1>tropical island with a Margarita in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

1377
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.943
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

1378
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:03.970
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1379
01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:05.230
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's play that out.</v>

1380
01:24:05.231 --> 01:24:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Let's be adult about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1381
01:24:06.641 --> 01:24:09.820
<v Speaker 1>so you go down to your this red headed </v>
<v Speaker 1>white guy,</v>

1382
01:24:09.970 --> 01:24:10.803
<v Speaker 1>you go down to the Caribbean and you sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a beach and you're sitting on the </v>

1383
01:24:14.381 --> 01:24:17.740
<v Speaker 1>beach and you have like six Margarita </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're there for like three hours.</v>

1384
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:19.900
<v Speaker 1>What happens the next day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1385
01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:22.240
<v Speaker 1>your Sun burnt to a crisp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1386
01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:25.330
<v Speaker 1>So you can't even go out of your hotel </v>
<v Speaker 1>room and you're hung over.</v>

1387
01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's say now you hide in your hotel</v>

1388
01:24:27.701 --> 01:24:28.534
<v Speaker 1>room for three or four days and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>recover and then you repeat that every </v>

1389
01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.253
<v Speaker 1>day for three months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you go outside and all the </v>

1390
01:24:34.421 --> 01:24:35.254
<v Speaker 1>locals get away from you because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new drunk lecture who's come down </v>

1391
01:24:40.181 --> 01:24:42.910
<v Speaker 1>from the north and that's your vision </v>
<v Speaker 1>for retirement.</v>

1392
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:44.203
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1393
01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.720
<v Speaker 1>so you have all the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want no responsibility.</v>

1394
01:24:46.721 --> 01:24:49.450
<v Speaker 1>You don't take care of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a partner,</v>

1395
01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:51.700
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any kids.</v>

1396
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:54.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a job like,</v>

1397
01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:57.400
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>

1398
01:24:57.401 --> 01:24:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sit in the sun and Drink Margaritas.</v>

1399
01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:01.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no.</v>

1400
01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:05.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good vision.</v>

1401
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:10.210
<v Speaker 1>You don't want no responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong.</v>

1402
01:25:10.570 --> 01:25:14.710
<v Speaker 1>People find the meaning in their life by</v>
<v Speaker 1>adopting responsibility and so</v>

1403
01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:18.610
<v Speaker 1>provision of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1404
01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:20.680
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man does not live by bread alone,</v>

1405
01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:23.043
<v Speaker 1>and there's wisdom in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't want no </v>

1406
01:25:25.181 --> 01:25:26.014
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might dream about that if you're </v>

1407
01:25:27.161 --> 01:25:30.070
<v Speaker 1>crushed by your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you have the wrong job,</v>

1408
01:25:30.071 --> 01:25:30.904
<v Speaker 1>or do you have the wrong attitude or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the wrong job and the wrong </v>

1409
01:25:32.681 --> 01:25:34.150
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

1410
01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:39.640
<v Speaker 1>You want lots of responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>society needs to foster that and we need</v>

1411
01:25:39.641 --> 01:25:44.530
<v Speaker 1>to help people find their purpose and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their place and that's,</v>

1412
01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:48.070
<v Speaker 1>that's more to the point than universal </v>
<v Speaker 1>income.</v>

1413
01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:49.960
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong solution.</v>

1414
01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1415
01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.420
<v Speaker 1>So that is the solution for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

1416
01:26:02.421 --> 01:26:07.421
<v Speaker 1>but for an individual that takes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>program and authors,</v>

1417
01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:13.980
<v Speaker 1>his or her future already has taken the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first steps of response,</v>

1418
01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.940
<v Speaker 1>personal responsibility by doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it.</v>

1419
01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:22.300
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume that we hear we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we assume responsibility for our lives.</v>

1420
01:26:22.431 --> 01:26:26.200
<v Speaker 1>We get our act together and we start </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our rooms and we,</v>

1421
01:26:26.201 --> 01:26:27.034
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we broaden the circle and we want to </v>

1422
01:26:28.611 --> 01:26:29.444
<v Speaker 1>start helping people out in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't have this first seat of </v>

1423
01:26:34.521 --> 01:26:35.354
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course some of them will also </v>

1424
01:26:38.811 --> 01:26:41.270
<v Speaker 1>have diseases that they can't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about.</v>

1425
01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:45.320
<v Speaker 1>We can leave that aside</v>
<v Speaker 1>for now,</v>

1426
01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.200
<v Speaker 1>but what do we do to inspire others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1427
01:26:49.201 --> 01:26:53.550
<v Speaker 1>you just laid it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's like you know,</v>

1428
01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:57.360
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pull out of the clinical literature.</v>

1429
01:26:58.090 --> 01:26:58.923
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you have children who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain low level amount of </v>

1430
01:27:04.231 --> 01:27:06.300
<v Speaker 1>neurological trouble when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>infants,</v>

1431
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:07.980
<v Speaker 1>so something's gone wrong.</v>

1432
01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little oxygen deprivation at </v>
<v Speaker 1>birth or something like that.</v>

1433
01:27:11.041 --> 01:27:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Something's gone a little bit wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their neurological development.</v>

1434
01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that the damage isn't too </v>
<v Speaker 1>severe,</v>

1435
01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:24.080
<v Speaker 1>those children will stabilize and </v>
<v Speaker 1>normalize if they have at least one well</v>

1436
01:27:25.501 --> 01:27:26.334
<v Speaker 1>put together role model in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that you do if </v>

1437
01:27:32.491 --> 01:27:33.324
<v Speaker 1>you want to inspire others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is get your act together because you </v>

1438
01:27:37.621 --> 01:27:38.454
<v Speaker 1>inspire most through example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more much more powerful than the </v>

1439
01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:43.733
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Words are very powerful if they're also </v>

1440
01:27:45.541 --> 01:27:46.374
<v Speaker 1>accompanied by example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the best thing you can do is start </v>

1441
01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:51.293
<v Speaker 1>putting things together around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of things to put </v>

1442
01:27:53.671 --> 01:27:55.950
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good meditative exercise.</v>

1443
01:27:55.951 --> 01:27:56.784
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

1444
01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:59.820
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is the proper form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prayer,</v>

1445
01:27:59.821 --> 01:28:02.100
<v Speaker 1>let's say assuming that there is such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1446
01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:07.110
<v Speaker 1>a proper form of prayer would be if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not happy with your life,</v>

1447
01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:08.093
<v Speaker 1>if you're miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit on the edge of your bed and you </v>

1448
01:28:10.441 --> 01:28:11.274
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1449
01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.633
<v Speaker 1>is there anything I can change in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing that is going to make this </v>

1450
01:28:16.651 --> 01:28:20.010
<v Speaker 1>less awful than it has to be less awful </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it might be.</v>

1451
01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:21.773
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know with intent and generally </v>

1452
01:28:25.561 --> 01:28:29.850
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get an answer almost immediately.</v>

1453
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.943
<v Speaker 1>There's something that you could put </v>
<v Speaker 1>right that day that would make things </v>

1454
01:28:35.911 --> 01:28:38.430
<v Speaker 1>slightly better than they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's rule four,</v>

1455
01:28:38.431 --> 01:28:39.264
<v Speaker 1>which is compare yourself to who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were yet to who you were yesterday and </v>

1456
01:28:42.571 --> 01:28:43.404
<v Speaker 1>not who someone else's today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There I don't believe that there is a </v>

1457
01:28:47.221 --> 01:28:48.054
<v Speaker 1>person who exists who wouldn't receive </v>
<v Speaker 1>an answer to that question if they </v>

1458
01:28:51.301 --> 01:28:52.134
<v Speaker 1>genuinely asked it and it's no different</v>
<v Speaker 1>really than thinking like if you think </v>

1459
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:58.860
<v Speaker 1>you have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you get an answer might not be</v>

1460
01:28:58.861 --> 01:28:59.694
<v Speaker 1>the right answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously you get an and you might </v>

1461
01:29:01.561 --> 01:29:01.921
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1462
01:29:01.921 --> 01:29:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I thought up that answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1463
01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:05.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really not much of an explanation</v>

1464
01:29:05.221 --> 01:29:08.700
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know how you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm sitting there and thoughts</v>

1465
01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:10.420
<v Speaker 1>appear in my head and that's how I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

1466
01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:15.030
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty shallow explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not much different than revelation.</v>

1467
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:17.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like you ask yourself the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

1468
01:29:17.371 --> 01:29:18.204
<v Speaker 1>You'll get the proper answers if you ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right question and you want the </v>

1469
01:29:22.171 --> 01:29:23.004
<v Speaker 1>answers right and those are not easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>preconditions to set up because who </v>

1470
01:29:27.301 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 1>knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know if,</v>

1471
01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.300
<v Speaker 1>if you're sitting on the edge of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed thinking,</v>

1472
01:29:31.690 --> 01:29:32.523
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1473
01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:34.893
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a question to ask </v>

1474
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:41.650
<v Speaker 1>because if you really want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find out and then you'll find out</v>

1475
01:29:41.651 --> 01:29:45.100
<v Speaker 1>that you really didn't want to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>because generally speaking,</v>

1476
01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:46.113
<v Speaker 1>finding out what you're doing wrong is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a pleasant experience and it means </v>

1477
01:29:48.791 --> 01:29:51.460
<v Speaker 1>that you have to sacrifice part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

1478
01:29:51.610 --> 01:29:54.220
<v Speaker 1>usually a burned out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>

1479
01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.570
<v Speaker 1>bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt,</v>

1480
01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.010
<v Speaker 1>arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty,</v>

1481
01:29:57.790 --> 01:29:58.623
<v Speaker 1>vengeful part of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless part that you like and </v>

1482
01:30:02.291 --> 01:30:03.124
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1483
01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.073
<v Speaker 1>so you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that room for those incremental </v>

1484
01:30:08.571 --> 01:30:13.571
<v Speaker 1>improvements exists within everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasp and and I think that it's a humble</v>

1485
01:30:15.561 --> 01:30:16.394
<v Speaker 1>thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask how you could improve </v>

1486
01:30:18.861 --> 01:30:21.920
<v Speaker 1>incrementally without interfering with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else.</v>

1487
01:30:21.921 --> 01:30:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Like it's your problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not theirs,</v>

1488
01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:24.973
<v Speaker 1>but I think that the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintained incremental improvement are </v>

1489
01:30:29.811 --> 01:30:34.811
<v Speaker 1>anything but incremental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get compound interest on incremental</v>

1490
01:30:34.821 --> 01:30:36.440
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1491
01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:39.530
<v Speaker 1>There's another rule in the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament called the matthew principal.</v>

1492
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:40.663
<v Speaker 1>Economists use it and the rule is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who have everything more will be </v>

1493
01:30:43.791 --> 01:30:44.624
<v Speaker 1>given and from those who have nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything will be taken to actually a </v>

1494
01:30:47.691 --> 01:30:50.510
<v Speaker 1>description of the way the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough,</v>

1495
01:30:50.690 --> 01:30:52.550
<v Speaker 1>you know that if you've ever played </v>
<v Speaker 1>monopoly,</v>

1496
01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:53.533
<v Speaker 1>because that's what happens if you play </v>
<v Speaker 1>monopoly and and there's a reason for </v>

1497
01:30:56.151 --> 01:30:57.350
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a deep reason,</v>

1498
01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:58.993
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very harsh rule because it </v>

1499
01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:04.220
<v Speaker 1>means as you start to wander off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>path,</v>

1500
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:05.203
<v Speaker 1>let's say the probability that you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>wander further off the path increases </v>

1501
01:31:09.051 --> 01:31:14.051
<v Speaker 1>nonlinearly and that's a terrible thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know as you wander towards the edge,</v>

1502
01:31:14.901 --> 01:31:19.901
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you'll fall off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cliff increases and that's a statistical</v>

1503
01:31:20.451 --> 01:31:21.284
<v Speaker 1>justification for the concept of hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you improve the probability that </v>

1504
01:31:27.291 --> 01:31:30.260
<v Speaker 1>each improvement will produce a further </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement increases,</v>

1505
01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:31.573
<v Speaker 1>and so perhaps the the downside is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic catastrophe that you can </v>

1506
01:31:36.681 --> 01:31:40.460
<v Speaker 1>engage upon if you reproduce your moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>failings,</v>

1507
01:31:40.461 --> 01:31:45.461
<v Speaker 1>but the upside is that each improvement </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces an increment in the probability</v>

1508
01:31:45.471 --> 01:31:46.550
<v Speaker 1>of the next improvement.</v>

1509
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:50.630
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen that it's a truism among </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral psychologists.</v>

1510
01:31:50.631 --> 01:31:51.464
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they don't generally phrase it </v>

1511
01:31:52.551 --> 01:31:53.384
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a behavioral psychologist and </v>

1512
01:31:55.251 --> 01:31:56.084
<v Speaker 1>I am a behavioral psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you find out what </v>

1513
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:03.160
<v Speaker 1>essentially you help a person establish </v>
<v Speaker 1>their aim.</v>

1514
01:32:03.650 --> 01:32:04.483
<v Speaker 1>Then you break down what they're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do into attainable units and you </v>

1515
01:32:08.321 --> 01:32:09.580
<v Speaker 1>negotiate with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

1516
01:32:09.581 --> 01:32:11.700
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I'm not,</v>

1517
01:32:11.970 --> 01:32:13.960
<v Speaker 1>they say I'm not making use of my time </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

1518
01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Spending three hours a day playing video</v>
<v Speaker 1>games and you say,</v>

1519
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.903
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1520
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:20.423
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1521
01:32:21.050 --> 01:32:21.883
<v Speaker 1>Hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time would you like to spend </v>

1522
01:32:23.481 --> 01:32:25.340
<v Speaker 1>playing video games?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

1523
01:32:25.341 --> 01:32:26.174
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could probably spend an hour a day </v>

1524
01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:31.010
<v Speaker 1>without it interfering with the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life,</v>

1525
01:32:31.190 --> 01:32:32.420
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1526
01:32:32.421 --> 01:32:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Because if you play video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

1527
01:32:34.251 --> 01:32:37.730
<v Speaker 1>but maybe three hours means that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing your homework or something and</v>

1528
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:39.890
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

1529
01:32:39.891 --> 01:32:41.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I want to play for an hour a day.</v>

1530
01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:42.621
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1531
01:32:42.621 --> 01:32:44.840
<v Speaker 1>well can you shift to an hour a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

1532
01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:47.090
<v Speaker 1>And this is supposed to be an honest </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

1533
01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:48.710
<v Speaker 1>and the person says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1534
01:32:48.711 --> 01:32:51.920
<v Speaker 1>I've tried that lots of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I try I just fail.</v>

1535
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:53.480
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1536
01:32:53.481 --> 01:32:54.314
<v Speaker 1>quit failing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go play one hour a day and the problem </v>

1537
01:32:56.901 --> 01:33:00.080
<v Speaker 1>will be solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a stupid strategy.</v>

1538
01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:00.921
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1539
01:33:00.921 --> 01:33:01.754
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about this and don't agree to </v>

1540
01:33:04.821 --> 01:33:05.654
<v Speaker 1>do this unless you think you will do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise it's just a waste of </v>

1541
01:33:08.031 --> 01:33:09.140
<v Speaker 1>both of our times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1542
01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:10.273
<v Speaker 1>do you think that you could track how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much time you spend playing video games </v>

1543
01:33:13.730 --> 01:33:15.920
<v Speaker 1>for one week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't change anything,</v>

1544
01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:17.713
<v Speaker 1>just track it.</v>

1545
01:33:18.710 --> 01:33:19.543
<v Speaker 4>They think,</v>

1546
01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could probably do that,</v>

1547
01:33:21.691 --> 01:33:23.460
<v Speaker 1>but I might miss a couple of days and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1548
01:33:23.461 --> 01:33:24.240
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

1549
01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:27.300
<v Speaker 1>so here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five out of the next seven days,</v>

1550
01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:30.450
<v Speaker 1>you just track how much time you spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing video games and the person says,</v>

1551
01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.313
<v Speaker 1>I think I can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you want them to </v>

1552
01:33:32.851 --> 01:33:34.920
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want them to succeed at.</v>

1553
01:33:34.921 --> 01:33:37.380
<v Speaker 1>The improvement is not much of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement,</v>

1554
01:33:37.381 --> 01:33:38.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1555
01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Then they come back and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1556
01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing about four hours a day,</v>

1557
01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:43.950
<v Speaker 1>and so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1558
01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.960
<v Speaker 1>well fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good work man.</v>

1559
01:33:45.961 --> 01:33:47.580
<v Speaker 1>You got track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know what.</v>

1560
01:33:47.730 --> 01:33:48.563
<v Speaker 1>We know the parameters of your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a little worse than you </v>

1561
01:33:51.031 --> 01:33:51.864
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least he had enough sense to </v>

1562
01:33:53.970 --> 01:33:56.460
<v Speaker 1>measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know where you're at.</v>

1563
01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:57.743
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you could cut that down to </v>

1564
01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:02.370
<v Speaker 1>three and a half hours every day</v>

1565
01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:04.020
<v Speaker 4>and the person thinks,</v>

1566
01:34:06.450 --> 01:34:07.800
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty weak willed.</v>

1567
01:34:07.801 --> 01:34:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I could manage that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

1568
01:34:10.801 --> 01:34:11.551
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about this?</v>

1569
01:34:11.551 --> 01:34:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that to have the next seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

1570
01:34:14.881 --> 01:34:15.714
<v Speaker 1>you can only play for three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you can manage that and you </v>

1571
01:34:18.391 --> 01:34:19.860
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not cynical about this.</v>

1572
01:34:19.861 --> 01:34:22.110
<v Speaker 1>You're not insulting the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of that.</v>

1573
01:34:22.111 --> 01:34:22.944
<v Speaker 1>It's like because you don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you care is that they make some </v>

1574
01:34:25.861 --> 01:34:29.880
<v Speaker 1>incremental movement towards their goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the person thinks about that.</v>

1575
01:34:29.881 --> 01:34:30.714
<v Speaker 1>If they have any sense and they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>their weakness into account and they </v>

1576
01:34:33.361 --> 01:34:35.790
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I could probably do that,</v>

1577
01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:38.460
<v Speaker 1>and then they come back the next week </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>

1578
01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:39.893
<v Speaker 1>I managed to spend three hours a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing video games for three days and </v>

1579
01:34:45.131 --> 01:34:46.780
<v Speaker 1>the rest were four hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>

1580
01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.070
<v Speaker 1>good work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1581
01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:51.640
<v Speaker 1>You've just got rid of 25 percent,</v>

1582
01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:54.273
<v Speaker 1>12 and a half percent of your problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your one eighth of the way to fixing it </v>

1583
01:34:59.030 --> 01:35:03.080
<v Speaker 1>in one week and you know the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to be all that thrilled with</v>

1584
01:35:03.081 --> 01:35:03.914
<v Speaker 1>themselves because they don't do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arithmetic and they don't do the </v>

1585
01:35:06.231 --> 01:35:07.220
<v Speaker 1>projection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>

1586
01:35:07.221 --> 01:35:08.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still pretty damn useless.</v>

1587
01:35:08.781 --> 01:35:12.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm playing 25 hours worth of video </v>
<v Speaker 1>games a week.</v>

1588
01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:15.050
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing to pat myself on the back </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1589
01:35:15.051 --> 01:35:16.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes it is.</v>

1590
01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:21.380
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a market measurable improvement and</v>

1591
01:35:21.381 --> 01:35:23.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a move in the right direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1592
01:35:23.421 --> 01:35:24.260
<v Speaker 1>and then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1593
01:35:24.261 --> 01:35:25.094
<v Speaker 1>well on the days you succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you manage to succeed and is </v>

1594
01:35:29.271 --> 01:35:32.870
<v Speaker 1>there a way that you could do it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>four days next week?</v>

1595
01:35:32.871 --> 01:35:36.380
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you could even try five days.</v>

1596
01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:39.530
<v Speaker 1>You think you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you also tell the person,</v>

1597
01:35:39.531 --> 01:35:41.330
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing you got to understand is</v>

1598
01:35:41.331 --> 01:35:42.980
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to improve like this.</v>

1599
01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.713
<v Speaker 1>You're going to improve like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some weeks you're going to come back </v>

1600
01:35:47.511 --> 01:35:48.111
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>

1601
01:35:48.111 --> 01:35:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I backslidden completely and I played </v>
<v Speaker 1>for four hours a day for seven days,</v>

1602
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:54.800
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't matter because that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean you failed.</v>

1603
01:35:54.801 --> 01:35:59.090
<v Speaker 1>It just means that you slid back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to calculate it over a month or</v>

1604
01:35:59.091 --> 01:36:00.560
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1605
01:36:00.561 --> 01:36:02.420
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month later,</v>

1606
01:36:02.421 --> 01:36:03.254
<v Speaker 1>the person's down to something like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a day and you've figured out ways </v>

1607
01:36:07.581 --> 01:36:10.400
<v Speaker 1>of filling their time in with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive otherwise and,</v>

1608
01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:11.443
<v Speaker 1>and they're on their way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the general consequence of that is </v>

1609
01:36:14.181 --> 01:36:17.300
<v Speaker 1>that every time they manage an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment,</v>

1610
01:36:17.690 --> 01:36:19.460
<v Speaker 1>they get a little stronger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

1611
01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:20.433
<v Speaker 1>They get a little bit more confident in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ability to get a little bit less </v>

1612
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:26.630
<v Speaker 1>wracked with self disgust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get a little bit more hopeful about</v>

1613
01:36:26.631 --> 01:36:30.650
<v Speaker 1>the future and they get more confident </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can make another change.</v>

1614
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:34.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you're patient and you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>patient with yourself that way,</v>

1615
01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:35.293
<v Speaker 1>it's like you reward those incremental </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvements and you don't get all </v>

1616
01:36:37.731 --> 01:36:39.890
<v Speaker 1>cynical about them and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1617
01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:43.730
<v Speaker 1>just imagine what would happen if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>kept doing that every week for 10 years.</v>

1618
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:48.020
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is things would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be so much better for you that you can't</v>

1619
01:36:48.021 --> 01:36:48.854
<v Speaker 1>even imagine it without much improvement</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe even with half that much </v>

1620
01:36:52.071 --> 01:36:54.140
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a,</v>

1621
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:59.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good way of progressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So very good.</v>

1622
01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:03.630
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1623
01:37:04.770 --> 01:37:09.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a question here on the article </v>
<v Speaker 1>written by your friend Bernard Schiff.</v>

1624
01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:15.290
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the many headpieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1625
01:37:16.050 --> 01:37:21.050
<v Speaker 1>from via that healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask you what your thoughts are</v>

1626
01:37:21.150 --> 01:37:23.540
<v Speaker 1>of the article written by Bernard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schiff.</v>

1627
01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.473
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a wide question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like to hear your side of the </v>

1628
01:37:26.911 --> 01:37:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Mat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1629
01:37:29.311 --> 01:37:34.311
<v Speaker 1>So Bernie Schiff is a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he doesn't see it that way.</v>

1630
01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that to be funny.</v>

1631
01:37:38.431 --> 01:37:39.264
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how I look at it and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>loss to me because he was a good friend </v>

1632
01:37:42.511 --> 01:37:43.344
<v Speaker 1>of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've lost a couple of friends in the </v>

1633
01:37:44.461 --> 01:37:47.970
<v Speaker 1>last two years and it's two or three </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and it's not pleasant,</v>

1634
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:52.260
<v Speaker 1>but he had his reasons for doing what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

1635
01:37:52.290 --> 01:37:53.340
<v Speaker 1>which I won't go into,</v>

1636
01:37:58.250 --> 01:38:00.800
<v Speaker 1>but there is one thing I will say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1637
01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:03.253
<v Speaker 1>He set forward a set of propositions </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the way that I was interacting </v>

1638
01:38:07.941 --> 01:38:08.774
<v Speaker 1>with my students and am interacting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the people like you to whom I'm </v>

1639
01:38:13.191 --> 01:38:18.191
<v Speaker 1>lecturing and he's he questions my </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations and fair enough,</v>

1640
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:21.783
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1641
01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:24.550
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1642
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:26.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm paraphrasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the gist of it,</v>

1643
01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:30.440
<v Speaker 1>that my style was autocratic say in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom,</v>

1644
01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:36.490
<v Speaker 1>and he cited a couple of students who </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt that way and I would say,</v>

1645
01:38:37.610 --> 01:38:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll say two things about that.</v>

1646
01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.420
<v Speaker 2>The the</v>

1647
01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:48.180
<v Speaker 1>evaluations of my classes at Harvard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the University of Toronto.</v>

1648
01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:49.943
<v Speaker 1>We're almost invariably better than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluations of any classes they'd ever </v>

1649
01:38:53.941 --> 01:38:54.774
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing in my maps of </v>

1650
01:38:57.211 --> 01:38:59.280
<v Speaker 1>meaning class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most common comment,</v>

1651
01:38:59.281 --> 01:39:00.114
<v Speaker 1>and that would have been from about 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of students was that the class </v>

1652
01:39:02.431 --> 01:39:05.580
<v Speaker 1>completely changed the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducted their lives.</v>

1653
01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:07.013
<v Speaker 1>So that's issue number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Issue number two is all those lectures </v>

1654
01:39:11.401 --> 01:39:14.250
<v Speaker 1>are online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like not every lecture I've given in the</v>

1655
01:39:14.251 --> 01:39:17.730
<v Speaker 1>last 30 years is online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every lecture I've given in the last</v>

1656
01:39:17.731 --> 01:39:18.564
<v Speaker 1>four years is online plus one lecture </v>
<v Speaker 1>series that I gave 30 years ago and a </v>

1657
01:39:22.471 --> 01:39:23.304
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of other talks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to see whether the </v>

1658
01:39:26.761 --> 01:39:30.990
<v Speaker 1>accusations leveled at me in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument in that article are true,</v>

1659
01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:34.410
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is go watch the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures and if you think they're true,</v>

1660
01:39:34.411 --> 01:39:37.710
<v Speaker 1>well then he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't think they're true then</v>

1661
01:39:37.711 --> 01:39:39.870
<v Speaker 1>he isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The d,</v>

1662
01:39:39.930 --> 01:39:42.450
<v Speaker 1>The evidence is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's hidden.</v>

1663
01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I've been recording my lectures since </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1664
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:50.100
<v Speaker 1>well I recorded one in 1993 at Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's online and then there's like</v>

1665
01:39:50.130 --> 01:39:54.390
<v Speaker 1>200 hours of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whatever my crimes,</v>

1666
01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:58.290
<v Speaker 1>they're there for everyone to see and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>determine for themselves.</v>

1667
01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:01.310
<v Speaker 1>And so that's mostly what people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and um,</v>

1668
01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:03.870
<v Speaker 1>that's fine with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1669
01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:06.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty much all I have to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that article.</v>

1670
01:40:08.730 --> 01:40:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Thank</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1671
01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:17.003
<v Speaker 1>There's a question from a Mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a relating to what you discussed </v>

1672
01:40:22.231 --> 01:40:24.000
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons.</v>

1673
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:27.540
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts on mutually </v>
<v Speaker 1>assured destruction?</v>

1674
01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Will we be safer in a world without </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons?</v>

1675
01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:38.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it depends on how we decide to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct ourselves.</v>

1676
01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:40.313
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me that we're in a </v>

1677
01:40:42.541 --> 01:40:45.480
<v Speaker 1>position where we can trust ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>without nuclear weapons.</v>

1678
01:40:46.710 --> 01:40:47.543
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1679
01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:49.763
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like a judgmental God in some </v>

1680
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:54.600
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you miss,</v>

1681
01:40:54.601 --> 01:40:57.130
<v Speaker 1>behave too badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be hell to pay,</v>

1682
01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:01.900
<v Speaker 1>and so the consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the end of the Second World War,</v>

1683
01:41:02.170 --> 01:41:03.003
<v Speaker 1>thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that no one has misbehaved too badly </v>

1684
01:41:06.521 --> 01:41:11.440
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I don't know if that's.</v>

1685
01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:15.340
<v Speaker 1>We've had comparative piece since the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the Second World War.</v>

1686
01:41:16.630 --> 01:41:17.463
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean there hasn't been </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught chronic low level conflict and </v>

1687
01:41:21.401 --> 01:41:22.234
<v Speaker 1>some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that the conflicts have </v>

1688
01:41:23.741 --> 01:41:25.840
<v Speaker 1>been trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but compared to world war two,</v>

1689
01:41:26.290 --> 01:41:29.350
<v Speaker 1>they are trivial and certainly compared </v>
<v Speaker 1>to world war three,</v>

1690
01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:30.293
<v Speaker 1>they are trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that the hydrogen </v>

1691
01:41:33.761 --> 01:41:34.594
<v Speaker 1>bomb has put the fear of God into us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's some utility in that </v>

1692
01:41:37.810 --> 01:41:38.643
<v Speaker 1>obviously it would be better if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't need that because they're </v>

1693
01:41:41.711 --> 01:41:42.544
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be an accident at some point </v>

1694
01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:50.110
<v Speaker 1>seems to me to be 100 percent because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always an accident.</v>

1695
01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're playing with fire.</v>

1696
01:41:53.230 --> 01:41:54.063
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1697
01:41:56.740 --> 01:42:01.120
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't self evident to me that so </v>
<v Speaker 1>far it's been a bad thing.</v>

1698
01:42:03.010 --> 01:42:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Even the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the Soviets,</v>

1699
01:42:04.721 --> 01:42:07.180
<v Speaker 1>even Stellan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he was probably,</v>

1700
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:08.223
<v Speaker 1>there is some evidence that stelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stellan was gearing up for the Third </v>

1701
01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:12.633
<v Speaker 1>World War and that he would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to put Europe to the </v>

1702
01:42:14.531 --> 01:42:15.364
<v Speaker 1>thermonuclear torch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was just the kind of guy to do </v>

1703
01:42:17.921 --> 01:42:18.754
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd been practicing doing that for a </v>

1704
01:42:20.111 --> 01:42:24.010
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After you kill your 10000000th person,</v>

1705
01:42:24.370 --> 01:42:28.570
<v Speaker 1>the next 10 million come pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he was.</v>

1706
01:42:28.810 --> 01:42:29.643
<v Speaker 1>There is evidence that he was gearing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that in western Europe and that he </v>

1707
01:42:32.201 --> 01:42:34.930
<v Speaker 1>was probably killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1708
01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:40.740
<v Speaker 1>but apart from stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one has come along who's been corrupt</v>

1709
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:44.290
<v Speaker 1>and malevolent enough to make that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>

1710
01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:45.453
<v Speaker 1>And so that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far a testament to the fundamental </v>

1711
01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:52.293
<v Speaker 1>goodness of the human heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what do you think Hitler with have </v>

1712
01:42:55.991 --> 01:42:56.824
<v Speaker 1>done with nuclear weapons?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably would have cleared </v>

1713
01:43:04.321 --> 01:43:05.850
<v Speaker 1>out most of eastern Europe</v>

1714
01:43:07.670 --> 01:43:10.970
<v Speaker 1>being part of his plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you perhaps know this,</v>

1715
01:43:10.971 --> 01:43:15.770
<v Speaker 1>but Hitler believed the Germans deserved</v>
<v Speaker 1>an empire like many other east,</v>

1716
01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:16.723
<v Speaker 1>many other European countries had an </v>
<v Speaker 1>empire and he felt that it was no </v>

1717
01:43:20.391 --> 01:43:24.620
<v Speaker 1>different for the Germans to pursue </v>
<v Speaker 1>their empire than it was for the British</v>

1718
01:43:24.621 --> 01:43:25.454
<v Speaker 1>and that his empire was going to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern Europe because what the hell </v>

1719
01:43:27.861 --> 01:43:28.910
<v Speaker 1>good are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1720
01:43:29.150 --> 01:43:33.620
<v Speaker 1>that was his attitude and I think he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have used whatever means necessary</v>

1721
01:43:33.621 --> 01:43:34.454
<v Speaker 1>to clear out as much territory as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible so that it could have been </v>

1722
01:43:36.351 --> 01:43:40.670
<v Speaker 1>inhabited by his voke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like now.</v>

1723
01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:41.533
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might ask about credit have been </v>

1724
01:43:42.710 --> 01:43:47.710
<v Speaker 1>done by nuclear means and the answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably so I think he would have</v>

1725
01:43:49.281 --> 01:43:51.350
<v Speaker 1>put them to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1726
01:43:51.351 --> 01:43:52.940
<v Speaker 1>my sense of Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

1727
01:43:52.941 --> 01:43:54.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what motivated Hitler?</v>

1728
01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:54.531
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1729
01:43:54.531 --> 01:43:56.180
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to rule the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1730
01:43:56.750 --> 01:44:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's what he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got exactly what he wanted.</v>

1731
01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:04.340
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to put a bullet through his </v>
<v Speaker 1>head when Berlin was in ruins and Europe</v>

1732
01:44:04.341 --> 01:44:05.180
<v Speaker 1>was inflamed.</v>

1733
01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:10.030
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

1734
01:44:10.031 --> 01:44:11.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one could aim for that.</v>

1735
01:44:11.171 --> 01:44:13.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think again,</v>

1736
01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:17.260
<v Speaker 1>someone named for it and they got it </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1737
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:22.120
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think he would've stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1738
01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:25.343
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a question here regarding the </v>

1739
01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:30.093
<v Speaker 1>controversial</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement three regarding enforced </v>

1740
01:44:37.061 --> 01:44:39.340
<v Speaker 1>monogamy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1741
01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:45.760
<v Speaker 1>from DC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three question stating the obvious often</v>

1742
01:44:45.761 --> 01:44:46.594
<v Speaker 1>suggests an agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with your observation that lack </v>

1743
01:44:51.221 --> 01:44:54.520
<v Speaker 1>of sex for young men can make society </v>
<v Speaker 1>more violent.</v>

1744
01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:59.200
<v Speaker 1>What should be done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually not my observation.</v>

1745
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:04.500
<v Speaker 1>So that isn't my observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>

1746
01:45:04.501 --> 01:45:05.334
<v Speaker 1>In words matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my observation is that social norms </v>

1747
01:45:08.921 --> 01:45:12.250
<v Speaker 1>favoring monogamy are essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human universal.</v>

1748
01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:14.133
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned through painful experience that </v>

1749
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:19.743
<v Speaker 1>social conventions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>favoring monogamy are the best way to </v>

1750
01:45:25.090 --> 01:45:25.923
<v Speaker 1>reduce male violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide a secure environment for </v>

1751
01:45:30.101 --> 01:45:30.934
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and help women find partners to help </v>

1752
01:45:33.521 --> 01:45:37.090
<v Speaker 1>them with the difficult process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduction and child rearing.</v>

1753
01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:39.213
<v Speaker 1>And that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman who wrote that article knew </v>

1754
01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:48.520
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well that when I used the term</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforced monogamy,</v>

1755
01:45:48.610 --> 01:45:49.443
<v Speaker 1>and we only discussed this for probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>two minutes out of an interview that </v>

1756
01:45:52.001 --> 01:45:52.834
<v Speaker 1>lasted two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knew perfectly well that I meant </v>

1757
01:45:57.460 --> 01:45:58.293
<v Speaker 1>social convention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was in her interest to find a </v>

1758
01:46:04.691 --> 01:46:05.524
<v Speaker 1>phrase that could be misinterpreted so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what I was speaking about could be </v>

1759
01:46:10.721 --> 01:46:15.250
<v Speaker 1>misinterpreted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what enforced monogamy means.</v>

1760
01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:21.370
<v Speaker 1>So let's say my son is planning to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>married in the fall.</v>

1761
01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:24.490
<v Speaker 1>And all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy about his fiance.</v>

1762
01:46:24.491 --> 01:46:27.970
<v Speaker 1>We seem to get along quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem to do quite well together.</v>

1763
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:33.390
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm pleased that they've made the</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision to start their life together.</v>

1764
01:46:35.170 --> 01:46:39.880
<v Speaker 1>So now imagine that he comes to me any </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and he says,</v>

1765
01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I've got some news for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>

1766
01:46:44.780 --> 01:46:45.613
<v Speaker 1>I've been married for a whole year and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've managed to have three affairs </v>

1767
01:46:48.311 --> 01:46:52.170
<v Speaker 1>during that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not get caught and what am I supposed to</v>

1768
01:46:52.171 --> 01:46:53.250
<v Speaker 1>do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1769
01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:54.900
<v Speaker 1>what do I put my arm around them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1770
01:46:54.901 --> 01:46:59.100
<v Speaker 1>good work kid way to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no.</v>

1771
01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.710
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he did that,</v>

1772
01:47:01.711 --> 01:47:05.610
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't tell me and second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he did tell me,</v>

1773
01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.593
<v Speaker 1>which I can't imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would ask him just what the hell did </v>

1774
01:47:10.411 --> 01:47:11.244
<v Speaker 1>he think he was doing that that was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to conduct himself and it would be </v>

1775
01:47:16.110 --> 01:47:21.030
<v Speaker 1>something I would regard as contemptible</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only the affairs but the deceit that</v>

1776
01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:21.893
<v Speaker 1>goes along with it and the violation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his vows and the breaking of the </v>

1777
01:47:24.661 --> 01:47:25.494
<v Speaker 1>harmonious relationship that he decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily to establish and the </v>

1778
01:47:28.531 --> 01:47:33.060
<v Speaker 1>weakening of the family structure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trouble that he put everyone through</v>

1779
01:47:33.061 --> 01:47:36.240
<v Speaker 1>to attend the marriage ceremony in good </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith and all of that.</v>

1780
01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:40.320
<v Speaker 1>While it's that's enforced monogamy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>God's sake.</v>

1781
01:47:40.710 --> 01:47:41.543
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the assumption of the </v>

1782
01:47:44.641 --> 01:47:45.474
<v Speaker 1>responsibility on the part of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>enter a relationship with some </v>

1783
01:47:49.801 --> 01:47:50.634
<v Speaker 1>expectation of permanence to uphold the </v>
<v Speaker 1>promise that they make when they do </v>

1784
01:47:53.971 --> 01:47:54.804
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she knew that bloody perfectly well </v>

1785
01:47:58.260 --> 01:47:59.910
<v Speaker 1>and so it's just a,</v>

1786
01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:04.240
<v Speaker 1>it's so idiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible to believe,</v>

1787
01:48:04.710 --> 01:48:06.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1788
01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:08.440
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to accuse someone of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1789
01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.340
<v Speaker 1>you should at least accused them of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's plausible.</v>

1790
01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:13.593
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would there isn't anybody who goes </v>

1791
01:48:15.791 --> 01:48:19.600
<v Speaker 1>around thinking that monogamy should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforced at the point of a gun,</v>

1792
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:22.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the odd isis wing nut does that,</v>

1793
01:48:22.541 --> 01:48:24.070
<v Speaker 1>thinks that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1794
01:48:24.071 --> 01:48:29.071
<v Speaker 1>there isn't anyone who thinks that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>including me and she knew that perfectly</v>

1795
01:48:29.351 --> 01:48:30.184
<v Speaker 1>well and so if that's the best that my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who regard themselves as my </v>

1796
01:48:34.691 --> 01:48:39.340
<v Speaker 1>enemies on the left can manage as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>character slurred then well,</v>

1797
01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:41.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have outer boys and girls.</v>

1798
01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:44.650
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bloody pathetic as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned.</v>

1799
01:48:45.210 --> 01:48:46.043
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1800
01:48:46.670 --> 01:48:51.670
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

1801
01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:54.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you one more thing about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's something interesting.</v>

1802
01:48:54.781 --> 01:48:56.790
<v Speaker 1>I detailed this out in 12 rules for </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1803
01:48:56.940 --> 01:49:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the figures exactly right </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I haven't got to memorize,</v>

1804
01:49:00.001 --> 01:49:00.834
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last 20 years the desire for </v>

1805
01:49:04.591 --> 01:49:08.430
<v Speaker 1>marriage has increased among young women</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by a substantial margin.</v>

1806
01:49:08.431 --> 01:49:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 35 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1807
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:11.783
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's decreased among men by about 17 </v>

1808
01:49:14.221 --> 01:49:16.490
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1809
01:49:16.491 --> 01:49:18.050
<v Speaker 1>so why am I telling you that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1810
01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:19.723
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1811
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.840
<v Speaker 1>are we so blind that we don't realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>what most people want?</v>

1812
01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:26.713
<v Speaker 1>Like most people who aren't cynical </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream that they'll find a monogamous </v>

1813
01:49:32.521 --> 01:49:34.170
<v Speaker 1>partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

1814
01:49:34.171 --> 01:49:35.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the evidence for that?</v>

1815
01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:36.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1816
01:49:36.211 --> 01:49:37.044
<v Speaker 1>there's evidence for that because all </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do is ask people and the </v>

1817
01:49:39.391 --> 01:49:43.050
<v Speaker 1>majority of them tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's way more evidence than that.</v>

1818
01:49:43.051 --> 01:49:44.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

1819
01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:49.820
<v Speaker 1>You take your date to a romantic comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's the structure of the romantic</v>

1820
01:49:49.931 --> 01:49:50.764
<v Speaker 1>comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man Lies to partner and has multiple </v>

1821
01:49:53.891 --> 01:49:54.724
<v Speaker 1>affairs and you go away from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>romantic comedy and you think that was </v>

1822
01:49:57.851 --> 01:49:59.890
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do that.</v>

1823
01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:00.993
<v Speaker 1>It's like that isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is you go to a romantic </v>

1824
01:50:03.011 --> 01:50:03.844
<v Speaker 1>comedy together and you see a couple who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are attracted and repulsed across the </v>

1825
01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:09.643
<v Speaker 1>across the dynamics of the movie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they overcome a bunch of obstacles and </v>

1826
01:50:12.941 --> 01:50:13.774
<v Speaker 1>they decide to live happily ever after </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the romantic comedy and it's </v>

1827
01:50:17.711 --> 01:50:18.544
<v Speaker 1>like a sure fire success if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably handled because it reflects </v>

1828
01:50:22.361 --> 01:50:26.710
<v Speaker 1>what people want and the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflects that is because basically,</v>

1829
01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:30.730
<v Speaker 1>although not without exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are monogamous,</v>

1830
01:50:30.731 --> 01:50:31.564
<v Speaker 1>we tilt towards monogamy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean we can't be serially </v>

1831
01:50:34.601 --> 01:50:35.434
<v Speaker 1>monogamous and it doesn't mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't people who tend towards </v>

1832
01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:42.250
<v Speaker 1>multiple partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the dream.</v>

1833
01:50:42.670 --> 01:50:45.310
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what we enforce social norms.</v>

1834
01:50:45.311 --> 01:50:50.311
<v Speaker 1>It's not the universal human standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what makes for good people,</v>

1835
01:50:50.651 --> 01:50:51.484
<v Speaker 1>individuals or good intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships or solid families or </v>

1836
01:50:54.611 --> 01:50:59.611
<v Speaker 1>stable communities and so and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how that can be contentious.</v>

1837
01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:03.880
<v Speaker 1>How did that become contentious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the alternative</v>

1838
01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:05.943
<v Speaker 2>like?</v>

1839
01:51:06.710 --> 01:51:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Responsibility lists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive sex.</v>

1840
01:51:10.610 --> 01:51:11.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

1841
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:14.600
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it for 15 years.</v>

1842
01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:18.110
<v Speaker 1>See how much fun it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See where you end up.</v>

1843
01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:22.460
<v Speaker 1>You will certainly end up cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll definitely end up alone.</v>

1844
01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Well then what the hell are you going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>

1845
01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:27.260
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do when you're 45 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have anyone?</v>

1846
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do for the next 35</v>

1847
01:51:29.871 --> 01:51:30.980
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have kids.</v>

1848
01:51:31.130 --> 01:51:31.963
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to have grandchildren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have someone to tangle your </v>

1849
01:51:34.041 --> 01:51:34.874
<v Speaker 1>story together with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have anything that lends </v>

1850
01:51:36.561 --> 01:51:37.394
<v Speaker 1>solidity to your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got no responsibility and so no </v>

1851
01:51:39.861 --> 01:51:42.320
<v Speaker 1>self respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1852
01:51:42.321 --> 01:51:43.154
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you're promoting as an </v>

1853
01:51:44.961 --> 01:51:49.160
<v Speaker 1>alternative to enforce monogamy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like have added to your life.</v>

1854
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:52.220
<v Speaker 1>You'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my sense of it,</v>

1855
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:54.103
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1856
01:51:58.190 --> 01:52:00.620
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>

1857
01:52:03.150 --> 01:52:04.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a good one.</v>

1858
01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:08.760
<v Speaker 1>What can mark system contribute to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern day world by</v>

1859
01:52:12.570 --> 01:52:15.810
<v Speaker 1>it can contribute Venezuela and it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has.</v>

1860
01:52:21.710 --> 01:52:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I'll be a little bit less cynical in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

1861
01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:27.570
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen what it can contribute.</v>

1862
01:52:27.690 --> 01:52:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many bloody times we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to run the experiment.</v>

1863
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:32.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't real Marxism.</v>

1864
01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what that sentence means.</v>

1865
01:52:35.730 --> 01:52:37.330
<v Speaker 1>What that means is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1866
01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:38.333
<v Speaker 1>if I was the dictator with my profound </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of Marx's real intent and </v>

1867
01:52:44.851 --> 01:52:45.684
<v Speaker 1>my benevolent compassion uncontaminated </v>
<v Speaker 1>by any proclivity towards darkness or </v>

1868
01:52:51.921 --> 01:52:55.880
<v Speaker 1>sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would bring on the socialist utopia.</v>

1869
01:52:56.240 --> 01:53:01.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if someone says that and claims it,</v>

1870
01:53:01.551 --> 01:53:04.880
<v Speaker 1>then you should get the hell away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as fast as you possibly can.</v>

1871
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so mark's was concerned about inequality</v>

1872
01:53:09.381 --> 01:53:11.780
<v Speaker 1>and there are reasons to be concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about inequality,</v>

1873
01:53:12.230 --> 01:53:13.063
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with Marxism is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>lays the cause of equality at the feet </v>

1874
01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:18.710
<v Speaker 1>of the fundamental institutions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>

1875
01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:20.690
<v Speaker 1>The free market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>

1876
01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:23.150
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy,</v>

1877
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:24.103
<v Speaker 1>the hated word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality is not caused by the </v>

1878
01:53:26.991 --> 01:53:30.530
<v Speaker 1>institutions of the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>

1879
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Inequality is the fundamental rule of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>

1880
01:53:33.890 --> 01:53:36.920
<v Speaker 1>and it's produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about the western systems,</v>

1881
01:53:37.190 --> 01:53:41.390
<v Speaker 1>every system we know produces inequality</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's run as a,</v>

1882
01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:43.490
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an operative process,</v>

1883
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:45.103
<v Speaker 1>all of the systems produce inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we've developed in the West is the </v>

1884
01:53:49.130 --> 01:53:52.970
<v Speaker 1>only system that produces wealth along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the inequality,</v>

1885
01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:54.231
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1886
01:53:54.231 --> 01:53:57.950
<v Speaker 1>the wealth isn't equally distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's true,</v>

1887
01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:01.550
<v Speaker 1>hence the inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least there's some wealth.</v>

1888
01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:04.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of people in absolute poverty</v>

1889
01:54:04.371 --> 01:54:07.580
<v Speaker 1>in the world have to between 2000 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>2012,</v>

1890
01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:12.350
<v Speaker 1>three years faster than the UN was </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping for in its most wildly optimistic</v>

1891
01:54:12.351 --> 01:54:13.184
<v Speaker 1>projections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are getting comparatively richer </v>

1892
01:54:15.741 --> 01:54:18.440
<v Speaker 1>at an absolute level with unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed.</v>

1893
01:54:18.441 --> 01:54:21.920
<v Speaker 1>It's never been seen in the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of the planet first.</v>

1894
01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:22.753
<v Speaker 1>It happened in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously including to Iceland and even </v>

1895
01:54:25.701 --> 01:54:29.740
<v Speaker 1>in the last 75 years here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been an unbelievable increasing</v>

1896
01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:33.020
<v Speaker 1>the standard of living and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to happen everywhere else.</v>

1897
01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:38.420
<v Speaker 1>This fastest growing economies in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world are in Subsaharan Africa.</v>

1898
01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:42.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no starvation in China.</v>

1899
01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:43.453
<v Speaker 1>There's no starvation in India and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the places in the world where there's </v>

1900
01:54:46.451 --> 01:54:47.284
<v Speaker 1>still is starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because because of political </v>

1901
01:54:49.551 --> 01:54:50.384
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not because there isn't enough </v>

1902
01:54:51.051 --> 01:54:51.884
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because one group of people sets </v>

1903
01:54:53.781 --> 01:54:56.480
<v Speaker 1>out to star of another group of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to death.</v>

1904
01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:00.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not a matter of absolute privation </v>
<v Speaker 1>or because of Marxism.</v>

1905
01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1906
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:04.330
<v Speaker 1>because of mark says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1907
01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I think the average Venezuelan has lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like 17 pounds,</v>

1908
01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:09.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

1909
01:55:09.681 --> 01:55:11.600
<v Speaker 1>it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely awful.</v>

1910
01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:14.570
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that Marxism has a damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1911
01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:15.493
<v Speaker 1>I think Marxism has already contributed </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough millions of corpses to have </v>

1912
01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:23.000
<v Speaker 1>finished with its contributions </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

1913
01:55:23.590 --> 01:55:24.423
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't Marxism thing just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it has its appeal and its appeal comes </v>

1914
01:55:30.291 --> 01:55:35.291
<v Speaker 1>from grains of truth that had uses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to stretch across an explain,</v>

1915
01:55:35.991 --> 01:55:36.824
<v Speaker 1>allowing the Marxists point to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pernicious problem of inequality and </v>

1916
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:45.330
<v Speaker 1>inequality is a problem of inequality is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a problem.</v>

1917
01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:46.613
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I outlined that in part in 12 rules for </v>

1918
01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:48.774
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason there's a left wing and the </v>

1919
01:55:50.221 --> 01:55:53.730
<v Speaker 1>reason there should be a left wing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because inequality is a problem.</v>

1920
01:55:53.731 --> 01:55:58.200
<v Speaker 1>It has to be addressed and when you set </v>
<v Speaker 1>up a hierarchical structure,</v>

1921
01:55:58.320 --> 01:55:59.153
<v Speaker 1>which you need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to pursue things of </v>

1922
01:56:00.421 --> 01:56:04.500
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the hierarchy tends to ossify and,</v>

1923
01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:05.670
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1924
01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:09.990
<v Speaker 1>and become rigid and it becomes hard for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people at the bottom to climb to the top</v>

1925
01:56:09.991 --> 01:56:12.390
<v Speaker 1>and so they get dispossessed and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can become permanent.</v>

1926
01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:15.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everyone's problem,</v>

1927
01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:18.060
<v Speaker 1>left wing centrust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right wing doesn't matter.</v>

1928
01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:19.073
<v Speaker 1>Inequality is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that you can lay </v>

1929
01:56:22.291 --> 01:56:23.124
<v Speaker 1>it at the feet of the institutions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the West and that's where Marxism goes </v>

1930
01:56:27.031 --> 01:56:27.864
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also doesn't mean that we know </v>

1931
01:56:29.371 --> 01:56:34.371
<v Speaker 1>how to fix inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a hard problem and so it,</v>

1932
01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:37.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a much harder problem than people </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

1933
01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Now when we don't know what to do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1934
01:56:39.930 --> 01:56:43.050
<v Speaker 1>We've done some things and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture is very.</v>

1935
01:56:43.051 --> 01:56:43.884
<v Speaker 1>The Scandinavian countries tend to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more on the income </v>

1936
01:56:45.901 --> 01:56:49.500
<v Speaker 1>redistribution side and that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have worked reasonably well.</v>

1937
01:56:49.501 --> 01:56:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Scandinavian countries are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn livable.</v>

1938
01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:52.973
<v Speaker 1>They've got their problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly Sweden as far as I can </v>

1939
01:56:54.991 --> 01:56:55.824
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1940
01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:56.693
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's easier for homogenous small </v>

1941
01:56:58.171 --> 01:57:01.200
<v Speaker 1>countries to do risk redistribution by </v>
<v Speaker 1>all appearances.</v>

1942
01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:03.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not so easy for a place like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

1943
01:57:03.511 --> 01:57:04.344
<v Speaker 1>which is much bigger and much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse and has a much broader range of </v>

1944
01:57:06.991 --> 01:57:07.824
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the western countries are </v>

1945
01:57:10.051 --> 01:57:10.884
<v Speaker 1>stumbling through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them have steeper hierarchies </v>

1946
01:57:14.490 --> 01:57:17.090
<v Speaker 1>and less of a social safety net like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>US.</v>

1947
01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:17.963
<v Speaker 1>Although it's incredibly productive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tended to have very low levels of </v>

1948
01:57:20.910 --> 01:57:21.743
<v Speaker 1>unemployment and then there's places </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Scandinavian countries where </v>

1949
01:57:25.111 --> 01:57:29.490
<v Speaker 1>the social and Canada where the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>safety net is more well developed,</v>

1950
01:57:29.491 --> 01:57:31.310
<v Speaker 1>but that struggle with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1951
01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.353
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with improving productivity and with </v>

1952
01:57:34.290 --> 01:57:36.600
<v Speaker 1>higher rates of unemployment most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

1953
01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:37.793
<v Speaker 1>So we don't know how to get that right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're kind of muddling through it </v>

1954
01:57:40.051 --> 01:57:42.060
<v Speaker 1>and at the same time we're muddling </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

1955
01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:43.253
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of us are getting absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard and so that's a pretty good </v>

1956
01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:47.993
<v Speaker 1>default position to be in when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to sort out the inequality </v>

1957
01:57:50.521 --> 01:57:51.354
<v Speaker 1>problem and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking over the last weeks </v>

1958
01:57:53.971 --> 01:57:56.840
<v Speaker 1>that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1959
01:57:56.850 --> 01:58:00.840
<v Speaker 1>you can express these problems in quasi </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical form.</v>

1960
01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:01.673
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's probably a rule that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like in order to produce one </v>

1961
01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:05.873
<v Speaker 1>increment of absolute wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to allow three increments of </v>

1962
01:58:09.091 --> 01:58:09.924
<v Speaker 1>inequality or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inequality is the price you pay for the </v>

1963
01:58:12.391 --> 01:58:13.224
<v Speaker 1>generation of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect because the right amount </v>

1964
01:58:15.961 --> 01:58:16.794
<v Speaker 1>of inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right amount of inequality is not </v>

1965
01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:21.390
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's some number.</v>

1966
01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:23.610
<v Speaker 1>And you could debate about what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>number is,</v>

1967
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's not zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You flattened everyone out,</v>

1968
01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:27.533
<v Speaker 1>you get nothing if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meritocracy of some sort than if you're </v>

1969
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:35.210
<v Speaker 1>producing something to get to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1970
01:58:35.230 --> 01:58:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing something for others.</v>

1971
01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>

1972
01:58:39.031 --> 01:58:44.031
<v Speaker 1>is that the radical types believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't believe that there's anything</v>

1973
01:58:44.531 --> 01:58:45.364
<v Speaker 1>but power they don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that really annoys me </v>

1974
01:58:47.561 --> 01:58:50.290
<v Speaker 1>about the universities and this doctrine</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've been</v>

1975
01:58:52.210 --> 01:58:53.230
<v Speaker 1>combating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1976
01:58:53.231 --> 01:58:54.064
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

1977
01:58:55.840 --> 01:59:00.220
<v Speaker 3>your argument is predicated on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the idea that there's such a thing as</v>

1978
01:59:00.221 --> 01:59:01.054
<v Speaker 3>merit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's such a thing as things </v>

1979
01:59:03.371 --> 01:59:04.204
<v Speaker 3>worth doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the real radical types would debate </v>

1980
01:59:06.881 --> 01:59:07.601
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just say,</v>

1981
01:59:07.601 --> 01:59:08.434
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just using the idea of </v>

1982
01:59:09.281 --> 01:59:10.114
<v Speaker 3>meritocracy to justify your page,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your position in the patriarchal </v>

1983
01:59:12.911 --> 01:59:14.650
<v Speaker 3>tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>

1984
01:59:14.651 --> 01:59:15.461
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

1985
01:59:15.461 --> 01:59:16.294
<v Speaker 3>And they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just a mouthpiece for your group </v>

1986
01:59:19.181 --> 01:59:20.740
<v Speaker 3>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There isn't any.</v>

1987
01:59:20.741 --> 01:59:24.680
<v Speaker 3>You don't make that mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no you,</v>

1988
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:26.193
<v Speaker 3>you're just</v>

1989
01:59:27.050 --> 01:59:30.500
<v Speaker 1>an Avatar for your privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1990
01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:31.373
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

1991
01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Well know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before I ask the last question,</v>

1992
01:59:38.930 --> 01:59:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to remind you that we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to meet outside this room and more</v>

1993
01:59:44.361 --> 01:59:48.050
<v Speaker 1>people may come since the people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>

1994
01:59:48.051 --> 01:59:51.470
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may come as well and Dr Peterson is</v>

1995
01:59:51.471 --> 01:59:54.670
<v Speaker 1>going to sign books and if you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have books signed,</v>

1996
01:59:54.710 --> 01:59:57.160
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a few seconds with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1997
01:59:57.710 --> 01:59:59.490
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1998
02:00:00.230 --> 02:00:02.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last question,</v>

1999
02:00:02.331 --> 02:00:06.950
<v Speaker 1>we had a similar question yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very original one from savannah.</v>

2000
02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:07.813
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So honored.</v>

2001
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:12.880
<v Speaker 1>How do you like Iceland?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2002
02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:14.863
<v Speaker 1>well my wife and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm here actually with my wife and </v>

2003
02:00:18.051 --> 02:00:23.051
<v Speaker 1>my mother who I don't normally travel </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and my aunt and they came along for</v>

2004
02:00:24.021 --> 02:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>the adventure because I had invited </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2005
02:00:25.731 --> 02:00:26.564
<v Speaker 1>I'm traveling with my wife to many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many places and I asked members of my </v>

2006
02:00:29.931 --> 02:00:33.650
<v Speaker 1>extended family if they wanted to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of an adventure that they could pick</v>

2007
02:00:33.651 --> 02:00:34.460
<v Speaker 1>a place to come.</v>

2008
02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:35.293
<v Speaker 1>And My mother and my aunt picked Iceland</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone here has been ridiculously </v>

2009
02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:44.120
<v Speaker 1>hospitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's lovely.</v>

2010
02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:45.583
<v Speaker 1>And I've met lots of people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street and outside these venues and </v>

2011
02:00:48.201 --> 02:00:49.034
<v Speaker 1>everyone has been unfailingly polite and</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcoming and you have a beautiful </v>

2012
02:00:54.021 --> 02:00:59.021
<v Speaker 1>little country and what you've done with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is nothing short of miraculous as far</v>

2013
02:01:00.651 --> 02:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful,</v>

2014
02:01:03.980 --> 02:01:06.440
<v Speaker 1>it's peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's thriving,</v>

2015
02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>it's stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's free.</v>

2016
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

2017
02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I love coming to countries like this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think there are absolute miracles.</v>

2018
02:01:17.090 --> 02:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Life is a real catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet look at how wonderful it is here</v>

2019
02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:25.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's not like it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't an easy place to live.</v>

2020
02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:26.593
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard place and yet you've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've done a tremendous amount with </v>

2021
02:01:31.911 --> 02:01:32.744
<v Speaker 1>what you have in front of you and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>more power to you as far as I'm </v>

2022
02:01:36.291 --> 02:01:38.180
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a wonderful time here.</v>

2023
02:01:40.530 --> 02:01:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Thanks very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a real honor to be here and to</v>

2024
02:01:58.851 --> 02:01:59.690
<v Speaker 2>talk to all of you.</v>
