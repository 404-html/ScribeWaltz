00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got lots of questions here.</v>

2
00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:11.861
<v Speaker 1>And so welcome to the first live</v>
<v Speaker 1>question and answer youtube session that</v>

3
00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm hosting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to get right into it and</v>

4
00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:18.830
<v Speaker 1>answer some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots coming up on the screen</v>

5
00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:20.420
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Mac one three five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven one nine seven,</v>

7
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>nine asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean people don't have</v>

8
00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:29.810
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas have people.</v>

9
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Are we okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Cause I've got an area here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that.</v>

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hear some technical talk</v>

12
00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>during this because we don't exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what we're doing yet.</v>

13
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does it mean people don't have</v>

14
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:45.020
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas have people.</v>

15
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I learned that mostly from young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

16
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I think that's virtually a direct quote</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Carl Jung.</v>

17
00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.400
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I learned from young</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that it's perfectly reasonable to</v>

18
00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:03.070
<v Speaker 1>think of ideas as something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>living as,</v>

19
00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:04.100
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as something that's,</v>

20
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.340
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But an idea is something that's alive.</v>

21
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.360
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beings that have ideas and so that's</v>

22
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:18.181
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are alive and we're trying to use</v>

23
00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:22.570
<v Speaker 1>our cognitive ability to further our</v>
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

24
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 1>And so we create ideas that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

25
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.380
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of those ideas is to have</v>

26
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:36.950
<v Speaker 1>them played out in embodiment to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mac that acted out because otherwise</v>

27
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>did not have any utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

28
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.570
<v Speaker 1>we conjure up ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say originally,</v>

29
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>but they take on a life of their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>over time.</v>

30
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.530
<v Speaker 1>And as they take on a life of their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their capacity to dominate someone</v>

31
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.700
<v Speaker 1>increases to the point where the idea is</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguably more powerful than the person.</v>

32
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at religious ideas,</v>

33
00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:07.940
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could think of what happened</v>

34
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>with regards to Islam and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>end up in the latter part of the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian Millennium,</v>

36
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>a set of ideas exploded out of one</v>
<v Speaker 1>source and,</v>

37
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.300
<v Speaker 1>and swept through a vast population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happened with</v>

38
00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

39
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:27.470
<v Speaker 1>the same thing is happening with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity right now in China,</v>

40
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

41
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.421
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in China.</v>

42
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Christianity is spreading faster than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>did in the Roman times.</v>

43
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.160
<v Speaker 1>And definitely something we already</v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed cause our timeframe is small</v>

44
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:39.140
<v Speaker 1>compared to thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

45
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.310
<v Speaker 1>But ideas have their own goal and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own perception and their own way of</v>

46
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

47
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.450
<v Speaker 1>it's always possible for them to possess</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

48
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.150
<v Speaker 3>Why do we feel exposed and vulnerable</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we know and do what we really like?</v>

49
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.590
<v Speaker 3>Your words that Zell H,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well</v>

50
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 3>lots of times people hide behind a shelf</v>
<v Speaker 3>even at cost to them because if the</v>

51
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 3>shell gets criticized and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>really that relevant because it doesn't</v>

52
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 3>have any direct bearing on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're not showing your true</v>

53
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 3>self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak to the world and what you're</v>

54
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 3>showing is something essentially this</v>
<v Speaker 3>false or just constructed and that gets</v>

55
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 3>criticized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you can always comfort yourself</v>

56
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 3>with the idea that it's not really you</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's under attack.</v>

57
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.020
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't wound to the same degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

58
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.790
<v Speaker 3>and I mean that's partly why people</v>
<v Speaker 3>protect themselves with falsehoods and</v>

59
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.810
<v Speaker 3>ideologies and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

60
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.210
<v Speaker 3>it's an attempt to shield their genuine</v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability from assault by the world.</v>

61
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.030
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is is that if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>allow that vulnerability to manifest</v>

62
00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:13.080
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the probability that you're</v>

63
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.100
<v Speaker 3>actually ever going to get what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>really like or even discover what it is</v>

64
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:19.530
<v Speaker 3>is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by protecting yourself to that</v>

65
00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:22.650
<v Speaker 3>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you end up losing,</v>

66
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.560
<v Speaker 3>certainly losing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is that you're most trying to</v>

67
00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:27.360
<v Speaker 3>protect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

68
00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:31.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be cavalier about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's understandable that people</v>

69
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.540
<v Speaker 3>attempt to shield their vulnerability</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the vulnerability isn't just</v>

70
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:39.720
<v Speaker 3>felt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real and people are fragile and you</v>

71
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:42.180
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're subject to the terrible forces of</v>

72
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.280
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enter the terrible forces of culture.</v>

73
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.620
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>we put all sorts of masks in front of</v>

74
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.370
<v Speaker 3>ourselves so that our exposure is</v>
<v Speaker 3>limited.</v>

75
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.300
<v Speaker 3>People even do that to themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 3>some degree.</v>

76
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 3>If you're front is false enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's also false to you.</v>

77
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.180
<v Speaker 3>And I suppose people do that to some</v>
<v Speaker 3>degree to protect themselves against</v>

78
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.530
<v Speaker 3>their own self criticisms.</v>

79
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.800
<v Speaker 3>David Guido says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can high school teachers best</v>

80
00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:16.290
<v Speaker 3>promote virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cultivate morality,</v>

81
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.830
<v Speaker 3>and tackle the meaning crisis in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>face of an increasingly chaotic,</v>

82
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:21.810
<v Speaker 3>violent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dehumanized future?</v>

83
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say it isn't obvious to me that</v>

84
00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:29.490
<v Speaker 3>the future is increasingly chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>violent,</v>

85
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:32.520
<v Speaker 3>and dehumanized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the past was pretty rough.</v>

86
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.850
<v Speaker 3>Now the future is definitely ill</v>
<v Speaker 3>defined.</v>

87
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.260
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what's going to happen and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe that's more true in in a</v>

88
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:43.080
<v Speaker 3>general sense than it ever has been in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the history of mankind.</v>

89
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.530
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily think that there's</v>

90
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.580
<v Speaker 3>reasons to be particularly pessimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

91
00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:52.380
<v Speaker 3>the first part of the question I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

92
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.090
<v Speaker 3>is well worth addressing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can high school teachers best</v>

93
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 3>promote virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cultivate,</v>

94
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 3>cultivate morality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and tackle the meaning crisis?</v>

95
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the best way that people in</v>

96
00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:08.680
<v Speaker 3>general promote virtue and cultivate</v>
<v Speaker 3>morality is by promoting virtue and</v>

97
00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:10.570
<v Speaker 3>cultivating morality within their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>

98
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.200
<v Speaker 3>But I think that in order to do that for</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and then also in order to</v>

99
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.120
<v Speaker 3>transmit that information to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>students,</v>

100
00:06:19.121 --> 00:06:23.260
<v Speaker 3>you have to understand that morality</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't a sec of injunctions,</v>

101
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.330
<v Speaker 3>of the nature of don't ever do anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>impulsive that you like,</v>

102
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.240
<v Speaker 3>which is generally how Morrell he's put</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

103
00:06:31.241 --> 00:06:32.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you think about morality is</v>

104
00:06:32.921 --> 00:06:36.640
<v Speaker 3>something that a puritanical person</v>
<v Speaker 3>might preach.</v>

105
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.660
<v Speaker 3>And that it has to do mostly with self</v>
<v Speaker 3>control and self constraint.</v>

106
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.620
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's a very shallow,</v>

107
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.070
<v Speaker 3>that's a very shell shallow vision of</v>
<v Speaker 3>morality.</v>

108
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 3>I think the way that you convince people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to act morally if that's something that</v>

109
00:06:56.881 --> 00:07:01.380
<v Speaker 3>you're interested in doing is to</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditate on the utility of the truth</v>

110
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.710
<v Speaker 3>because I think the highest form of</v>
<v Speaker 3>morality is following the truth.</v>

111
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.030
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

112
00:07:06.031 --> 00:07:10.950
<v Speaker 3>why would you bother following?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's true and answer to that I think</v>

113
00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:14.880
<v Speaker 3>is quite straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you follow what's false,</v>

114
00:07:14.881 --> 00:07:18.150
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to end up somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you weren't planning to go and the</v>

115
00:07:18.151 --> 00:07:20.640
<v Speaker 3>probability that that's going to be good</v>
<v Speaker 3>is low.</v>

116
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Me following what's false,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like attempting to use the wrong</v>

117
00:07:25.051 --> 00:07:28.230
<v Speaker 3>map for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for for the territory that you occupy.</v>

118
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.140
<v Speaker 3>And if your eyes are opening and you pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention,</v>

119
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.450
<v Speaker 3>then the probability that you'll be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to maneuver around the terrible,</v>

120
00:07:36.451 --> 00:07:40.680
<v Speaker 3>sharp obstacles that will emerge in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front of you is that much higher.</v>

121
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.260
<v Speaker 3>And so when you were having a serious</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion about morality with people,</v>

122
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.750
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of points that you'd</v>

123
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.220
<v Speaker 3>make to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

124
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.680
<v Speaker 3>and these were fundamental points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One would be do you want things to be</v>

125
00:07:55.681 --> 00:07:58.620
<v Speaker 3>better or do you want things to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse?</v>

126
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 3>And you might assume that people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to automatically answered that.</v>

127
00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:08.310
<v Speaker 3>They'd rather have things better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not so self evident because</v>

128
00:08:08.311 --> 00:08:10.620
<v Speaker 3>to make things better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it usually requires that you adopt a</v>

129
00:08:10.621 --> 00:08:15.390
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of responsibility and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's effortful and difficult and</v>

130
00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:19.170
<v Speaker 3>frightening and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the buck sort of stops with you,</v>

131
00:08:19.171 --> 00:08:21.300
<v Speaker 3>which is also part of what makes it</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifying.</v>

132
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.840
<v Speaker 3>But if you do want things to be better</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have your mind stream and</v>

133
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.210
<v Speaker 3>oriented in that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then</v>

134
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.150
<v Speaker 3>the truth is your best possible guide</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it'll help you get to that</v>

135
00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:40.810
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think one of the things that people</v>

136
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:45.811
<v Speaker 3>who talk about morality</v>
<v Speaker 3>failed to understand is that it's not</v>

137
00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:50.260
<v Speaker 3>abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's practical.</v>

138
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Morality is precisely what's proved to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be most practical,</v>

139
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.820
<v Speaker 3>the longest possible span of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like the,</v>

140
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 3>the moral act is what's best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all things considered.</v>

141
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 3>And part of the reason that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary for people to follow</v>

142
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 3>conventional rules is because convention</v>
<v Speaker 3>is part of the wisdom of mankind.</v>

143
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 3>And the wisdom of mankind has basically</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

144
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all things considered,</v>

145
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.160
<v Speaker 3>here's a pathway that you can follow</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is going to work out in principle</v>

146
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 3>best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

147
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>

148
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 3>one of the considerations there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking in terms of convention is,</v>

149
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the standard path through life,</v>

150
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.300
<v Speaker 3>say in western culture has been to grow</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to form an intimate relationship of</v>

151
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:44.250
<v Speaker 3>some stability to do something</v>
<v Speaker 3>productive than other people approve of.</v>

152
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.083
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

153
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 3>and we'll trade with you for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to raise children and to establish</v>

154
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:54.240
<v Speaker 3>yourself in a community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that that's conventional</v>

155
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:58.740
<v Speaker 3>morality is because that's not such a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad deal compared to most of the</v>

156
00:09:58.741 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 3>alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you can pull all those things off</v>

157
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:05.340
<v Speaker 3>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's a reasonable chance that</v>

158
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 3>you'll at least have a life that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely full of unbearable suffering</v>

159
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 3>with nothing positive in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also the,</v>

160
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.640
<v Speaker 3>there's also a reasonable possibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you'll have a good life.</v>

161
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 3>And so then you might want to try to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that correctly.</v>

162
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Why Act Morally?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why Act in a virtuous manner?</v>

163
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Because it's in your interest and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>in every once in else,</v>

164
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.250
<v Speaker 3>everyone else's interest as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that seems like a good deal.</v>

165
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 3>Now it will mean that you'll have to put</v>
<v Speaker 3>off certain forms of impulsive pleasure.</v>

166
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.280
<v Speaker 3>But the problem often with impulsive</v>
<v Speaker 3>pleasure is that well you,</v>

167
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have pleasure at haste and you</v>

168
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:43.860
<v Speaker 3>repented leisure.</v>

169
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.520
<v Speaker 3>And so part of what standard morality is</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do is to inform you about how</v>

170
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:53.430
<v Speaker 3>you might act in the present so that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>present is acceptable.</v>

171
00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:57.300
<v Speaker 3>But so the tomorrow is also good and</v>
<v Speaker 3>next week is also good and next month is</v>

172
00:10:57.301 --> 00:11:02.280
<v Speaker 3>also good and next year is also good for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and for your family and for your</v>

173
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 3>community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for this broad swath of humanity.</v>

174
00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 3>And partly what you ask people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ask high school students is,</v>

175
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.720
<v Speaker 3>well they want to be part of that or did</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to do something else?</v>

176
00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:15.420
<v Speaker 3>And if they want to do something else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they want to make things worse</v>

177
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 3>while they should think that through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's just not a very good</v>

178
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:19.520
<v Speaker 3>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

179
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.530
<v Speaker 3>unless your goal is to make the world a</v>
<v Speaker 3>more miserable place.</v>

180
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often people's goals are precisely.</v>

181
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:29.220
<v Speaker 3>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex fiander asked,</v>

182
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:31.860
<v Speaker 3>is mindfulness really beneficial or is</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just a trend?</v>

183
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.450
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly it's a trend.</v>

184
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with mindfulness as far as</v>

185
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:38.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's,</v>

186
00:11:38.871 --> 00:11:39.770
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

187
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.130
<v Speaker 3>it's a word that's like a giant box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can put anything you want in it and</v>

188
00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:47.790
<v Speaker 3>claim that that's not only what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what it does.</v>

189
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.890
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

190
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be very hesitant to make a</v>

191
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:55.690
<v Speaker 3>blanket statement such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

192
00:11:55.691 --> 00:12:00.691
<v Speaker 3>like no one practicing mindfulness or</v>
<v Speaker 3>teaching mindfulness is producing any</v>

193
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:06.370
<v Speaker 3>benefit for their students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

194
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:08.290
<v Speaker 3>I think mostly it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fat.</v>

195
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.573
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

196
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.610
<v Speaker 3>how can disney produced an architectural</v>
<v Speaker 3>masterpiece in the mid nineties lion</v>

197
00:12:19.611 --> 00:12:24.320
<v Speaker 3>king and then turn around and create</v>
<v Speaker 3>propaganda in the new millennium froze.</v>

198
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.810
<v Speaker 3>That's why Sam Colette,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

199
00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:29.660
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's an even better question that</v>

200
00:12:29.661 --> 00:12:32.840
<v Speaker 3>goes along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like not only could did isn't he</v>

201
00:12:32.841 --> 00:12:36.320
<v Speaker 3>turned around and create propaganda in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new millennium because I do believe</v>

202
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:40.370
<v Speaker 3>exactly that that's what frozen is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I remember correctly,</v>

203
00:12:40.371 --> 00:12:43.640
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's the highest grossing</v>
<v Speaker 3>animated movie now that's ever been</v>

204
00:12:43.641 --> 00:12:46.130
<v Speaker 3>made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not only that they created</v>

205
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.440
<v Speaker 3>propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the people are extraordinarily</v>

206
00:12:48.441 --> 00:12:52.130
<v Speaker 3>hungry for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would that be?</v>

207
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ideological motifs in frozen</v>

208
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.470
<v Speaker 3>is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

209
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:07.471
<v Speaker 3>the classic idea that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sleeping beauty needs a prince to</v>

210
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:12.571
<v Speaker 3>awaken her is observed and old fashioned</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that there are alternative ways of</v>

211
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:19.351
<v Speaker 3>traveling through life</v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't require the subjugation that</v>

212
00:13:20.201 --> 00:13:25.201
<v Speaker 3>that particular story might appear to</v>
<v Speaker 3>entail.</v>

213
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:31.230
<v Speaker 3>I think that's really naive beyond</v>
<v Speaker 3>belief because a story like sleeping</v>

214
00:13:31.991 --> 00:13:36.580
<v Speaker 3>beauty</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the feminine is waiting for the</v>

215
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:37.900
<v Speaker 3>masculine to awaken.</v>

216
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.460
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just as true for men as it is for</v>

217
00:13:43.461 --> 00:13:44.990
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about men and women.</v>

218
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is to some degree.</v>

219
00:13:46.671 --> 00:13:50.570
<v Speaker 3>It's more about the masculine and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminine and the feminine part of a man,</v>

220
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:56.450
<v Speaker 3>which is the part that enables him to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a relationship with a woman at all,</v>

221
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.500
<v Speaker 3>is awoken by the archetypal masculine</v>
<v Speaker 3>qualities of clarity of mind.</v>

222
00:14:03.081 --> 00:14:07.160
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as much as the females femininity</v>

223
00:14:07.161 --> 00:14:12.161
<v Speaker 3>is awoken by masculine clarity of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can read those old stories and</v>

224
00:14:13.911 --> 00:14:17.630
<v Speaker 3>sleeping beauty in all likelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very little story at multiple</v>

225
00:14:17.631 --> 00:14:18.800
<v Speaker 3>levels simultaneously.</v>

226
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.193
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

227
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.160
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that people want the propaganda</v>

228
00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:30.090
<v Speaker 3>because it tells them that what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>already think is correct</v>

229
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.333
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

230
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.690
<v Speaker 3>that all the old wisdom or much of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>old list them,</v>

231
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.250
<v Speaker 3>it can just be dispensed with and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>can conduct your lives in any manner</v>

232
00:14:39.251 --> 00:14:40.450
<v Speaker 3>that they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

233
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.583
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't work.</v>

234
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.983
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

235
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.370
<v Speaker 3>Julian 10 says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have said that to study history is</v>

236
00:14:49.371 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 3>to study oneself and one will be much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more grounded and strong if they do.</v>

237
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 3>So will you please more talk on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please talk more on this.</v>

238
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.833
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

239
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.440
<v Speaker 3>it's easy for people to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're 30 years old.</v>

240
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.840
<v Speaker 3>It's easy for you to think that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually 30 years old,</v>

241
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.090
<v Speaker 3>but you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in many ways,</v>

242
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.630
<v Speaker 3>at least at one level of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're three and a half billion years</v>

243
00:15:16.631 --> 00:15:21.631
<v Speaker 3>old because that's approximately how</v>
<v Speaker 3>long the genetic structure that has</v>

244
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.850
<v Speaker 3>given rise to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in part has existed.</v>

245
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.720
<v Speaker 3>And you're the consequences of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive,</v>

246
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.230
<v Speaker 3>massively extensive evolutionary process</v>
<v Speaker 3>extending back billions of years.</v>

247
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.210
<v Speaker 3>It's conditioned every aspect of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you're a very,</v>

248
00:15:40.211 --> 00:15:42.970
<v Speaker 3>very ancient creature from a biological</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

249
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:48.570
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't view yourself across</v>
<v Speaker 3>that entire span of time,</v>

250
00:15:48.941 --> 00:15:52.300
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the wrong idea about what it</v>

251
00:15:52.301 --> 00:15:56.650
<v Speaker 3>means to be a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then on the cultural end of things,</v>

252
00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.460
<v Speaker 3>while you're deeply shaped and</v>

253
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
<v Speaker 3>and inhibited and offered opportunity by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire history of human cultural</v>

254
00:16:09.691 --> 00:16:12.900
<v Speaker 3>endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also interacted in the causal</v>

255
00:16:12.901 --> 00:16:16.470
<v Speaker 3>manner with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the emergence of our biology across</v>

256
00:16:16.471 --> 00:16:18.390
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't understand history,</v>

257
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:24.300
<v Speaker 3>then you don't understand who you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're a product of history.</v>

258
00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.660
<v Speaker 3>Everything you think someone else</v>
<v Speaker 3>already thought,</v>

259
00:16:27.661 --> 00:16:30.450
<v Speaker 3>every word that you use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else came up with.</v>

260
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.570
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now youth person thinks for example,</v>

261
00:16:36.571 --> 00:16:38.550
<v Speaker 3>that the thoughts that they have or</v>
<v Speaker 3>their thoughts,</v>

262
00:16:38.551 --> 00:16:41.340
<v Speaker 3>but the probability that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a thought that's original is</v>

263
00:16:41.341 --> 00:16:45.840
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so just to understand your own</v>

264
00:16:45.841 --> 00:16:48.720
<v Speaker 3>thought process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to be deeply,</v>

265
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.910
<v Speaker 3>you understand your own thought process</v>
<v Speaker 3>far more deeply.</v>

266
00:16:53.911 --> 00:16:58.080
<v Speaker 3>If you are an astute student of history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you also understand the problems that</v>

267
00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.820
<v Speaker 3>confront you in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

268
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.630
<v Speaker 3>you're born into the world in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular historical configuration.</v>

269
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.750
<v Speaker 3>That's an architectural truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

270
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.020
<v Speaker 3>your spirit is born into the world when</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is a certain specific way.</v>

271
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.050
<v Speaker 3>And that certain specific way is also a</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of</v>

272
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.640
<v Speaker 3>vast patterns of processes that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>laid themselves out on a historical</v>

273
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.271
<v Speaker 3>timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

274
00:17:24.271 --> 00:17:28.400
<v Speaker 3>just a simple example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of the um,</v>

275
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.630
<v Speaker 3>interpersonal complexities that young</v>
<v Speaker 3>people face say in their,</v>

276
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:37.530
<v Speaker 3>in their intimate relationships are a</v>
<v Speaker 3>direct consequence of the birth control</v>

277
00:17:37.531 --> 00:17:38.250
<v Speaker 3>pill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

278
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.700
<v Speaker 3>that's only been around for 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not deep history,</v>

279
00:17:41.701 --> 00:17:43.680
<v Speaker 3>but it certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it certainly history.</v>

280
00:17:43.681 --> 00:17:48.681
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't understand that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>birth control burst in on humanity like</v>

281
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 3>app,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an atomic</v>

282
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.470
<v Speaker 1>bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe like a hydrogen bomb,</v>

283
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand what it is that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving your own interpersonal problems.</v>

284
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.100
<v Speaker 1>So there's no difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>studying history and studying</v>

285
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:03.030
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

286
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.860
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between studying</v>
<v Speaker 1>history and psychology and,</v>

287
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.960
<v Speaker 1>and trying to understand who you are and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you should do histories about you.</v>

288
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not about the world or it's about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and you,</v>

289
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.510
<v Speaker 1>and if you can't see the sense in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not approaching it properly.</v>

290
00:18:19.511 --> 00:18:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Or You have bad teachers where you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to read or something like that</v>

291
00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:25.410
<v Speaker 1>because history is unbearably</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

292
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 1>And so I suppose that's another marker</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can use to determine whether or</v>

293
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:33.600
<v Speaker 1>not your attitude towards studying</v>
<v Speaker 1>history is correct.</v>

294
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>If you're not fascinated and horrified</v>
<v Speaker 1>by it,</v>

295
00:18:36.691 --> 00:18:39.330
<v Speaker 1>almost beyond belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not studying history</v>

296
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:41.880
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you were studying it</v>

297
00:18:41.881 --> 00:18:46.020
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd never ask why you should study it.</v>

298
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:47.350
<v Speaker 1>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be so evident,</v>

299
00:18:47.351 --> 00:18:52.351
<v Speaker 1>so obvious that it was necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did humans enjoy sad stories?</v>

300
00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.800
<v Speaker 1>That's Lx yonder.</v>

301
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they actually enjoyed</v>

302
00:19:06.041 --> 00:19:08.500
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I think you could make a case</v>

303
00:19:08.501 --> 00:19:13.360
<v Speaker 1>that they do in sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someone's watching a story that's,</v>

304
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.330
<v Speaker 1>that's somewhat sentimental that'll make</v>
<v Speaker 1>them tear up.</v>

305
00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.270
<v Speaker 1>And you might say that that's an element</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being sad.</v>

306
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:24.930
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that's more an element</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being compassionate and participating</v>

307
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:30.450
<v Speaker 1>in this fictional way in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the love and the intimacy that human</v>

308
00:19:31.361 --> 00:19:34.270
<v Speaker 1>beings are capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can do that by proxy and that can</v>

309
00:19:34.271 --> 00:19:37.880
<v Speaker 1>certainly produce sentimental emotions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

310
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.200
<v Speaker 1>and nostalgic emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those can be associated with tiers.</v>

311
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.070
<v Speaker 1>But you could go deeper than that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

312
00:19:45.071 --> 00:19:47.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will watch tragic stories.</v>

313
00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's certainly the case mean any</v>
<v Speaker 1>shakespearian play virtually is,</v>

314
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.110
<v Speaker 1>is tragic in many regards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason that</v>

315
00:19:54.111 --> 00:19:56.720
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are compelled to do that is because</v>

316
00:19:56.721 --> 00:19:59.150
<v Speaker 1>we're compelled to understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedies of our life.</v>

317
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.830
<v Speaker 1>And so to see that tragedy laid out on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>

318
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:10.360
<v Speaker 1>which means that it's distilled and</v>
<v Speaker 1>amplified in some sense,</v>

319
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.400
<v Speaker 1>is to simultaneously engage in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of wrestling with what it means</v>

320
00:20:15.401 --> 00:20:20.320
<v Speaker 1>to exist in a tragic world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And any information you can get about</v>

321
00:20:20.321 --> 00:20:23.620
<v Speaker 1>that is going to be well worth the</v>
<v Speaker 1>momentary negative emotion that you</v>

322
00:20:23.621 --> 00:20:26.410
<v Speaker 1>might experience while you're engaged in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the play.</v>

323
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.230
<v Speaker 1>So people like sad stories because life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is often sad and we have to figure out</v>

324
00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:35.650
<v Speaker 1>how to deal with that and stories can</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you how to deal with it well and</v>

325
00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:37.880
<v Speaker 1>how to deal with it badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

326
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.840
<v Speaker 1>that can be absurdly informative.</v>

327
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.540
<v Speaker 3>If Christianity has much historical</v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom to offer,</v>

328
00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:00.780
<v Speaker 3>why is it so derided in the academy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this a good thing or a bad thing?</v>

329
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:06.470
<v Speaker 3>Why Ryan Ross?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

330
00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:10.730
<v Speaker 3>I think that people generally think of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity as</v>

331
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.340
<v Speaker 3>science for stupid people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that,</v>

332
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's often reduced to its more</v>

333
00:21:20.001 --> 00:21:24.860
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalist manifestations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know that the straw man version</v>

334
00:21:24.861 --> 00:21:29.861
<v Speaker 3>of Christianity is</v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalist protestantism of the</v>

335
00:21:31.021 --> 00:21:36.021
<v Speaker 3>sword that makes the case that the Bible</v>
<v Speaker 3>is literally true and that the cosmos is</v>

336
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.820
<v Speaker 3>roughly several thousand years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

337
00:21:44.521 --> 00:21:49.521
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to make fun of that.</v>

338
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure it's so why is to make fun</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it can mean people generally have</v>

339
00:21:53.701 --> 00:21:57.840
<v Speaker 3>reasons for what they believe and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's fear and,</v>

340
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.640
<v Speaker 3>and narrow mindedness and ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes what might appear to be</v>

341
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.890
<v Speaker 3>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear and narrow mindedness and ignorance</v>

342
00:22:06.891 --> 00:22:10.850
<v Speaker 3>is actually the attempt to preserve</v>
<v Speaker 3>something of extraordinary,</v>

343
00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:15.170
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The value of which has not been fully</v>

344
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.103
<v Speaker 3>articulated.</v>

345
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.020
<v Speaker 3>I guess partly I see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's the,</v>

346
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:32.530
<v Speaker 3>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the ability for people to</v>

347
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.370
<v Speaker 3>generate the straw man version of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity and then just feel</v>

348
00:22:36.371 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 3>intelligent by comparing their old</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge to that.</v>

349
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.020
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty weak I would say.</v>

350
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:50.080
<v Speaker 3>I think Marxism contributes to it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

351
00:22:50.081 --> 00:22:54.310
<v Speaker 3>I think that the universities and our</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual life in general is still</v>

352
00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:57.760
<v Speaker 3>saturated with Marxist in new Marxists</v>
<v Speaker 3>presuppositions.</v>

353
00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.740
<v Speaker 3>And I really think that's a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

354
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:03.610
<v Speaker 3>I really don't think that that's any</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than having our intellectual</v>

355
00:23:03.611 --> 00:23:06.730
<v Speaker 3>landscape populated by neo fascist</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

356
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't see it from a historical</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective that there's any reason</v>

357
00:23:10.331 --> 00:23:15.331
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever to assume that neo Marxist</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas are any more morally appropriate</v>

358
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:18.790
<v Speaker 3>than neofascist ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

359
00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:23.410
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of what drives them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Neo Marxist analysis of Christianity</v>

360
00:23:23.411 --> 00:23:24.244
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

361
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.520
<v Speaker 3>some of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it's simple mindedness mean the</v>

362
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.900
<v Speaker 3>marxists tend to reduce everything to</v>
<v Speaker 3>power or to economics.</v>

363
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.420
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>power and economics are important,</v>

364
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:41.530
<v Speaker 3>but to reduce everything to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to reduce everything to any one thing</v>

365
00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:44.410
<v Speaker 3>is a mark of a weak mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

366
00:23:44.411 --> 00:23:47.810
<v Speaker 3>most problems multivariant problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not univariate problems.</v>

367
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:53.750
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a hatred for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility that genuine Christianity</v>

368
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:58.970
<v Speaker 3>lays upon a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because after an architectural level,</v>

369
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:00.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

370
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 3>if you just speak about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically,</v>

371
00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.460
<v Speaker 3>you don't set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

372
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 3>the soul is naturally Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a hell of a thing to say.</v>

373
00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.850
<v Speaker 3>But he had his reasons for saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of what he was saying was that,</v>

374
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.830
<v Speaker 3>or what do you believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Aldous Huxley talked about this a</v>

375
00:24:15.831 --> 00:24:16.664
<v Speaker 3>bit too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that</v>

376
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:24.660
<v Speaker 3>there are elements of Christianity that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have Tiquan conceptualization as far as</v>

377
00:24:24.661 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 3>it can go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what makes an architectural</v>

378
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.310
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I can give you an example of that.</v>

379
00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:35.060
<v Speaker 3>So there's a presupposition in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity speaking psychologically</v>

380
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.163
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

381
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.560
<v Speaker 3>human beings make progress by making</v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices.</v>

382
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.210
<v Speaker 3>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see this act it out to begin to,</v>

383
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.770
<v Speaker 3>to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to some degree in the old testament</v>

384
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:53.010
<v Speaker 3>where the sacrifices that people make</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

385
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.930
<v Speaker 3>are genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>archaic sacrifices.</v>

386
00:24:55.931 --> 00:25:00.270
<v Speaker 3>If they take something that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they believe has value,</v>

387
00:25:00.271 --> 00:25:04.560
<v Speaker 3>perhaps a prize animal and burden at</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't offer it to God.</v>

388
00:25:04.561 --> 00:25:09.180
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that it's burned as far</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I've been able to tell us,</v>

389
00:25:09.181 --> 00:25:12.240
<v Speaker 3>because the archaic conception of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world was that the world was a flat</v>

390
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.450
<v Speaker 3>disc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on top of that disc was a ball and</v>

391
00:25:15.451 --> 00:25:17.370
<v Speaker 3>the ball was the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking.</v>

392
00:25:17.371 --> 00:25:20.460
<v Speaker 3>And then outside the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where the gods existed.</v>

393
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.470
<v Speaker 3>And I think our cake people believe that</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the same reason that we feel are</v>

394
00:25:25.471 --> 00:25:27.930
<v Speaker 3>when we look up in the night sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't,</v>

395
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.140
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to make the mistake that</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because people didn't know some of</v>

396
00:25:31.141 --> 00:25:33.090
<v Speaker 3>the things we know now that they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>

397
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:37.040
<v Speaker 3>They looked up at the night sky or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day sky and felt awe and,</v>

398
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:39.240
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and part of the intuition that came</v>

399
00:25:39.241 --> 00:25:40.590
<v Speaker 3>along with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or was that</v>

400
00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:46.160
<v Speaker 1>while they were looking at the night sky</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a day start there looking into the</v>

401
00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:49.390
<v Speaker 1>infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a lie very tightly with</v>

402
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.770
<v Speaker 1>divinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's those ideas going in the</v>

403
00:25:51.771 --> 00:25:52.604
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

404
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.220
<v Speaker 1>if you burn something and offer it up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

405
00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:58.700
<v Speaker 1>the smoke rises and God can detect the</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of your sacrifice and you,</v>

406
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.470
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's again,</v>

407
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:01.304
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty,</v>

408
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

409
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.710
<v Speaker 1>simple minded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

410
00:26:04.711 --> 00:26:08.250
<v Speaker 1>it's the dramatic representation of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably profound idea.</v>

411
00:26:08.251 --> 00:26:12.360
<v Speaker 1>And the profound idea is that sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to make things go properly,</v>

412
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:17.630
<v Speaker 1>you have to let go of something that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply love or deeply want to do.</v>

413
00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:22.470
<v Speaker 1>And what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means to sacrifice is to let</v>

414
00:26:22.471 --> 00:26:26.970
<v Speaker 1>something go in the present so that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future can be better or to let something</v>

415
00:26:26.971 --> 00:26:29.790
<v Speaker 1>go personally so that other people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>have it better.</v>

416
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.880
<v Speaker 1>And there's no difference between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of sacrifice and the discovery of</v>

417
00:26:35.041 --> 00:26:38.130
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you discovered the future,</v>

418
00:26:38.131 --> 00:26:41.100
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you realize is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to sacrifice things in the</v>

419
00:26:41.101 --> 00:26:46.101
<v Speaker 1>present so that the future manifests</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in a more acceptable manner.</v>

420
00:26:46.921 --> 00:26:47.701
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

421
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:51.150
<v Speaker 1>that's also an amazing discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the discovery human beings made.</v>

422
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.240
<v Speaker 1>If we change our behavior in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

423
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.880
<v Speaker 1>better things could happen in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

424
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no other animal really has ever</v>

425
00:26:59.041 --> 00:26:59.970
<v Speaker 1>discovered that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

426
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:02.730
<v Speaker 1>So that's very tightly linked into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of sacrifice.</v>

427
00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.050
<v Speaker 1>And so he might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

428
00:27:04.051 --> 00:27:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you have to sacrifice something of</v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

429
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:12.210
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes I ask my students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them are second or children of</v>

430
00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:13.220
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

431
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.380
<v Speaker 1>what did your parents sacrifice so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to university?</v>

432
00:27:16.381 --> 00:27:18.660
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone understands that question.</v>

433
00:27:18.661 --> 00:27:20.940
<v Speaker 1>The students immediately tell me of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

434
00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:24.900
<v Speaker 1>the things that their parents have done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They moved from some foreign country.</v>

435
00:27:24.901 --> 00:27:28.950
<v Speaker 1>They spent 18 hours a day working their</v>
<v Speaker 1>selves to the fingers,</v>

436
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:32.850
<v Speaker 1>to the bone at a laundromat or a dry</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaner so that their students could</v>

437
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.820
<v Speaker 1>assume that their children could have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>richer and fuller life.</v>

438
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:40.410
<v Speaker 1>They're sacrificing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the sacrifices based on it's based</v>

439
00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:44.160
<v Speaker 1>on faith and the faith in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially a form of religious</v>

440
00:27:44.161 --> 00:27:46.030
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have to get into that</v>

441
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.990
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fundamental driving idea is that</v>

442
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.770
<v Speaker 1>the reality is can be positively shaped</v>
<v Speaker 1>by sacrifice.</v>

443
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an amazing idea.</v>

444
00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you might say,</v>

445
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:00.444
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

446
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.910
<v Speaker 1>the higher quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifice,</v>

447
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 1>the more profound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive effect on the future to</v>

448
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.350
<v Speaker 1>reasonable proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>

449
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.420
<v Speaker 1>what's the most valuable possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice and announcer that is long</v>

450
00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:20.130
<v Speaker 1>enviously yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you can say,</v>

451
00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:21.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that the ultimate moral</v>

452
00:28:21.571 --> 00:28:26.130
<v Speaker 1>junction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate moral injunction is to</v>

453
00:28:26.131 --> 00:28:29.570
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice yourself in a manner that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the future better love.</v>

454
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the central idea of Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The central idea,</v>

455
00:28:32.881 --> 00:28:36.480
<v Speaker 1>like the central figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological figure at the core of</v>

456
00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Christianity is the person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily sacrifices themself to the</v>

457
00:28:41.341 --> 00:28:44.790
<v Speaker 1>benevolent will of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

458
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:47.250
<v Speaker 1>if you have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're terrified of that idea.</v>

459
00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.230
<v Speaker 1>And especially if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

460
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I would say if you're a rationalistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual or rationalizing</v>

461
00:28:53.491 --> 00:28:54.151
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

462
00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:55.940
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell wants to believe that?</v>

463
00:28:56.330 --> 00:29:01.330
<v Speaker 1>That that's your moral obligation is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice yourself for the best.</v>

464
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:02.821
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

465
00:29:02.821 --> 00:29:05.220
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the archetypal stories,</v>

466
00:29:05.221 --> 00:29:06.720
<v Speaker 1>it means that you end up crucified.</v>

467
00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:08.643
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

468
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:12.850
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of reasons to be not very</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>

469
00:29:12.851 --> 00:29:14.800
<v Speaker 1>both that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you say,</v>

470
00:29:14.801 --> 00:29:16.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that Christian and</v>

471
00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Christianity is derided in the academy a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing or a bad thing?</v>

472
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Mostly it's a terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

473
00:29:23.021 --> 00:29:26.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not like Christianity can't use</v>
<v Speaker 1>some criticism,</v>

474
00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:28.650
<v Speaker 1>although I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

475
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.590
<v Speaker 1>nature in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature took care of that for us.</v>

476
00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.093
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

477
00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.510
<v Speaker 1>mostly I think what we're doing in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>academy is running as fast as we can</v>

478
00:29:40.511 --> 00:29:45.511
<v Speaker 1>from the responsibility of bearing our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and we're diversifying it.</v>

479
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
<v Speaker 1>And we were using any number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling rationalizations and</v>

480
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:57.420
<v Speaker 1>ideological maneuvers to try to not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>make that acceptable personally,</v>

481
00:29:57.521 --> 00:30:01.690
<v Speaker 1>but to proselytize about it to others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

482
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.520
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more,</v>

483
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say cynical maybe of what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>more cynical part of me sometimes thinks</v>

484
00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:11.050
<v Speaker 1>that the universities now these students</v>
<v Speaker 1>more harm than good,</v>

485
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.590
<v Speaker 1>especially on the humanities because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take students at a very formative</v>

486
00:30:14.591 --> 00:30:18.760
<v Speaker 1>period of their life when they're all in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their belief systems and their ability</v>

487
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:23.761
<v Speaker 1>to identify strongly with life are</v>
<v Speaker 1>already somebody questioned because they</v>

488
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:28.150
<v Speaker 1>exist in a culture that speak badly</v>
<v Speaker 1>fractured and they take those kids and</v>

489
00:30:28.151 --> 00:30:28.781
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

490
00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:33.781
<v Speaker 1>they expose them to ideas that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely destructive and it's not</v>

491
00:30:33.871 --> 00:30:35.860
<v Speaker 1>about having anything against ideas like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

492
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Reading Nicha for example is org or</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading dusty Yefsky.</v>

493
00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:44.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean that can be a very destructive</v>
<v Speaker 1>act but the purpose of each is writing</v>

494
00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.840
<v Speaker 1>and Dostoyevsky's writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not to destroy,</v>

495
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.090
<v Speaker 1>it's to remove detritus so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>something new can spring forth.</v>

496
00:30:52.091 --> 00:30:54.490
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't really see that happening</v>

497
00:30:54.491 --> 00:30:58.360
<v Speaker 1>in the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are too cynical and I</v>

498
00:30:58.361 --> 00:31:03.361
<v Speaker 1>think that there's also a strong streak</v>
<v Speaker 1>of serious anti humanity among moderate</v>

499
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:06.070
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals and that's been the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>for at least a hundred years.</v>

500
00:31:06.071 --> 00:31:07.490
<v Speaker 1>You hear people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

501
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.330
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this was a statement from the</v>

502
00:31:10.331 --> 00:31:12.500
<v Speaker 1>club of Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are so concerned about</v>

503
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:17.230
<v Speaker 1>population explosion back in the mid</v>
<v Speaker 1>1960s that the world would be better off</v>

504
00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:21.040
<v Speaker 1>if there were fewer people on it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that there were no people on it.</v>

505
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

506
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.490
<v Speaker 1>you can't say anything that's more</v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling than that.</v>

507
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you said the planet would be better</v>

508
00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:33.460
<v Speaker 1>off if there were fewer black people on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

509
00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no one's going to put up with that.</v>

510
00:31:35.321 --> 00:31:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Or the planet would be better off if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were fewer European colonizers on</v>

511
00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:40.690
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

512
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to get away with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more,</v>

513
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:44.710
<v Speaker 1>but probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as long as your</v>

514
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.600
<v Speaker 1>sentiments expand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extend to humanity as a whole,</v>

515
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:51.860
<v Speaker 1>it's perfectly reasonable for you to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

516
00:31:51.861 --> 00:31:54.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's the most horrific thing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could possibly say.</v>

517
00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids who go into high schools and</v>

518
00:31:58.031 --> 00:32:01.280
<v Speaker 1>shoot them up and call them body kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's certainly what they believe.</v>

519
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.600
<v Speaker 1>The planet would be a lot better off if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were fewer people on it.</v>

520
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we'll take a few steps in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

521
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:13.140
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Smith says,</v>

522
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.010
<v Speaker 1>nice jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you Paul.</v>

523
00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

524
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Can you explain each just general</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and some of his most famous</v>

525
00:32:28.741 --> 00:32:31.440
<v Speaker 1>ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really hard to comprehend.</v>

526
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Nature's general philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably can't do that.</v>

527
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I've been putting together with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>students here,</v>

528
00:32:42.101 --> 00:32:44.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been starting to plan a seminar on</v>

529
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:49.730
<v Speaker 1>existentialism and which would focus a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot on Nietzsche and Dostoevsky.</v>

530
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I think each just so damn complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't really do that.</v>

531
00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can explain niches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>General Philosophy.</v>

532
00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.660
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't really a systematizer.</v>

533
00:32:59.661 --> 00:33:00.830
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

534
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:01.933
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

535
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:06.200
<v Speaker 1>was skeptical of systematizer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to distill someone</v>

536
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:09.080
<v Speaker 1>who's not a systematizer into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

537
00:33:09.081 --> 00:33:12.500
<v Speaker 1>a few general principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is with,</v>

538
00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:14.900
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some of the greatest thinkers,</v>

539
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.090
<v Speaker 1>you actually have to read what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote.</v>

540
00:33:20.091 --> 00:33:22.550
<v Speaker 1>You have to read the original writings</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>

541
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:27.670
<v Speaker 1>the brilliance is encapsulated in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>original writings and they can't be</v>

542
00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:30.980
<v Speaker 1>condensed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

543
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:32.811
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

544
00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Can I do any better than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I explain each his general</v>

545
00:33:35.991 --> 00:33:38.240
<v Speaker 1>philosophy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truth serves life.</v>

546
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:41.270
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess we could unpack that a</v>

547
00:33:41.271 --> 00:33:42.104
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

548
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example of exactly what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>need you to.</v>

549
00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:51.560
<v Speaker 1>So staggeringly brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things he presumes when he</v>

550
00:33:51.561 --> 00:33:55.550
<v Speaker 1>makes a statement like that is that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being is in</v>

551
00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:01.680
<v Speaker 1>an existential situation that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by the necessity of</v>

552
00:34:01.681 --> 00:34:06.420
<v Speaker 1>determining what he or she will actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept as truth.</v>

553
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

554
00:34:08.041 --> 00:34:10.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth is something you can prove and</v>

555
00:34:10.891 --> 00:34:14.400
<v Speaker 1>that's how you know it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately it's not that simple</v>

556
00:34:14.401 --> 00:34:19.401
<v Speaker 1>because you have to decide what criteria</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to accept.</v>

557
00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.570
<v Speaker 1>There's proof and there's an act of</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith in that.</v>

558
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:28.690
<v Speaker 1>And there's an enabling were that</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument seems to be lacking.</v>

559
00:34:28.691 --> 00:34:33.691
<v Speaker 1>And this is the famous is ot conundrum</v>
<v Speaker 1>that David Hume described is,</v>

560
00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.000
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's say that you use science to</v>

561
00:34:37.001 --> 00:34:41.560
<v Speaker 1>lay out a very detailed description of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the objective world.</v>

562
00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that still doesn't mean that you know</v>

563
00:34:44.651 --> 00:34:48.130
<v Speaker 1>how to act in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem.</v>

564
00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:53.160
<v Speaker 1>It might be a fundamental problem if the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental problem of people isn't what</v>

565
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.630
<v Speaker 1>is the nature of the objective world</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought?</v>

566
00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.280
<v Speaker 1>How is it that you should conduct</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself while you're alive?</v>

567
00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neat you to believe that</v>

568
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.030
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental question was how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should conduct yourself while you're</v>

569
00:35:07.031 --> 00:35:08.290
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How should you act?</v>

570
00:35:08.291 --> 00:35:11.920
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental question of meaning and</v>

571
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.260
<v Speaker 1>science can inform you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can't really solve that problem</v>

572
00:35:17.261 --> 00:35:19.030
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a problem.</v>

573
00:35:19.031 --> 00:35:23.380
<v Speaker 1>And then science also has this other</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible attribute.</v>

574
00:35:23.381 --> 00:35:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that</v>

575
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:32.480
<v Speaker 1>because science can't solve the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how you should act in the world,</v>

576
00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:35.640
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

577
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.200
<v Speaker 1>impels people towards conclusion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no answer to the question,</v>

578
00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:45.201
<v Speaker 1>how should you act in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that way that opens up a door to</v>

579
00:35:46.251 --> 00:35:47.740
<v Speaker 1>nihilism and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

580
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.970
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's destructive.</v>

581
00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:53.610
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does not facilitate life.</v>

582
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:55.470
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has the opposite effect.</v>

583
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.550
<v Speaker 1>It takes the spirit of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes the motivation out of people,</v>

584
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:02.100
<v Speaker 1>it makes them bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes them resentful,</v>

585
00:36:02.101 --> 00:36:04.950
<v Speaker 1>it makes them hateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing.</v>

586
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Also niches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily concerned in some sense with</v>

587
00:36:09.571 --> 00:36:13.890
<v Speaker 1>how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of the reason that he</v>

588
00:36:13.891 --> 00:36:18.120
<v Speaker 1>decomposes Christianity to the degree</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he does this because he believed</v>

589
00:36:18.121 --> 00:36:21.390
<v Speaker 1>that Christianity</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a very,</v>

590
00:36:21.391 --> 00:36:23.700
<v Speaker 1>very serious attempt to answer the</v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

591
00:36:23.701 --> 00:36:27.420
<v Speaker 1>how should you act?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also believed that it had become</v>

592
00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:32.421
<v Speaker 1>fatally flawed for a variety of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in its typical societally</v>

593
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.840
<v Speaker 1>socially instantiated forms.</v>

594
00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.750
<v Speaker 1>So he took it upon himself to subject it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a criticism.</v>

595
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.040
<v Speaker 1>But I've always thought I've Nicha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible image,</v>

596
00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.980
<v Speaker 1>but I've always thought Nietzsche has</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a magnet in a wound.</v>

597
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:52.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like what he's doing is clearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>away dead and diseased tissues so that</v>

598
00:36:52.321 --> 00:36:56.400
<v Speaker 1>something else can live and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing to watch.</v>

599
00:36:56.401 --> 00:36:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible thing to apprehend and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

600
00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:02.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a terribly destructive thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>involve yourself in these niches.</v>

601
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.120
<v Speaker 1>He said he philosophize with the hammer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's certainly true,</v>

602
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.650
<v Speaker 1>but he was trying to clear the path for</v>
<v Speaker 1>something new and that that's something</v>

603
00:37:10.651 --> 00:37:13.170
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to formulate with his</v>

604
00:37:13.171 --> 00:37:15.570
<v Speaker 1>consumption such as like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

605
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:20.571
<v Speaker 1>the superman that the next version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings so to speak.</v>

606
00:37:20.971 --> 00:37:24.690
<v Speaker 1>And he thought of them as people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>would create their own values</v>

607
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:30.220
<v Speaker 1>and if that would be the way forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

608
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.720
<v Speaker 1>is the wreckage of Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

609
00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Nisha was wrong about that.</v>

610
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.850
<v Speaker 1>And I say that with all due respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

611
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.080
<v Speaker 1>and I say a cautiously and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an original idea of my own,</v>

612
00:37:42.081 --> 00:37:44.780
<v Speaker 1>that nature was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason that he was</v>

613
00:37:44.781 --> 00:37:47.360
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because people don't create value,</v>

614
00:37:47.361 --> 00:37:50.450
<v Speaker 1>say discover them or maybe they cocreate</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

615
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.960
<v Speaker 1>but you can't create values</v>
<v Speaker 1>by conjuring them out of nonexistence.</v>

616
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:02.660
<v Speaker 1>You could say if you were scientifically</v>
<v Speaker 1>minded,</v>

617
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.900
<v Speaker 1>that values are in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary.</v>

618
00:38:05.901 --> 00:38:08.120
<v Speaker 1>And then if you believe that values are</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary,</v>

619
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:10.520
<v Speaker 1>you might then believe that people could</v>
<v Speaker 1>create them.</v>

620
00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing but values aren't</v>

621
00:38:13.671 --> 00:38:16.910
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of the time people discover</v>

622
00:38:16.911 --> 00:38:20.000
<v Speaker 1>them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they cocreate the,</v>

623
00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:25.330
<v Speaker 1>and one of the reasons that I so have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been so attracted to use thinking is</v>

624
00:38:25.341 --> 00:38:27.350
<v Speaker 1>because young is in many ways a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nietzschean,</v>

625
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.920
<v Speaker 1>a student of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also a student of Freud,</v>

626
00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:35.940
<v Speaker 1>but more primarily a student of nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>and s lifelong endeavor</v>

627
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:41.610
<v Speaker 3>was to understand what the way forward</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be given the situation that needs</v>

628
00:38:43.791 --> 00:38:47.740
<v Speaker 3>you to describe and the situation that</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs you to described in some sense was</v>

629
00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:52.741
<v Speaker 3>that Christianity laid so much emphasis</v>
<v Speaker 3>on truth that it ended up undermining</v>

630
00:38:53.171 --> 00:38:58.171
<v Speaker 3>its own axiomatic presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then you thought following it</v>

631
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:01.120
<v Speaker 3>needs you well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

632
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:04.180
<v Speaker 3>in principle we have to create new</v>
<v Speaker 3>values.</v>

633
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:07.540
<v Speaker 3>But that that's partly why you even got</v>
<v Speaker 3>so interested in the unconscious because</v>

634
00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:11.440
<v Speaker 3>one of the things he found particular in</v>
<v Speaker 3>his analysis of the collective</v>

635
00:39:11.441 --> 00:39:16.360
<v Speaker 3>unconscious that was that the values</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Nietzsche thought people should</v>

636
00:39:16.361 --> 00:39:20.830
<v Speaker 3>create were actually lying dormant in</v>
<v Speaker 3>well in our imagination.</v>

637
00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:23.290
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of thinking about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's a good way of thinking</v>

638
00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:28.291
<v Speaker 3>about the collective unconscious and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was a return to the deepest that</v>

639
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.530
<v Speaker 3>the way forward in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>generation of new value was,</v>

640
00:39:32.531 --> 00:39:37.531
<v Speaker 3>was a return to the deepest recesses of</v>
<v Speaker 3>human existence and a rediscovery of</v>

641
00:39:38.591 --> 00:39:41.230
<v Speaker 3>what was actually there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I touched on that a little bit today</v>

642
00:39:41.231 --> 00:39:43.720
<v Speaker 3>when I was talking about the necessity</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sacrifice,</v>

643
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.540
<v Speaker 3>like there's an archetypal idea that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>savior,</v>

644
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:51.410
<v Speaker 3>the Messiah is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is by definition the person who was</v>

645
00:39:51.411 --> 00:39:55.610
<v Speaker 3>willing to sacrifice him or herself for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate good,</v>

646
00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.150
<v Speaker 3>whatever that happens to be and if</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the appropriate pathway forward.</v>

647
00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an art degree teak of</v>

648
00:40:02.311 --> 00:40:05.460
<v Speaker 3>Christianity and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that you almost right.</v>

649
00:40:05.461 --> 00:40:09.540
<v Speaker 3>I think he's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a terrible thing to say because I</v>

650
00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:12.160
<v Speaker 3>mean yoga is such a radical thinker that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

651
00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.013
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

652
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:17.940
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because yoga is subject to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of criticism.</v>

653
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read Richard [inaudible] book on</v>

654
00:40:20.131 --> 00:40:22.140
<v Speaker 3>Nisha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was called the area in Christ</v>

655
00:40:22.141 --> 00:40:26.310
<v Speaker 3>and nowell basically who I think was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very is or was,</v>

656
00:40:26.311 --> 00:40:28.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm very resentful person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

657
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.500
<v Speaker 3>I think he did a hatchet job on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

658
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:34.350
<v Speaker 3>he the cover of his book made Yo look</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was a Nazi.</v>

659
00:40:34.351 --> 00:40:38.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean how cheap cheap shot that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

660
00:40:38.161 --> 00:40:43.161
<v Speaker 3>he accused yoga basically fomenting a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cult and I read no book and it just made</v>

661
00:40:44.011 --> 00:40:49.011
<v Speaker 3>me laugh because what you was actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>up to is so much worse so to speak.</v>

662
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.720
<v Speaker 3>Then merely starting a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like accusing and ax murder of,</v>

663
00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.040
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>

664
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.633
<v Speaker 2>of what</v>

665
00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:02.640
<v Speaker 3>annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>annoying his pet cat.</v>

666
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that the differences that</v>

667
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:07.710
<v Speaker 3>extensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sorts of things that Ewan was</v>

668
00:41:07.711 --> 00:41:12.711
<v Speaker 3>actually messing around with are so</v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated and terrible compared to</v>

669
00:41:12.901 --> 00:41:15.120
<v Speaker 3>just building a little cult that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

670
00:41:15.121 --> 00:41:18.120
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely clear that Noah had no</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea what he was talking about.</v>

671
00:41:18.121 --> 00:41:22.170
<v Speaker 3>He only said it like nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Dostoevsky is that terrifying</v>

672
00:41:22.171 --> 00:41:24.410
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think part of the reason that you</v>

673
00:41:24.411 --> 00:41:27.870
<v Speaker 3>don't use not well regarded in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>academy and also my Christianity is</v>

674
00:41:27.871 --> 00:41:32.871
<v Speaker 3>subject to such continual rationalist</v>
<v Speaker 3>and criticism is because people open up</v>

675
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:39.170
<v Speaker 3>and take one look at what he's doing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>either just don't get it at all or they</v>

676
00:41:39.171 --> 00:41:40.970
<v Speaker 3>get a little bit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It scares them so badly.</v>

677
00:41:40.971 --> 00:41:43.860
<v Speaker 3>They think there's no damn way I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and,</v>

678
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:46.280
<v Speaker 3>and I can really understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

679
00:41:46.281 --> 00:41:49.940
<v Speaker 3>I think anybody with any sense would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

680
00:41:49.941 --> 00:41:53.610
<v Speaker 3>very careful about trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 3>what Dean was talking about.</v>

681
00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:58.611
<v Speaker 3>It</v>
<v Speaker 3>is cognitive behavioral,</v>

682
00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:04.923
<v Speaker 3>a sorry here</v>

683
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 3>I missed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry about that.</v>

684
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.900
<v Speaker 3>It's a good idea to believe in</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

685
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.810
<v Speaker 3>Healthy delusions like Karma or life</v>
<v Speaker 3>after death.</v>

686
00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:22.010
<v Speaker 3>That's Danny Wall socket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there is a whole line of social</v>

687
00:42:22.011 --> 00:42:24.680
<v Speaker 3>psychology that was very popular about</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 years ago.</v>

688
00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:27.170
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most cited social psychological</v>

689
00:42:27.171 --> 00:42:30.620
<v Speaker 3>paper ever written was about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessity of positive illusions.</v>

690
00:42:30.621 --> 00:42:33.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the basic hypothesis was life was so</v>

691
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.310
<v Speaker 3>tragic and dismal that unless you</v>
<v Speaker 3>bolstered yourself against it with,</v>

692
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:41.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>defensible optimists and I suppose if</v>

693
00:42:41.631 --> 00:42:45.860
<v Speaker 3>you were being charitable or just</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive illusions lies is what I think</v>

694
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:48.770
<v Speaker 3>are that life would actually be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerable.</v>

695
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 3>nihilistic and vicious philosophy.</v>

696
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:58.550
<v Speaker 3>I think the fact that that was actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously put forward by,</v>

697
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:04.750
<v Speaker 3>by a generation of social psychologists</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a medication for the modern disease</v>

698
00:43:05.301 --> 00:43:08.540
<v Speaker 3>of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is an absolute indictment of the</v>

699
00:43:08.541 --> 00:43:10.430
<v Speaker 3>entire field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

700
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.040
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing about illusions that are</v>

701
00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:16.130
<v Speaker 3>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that cynicism and</v>

702
00:43:16.131 --> 00:43:20.450
<v Speaker 3>despair are forms of truth or that</v>
<v Speaker 3>nihilism is a form of truth.</v>

703
00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:24.590
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing as healthy</v>
<v Speaker 3>delusions.</v>

704
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.863
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

705
00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.970
<v Speaker 3>any wall song consent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like Karma.</v>

706
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know Karma is a healthy</v>

707
00:43:34.901 --> 00:43:36.850
<v Speaker 3>delusion and I'm not so sure about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

708
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:42.160
<v Speaker 3>mean there's some elements of Karma that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think are extremely interesting from a</v>

709
00:43:42.161 --> 00:43:45.460
<v Speaker 3>psychological perspective and we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>scrap the incarnation element of it</v>

710
00:43:45.461 --> 00:43:49.150
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well for obviously at least for the sake</v>

711
00:43:49.151 --> 00:43:51.310
<v Speaker 3>of simplicity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I believe in Karma.</v>

712
00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.850
<v Speaker 3>I think that no one gets away with</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything ever.</v>

713
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:59.910
<v Speaker 3>I think every single thing you do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the moral cause in the moral thing is</v>

714
00:44:00.731 --> 00:44:02.740
<v Speaker 3>an attempt to work the structure of</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

715
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Everything you do that's immoral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes back to haunt you.</v>

716
00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:10.060
<v Speaker 3>And it generally comes back in multiply</v>
<v Speaker 3>form.</v>

717
00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.730
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't mean you'll be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive the costs of connections.</v>

718
00:44:12.731 --> 00:44:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Like you might've done something immoral</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows five years ago and that</v>

719
00:44:16.841 --> 00:44:21.430
<v Speaker 3>produced like a crack in the structure</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your being and like it's five years</v>

720
00:44:21.431 --> 00:44:23.800
<v Speaker 3>later and all sorts of things are</v>
<v Speaker 3>falling into that crack.</v>

721
00:44:23.801 --> 00:44:28.510
<v Speaker 3>And you have no idea that that initial</v>
<v Speaker 3>act was what produced this know</v>

722
00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:32.640
<v Speaker 3>cascading consequences events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean it didn't.</v>

723
00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:34.853
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

724
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:39.480
<v Speaker 3>what did [inaudible] mean by revolt in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the myth of Sisyphus?</v>

725
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:43.710
<v Speaker 3>What are some ways to revolt without</v>
<v Speaker 3>being destructive or should one simply</v>

726
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:45.490
<v Speaker 3>be a good app?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

727
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 3>Well that's 19 k Mitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the first thing I should say,</v>

728
00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:52.290
<v Speaker 3>how bad is it not those so simple to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good aunt.</v>

729
00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.490
<v Speaker 3>Like I think being a good aunt is better</v>
<v Speaker 3>than just being a chaotic.</v>

730
00:44:56.491 --> 00:44:58.000
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and useless aunt.</v>

731
00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:02.040
<v Speaker 3>And so you should probably go from</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaotic and useless and two good.</v>

732
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:06.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's a process of maturation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens when you're,</v>

733
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you move from being a child to an</v>

734
00:45:08.041 --> 00:45:09.450
<v Speaker 3>adolescent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a young adult.</v>

735
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:14.960
<v Speaker 3>You adopt the strictures and</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibilities of your culture to</v>

736
00:45:15.571 --> 00:45:17.730
<v Speaker 3>discipline yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

737
00:45:17.731 --> 00:45:20.880
<v Speaker 3>if you stop at the point where you're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good aunt,</v>

738
00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 3>while then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

739
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.290
<v Speaker 3>that's not so good then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're,</v>

740
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:30.530
<v Speaker 3>you're an Avatar of the pathologies of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your culture as well as an Avatar of the</v>

741
00:45:30.931 --> 00:45:32.250
<v Speaker 3>virtues of your culture.</v>

742
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.260
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

743
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:37.150
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fighting against mirror</v>

744
00:45:37.151 --> 00:45:38.920
<v Speaker 3>enculturation is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

745
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:41.160
<v Speaker 3>that's not virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's failure.</v>

746
00:45:41.161 --> 00:45:43.620
<v Speaker 3>That's just failure to mature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

747
00:45:43.621 --> 00:45:46.410
<v Speaker 3>that was actually one of Nietzsche's</v>
<v Speaker 3>questions of conscience.</v>

748
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you leading or are you just running</v>

749
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:52.290
<v Speaker 3>away?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

750
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.720
<v Speaker 3>the answer that almost always is he</v>
<v Speaker 3>running away.</v>

751
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 3>You might think you're leading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the probability that you're leaving,</v>

752
00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:00.420
<v Speaker 3>especially if you haven't seriously</v>
<v Speaker 3>considered the possibility that you're</v>

753
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:02.160
<v Speaker 3>running away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like really?</v>

754
00:46:02.161 --> 00:46:04.290
<v Speaker 3>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the chances if you,</v>

755
00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:06.960
<v Speaker 3>if you really think about us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that easy lead and it's pretty easy</v>

756
00:46:06.961 --> 00:46:09.510
<v Speaker 3>to run away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're not doing what other people</v>

757
00:46:09.511 --> 00:46:12.000
<v Speaker 3>are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably running away.</v>

758
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.800
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's pretty rough.</v>

759
00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:15.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

760
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.320
<v Speaker 3>if you've got some absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unique destiny that you have to</v>

761
00:46:19.321 --> 00:46:20.850
<v Speaker 3>manifest more power to you.</v>

762
00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

763
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:31.070
<v Speaker 3>most of the time what I see are people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who think they have a unique destiny and</v>

764
00:46:31.071 --> 00:46:34.610
<v Speaker 3>really what they're doing is wandering</v>
<v Speaker 3>off the beat batch into some thorn</v>

765
00:46:34.611 --> 00:46:37.160
<v Speaker 3>written ditch where things are not going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be good for them.</v>

766
00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.013
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

767
00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.500
<v Speaker 3>what are some ways to revolt without</v>
<v Speaker 3>being distracted?</v>

768
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Revolt against what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be the question.</v>

769
00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:50.123
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very,</v>

770
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:53.130
<v Speaker 3>you could try revolting against your</v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of discipline.</v>

771
00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:55.410
<v Speaker 3>Like that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a war.</v>

772
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:56.900
<v Speaker 3>That's a war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want a war,</v>

773
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:59.520
<v Speaker 3>maybe you do because people need war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

774
00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:04.500
<v Speaker 3>I think it was William James who said</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people need a moral equivalent to</v>

775
00:47:04.501 --> 00:47:06.210
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what [inaudible] was</v>

776
00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:07.530
<v Speaker 3>trying to discover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

777
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.490
<v Speaker 3>the moral equivalent to war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think he did discover it as well.</v>

778
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:14.490
<v Speaker 3>And that's tied up with the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice.</v>

779
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.090
<v Speaker 3>If you want to revoke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should revolt against your own</v>

780
00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:24.690
<v Speaker 3>pathology and inadequacy and uselessness</v>
<v Speaker 3>and resentment and cruelty and blindness</v>

781
00:47:26.291 --> 00:47:28.930
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could have a war against,</v>

782
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:32.470
<v Speaker 3>you could revolt against that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That gives you something to do.</v>

783
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.820
<v Speaker 3>Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Professor Mra,</v>

784
00:47:36.821 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 3>people are often quite smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did they have this strong tendency</v>

785
00:47:39.881 --> 00:47:41.320
<v Speaker 3>towards atheism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

786
00:47:41.321 --> 00:47:42.430
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know people who are,</v>

787
00:47:42.431 --> 00:47:44.910
<v Speaker 3>have smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good atheistic right away because you</v>

788
00:47:44.911 --> 00:47:46.960
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's obvious who really believe in God.</v>

789
00:47:46.961 --> 00:47:49.730
<v Speaker 3>You believe in an old man and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you already think the world's least</v>

790
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:51.430
<v Speaker 3>7,000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

791
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:54.160
<v Speaker 3>do you really believe Christ turned wine</v>
<v Speaker 3>into water?</v>

792
00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one who wasn't foolish would believe</v>

793
00:47:57.281 --> 00:47:59.050
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While that's the statement of someone</v>

794
00:47:59.051 --> 00:47:59.884
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>

795
00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:07.760
<v Speaker 3>I guess who's smart enough to start to</v>
<v Speaker 3>notice something about what people</v>

796
00:48:07.761 --> 00:48:09.350
<v Speaker 3>believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

797
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.680
<v Speaker 3>they're 10 steps along out 50,000 mile</v>
<v Speaker 3>journey.</v>

798
00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.980
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the other thing,</v>

799
00:48:15.981 --> 00:48:20.930
<v Speaker 3>I already mentioned this about atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like to think that the reason</v>

800
00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:23.810
<v Speaker 3>their atheistic is because they're clear</v>
<v Speaker 3>headed and rational.</v>

801
00:48:23.811 --> 00:48:24.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well first of all,</v>

802
00:48:24.891 --> 00:48:26.090
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably they're not.</v>

803
00:48:26.091 --> 00:48:28.850
<v Speaker 3>Because how often do you meet someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's clear headed and rational?</v>

804
00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Like being psychoanalytically minded?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always way more likely to look for</v>

805
00:48:33.441 --> 00:48:36.680
<v Speaker 3>the dark reason that someone is doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>something rather than the light reason.</v>

806
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:38.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that's moving them towards</v>

807
00:48:38.451 --> 00:48:40.610
<v Speaker 3>the light because it's hard to move</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards the light.</v>

808
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:43.820
<v Speaker 3>And so I would say most of the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are atheistic.</v>

809
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of,</v>

810
00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:51.170
<v Speaker 3>it's fashionable in some silicon said</v>
<v Speaker 3>fashion way to Vr to revolt if you're</v>

811
00:48:51.171 --> 00:48:54.020
<v Speaker 3>rational and if you're kind of an</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual.</v>

812
00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:57.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also you can just dispense with</v>

813
00:48:57.051 --> 00:49:00.560
<v Speaker 3>responsibility if you're atheistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's 90% of the reason</v>

814
00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:02.840
<v Speaker 3>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the modern world,</v>

815
00:49:02.841 --> 00:49:06.590
<v Speaker 3>that's why people are proponents of</v>
<v Speaker 3>atheism.</v>

816
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they have some particular hatred for</v>

817
00:49:08.841 --> 00:49:11.390
<v Speaker 3>the church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Richard Dawkins has a particular</v>

818
00:49:11.391 --> 00:49:13.070
<v Speaker 3>hatred for the church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

819
00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.090
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

820
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:18.230
<v Speaker 3>I've thought about this many times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would swear that something happened to</v>

821
00:49:18.231 --> 00:49:22.130
<v Speaker 3>him when he was a kid that wasn't good</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that the church was involved because</v>

822
00:49:22.131 --> 00:49:24.380
<v Speaker 3>he has such an animus against the</v>
<v Speaker 3>church.</v>

823
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:27.090
<v Speaker 3>It's that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it,</v>

824
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:28.640
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it possesses him.</v>

825
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:32.950
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

826
00:49:32.951 --> 00:49:34.030
<v Speaker 3>so let's see here.</v>

827
00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:40.580
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you explain why the conventional</v>

828
00:49:40.581 --> 00:49:43.630
<v Speaker 3>wisdom about each and people are so at</v>
<v Speaker 3>odds with your ideas about each of</v>

829
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:44.450
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

830
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:45.261
<v Speaker 3>that's Harold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

831
00:49:45.261 --> 00:49:48.620
<v Speaker 3>I can explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People like to think they're smart and</v>

832
00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:50.720
<v Speaker 3>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the easiest way to think you're</v>

833
00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:53.150
<v Speaker 3>smart in many ways is to think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people aren't.</v>

834
00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:54.860
<v Speaker 3>And so we think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

835
00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:57.860
<v Speaker 3>the people who came before us all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of centuries,</v>

836
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:59.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just didn't know what we knew.</v>

837
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:03.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are cultures didn't have the same</v>

838
00:50:03.441 --> 00:50:07.400
<v Speaker 3>degree of staggering technological</v>
<v Speaker 3>capacity that our skin,</v>

839
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:09.230
<v Speaker 3>but that didn't mean that they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>

840
00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:12.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean you throw the average person back</v>
<v Speaker 3>into ancient Athens,</v>

841
00:50:12.621 --> 00:50:17.621
<v Speaker 3>they're not gonna last very long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's lack of respect.</v>

842
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:20.960
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a definite hallmark of water</v>

843
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.930
<v Speaker 3>culture is that you can hardly even</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell.</v>

844
00:50:23.931 --> 00:50:25.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can hardly even say,</v>

845
00:50:25.161 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 3>well being respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like you're from 19</v>

846
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:29.870
<v Speaker 1>be respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

847
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.220
<v Speaker 1>if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to be nihilistic,</v>

848
00:50:36.221 --> 00:50:37.900
<v Speaker 1>you better be respectful because</v>

849
00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.233
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

850
00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:43.540
<v Speaker 1>being nihilistic and having respect for</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing are exactly the same thing.</v>

851
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:50.240
<v Speaker 1>So you could start by having some</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect for your ancestors and try and</v>

852
00:50:50.241 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 1>figure out what the hell they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

853
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:54.950
<v Speaker 1>He read the Old Testament for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very weird book.</v>

854
00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:56.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

855
00:50:56.001 --> 00:50:57.410
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very weird book.</v>

856
00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people and it did.</v>

857
00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:04.960
<v Speaker 1>It got sequenced together and turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this volume for,</v>

858
00:51:04.961 --> 00:51:07.220
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that we just can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

859
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:11.720
<v Speaker 1>It's our collective work of the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination and people read it.</v>

860
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:14.240
<v Speaker 1>So simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a simple minded way.</v>

861
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.420
<v Speaker 1>They read it like fundamentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like simple minded.</v>

862
00:51:17.421 --> 00:51:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentalist Protestants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about science.</v>

863
00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamentalist Protestants think the</v>

864
00:51:23.601 --> 00:51:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Bible is literally true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science is literally true.</v>

865
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Doris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible is science.</v>

866
00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

867
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:34.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who wrote the Bible word</v>

868
00:51:34.821 --> 00:51:36.470
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not how it works.</v>

869
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:37.400
<v Speaker 1>But then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

870
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the modern critics of religious</v>

871
00:51:40.851 --> 00:51:42.470
<v Speaker 1>thinking of traditional religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

872
00:51:42.471 --> 00:51:43.610
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the same.</v>

873
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.040
<v Speaker 1>They do the same thing except backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

874
00:51:46.041 --> 00:51:46.371
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

875
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:47.930
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion was science.</v>

876
00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:50.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just bad sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

877
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:51.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have pay any attention to it.</v>

878
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not science,</v>

879
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:57.050
<v Speaker 1>it's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ethics,</v>

880
00:51:57.051 --> 00:51:58.730
<v Speaker 1>it's morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's drama,</v>

881
00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:04.090
<v Speaker 1>it's all of that and dramas about how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>live and religious drama is,</v>

882
00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:09.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a definitional issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing deeper than religious</v>

883
00:52:09.441 --> 00:52:13.040
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that depth</v>

884
00:52:13.041 --> 00:52:17.690
<v Speaker 1>defines what's religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I know this firsthand hardly</v>

885
00:52:17.691 --> 00:52:21.230
<v Speaker 1>because in my clinical practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I often see people who are in</v>

886
00:52:21.231 --> 00:52:22.250
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

887
00:52:22.251 --> 00:52:26.840
<v Speaker 1>terrible trouble and often that trouble</v>
<v Speaker 1>is ethical and if the trouble they're in</v>

888
00:52:26.841 --> 00:52:28.910
<v Speaker 1>is bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no other language to</v>

889
00:52:28.911 --> 00:52:32.600
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't religious because the religious</v>

890
00:52:32.601 --> 00:52:35.810
<v Speaker 1>language comes into its own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're dealing with problems.</v>

891
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Normally we have life and death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but literally of Heaven and Hell and you</v>

892
00:52:39.861 --> 00:52:41.060
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern people think,</v>

893
00:52:41.061 --> 00:52:43.880
<v Speaker 1>well there's no such thing as heaven and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as hell.</v>

894
00:52:43.881 --> 00:52:45.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay fine,</v>

895
00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.110
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's accept that.</v>

896
00:52:48.111 --> 00:52:50.450
<v Speaker 1>But if you think there's no such thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>as hell,</v>

897
00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:55.590
<v Speaker 1>like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see how someone who's educated</v>

898
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:01.800
<v Speaker 1>would ever dare to make that claim.</v>

899
00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:04.043
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

900
00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:07.230
<v Speaker 1>after everything that happened to us in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century,</v>

901
00:53:07.231 --> 00:53:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I can't see that someone could ever say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's no such thing as hell</v>

902
00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:15.060
<v Speaker 1>without being terrified that a bolt of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightning would obliterate them on the</v>

903
00:53:15.061 --> 00:53:15.894
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

904
00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.930
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell is real.</v>

905
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:22.290
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to talk about use</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious language and if you want to</v>

906
00:53:22.291 --> 00:53:26.640
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get away from hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you use religious language.</v>

907
00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's what religious language is</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

908
00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:32.310
<v Speaker 1>So you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

909
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.530
<v Speaker 1>that's actually understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I would say if,</v>

910
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.010
<v Speaker 1>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to learn about this,</v>

911
00:53:38.011 --> 00:53:39.870
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can read nature,</v>

912
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:42.570
<v Speaker 1>you can read Dostoyevsky you can read</v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

913
00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can read young student,</v>

914
00:53:45.961 --> 00:53:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Eric Normand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Norman was a genius.</v>

915
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Like I wanted this information is there</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for people to,</v>

916
00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.870
<v Speaker 1>to begin to understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard slog again.</v>

917
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:59.550
<v Speaker 1>And part of the problem is is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to hell way before you get to have,</v>

918
00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:05.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things youngest sometimes</v>

919
00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:09.760
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as a new age thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's absurd.</v>

920
00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

921
00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.670
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the platelet observe,</v>

922
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:20.400
<v Speaker 1>one of his fundamental propositions is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you follow a meaningful and</v>

923
00:54:20.401 --> 00:54:24.930
<v Speaker 1>truthful path that will take you to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst place you can imagine.</v>

924
00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:29.880
<v Speaker 1>And then possibly having gone there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the journey uphill,</v>

925
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:32.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the light can begin in earnest.</v>

926
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.093
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

927
00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.080
<v Speaker 1>who wants that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

928
00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:44.520
<v Speaker 1>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they have any sense,</v>

929
00:54:44.521 --> 00:54:47.160
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young also made another statement which,</v>

930
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:49.830
<v Speaker 1>which really taught me to the bone when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I first understood it,</v>

931
00:54:49.831 --> 00:54:50.664
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

932
00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:54.810
<v Speaker 1>anything you don't thoroughly</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

933
00:54:54.811 --> 00:54:56.910
<v Speaker 1>you act out in the world as fate.</v>

934
00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:02.950
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the lessons I took away from that</v>

935
00:55:02.951 --> 00:55:03.590
<v Speaker 1>is then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

936
00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:06.100
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want hell to manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in the world,</v>

937
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:09.220
<v Speaker 1>then you better understand your role in</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing it.</v>

938
00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:13.330
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's actually the</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary religious injunction.</v>

939
00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:18.880
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say that that's a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason why belief systems</v>

940
00:55:18.881 --> 00:55:21.580
<v Speaker 1>such as Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking mostly about Christianity</v>

941
00:55:21.581 --> 00:55:23.290
<v Speaker 1>because that's what I'm most familiar</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

942
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.030
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also because it's,</v>

943
00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:29.860
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely out the fin on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation of Western civilization</v>

944
00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.140
<v Speaker 1>actually quite a fan of Western</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

945
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental moral injunction is in</v>

946
00:55:36.851 --> 00:55:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Christianity or one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're all tangled together,</v>

947
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I guess to some degree it's like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to constrain hell within yourself.</v>

948
00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's no joke man.</v>

949
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:50.003
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

950
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:52.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of what,</v>

951
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:55.890
<v Speaker 1>another thing I learned from Yoga and</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Nietzsche was that if you,</v>

952
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.810
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the sorts of things that</v>

953
00:55:57.811 --> 00:55:59.320
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying now she Germany or,</v>

954
00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.130
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in the Soviet Union or in Mao's China</v>

955
00:56:02.131 --> 00:56:06.390
<v Speaker 1>or that are still happening around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world where they're systematic torture</v>

956
00:56:06.391 --> 00:56:08.820
<v Speaker 1>and persecution of millions and millions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>

957
00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.970
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the entire state was devoted</v>

958
00:56:11.971 --> 00:56:16.020
<v Speaker 1>towards making things as bad as they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly be and then making them even</v>

959
00:56:16.021 --> 00:56:20.820
<v Speaker 1>worse after that is that people played a</v>
<v Speaker 1>role in that and they were people like</v>

960
00:56:20.821 --> 00:56:23.380
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that people like you play</v>

961
00:56:23.381 --> 00:56:27.400
<v Speaker 1>a role in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question is what's your</v>

962
00:56:27.401 --> 00:56:29.830
<v Speaker 1>role and is that the game that you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be playing?</v>

963
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a serious question because it is</v>

964
00:56:33.851 --> 00:56:36.460
<v Speaker 1>people like you who were responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

965
00:56:36.461 --> 00:56:41.461
<v Speaker 1>And it means that to the degree that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a person and you don't want that</v>

966
00:56:42.551 --> 00:56:45.850
<v Speaker 1>to happen anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to sort that out within</v>

967
00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:46.980
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can,</v>

968
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I can explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll close with this another</v>

969
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.270
<v Speaker 1>deeply religious idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another idea.</v>

970
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:58.800
<v Speaker 1>This is an archetypal idea about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>image of the savior,</v>

971
00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:03.820
<v Speaker 1>the Messiah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Messiah is the person who takes the</v>

972
00:57:04.541 --> 00:57:09.541
<v Speaker 1>sins of the world onto himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a classic archetypal idea.</v>

973
00:57:10.231 --> 00:57:11.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like what does that mean?</v>

974
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:20.670
<v Speaker 1>It means that you look for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations that drove Hitler in</v>

975
00:57:20.671 --> 00:57:25.671
<v Speaker 1>yourself because they were there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what it means to take the</v>

976
00:57:26.011 --> 00:57:31.011
<v Speaker 1>sins of the world onto yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that you have to view yourself</v>

977
00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:36.350
<v Speaker 1>as the perpetrator of archetypical evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

978
00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.590
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you said for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

979
00:57:39.591 --> 00:57:41.910
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take a small moral failing that a</v>

980
00:57:41.911 --> 00:57:46.170
<v Speaker 1>person manifests and you dig into that</v>

981
00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:51.460
<v Speaker 1>as deeply as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up in the center of health,</v>

982
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.720
<v Speaker 1>like the roots of that unethical</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior go all the way down to the,</v>

983
00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.520
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the archetype and in my experience,</v>

984
00:57:59.521 --> 00:58:00.600
<v Speaker 1>docs being true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

985
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.530
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people want to have</v>

986
00:58:02.531 --> 00:58:06.290
<v Speaker 1>conversations about this sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you see it happening in,</v>

987
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.380
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in intimate relationships all the time</v>

988
00:58:08.381 --> 00:58:11.140
<v Speaker 1>where there are things that the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were involved in the</v>

989
00:58:11.141 --> 00:58:15.220
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just not talk about why it's cause</v>

990
00:58:15.221 --> 00:58:18.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where is it that they don't want to</v>

991
00:58:18.431 --> 00:58:20.500
<v Speaker 1>go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to get to the bottom of</v>

992
00:58:20.501 --> 00:58:21.820
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

993
00:58:21.821 --> 00:58:26.650
<v Speaker 1>no wonder because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an archetypal idea to hell is a</v>

994
00:58:26.651 --> 00:58:29.020
<v Speaker 1>pit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's at the bottom of things.</v>

995
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:29.741
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

996
00:58:29.741 --> 00:58:31.900
<v Speaker 1>that is where it is and you have to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

997
00:58:31.901 --> 00:58:35.740
<v Speaker 1>If you want a straight things out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like who the hell wants to do that?</v>

998
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is that it plays itself</v>

999
00:58:37.961 --> 00:58:42.961
<v Speaker 1>out in the world and we've seen that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't look like a good idea to</v>

1000
00:58:43.151 --> 00:58:43.984
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1001
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we should probably end there</v>

1002
00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:53.040
<v Speaker 1>because I'm getting fuzzy minded then</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1003
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:57.250
<v Speaker 1>That's always a good time to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thank you very much for tuning in and</v>

1004
00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:02.030
<v Speaker 1>if this seems to have been successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of had a slow start as far as I was</v>

1005
00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:04.150
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of muddled headed to begin</v>

1006
00:59:04.151 --> 00:59:05.290
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1007
00:59:05.291 --> 00:59:07.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1008
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:11.650
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll edit all that out anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about doing this on a</v>

1009
00:59:11.651 --> 00:59:12.790
<v Speaker 1>regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1010
00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:14.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me know what you think and,</v>

1011
00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:15.130
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1012
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:17.320
<v Speaker 1>we'll see how many people watch it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see what happens.</v>

1013
00:59:17.321 --> 00:59:20.820
<v Speaker 1>And thanks to all my Iras because I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned some research assistants here</v>

1014
00:59:20.821 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 1>who already helping me out with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a,</v>

1015
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:26.240
<v Speaker 1>mastering the technology and figuring</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what to do with youtube.</v>

1016
00:59:26.241 --> 00:59:29.060
<v Speaker 1>So thank you very much for tuning in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1017
00:59:29.061 --> 00:59:30.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully I'll see you again.</v>

1018
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Ciao.</v>
