<v Speaker 1>Thank you for coming on and tiering </v>

18
00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:46.341
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

19
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:47.174
<v Speaker 1>is it safe to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it fair to say that you are </v>

20
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:50.420
<v Speaker 1>considered a rock star now?</v>

21
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my youtube channel seems to be,</v>

22
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.180
<v Speaker 2>have become very popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

23
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.910
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

24
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean I hate to use that </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterization,</v>

25
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:03.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

26
00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:04.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

27
00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:08.450
<v Speaker 2>there's been an explosion of media </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest and then public interest in the</v>

28
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:09.284
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things that not only the sorts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things that I've been dealing with </v>

29
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.800
<v Speaker 2>say sort of philosophically and </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically,</v>

30
00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:15.634
<v Speaker 2>but also in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the lectures that I'm putting up for </v>

31
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:19.630
<v Speaker 2>people on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube,</v>

32
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.480
<v Speaker 2>which I'd been doing for about about </v>
<v Speaker 2>four years now.</v>

33
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.100
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's the combination of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stance that I took on,</v>

34
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.113
<v Speaker 2>on compelled speech and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on political correctness in general </v>

35
00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:32.194
<v Speaker 2>and also the content that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>provided with the people that they come </v>

36
00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 2>to the channel for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the political controversy,</v>

37
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:40.510
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they seem to stay for the content.</v>

38
00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:42.160
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>

39
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 2>it's remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

40
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to make of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

41
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.653
<v Speaker 2>it's remarkable.</v>

42
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like it.</v>

43
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>There's been like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shift of people wanting to,</v>

44
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to hear stuff like this.</v>

45
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:54.944
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really excited to hear like a </v>

46
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:58.990
<v Speaker 1>position of free speech when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

47
00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:01.970
<v Speaker 1>when a lot of people actually have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of railing against it.</v>

48
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting the type,</v>

49
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.723
<v Speaker 1>the Times that we're in because </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately it's coming from a lot of </v>

50
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 1>people on the far left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like this a Torah,</v>

51
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>a authoritarian left type of movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a foot.</v>

52
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.003
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people kind of a recognized you </v>

53
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:22.250
<v Speaker 1>from because they saw a protest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.980
<v Speaker 1>that was going on at your university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:27.050
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was about a bill see 16.</v>

56
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

57
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.441
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Well cause I made a video that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that where I,</v>

59
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.663
<v Speaker 2>I expressed my opposition to the go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Canadian government's attempts to </v>

60
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:42.361
<v Speaker 2>make certain kinds of speech mandatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also our to oppose the University of</v>

61
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Toronto Human Resources Departments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempts to impose,</v>

62
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I regard as inappropriate and,</v>

63
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 2>and likely harmful so-called unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti bias retraining on the,</v>

64
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.870
<v Speaker 2>of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

65
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.803
<v Speaker 2>human resources employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a very dangerous </v>

66
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 2>incursion into the civil rights of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

67
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 2>of their staff as well as being based on</v>
<v Speaker 2>very poor science in my estimation.</v>

68
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

69
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

70
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:14.764
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a protest as a consequence of </v>

71
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:17.734
<v Speaker 2>that and that got a lot of attention on </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube and that was one of the things </v>

72
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 2>that drew a lot of attention to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>

73
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.893
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

74
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.121
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

75
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how I found you.</v>

76
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.073
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually did a video on it and I saw </v>

77
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:31.680
<v Speaker 1>that you tweeted it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was actually like,</v>

78
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

79
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.240
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seen it.</v>

80
00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:34.260
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel,</v>

81
00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I feel strange because I'm like the type</v>
<v Speaker 1>of content I make.</v>

82
00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:41.280
<v Speaker 1>I try to be a very lighthearted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to have people,</v>

83
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:42.114
<v Speaker 1>I try to be a crack a lot of jokes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have people at least have some fun </v>

84
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:49.170
<v Speaker 1>through through the madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I was also like seeing that,</v>

85
00:03:49.171 --> 00:03:49.621
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

86
00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:50.454
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what he thinks because I don't </v>

87
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:53.270
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

88
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I got a real kick out of your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of your coverage.</v>

89
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:56.683
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny because some of the best </v>

90
00:03:58.491 --> 00:03:59.324
<v Speaker 2>conversations that I've had with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube so far have been with people </v>

91
00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:02.864
<v Speaker 2>who have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

92
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.420
<v Speaker 2>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have a background in comedy,</v>

93
00:04:05.421 --> 00:04:06.254
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's partly because people </v>

94
00:04:08.121 --> 00:04:08.954
<v Speaker 2>who have a good sense of humor and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a comical take on things are also </v>

95
00:04:11.811 --> 00:04:12.644
<v Speaker 2>likely to tell the truth because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost nothing funnier than telling the </v>

96
00:04:15.471 --> 00:04:16.011
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

97
00:04:16.011 --> 00:04:18.470
<v Speaker 2>If you say things that other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>think but won't say,</v>

98
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.760
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that often makes it very funny.</v>

99
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.900
<v Speaker 2>And I thought you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

100
00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:26.660
<v Speaker 2>I think your general very comical and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wedding so</v>

101
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.580
<v Speaker 1>well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

102
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>that I appreciate that a lot because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

103
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.111
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing,</v>

105
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.850
<v Speaker 1>hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

106
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'm like doubting myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

107
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I,</v>

108
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>should I try to be more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause,</v>

109
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.583
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

110
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of,</v>

111
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I guess I've been shoved in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>this community called this skeptic </v>
<v Speaker 1>community on Youtube.</v>

113
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

114
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

115
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I do try to be skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

116
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:49.414
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to be more just on the comedic </v>

117
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:51.304
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about being more serious </v>

118
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>and try to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say more respected,</v>

119
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I guess in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

120
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.130
<v Speaker 1>in the community that I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I kind of want to just,</v>

121
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.481
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

122
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:01.721
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

123
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

124
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 1>there's enough people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're,</v>

125
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch,</v>

126
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:05.914
<v Speaker 1>say if there's any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any youtubers and taking in particular </v>

127
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>that you watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've,</v>

128
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:10.144
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen say anyone like Sargon of a cod or </v>

129
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>armored skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

131
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.333
<v Speaker 1>have you had any</v>

132
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be on star gone show and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

133
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.100
<v Speaker 2>in the relatively near future</v>

134
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I suspected that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

135
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 1>especially he just did a video about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it,</v>

136
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.121
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

137
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:25.954
<v Speaker 1>And that was actually something that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to ask you about cause he was </v>

138
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>talking about mcmaster university and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

139
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.030
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually something that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to,</v>

140
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.983
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really interested in and knowing </v>

141
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>like say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

142
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:39.034
<v Speaker 1>was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you like you officially like on </v>

143
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.003
<v Speaker 1>you just like a target now we're now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being shut down where we've seen </v>

144
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:47.134
<v Speaker 1>it happen to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that like say the Milo </v>

145
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.961
<v Speaker 1>Yiannopoulos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

146
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:53.490
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can say a provocateur and so it's,</v>

147
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:54.324
<v Speaker 1>it's very telling that they would go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their way just to shut you down when </v>

148
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 1>I know it just seems like you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying anything that is irrational.</v>

149
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>You're not saying anything that is even </v>
<v Speaker 1>remotely extreme.</v>

150
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.563
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to get your take on how </v>

151
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>did you feel when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you got,</v>

152
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>when you got your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

153
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shutdown at all?</v>

154
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.703
<v Speaker 2>Because when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really think of it as being </v>

155
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:18.100
<v Speaker 2>shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

156
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.153
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>things aren't exactly what they appear </v>

157
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:24.620
<v Speaker 2>to be anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for example,</v>

158
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:25.454
<v Speaker 2>now when I go and talk at places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place I'm talking out is barely the </v>

159
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 2>place where the event is happening at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

160
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.273
<v Speaker 2>The real event happens on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I went there and I saw all these </v>

161
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:43.391
<v Speaker 2>people acting in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>

162
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was partly a,</v>

163
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 2>a vulgar manner because they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling things at me that were,</v>

164
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

165
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.310
<v Speaker 2>they just Asinine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

166
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 2>they're not the sorts of things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd expect.</v>

167
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Even protestors who had any sense to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouting.</v>

168
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.943
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

169
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.790
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just low rent insults,</v>

170
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:05.624
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low grade insults and behaving very </v>

171
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:13.061
<v Speaker 2>badly and laughing about it and on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>cell phones and misbehaving in a,</v>

172
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 2>in a very bad way.</v>

173
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and having the goal,</v>

174
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:18.284
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to appear at the mcmaster talk behind a </v>

175
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:23.990
<v Speaker 2>huge banner with a hammer and sickle on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

176
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

177
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 2>I really mean this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no difference between appearing</v>

178
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:34.130
<v Speaker 2>behind a banner with a hammer and sickle</v>
<v Speaker 2>on it and appearing behind a banner with</v>

179
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:34.964
<v Speaker 2>a swastika on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that you can get away with </v>

180
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 2>that at a university and that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered,</v>

181
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.913
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you describe it as a </v>

182
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:43.634
<v Speaker 2>reasonable stance in the aftermath of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the events of the 20th century where we </v>

183
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:48.284
<v Speaker 2>know that at least a hundred million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were killed by communist </v>

184
00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Speaker 2>totalitarianism is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible.</v>

185
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.610
<v Speaker 2>But when I was at mass mcmaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

186
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 2>and I thought this ever since that </v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

187
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 2>that first protest where I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I was shouted down,</v>

188
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.253
<v Speaker 2>increasingly the appropriate thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>when surrounded by protesters is to </v>

189
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 2>document it and let them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them destroy their own credibility.</v>

190
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.113
<v Speaker 2>And so far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually every time I've had an </v>

191
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:20.771
<v Speaker 2>encounter with the radical social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice types and I just let them be,</v>

192
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I think a reasonable approach.</v>

193
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 2>They've undermined their own position </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreadfully.</v>

194
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.680
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't think of it being as </v>
<v Speaker 2>being shut down at all.</v>

195
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:34.580
<v Speaker 2>I just think about it as another route </v>
<v Speaker 2>to victory and even an effective route.</v>

196
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:35.414
<v Speaker 2>Cause I may be 150,000 people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched that protest now at mcmaster </v>

197
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:42.110
<v Speaker 2>university may be more far more people </v>
<v Speaker 2>than were at the event itself.</v>

198
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.143
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

199
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:45.281
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

200
00:08:45.281 --> 00:08:46.260
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

201
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.100
<v Speaker 1>it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wouldn't,</v>

202
00:08:48.101 --> 00:08:49.870
<v Speaker 1>this stuff does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does bring,</v>

203
00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:50.704
<v Speaker 1>it brings these issues to light and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows just how ridiculous these people </v>

204
00:08:53.261 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 1>are acting and showing that like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take them seriously.</v>

205
00:08:56.221 --> 00:08:57.054
<v Speaker 1>And I 100% agree about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hammer and sickle thing like 100% </v>

206
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

207
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.670
<v Speaker 1>especially when you see what's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening at say for instance,</v>

208
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:06.504
<v Speaker 1>like trump rallies around the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States where a lot of these people that </v>

209
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 1>consider themselves a communists or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxists or whatever,</v>

210
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.733
<v Speaker 1>or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antifascist they're just just beating </v>

211
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 1>the hell out of people in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the name of fighting fascism.</v>

212
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the most,</v>

213
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>it's the most like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the most ironic thing that I,</v>

214
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've witnessed in quite a while.</v>

215
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty,</v>

216
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty sad to be honest.</v>

217
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:31.560
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

218
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 1>like you said though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

219
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just in droves is just trying to shy</v>

220
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>away from that and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>

221
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 1>this is not the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>

222
00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 1>it actually is a very good thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:43.104
<v Speaker 1>will say there's the silver lining for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you getting screeched at and shouted </v>

224
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:47.710
<v Speaker 1>down and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

225
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:47.980
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

226
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.980
<v Speaker 2>a massive silver lining because now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a situation that I suspect is very</v>

227
00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.210
<v Speaker 2>frustrating for those who are opposing </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing,</v>

228
00:09:58.211 --> 00:10:01.540
<v Speaker 2>where if I go speak somewhere and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are no protestors,</v>

229
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.613
<v Speaker 2>then I get to speak and I'll get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewing of a couple of hundred thousand </v>

230
00:10:06.461 --> 00:10:09.520
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I go somewhere and I don't get to</v>

231
00:10:09.521 --> 00:10:10.354
<v Speaker 2>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that gets a viewing of a couple of </v>

232
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.533
<v Speaker 2>hundred thousand people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so at the moment I'm in this </v>

233
00:10:15.761 --> 00:10:16.594
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily fortunate position where</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as I don't do anything to </v>

234
00:10:19.631 --> 00:10:23.650
<v Speaker 2>unforgivably stupid and get carried away</v>
<v Speaker 2>or get arrogant or anything like that,</v>

235
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.513
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as I've cautious as if I keep </v>

236
00:10:28.721 --> 00:10:29.554
<v Speaker 2>pushing forward with what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I seem to come out in a positive </v>

237
00:10:34.091 --> 00:10:36.940
<v Speaker 2>light either way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a great position to be in.</v>

238
00:10:36.941 --> 00:10:39.000
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing position to be in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>eye.</v>

239
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:39.923
<v Speaker 2>It's also been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned some really interesting </v>

240
00:10:41.261 --> 00:10:42.250
<v Speaker 2>things here as well.</v>

241
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.083
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about my youtube </v>

242
00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:49.060
<v Speaker 2>popularity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you some details about that,</v>

243
00:10:49.061 --> 00:10:51.820
<v Speaker 2>that you might be interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

244
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.613
<v Speaker 2>the overwhelming majority of the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who come to see me live and who are </v>

245
00:10:57.161 --> 00:11:01.720
<v Speaker 2>watching my youtube videos are men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about 90% men.</v>

246
00:11:01.721 --> 00:11:02.554
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think that that's because my </v>

247
00:11:03.971 --> 00:11:06.640
<v Speaker 2>political stance say it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily appeal to women,</v>

248
00:11:06.641 --> 00:11:08.140
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that that's what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

249
00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Because when I looked at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>demographics for my lectures,</v>

250
00:11:11.681 --> 00:11:12.514
<v Speaker 2>my personality lectures in my other </v>
<v Speaker 2>university lectures that I put online </v>

251
00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:20.521
<v Speaker 2>since 2013 even before this political </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue became central,</v>

252
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:27.550
<v Speaker 2>let's say about 85% of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were watching my lectures were men.</v>

253
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:29.283
<v Speaker 2>And that's strange because about 75% of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology students in universities are </v>

254
00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:33.994
<v Speaker 2>female now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've been trying to figure out </v>

255
00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:37.024
<v Speaker 2>why is it that men are coming to watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and why is it that men are watching </v>

256
00:11:39.821 --> 00:11:44.821
<v Speaker 2>my lectures and what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've been speaking to these audiences</v>

257
00:11:44.891 --> 00:11:45.724
<v Speaker 2>about a variety of different things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been concentrating mostly on the </v>

258
00:11:49.301 --> 00:11:51.340
<v Speaker 2>right to free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

259
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 2>and in an apolitical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense,</v>

260
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.083
<v Speaker 2>like I'm making the case that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary for free speech to be placed </v>

261
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 2>above all other political virtue so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter who it is,</v>

262
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 2>no matter who positioned that's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>put forward,</v>

263
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.580
<v Speaker 2>they have an opportunity to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 2>political dialogue.</v>

264
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.163
<v Speaker 2>But also I've been talking an awful lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>about responsibility and responsibility </v>

265
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:17.770
<v Speaker 2>is the other half of rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

266
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:18.604
<v Speaker 2>Because your rights are my </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and my rights are your </v>

267
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:22.234
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you actually can't have a </v>

268
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:24.124
<v Speaker 2>discussion about rights without having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion about responsibility unless </v>

269
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 2>you're willing to forget about half of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story.</v>

270
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.323
<v Speaker 2>And the radical leftists in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even the moderates I would say have </v>

271
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:36.244
<v Speaker 2>been pushing this idea that the quality </v>
<v Speaker 2>of life that someone enjoys is entirely </v>

272
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:42.484
<v Speaker 2>dependent on the rights that they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>granted or the rights that they take to </v>

273
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:46.384
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have been putting forward the </v>

274
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:48.790
<v Speaker 2>counter story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

275
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.653
<v Speaker 2>well just hold on a minute there guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be concentrating more on </v>

276
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.423
<v Speaker 2>responsibility that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>upholding in the community and getting </v>

277
00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:57.934
<v Speaker 2>your act together as individuals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in a way that makes you valuable </v>

278
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:01.894
<v Speaker 2>to your family and to your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the broader community and learning </v>

279
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:05.284
<v Speaker 2>how to bear a heavy load,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a civilized human being and the </v>

280
00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:10.450
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the young man,</v>

281
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:12.440
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are so hungry for that message.</v>

282
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just unbelievable.</v>

283
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Their eyes light up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

284
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.343
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got this program that I wanted to </v>

285
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:20.480
<v Speaker 2>talk to you about too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

286
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I designed this program a while back </v>
<v Speaker 2>called future authoring.</v>

287
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.503
<v Speaker 2>And that's available@selfauthoring.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a program that helps people </v>

288
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.210
<v Speaker 2>write out a plan for their life three to</v>
<v Speaker 2>five years down the road.</v>

289
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:38.380
<v Speaker 2>And so what the program asks you some </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions it asks you,</v>

290
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.203
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you were taking care of </v>

291
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:43.960
<v Speaker 2>yourself like you're someone that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were cared for.</v>

292
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.670
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

293
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:48.160
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to set your life up so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have a good,</v>

294
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.900
<v Speaker 2>high quality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable life.</v>

295
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 2>However you want to define that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's up to you to define it,</v>

296
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Eros to think about,</v>

297
00:13:55.781 --> 00:13:57.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want from your friends?</v>

298
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Or Hoe do you want your friends to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want for your career?</v>

299
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.433
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to educate yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you use your time in a high </v>

300
00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:06.930
<v Speaker 2>quality and productive way outside of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

301
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.610
<v Speaker 2>outside of your obligations?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

302
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.610
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to handle drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol?</v>

303
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.943
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want for an intimate </v>

304
00:14:14.651 --> 00:14:15.484
<v Speaker 2>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to structure your </v>

305
00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:17.200
<v Speaker 2>family?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

306
00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:18.034
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basic can take about that as the </v>

307
00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:21.790
<v Speaker 2>basic dimensions of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a functional life.</v>

308
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.540
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could have what you wanted,</v>

309
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.610
<v Speaker 2>what would that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And assuming what,</v>

310
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.553
<v Speaker 2>what you wanted was also best for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that you were heading in a </v>

311
00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:34.090
<v Speaker 2>positive direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're asked to think about that.</v>

312
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.283
<v Speaker 2>And then you're asked to write for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes without too much concern for </v>

313
00:14:37.991 --> 00:14:38.824
<v Speaker 2>grammar or structure about what your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life could be like three to five years </v>

314
00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:45.280
<v Speaker 2>down the road if it was set up in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner that you would find optimal.</v>

315
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.760
<v Speaker 2>And then you're asked to write a counter</v>
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>

316
00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 2>which is all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So think about yourself critically for a</v>

317
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.933
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then imagine that you let your bad </v>

318
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:56.810
<v Speaker 2>habits and your resentment and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred and,</v>

319
00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.570
<v Speaker 2>and everything about you that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's subpar.</v>

320
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.413
<v Speaker 2>It's suboptimal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the upper hand and it augured into </v>

321
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:04.754
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What sort of hell would you be in three </v>

322
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:07.484
<v Speaker 2>to five years down the road?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we basically imagine you specify </v>

323
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:15.560
<v Speaker 2>a heaven that you can strive for and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>held that you want to avoid.</v>

324
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 2>And that sets you up for maximum </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation a cause.</v>

325
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:18.884
<v Speaker 2>You're running towards something you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want and you're running away from </v>

326
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:21.224
<v Speaker 2>something you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're asked to lay out an </v>

327
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:28.130
<v Speaker 2>implementable plan and to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed rationale for what you're going</v>

328
00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:29.180
<v Speaker 2>to pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

329
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:30.830
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's all a long story.</v>

330
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:31.664
<v Speaker 2>But we've tested this program and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of universities in Europe and in </v>

331
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:38.840
<v Speaker 2>North America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we found the same thing each time.</v>

332
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.500
<v Speaker 2>We found that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works better for,</v>

333
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.660
<v Speaker 2>for students who are doing worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just for students,</v>

334
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:45.494
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've tested it in students because </v>

335
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:47.744
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an easy population to actually </v>

336
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 2>assess its effectiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

337
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:52.963
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found that it increased student's </v>

338
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:56.204
<v Speaker 2>grade point average by about 25% and </v>
<v Speaker 2>decreased the probability that they </v>

339
00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:03.760
<v Speaker 2>would drop out of university by about </v>
<v Speaker 2>25% so about,</v>

340
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:04.603
<v Speaker 2>so huge effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what was really cool was that the </v>

341
00:16:08.091 --> 00:16:08.924
<v Speaker 2>biggest effect was on men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look in the universities now </v>

342
00:16:13.491 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 2>and it schools for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women are outperforming men.</v>

343
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's because of the men.</v>

344
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to get into why that is,</v>

345
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:23.444
<v Speaker 2>but they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they do the future authoring </v>

346
00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:27.080
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the men catch up.</v>

347
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.000
<v Speaker 2>And then here's the kicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

348
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.670
<v Speaker 2>this is something I think is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>

349
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.960
<v Speaker 2>So when we did our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our big study in Holland,</v>

350
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.750
<v Speaker 2>I worked with a woman there named </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mikayla shippers.</v>

351
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.210
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

352
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.520
<v Speaker 2>another professor named Ad Cheaper's and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ran about 7,000 students through this</v>

353
00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:47.600
<v Speaker 2>program now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we broke them up,</v>

354
00:16:47.601 --> 00:16:49.160
<v Speaker 2>not only buy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy,</v>

355
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.620
<v Speaker 2>buy sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also by ethnicity.</v>

356
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.053
<v Speaker 2>And so we broke them into male and </v>
<v Speaker 2>female and also Dutch national and no </v>

357
00:16:59.591 --> 00:17:03.020
<v Speaker 2>one western ethnic minority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we looked at,</v>

358
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.020
<v Speaker 2>at their initial performance before they</v>
<v Speaker 2>did the program.</v>

359
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:10.460
<v Speaker 2>And so the higher performing people </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the Dutch women and then the Dutch</v>

360
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.293
<v Speaker 2>Dutchmen and then the non Western ethnic</v>
<v Speaker 2>minority women and then the non Western </v>

361
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:18.560
<v Speaker 2>ethnic minority men who were out </v>
<v Speaker 2>underperforming the Dutch women by about</v>

362
00:17:18.561 --> 00:17:19.394
<v Speaker 2>70%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a huge margin and dropping out far </v>

363
00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:25.610
<v Speaker 2>more frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they did the program,</v>

364
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:26.503
<v Speaker 2>the nonwestern ethnic minority men </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught up to the Dutch women and passed </v>

365
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:32.900
<v Speaker 2>them within two years.</v>

366
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.570
<v Speaker 2>And then we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no kidding,</v>

367
00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:36.950
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just blew me away.</v>

368
00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:38.810
<v Speaker 2>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that's,</v>

369
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.190
<v Speaker 2>that's so unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

370
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.053
<v Speaker 2>Usually when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you produce an intervention that's </v>

371
00:17:42.651 --> 00:17:44.660
<v Speaker 2>designed to improve things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

372
00:17:44.661 --> 00:17:48.500
<v Speaker 2>it usually fails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it makes things worse.</v>

373
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.370
<v Speaker 2>And even if it does succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what usually happens is,</v>

374
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 2>is it makes the higher performing people</v>
<v Speaker 2>do even better.</v>

375
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.740
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't what this did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it did was take the people who were</v>

376
00:17:59.010 --> 00:17:59.843
<v Speaker 2>doing the worst and it increased their </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance up to the point where they </v>

377
00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 2>were indistinguishable from the high </v>
<v Speaker 2>performers.</v>

378
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:06.563
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a bunch of things about that </v>

379
00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:08.874
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting in the first is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people make the claim all the time that </v>

380
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 2>say in European communities that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a visible minority,</v>

381
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 2>the reason that you're not attaining the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same,</v>

382
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment level,</v>

383
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:21.683
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because of sociological or political </v>

384
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:25.500
<v Speaker 2>or economic reasons.</v>

385
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.053
<v Speaker 2>But we produced a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention that helped people get </v>

386
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:30.714
<v Speaker 2>their acts together at the individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>level to set concrete goals for </v>

387
00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:36.480
<v Speaker 2>themselves that they want it and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>removed the effects.</v>

388
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.800
<v Speaker 2>And so that's one of the things I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk to you about because you know,</v>

389
00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:43.530
<v Speaker 2>among your listeners there are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be people of,</v>

390
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:44.463
<v Speaker 2>of all sorts who are drifting and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of what I'm doing when I'm </v>

391
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:51.720
<v Speaker 2>talking to live audiences as an on </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube is to,</v>

392
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:52.763
<v Speaker 2>is to tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help people figure out how to get their </v>

393
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:57.990
<v Speaker 2>act together and aim at what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what it,</v>

394
00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:58.883
<v Speaker 2>what seems to be the case is if you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get men to sit down and think about how </v>

395
00:19:02.431 --> 00:19:03.264
<v Speaker 2>they can take responsibility for what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want in a way that would also </v>

396
00:19:06.121 --> 00:19:06.954
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously benefit the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their performance goes way up and their </v>

397
00:19:10.261 --> 00:19:12.840
<v Speaker 2>quality of life improves and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental health improves.</v>

398
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.673
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've got like hundreds of letters </v>

399
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.343
<v Speaker 2>now from people who have listened to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lectures or done that program and said </v>

400
00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:21.001
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

401
00:19:21.001 --> 00:19:23.670
<v Speaker 2>it's turned their life around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped them from being nihilistic.</v>

402
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.593
<v Speaker 2>Stop them from wasting their time </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly and doing foolish things and </v>

403
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.130
<v Speaker 2>set them on a path that they regard as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much as much more powerful.</v>

404
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

405
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.393
<v Speaker 2>it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that isn't taught to </v>

406
00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:39.960
<v Speaker 2>young men now is that the reason you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>your act together so that you have power</v>

407
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.760
<v Speaker 2>and influence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

408
00:19:41.761 --> 00:19:46.080
<v Speaker 2>So you get strong and indomitable and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that nobody can get in your way.</v>

409
00:19:46.081 --> 00:19:48.840
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean that you become a cruel</v>
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>

410
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Although being able to be a cruel </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster is actually extremely useful,</v>

411
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.113
<v Speaker 2>but doesn't mean you should be one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But being able to be one is means that </v>

412
00:19:57.961 --> 00:20:00.000
<v Speaker 2>you're no pushover and who you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

413
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:02.520
<v Speaker 2>what kind of man are you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a pushover,</v>

414
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.030
<v Speaker 2>you're hearing you're not good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself or anyone else.</v>

415
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.730
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's been very exciting.</v>

416
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds amazing.</v>

417
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.310
<v Speaker 1>The results are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

418
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.410
<v Speaker 1>that's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like hearing that stuff.</v>

419
00:20:15.411 --> 00:20:16.244
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I totally understand that and it's </v>

420
00:20:19.011 --> 00:20:20.510
<v Speaker 1>something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say for example,</v>

421
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:21.344
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I kind of would need</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I was even telling one of my </v>

422
00:20:24.201 --> 00:20:26.210
<v Speaker 1>friends the other day that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

423
00:20:26.211 --> 00:20:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will,</v>

424
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.400
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll succeed much better,</v>

425
00:20:28.401 --> 00:20:30.890
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have something mapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

426
00:20:30.891 --> 00:20:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you actually can physically see it,</v>

427
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.630
<v Speaker 1>if you not just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

428
00:20:35.631 --> 00:20:37.250
<v Speaker 1>thinking about and you're bouncing all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the place.</v>

429
00:20:37.251 --> 00:20:38.084
<v Speaker 1>It's something that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do a lot and say recently I've </v>

430
00:20:41.151 --> 00:20:42.170
<v Speaker 1>been say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

431
00:20:42.171 --> 00:20:44.510
<v Speaker 1>I want to get better physically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally,</v>

432
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.020
<v Speaker 1>especially physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

433
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 1>I've just been kind of all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in war.</v>

434
00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:50.561
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

435
00:20:50.561 --> 00:20:51.394
<v Speaker 1>I need to sit down and I really need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what I'm going to do and I </v>

436
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:56.680
<v Speaker 1>need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to actually just write it out.</v>

437
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.990
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the type of food I'm gonna eat.</v>

438
00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:01.240
<v Speaker 1>This is all this legwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I can actually see it.</v>

439
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Like it's so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to,</v>

440
00:21:03.241 --> 00:21:05.690
<v Speaker 1>to just obtain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much easier to like,</v>

441
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:06.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just,</v>

442
00:21:06.851 --> 00:21:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I always just feel like saying your</v>

443
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:09.580
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have so many thoughts.</v>

444
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:10.414
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to just lock on to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing though when you can actually just </v>

445
00:21:12.401 --> 00:21:14.500
<v Speaker 1>like focus on to something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

446
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:15.543
<v Speaker 1>like this program that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds exactly what a lot of people </v>

447
00:21:18.801 --> 00:21:20.100
<v Speaker 1>would need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like something that like my,</v>

448
00:21:20.101 --> 00:21:22.480
<v Speaker 1>my friend that I hang out with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

449
00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:23.050
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

450
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.390
<v Speaker 1>every week it sounds like something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can really benefit from.</v>

451
00:21:25.391 --> 00:21:27.220
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure he'll watch this because he</v>

452
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:29.070
<v Speaker 1>actually does watch my channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

453
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.913
<v Speaker 1>he's a good guy.</v>

454
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:30.873
<v Speaker 2>I think what I'll do is maybe what I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>do is I'll set up a discount code for </v>

455
00:21:33.971 --> 00:21:34.804
<v Speaker 2>your viewers and I'll send you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can put it in the lake and your </v>

456
00:21:37.691 --> 00:21:39.740
<v Speaker 2>youtube video link.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

457
00:21:39.741 --> 00:21:40.574
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

458
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 2>that would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll send you a couple of codes to,</v>

459
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:44.740
<v Speaker 2>and if you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

460
00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:46.870
<v Speaker 2>if you're inclined to do the program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're interested,</v>

461
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:49.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe we can have a conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it after you're done.</v>

462
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a shot,</v>

463
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:51.371
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

464
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:52.204
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I could benefit from it myself </v>

465
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially my,</v>

466
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.340
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my audience knows how,</v>

467
00:21:57.341 --> 00:21:59.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how chaotic my life has been.</v>

468
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:00.420
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

469
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:00.761
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

470
00:22:00.761 --> 00:22:03.580
<v Speaker 1>they never know what setting I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have in the background because I move</v>

471
00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:05.530
<v Speaker 1>around so much and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

472
00:22:05.531 --> 00:22:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to,</v>

473
00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:08.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

474
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm figuring things out as I go do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very open and honest,</v>

475
00:22:11.111 --> 00:22:12.450
<v Speaker 1>so I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

476
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.293
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never tried to hide the fact that I </v>

477
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:15.071
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

478
00:22:15.071 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

479
00:22:15.941 --> 00:22:16.631
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

480
00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting pretty old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

481
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it just to a standard of,</v>

482
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:23.590
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't be bouncing from place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>place because I'm,</v>

483
00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:24.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditionally I should probably have my </v>

484
00:22:26.351 --> 00:22:27.184
<v Speaker 1>own spot and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it should be completely focused in </v>

485
00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:31.660
<v Speaker 1>and established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

486
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:32.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

487
00:22:32.461 --> 00:22:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

488
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.330
<v Speaker 2>so you've obviously latched onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

489
00:22:36.331 --> 00:22:36.841
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

490
00:22:36.841 --> 00:22:39.150
<v Speaker 2>you've produced a pretty successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube channel,</v>

491
00:22:39.151 --> 00:22:40.150
<v Speaker 2>so how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

492
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.240
<v Speaker 2>how common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you manage that?</v>

493
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:43.661
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

494
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:44.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

495
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean from a young age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always knew that I wanted to entertain</v>

496
00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:48.784
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just didn't know exactly what I </v>

497
00:22:50.651 --> 00:22:53.650
<v Speaker 1>thought it was going to be through music</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I always would play music.</v>

498
00:22:53.651 --> 00:22:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

499
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:55.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started playing the guitar and the drums</v>

500
00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:57.250
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

501
00:22:57.251 --> 00:22:58.084
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

502
00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:58.983
<v Speaker 1>when I kind of reg recognize that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't really what I wanted to pursue </v>

503
00:23:01.991 --> 00:23:05.200
<v Speaker 1>because of just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the independent,</v>

504
00:23:05.201 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 1>like the independent thoughts and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that I want to do,</v>

505
00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:09.820
<v Speaker 1>the visions that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to work with people,</v>

506
00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:10.654
<v Speaker 1>especially when there was other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have their own type of visions and </v>

507
00:23:12.671 --> 00:23:13.504
<v Speaker 1>ambitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when there was something like </v>

508
00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

509
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.360
<v Speaker 1>when that became a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

510
00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I started just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just putting some stuff out there.</v>

511
00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:22.354
<v Speaker 1>Like I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly thought I was going to be </v>

512
00:23:24.671 --> 00:23:27.160
<v Speaker 1>like a gaming channel when I first </v>
<v Speaker 1>started the channel.</v>

513
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:27.993
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the first thing that I was </v>

514
00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:30.310
<v Speaker 1>going to try to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially since,</v>

515
00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gamers were doing so well.</v>

516
00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:33.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like I would love to be a part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that community,</v>

517
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.680
<v Speaker 1>but when I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

518
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:36.663
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech being threatened when I saw </v>

519
00:23:38.471 --> 00:23:39.304
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that propped up like say in </v>

520
00:23:40.301 --> 00:23:41.350
<v Speaker 1>2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

521
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Gamergate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

522
00:23:42.911 --> 00:23:43.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

523
00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.370
<v Speaker 1>and then there was all little where a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of these,</v>

524
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:47.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radical leftist,</v>

525
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:48.224
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going after things like metal and </v>

526
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:52.430
<v Speaker 1>saying that metal is sexist and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

527
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need to,</v>

528
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.520
<v Speaker 1>we need to do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

529
00:23:55.521 --> 00:23:56.354
<v Speaker 1>and that's when I started just putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>out some content and people were </v>

530
00:23:58.311 --> 00:23:59.720
<v Speaker 1>starting to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

531
00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:00.554
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no secret that it's no secret that </v>

532
00:24:02.361 --> 00:24:03.194
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people like to listen to me </v>

533
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:06.570
<v Speaker 1>because they think like I'm a breath of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh air.</v>

534
00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:07.700
<v Speaker 1>It especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

535
00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:08.480
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

536
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a stigma,</v>

537
00:24:10.071 --> 00:24:10.791
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

538
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

539
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.960
<v Speaker 1>of black Americans where people are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>shocked too that,</v>

540
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.531
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

541
00:24:15.531 --> 00:24:17.630
<v Speaker 1>it's so nice to meet somebody that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>x,</v>

542
00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:18.411
<v Speaker 1>y,</v>
<v Speaker 1>z.</v>

543
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:19.440
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

544
00:24:19.441 --> 00:24:21.890
<v Speaker 1>it sucks to say that it sucks to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

545
00:24:21.891 --> 00:24:23.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the truth.</v>

546
00:24:23.181 --> 00:24:24.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

547
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:24.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

548
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:25.763
<v Speaker 1>the black men that I know in my area or </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that I've met and I've lived in say </v>

549
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.990
<v Speaker 1>south central Los Angeles just smack Dab</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle.</v>

550
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.080
<v Speaker 1>And it's just unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an unfortunate community.</v>

551
00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:36.914
<v Speaker 1>They're not really interested in like </v>
<v Speaker 1>say they can really benefit from a pro </v>

552
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 1>the your program because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just not interested in anything.</v>

553
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:44.953
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people that I've met and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked a bunch of different jobs </v>

554
00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:48.134
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

555
00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.500
<v Speaker 1>they already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel like they're,</v>

556
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.680
<v Speaker 1>they're doomed already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their,</v>

557
00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:53.430
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their destiny has already been set.</v>

558
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:54.763
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>

559
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.793
<v Speaker 2>it's a terrible thing for people to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the world is full of more </v>

560
00:24:58.621 --> 00:25:01.170
<v Speaker 2>possibility than people generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize.</v>

561
00:25:01.171 --> 00:25:03.090
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

562
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:06.210
<v Speaker 2>here's a couple of things that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are interesting in that regard.</v>

563
00:25:06.211 --> 00:25:08.940
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may or may not deal with it.</v>

564
00:25:08.941 --> 00:25:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I've done a lot of work on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology of religion.</v>

565
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.450
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I did was look </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the origin of the word sin.</v>

566
00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:16.883
<v Speaker 2>And strangely enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the word sin means essentially to </v>

567
00:25:20.371 --> 00:25:22.950
<v Speaker 2>violate the sacred moral code,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

568
00:25:22.951 --> 00:25:25.320
<v Speaker 2>And you can think about that is breaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rule,</v>

569
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.513
<v Speaker 2>but that's not exactly the right way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it because sometimes it's a </v>

570
00:25:29.701 --> 00:25:32.640
<v Speaker 2>sin not to break a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

571
00:25:32.641 --> 00:25:36.450
<v Speaker 2>if the rule is is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is unjust or,</v>

572
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:37.523
<v Speaker 2>or tyrannical or outdated or blind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's up to you to break the damn </v>

573
00:25:42.661 --> 00:25:44.550
<v Speaker 2>rule and to suffer the consequences.</v>

574
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.383
<v Speaker 2>And so to sit and means more to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>against your own spirit and to violate </v>

575
00:25:50.191 --> 00:25:54.930
<v Speaker 2>your own spirit and to violate your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own proper motive being,</v>

576
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not to be true to yourself.</v>

577
00:25:56.641 --> 00:25:57.474
<v Speaker 2>And it's actually derived from a Greek </v>
<v Speaker 2>word and the word is </v>

578
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.473
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]. [inaudible] and [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an archery term and it means to miss </v>

579
00:26:04.351 --> 00:26:08.040
<v Speaker 2>the center of the target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in my,</v>

580
00:26:08.041 --> 00:26:13.041
<v Speaker 2>in my role as a clinical psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always dealing with helping people.</v>

581
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think what I'm doing is curing</v>

582
00:26:16.051 --> 00:26:17.160
<v Speaker 2>mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

583
00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's really what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

584
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.200
<v Speaker 2>What I'm doing is helping people get </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives together.</v>

585
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:23.543
<v Speaker 2>And lots of people come to me not </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have mental illness big </v>

586
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.780
<v Speaker 2>because they have very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complicated lives.</v>

587
00:26:27.781 --> 00:26:29.660
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their families are fractured or,</v>

588
00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.790
<v Speaker 2>and they're under extreme societal </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure and they're,</v>

589
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:33.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have economic trouble and maybe </v>

590
00:26:34.981 --> 00:26:38.250
<v Speaker 2>they're sick and like life is hard on </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and they have real problems.</v>

591
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.083
<v Speaker 2>And what we try to do is to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the target is and then figure out </v>

592
00:26:42.121 --> 00:26:42.954
<v Speaker 2>how they can hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you a couple of reasons </v>

593
00:26:44.821 --> 00:26:45.654
<v Speaker 2>why people fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one reason is is that they don't </v>

594
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 2>ever define what constitutes success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they never even aim at the target.</v>

595
00:26:54.631 --> 00:26:59.190
<v Speaker 2>And my experience has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you specify a target intelligently,</v>

596
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:00.024
<v Speaker 2>like he can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to shoot your Arrow at a </v>

597
00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 2>target that's 50 miles away that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't see,</v>

598
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.333
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to put a target that's pretty </v>

599
00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:10.140
<v Speaker 2>close and then it's sort of within your </v>
<v Speaker 2>skill level.</v>

600
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.740
<v Speaker 2>But most of the time if you set up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>target property and you practice,</v>

601
00:27:13.741 --> 00:27:14.574
<v Speaker 2>you can hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that people have that </v>

602
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:18.480
<v Speaker 2>they're do from the outset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

603
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.280
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you believe it.</v>

604
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:22.700
<v Speaker 2>And I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

605
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.543
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to say that that life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>equally difficult for everyone and you </v>

606
00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:30.120
<v Speaker 2>should just pull up your socks and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>at it.</v>

607
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that because I know full </v>
<v Speaker 2>well that that's not true,</v>

608
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.450
<v Speaker 2>but you can overcome a tremendous amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

609
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.170
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

610
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.180
<v Speaker 2>opposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

611
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.043
<v Speaker 2>you can defeat a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very powerful set of adversaries if </v>

612
00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:43.974
<v Speaker 2>you're locked onto goal that you truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>value and that and that you've thought </v>

613
00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:47.934
<v Speaker 2>through and articulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And writing that down does really help </v>

614
00:27:50.341 --> 00:27:54.120
<v Speaker 2>as you observe before the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature on that is very clear.</v>

615
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.223
<v Speaker 2>So I would say don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't make the mistake of assuming that </v>

616
00:27:58.861 --> 00:28:03.690
<v Speaker 2>your life is doomed without putting that</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory thoroughly to the test.</v>

617
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.150
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other problem with that idea,</v>

618
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that goes along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with nihilism,</v>

619
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:10.560
<v Speaker 2>is that you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

620
00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:11.394
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pointless and I'm doomed and the </v>

621
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 2>world is against me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

622
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:15.983
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is that also gives you an </v>

623
00:28:17.611 --> 00:28:18.444
<v Speaker 2>excuse not to take any responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's the underground reason </v>

624
00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:24.900
<v Speaker 2>why you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you're saying that you're doomed and</v>

625
00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:27.600
<v Speaker 2>that everything is stacked against you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

626
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.493
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not to say that there aren't </v>

627
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:33.720
<v Speaker 2>structural inequalities and all of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because obviously there are so,</v>

628
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:34.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

629
00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.613
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that I 100% agree </v>

630
00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

631
00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:38.791
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

632
00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:39.624
<v Speaker 1>I think leaning more towards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of people that </v>

633
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:42.930
<v Speaker 1>just try to opt out and they then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

634
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:44.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to take any </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

635
00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:45.264
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bigger influence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that where there are clearly there are </v>

636
00:28:49.381 --> 00:28:53.040
<v Speaker 1>clear cut examples of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people just thriving,</v>

637
00:28:53.041 --> 00:28:53.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

638
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.020
<v Speaker 1>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

639
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.120
<v Speaker 1>the worst of circumstances.</v>

640
00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I made this video called message to </v>
<v Speaker 2>millennials at,</v>

641
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.960
<v Speaker 2>at New Year's around New Year's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that got to be very popular.</v>

642
00:29:05.961 --> 00:29:09.350
<v Speaker 2>And I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I made the future,</v>

643
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:13.190
<v Speaker 2>I think I talked about the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoring program in that video,</v>

644
00:29:13.191 --> 00:29:14.024
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things I had thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>about was I thought it would be comical </v>

645
00:29:16.431 --> 00:29:20.750
<v Speaker 2>and this was after I came across you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it would be comical if I could</v>

646
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:24.260
<v Speaker 2>run a discount code for the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoring for black guys,</v>

647
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.150
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know how I would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's the demographics of your,</v>

648
00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.960
<v Speaker 2>of your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your viewership,</v>

649
00:29:29.961 --> 00:29:31.610
<v Speaker 2>do you know like who watches you?</v>

650
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.583
<v Speaker 1>There's a very small amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my demographic normally is like say a </v>

651
00:29:35.681 --> 00:29:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Caucasian male of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that there's a,</v>

652
00:29:39.671 --> 00:29:40.504
<v Speaker 1>there are some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some black dudes that just don't even </v>

653
00:29:42.941 --> 00:29:43.820
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

654
00:29:43.821 --> 00:29:44.654
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to call me a coon or an uncle </v>

655
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:47.134
<v Speaker 1>tom or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're saying that I'm catering to </v>

656
00:29:48.991 --> 00:29:51.850
<v Speaker 1>the due to the white man and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

657
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:55.580
<v Speaker 2>why do they say that though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I mean like why is,</v>

658
00:29:55.581 --> 00:29:56.414
<v Speaker 2>why is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that something that would be </v>

659
00:29:57.531 --> 00:29:59.570
<v Speaker 2>directed against you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that seems like a,</v>

660
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.410
<v Speaker 2>like it's a curious kind of insult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

661
00:30:03.411 --> 00:30:05.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean I understand being insulted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get insulted,</v>

662
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.050
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

663
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.760
<v Speaker 2>you have to wonder sometimes why it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>that particular kind of insult that gets</v>

664
00:30:10.761 --> 00:30:13.550
<v Speaker 2>directed against someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why do you think that's being,</v>

665
00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.473
<v Speaker 2>why are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you being put down in that </v>

666
00:30:16.041 --> 00:30:16.874
<v Speaker 2>particular way?</v>

667
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's there.</v>

668
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just being told to think that way.</v>

669
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:23.704
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think genuinely because I never </v>

670
00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:26.920
<v Speaker 1>really had that issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

671
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.793
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't have that issue growing </v>

672
00:30:28.871 --> 00:30:29.920
<v Speaker 1>up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

673
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.110
<v Speaker 1>with like say when I would be in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

674
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.740
<v Speaker 1>in the black community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

675
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.520
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of them because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were some people that just like,</v>

676
00:30:36.521 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 1>say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe grew up in a private school a</v>

677
00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:42.100
<v Speaker 1>little bit and they had a diff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of a different start.</v>

678
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're an empty vessel and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were just able to just have like books,</v>

679
00:30:45.431 --> 00:30:48.550
<v Speaker 1>like just literature and it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really grow up on TV and stuff.</v>

680
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:49.743
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of how I got my start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then from there I just kind of </v>

681
00:30:51.971 --> 00:30:55.060
<v Speaker 1>entered the public spirit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of school and everything.</v>

682
00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:58.720
<v Speaker 1>And so most people were pretty cool with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

683
00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:01.660
<v Speaker 1>But then as I started to gain a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of notoriety,</v>

684
00:31:01.661 --> 00:31:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I started to notice that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's quite a few people that,</v>

685
00:31:04.121 --> 00:31:04.954
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you getting this thought </v>

686
00:31:05.561 --> 00:31:07.780
<v Speaker 1>process from where I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

687
00:31:07.781 --> 00:31:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a trader or I am a coon if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

688
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.710
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not exactly like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not like say you know,</v>

689
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:19.740
<v Speaker 1>the stereotypical bt black guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just only exclusively into hip hop,</v>

690
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

691
00:31:21.431 --> 00:31:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I love listening to hip hop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

692
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 1>I also actually like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

693
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.700
<v Speaker 1>metal a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that thing,</v>

694
00:31:27.701 --> 00:31:28.301
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

695
00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:29.380
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a,</v>

696
00:31:29.381 --> 00:31:31.660
<v Speaker 1>you're whitewashed or you're this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

697
00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:33.010
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

698
00:31:33.011 --> 00:31:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we,</v>

699
00:31:34.241 --> 00:31:34.590
<v Speaker 1>he</v>

700
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:35.423
<v Speaker 2>seems particularly dopey to think of you</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a sellout because you've made </v>

701
00:31:38.491 --> 00:31:39.324
<v Speaker 2>yourself a presence on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like anybody's handed that to </v>

702
00:31:41.791 --> 00:31:44.250
<v Speaker 2>you on a silver platter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just something,</v>

703
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing is open to anyone.</v>

704
00:31:46.591 --> 00:31:49.470
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're in the wild west frontier days</v>

705
00:31:49.471 --> 00:31:52.860
<v Speaker 2>of youtube and you built yourself a </v>
<v Speaker 2>following,</v>

706
00:31:52.861 --> 00:31:55.500
<v Speaker 2>pretty much of your own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't see,</v>

707
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:56.543
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's to obviously some of it's </v>

708
00:31:58.441 --> 00:32:00.840
<v Speaker 2>got to be to do with resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>jealousy.</v>

709
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.370
<v Speaker 2>You'd say that because that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that generally drives insults.</v>

710
00:32:05.371 --> 00:32:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I saw the same,</v>

711
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:08.783
<v Speaker 2>similar thing happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was very distressing at </v>

712
00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:12.600
<v Speaker 2>that free speech rally that we talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

713
00:32:12.601 --> 00:32:15.990
<v Speaker 2>There was a kid there who now works for </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebel media,</v>

714
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Nikki opion guy and he's pretty dark</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pretty articulate,</v>

715
00:32:20.911 --> 00:32:21.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

716
00:32:21.321 --> 00:32:23.790
<v Speaker 2>and now he's cut himself a good career </v>
<v Speaker 2>with rebel media,</v>

717
00:32:23.791 --> 00:32:24.750
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty funny.</v>

718
00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:25.763
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

719
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.840
<v Speaker 2>when he was speaking at the open mic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was an open,</v>

720
00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:34.290
<v Speaker 2>open mic session,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woman who founded black lives matter</v>

721
00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:36.930
<v Speaker 2>in Toronto was standing about 12 feet </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from him.</v>

722
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:40.790
<v Speaker 2>And she yelled coon Adam about a times </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>

723
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.931
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

724
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:46.730
<v Speaker 2>she's someone I have who I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost utterly contemptible and yeah.</v>

725
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:48.860
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because her,</v>

726
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:52.160
<v Speaker 2>her behavior generally speaking is </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond reprehensible.</v>

727
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.173
<v Speaker 2>But I thought that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was a remarkable thing </v>

728
00:32:55.461 --> 00:32:57.890
<v Speaker 2>for her to be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

729
00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Jaw droppingly appalling things to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

730
00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:04.700
<v Speaker 2>But I was also curious about why that </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular insult.</v>

731
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.740
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean to her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

732
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

733
00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I wonder that myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

734
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.233
<v Speaker 1>I wonder that myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because like reading up from </v>

735
00:33:14.341 --> 00:33:17.370
<v Speaker 1>my understanding of what a coon actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>is and what a coon,</v>

736
00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be was kind of like the,</v>

737
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.630
<v Speaker 1>was kind of like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

738
00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:22.493
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shucking and jiving term where you </v>

739
00:33:23.911 --> 00:33:26.220
<v Speaker 1>had to like turn on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to like put on like a,</v>

740
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:28.150
<v Speaker 1>a show to entertain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

741
00:33:28.151 --> 00:33:30.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the masses or whatever.</v>

742
00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.490
<v Speaker 1>You had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to like,</v>

743
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

744
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.900
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be very stereotypical,</v>

745
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.540
<v Speaker 1>like say a lot of people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people in the black community,</v>

746
00:33:39.541 --> 00:33:42.150
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are calling people a black</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like me,</v>

747
00:33:42.151 --> 00:33:42.984
<v Speaker 1>a coon or kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually the ones that are at </v>

748
00:33:44.911 --> 00:33:46.110
<v Speaker 1>koons themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

749
00:33:46.111 --> 00:33:48.300
<v Speaker 1>the Wa the way that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And it's like hate you mean?</v>

751
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:50.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

752
00:33:50.101 --> 00:33:50.911
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

753
00:33:50.911 --> 00:33:55.230
<v Speaker 1>it's so embarrassing to see how like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>descent that I get on my channel,</v>

754
00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

755
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.890
<v Speaker 1>valid criticism from people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they'll,</v>

756
00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:02.580
<v Speaker 1>they'll tear me a new ae because </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'm just,</v>

757
00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I deserve it.</v>

758
00:34:04.201 --> 00:34:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to like,</v>

759
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people,</v>

760
00:34:08.221 --> 00:34:10.620
<v Speaker 1>usually the ones that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can visibly see their thumbnails and</v>

761
00:34:10.621 --> 00:34:12.240
<v Speaker 1>avatars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

762
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:13.103
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually feel very disappointed </v>

763
00:34:14.461 --> 00:34:15.294
<v Speaker 1>because it's usually just an ad hominem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually Kuhn and it's usually sell </v>

764
00:34:18.871 --> 00:34:21.570
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just do the keyword search and,</v>

765
00:34:21.571 --> 00:34:22.404
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>search Koonin they see you as somebody </v>

766
00:34:24.241 --> 00:34:25.074
<v Speaker 1>joking around because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a video like about a year ago or </v>

767
00:34:28.471 --> 00:34:29.304
<v Speaker 1>something just called like Hashtag </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Macoun just basically </v>

768
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.570
<v Speaker 1>embracing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of showing me,</v>

769
00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really buckle.</v>

770
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't care.</v>

771
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Like the Ad Hominem attacks and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just petty insults.</v>

772
00:34:40.321 --> 00:34:41.720
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does not affect me at,</v>

773
00:34:41.721 --> 00:34:43.830
<v Speaker 1>at whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was actually,</v>

774
00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:44.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

775
00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

776
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to make a shirts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything like that,</v>

777
00:34:47.851 --> 00:34:50.070
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of got a little bit behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

778
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.170
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of showing people that,</v>

779
00:34:52.171 --> 00:34:52.771
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

780
00:34:52.771 --> 00:34:53.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

781
00:34:53.551 --> 00:34:56.040
<v Speaker 1>just let that just slide off of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

782
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:57.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

783
00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.190
<v Speaker 1>that's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all they have.</v>

784
00:34:59.191 --> 00:35:00.600
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

785
00:35:00.601 --> 00:35:02.220
<v Speaker 1>it does kind of break my heart a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

786
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

787
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I would hope that I would be somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

788
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like of an example of,</v>

789
00:35:08.881 --> 00:35:10.140
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

790
00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:11.550
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not hopeless.</v>

791
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

792
00:35:12.961 --> 00:35:14.490
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stop,</v>

793
00:35:14.491 --> 00:35:18.070
<v Speaker 1>stop talking about systemic racism and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and saying that it,</v>

794
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chopping a doomsayer and try to better </v>

795
00:35:22.351 --> 00:35:23.071
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

796
00:35:23.071 --> 00:35:24.090
<v Speaker 1>try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

797
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.740
<v Speaker 1>if you're living in a bad situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

798
00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:28.170
<v Speaker 1>how can you get yourself out of it?</v>

799
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I always use my mother as an example </v>
<v Speaker 1>where she talks about just,</v>

800
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff that she went through.</v>

801
00:35:33.661 --> 00:35:35.190
<v Speaker 1>She went through a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

802
00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:37.160
<v Speaker 1>and to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

803
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.720
<v Speaker 1>raise two kids and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

804
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:40.580
<v Speaker 1>put us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

805
00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.220
<v Speaker 1>give us a good start in private school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>private elementary and,</v>

806
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.123
<v Speaker 1>and then on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I went to public school </v>

807
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:45.731
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had,</v>

808
00:35:45.731 --> 00:35:50.670
<v Speaker 1>it just gave me a huge advantage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>where my mind felt incredibly stimulated</v>

809
00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:52.560
<v Speaker 1>to the point where I remember doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

810
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

811
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:57.330
<v Speaker 1>fractions and taxes when I was in first </v>
<v Speaker 1>grade.</v>

812
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:58.583
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with those type of things that </v>

813
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very typical that the time.</v>

814
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:04.170
<v Speaker 1>But now like very useful to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

815
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:05.460
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do my own taxes,</v>

816
00:36:05.461 --> 00:36:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any problems with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like people are always like,</v>

817
00:36:08.741 --> 00:36:09.481
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do.</v>

818
00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I've got to pay somebody some money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

819
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

820
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.983
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

821
00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.830
<v Speaker 2>I think also the insults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a,</v>

822
00:36:15.831 --> 00:36:17.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of,</v>

823
00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.900
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of challenge that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with them too.</v>

824
00:36:19.901 --> 00:36:20.734
<v Speaker 2>So if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're involved in a particular </v>

825
00:36:23.951 --> 00:36:24.784
<v Speaker 2>worldview and someone comes up who </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually challenges that either by what </v>

826
00:36:27.851 --> 00:36:28.684
<v Speaker 2>they say or what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you're going to do </v>

827
00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:32.283
<v Speaker 2>because you don't want to recalibrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>your entire belief system is you're </v>

828
00:36:35.261 --> 00:36:38.740
<v Speaker 2>going to throw horrible things at them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and see if any of them stick.</v>

829
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.440
<v Speaker 2>And so I guess partly what happens is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

830
00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.570
<v Speaker 2>and I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been insulted in that way as</v>

831
00:36:43.571 --> 00:36:45.580
<v Speaker 2>well because people have called me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigot and,</v>

832
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.420
<v Speaker 2>and it turns than up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

833
00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:49.573
<v Speaker 2>I was protected against that to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree I think because I'd already put </v>

834
00:36:52.631 --> 00:36:53.464
<v Speaker 2>500 hours of videos online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if I was any of those </v>

835
00:36:57.311 --> 00:36:58.144
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people probably could have found that </v>

836
00:37:01.151 --> 00:37:01.984
<v Speaker 2>out pretty quickly by going through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>material that I put online because I </v>

837
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.103
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost every word I've uttered to </v>

838
00:37:08.621 --> 00:37:12.640
<v Speaker 2>students in the last five years has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>recorded and is publicly accessible.</v>

839
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.473
<v Speaker 2>So if there was anything in what I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying or what I believe that was </v>

840
00:37:16.451 --> 00:37:17.284
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually deserved that kind of a </v>

841
00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.770
<v Speaker 2>derogatory classification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it would be found out very rapidly.</v>

842
00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:26.320
<v Speaker 2>But it's also the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that people,</v>

843
00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.750
<v Speaker 2>when they throw those sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>

844
00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:29.913
<v Speaker 2>there's a part of them that's hoping </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can withstand it and tell them </v>

845
00:37:33.551 --> 00:37:34.384
<v Speaker 2>exactly why they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just on the off chance that you're the </v>

846
00:37:36.281 --> 00:37:38.410
<v Speaker 2>real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

847
00:37:38.411 --> 00:37:39.244
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a certain amount of success </v>

848
00:37:40.301 --> 00:37:42.490
<v Speaker 2>that you generated yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people are going to say,</v>

849
00:37:42.491 --> 00:37:43.324
<v Speaker 2>well you sold out and then they're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sit back and watch and see what you </v>

850
00:37:46.241 --> 00:37:47.320
<v Speaker 2>say is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

851
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.470
<v Speaker 2>I said he's sold out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's true,</v>

852
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.633
<v Speaker 2>but maybe he can defend himself too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of like people will throw </v>

853
00:37:54.881 --> 00:37:58.120
<v Speaker 2>the worst that they can at you and see </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can withstand it.</v>

854
00:37:58.450 --> 00:37:59.283
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of the way they test to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see if they actually should pay any </v>

855
00:38:01.211 --> 00:38:03.220
<v Speaker 2>attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

856
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.810
<v Speaker 2>so how come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come you're able to let the insults,</v>

857
00:38:07.811 --> 00:38:09.850
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you,</v>

858
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:10.743
<v Speaker 2>why do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they must bother you to some </v>

859
00:38:12.041 --> 00:38:12.874
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't bother you that much and </v>

860
00:38:15.671 --> 00:38:17.950
<v Speaker 2>you don't let them stop you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why is that?</v>

861
00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only thing like that,</v>

862
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:26.770
<v Speaker 1>that the only thing that bothers me is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like say the insults when it,</v>

863
00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:28.200
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes out,</v>

864
00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.043
<v Speaker 1>when it's race related,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that bother me are the ones </v>

865
00:38:30.581 --> 00:38:32.980
<v Speaker 1>that like say when it comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when black people in general,</v>

866
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.570
<v Speaker 1>the ones that I would cause feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>say my content could help out.</v>

867
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.441
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

868
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:41.110
<v Speaker 1>some black Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made some videos about saying,</v>

869
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop basically stop just thinking that </v>

870
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.370
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's against you.</v>

871
00:38:45.371 --> 00:38:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Stop just thinking that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States is this a systemic,</v>

872
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.510
<v Speaker 1>a systemic racist system in 2017 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

873
00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:55.090
<v Speaker 1>And you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no point of trying,</v>

874
00:38:55.091 --> 00:38:56.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop telling your children that,</v>

875
00:38:56.261 --> 00:38:57.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like give them a,</v>

876
00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.443
<v Speaker 1>give them a boost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that they would help me </v>

877
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:00.870
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the only time when,</v>

878
00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:03.670
<v Speaker 1>when they say stuff to me like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else,</v>

879
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:04.583
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been on the Internet for so long </v>

880
00:39:05.981 --> 00:39:08.800
<v Speaker 1>that people are just going to talk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say some of the worst things.</v>

881
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:12.250
<v Speaker 1>And most times they would never say it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your face.</v>

882
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.620
<v Speaker 1>They would never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people,</v>

883
00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:15.454
<v Speaker 1>now it's starting to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm starting to see a shift </v>

884
00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:18.154
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially from looking at the protest </v>

885
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:21.520
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the speeches that you were trying to</v>

886
00:39:21.521 --> 00:39:23.500
<v Speaker 1>give him and when people are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut them down,</v>

887
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.233
<v Speaker 1>what I'm seeing is what normally used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be fantasy becoming reality and </v>

888
00:39:29.531 --> 00:39:32.410
<v Speaker 1>like in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the entire spectrum where like say if</v>

889
00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:33.244
<v Speaker 1>you've ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever actually </v>

890
00:39:33.791 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 1>been on tumbler.com I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've actually logged on there,</v>

891
00:39:37.991 --> 00:39:41.310
<v Speaker 1>but see a lot of tumbler at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

892
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.300
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

893
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I would say that a lot of stuff that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear nowadays,</v>

894
00:39:46.481 --> 00:39:47.314
<v Speaker 1>like when you hear about gendered </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns diseaser and all the weird </v>

895
00:39:50.111 --> 00:39:53.050
<v Speaker 1>things that are coming up foot and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other Ken and,</v>

896
00:39:53.051 --> 00:39:53.884
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just being just mean and just </v>

897
00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:58.210
<v Speaker 1>nasty to a lot of that stuff.</v>

898
00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I would see that was tumbler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've never heard of any type of,</v>

899
00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:04.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred different type of,</v>

900
00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:06.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns until,</v>

901
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.473
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tumblr and I don't know what this was </v>

902
00:40:08.831 --> 00:40:10.660
<v Speaker 1>like the safe space for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

903
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.540
<v Speaker 1>And now do you think Tumblr is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

904
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that's focused there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

905
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I've wondered that myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

906
00:40:17.561 --> 00:40:18.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

907
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:21.940
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect her greatly,</v>

908
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.070
<v Speaker 1>but she's one of those people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

909
00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

910
00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.653
<v Speaker 1>changes her name and her and her </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns and this and that and had a </v>

911
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:30.460
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

912
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a beard and stuff,</v>

913
00:40:33.191 --> 00:40:33.911
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call me.</v>

914
00:40:33.911 --> 00:40:34.990
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

915
00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.460
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

916
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.713
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

917
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:42.340
<v Speaker 1>and I'm trying to figure out like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I can't find the root and,</v>

918
00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:43.174
<v Speaker 1>and seeing like his was there like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant presence or maybe a public figure </v>

919
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.540
<v Speaker 1>that maybe started talking about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas because I don't know,</v>

920
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:50.403
<v Speaker 1>the only thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that earliest thing that I could really </v>

921
00:40:51.161 --> 00:40:51.994
<v Speaker 1>find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember like say back in 2011 I </v>

922
00:40:54.251 --> 00:40:58.330
<v Speaker 1>started seeing a trend happened in Texas</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it was being wolves.</v>

923
00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Those were on that twilight movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

924
00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:00.783
<v Speaker 1>the twilight started to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was even younger because I </v>

925
00:41:02.471 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 1>think the toilets were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

926
00:41:03.881 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 1>it came out a while ago on the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

927
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:07.143
<v Speaker 1>I started seeing that a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are starting to dress like wolves or </v>

928
00:41:08.521 --> 00:41:09.354
<v Speaker 1>putting tails on and all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was starting to see stuff like </v>

929
00:41:11.681 --> 00:41:14.080
<v Speaker 1>that and maybe it was just the pop </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

930
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.420
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're making it socially acceptable.</v>

931
00:41:16.421 --> 00:41:18.970
<v Speaker 1>And then it started to be discussed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>forums and everything.</v>

932
00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.310
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it became the,</v>

933
00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:22.301
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

934
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:23.134
<v Speaker 1>the ground zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like that for me and now </v>

935
00:41:25.361 --> 00:41:27.910
<v Speaker 1>it's just being translated into </v>
<v Speaker 1>academia.</v>

936
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're starting.</v>

937
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting because you know,</v>

938
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.520
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've wondered about </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all this identity</v>

939
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.353
<v Speaker 2>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this includes not only the sort of </v>

940
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 2>gender let's call it play that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

941
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.110
<v Speaker 2>but also that other kin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

942
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>

943
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:47.263
<v Speaker 2>it looks a lot to me like the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasy play that's characteristic of </v>

944
00:41:50.151 --> 00:41:50.984
<v Speaker 2>kids when they were about ages say from </v>
<v Speaker 2>about four to about nine or maybe four </v>

945
00:41:54.681 --> 00:41:55.790
<v Speaker 2>to 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

946
00:41:55.791 --> 00:41:57.260
<v Speaker 2>that that would be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

947
00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.080
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the maximal extent of it.</v>

948
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:05.090
<v Speaker 2>And I wonder to some degree if what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening is that because,</v>

949
00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:06.943
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think that modern kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>get enough chance to engage in fantasy </v>

950
00:42:10.311 --> 00:42:11.144
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

951
00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 2>like pretend play like they did 30 or 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

952
00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:18.350
<v Speaker 2>that maybe that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been pushed aside by,</v>

953
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.910
<v Speaker 2>by mass media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's being pushed aside by computers and</v>

954
00:42:22.911 --> 00:42:26.180
<v Speaker 2>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been pushed aside by cell phones.</v>

955
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:31.181
<v Speaker 2>And it's also less common because </v>
<v Speaker 2>children's play is so structured now,</v>

956
00:42:31.611 --> 00:42:32.444
<v Speaker 2>partly because they don't have very many</v>
<v Speaker 2>siblings and play dates are set up in </v>

957
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:36.740
<v Speaker 2>kids' lives are hyper structured.</v>

958
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:41.300
<v Speaker 2>And so kids have to go through that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretend play period.</v>

959
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:45.470
<v Speaker 2>And I'm wondering if maybe because we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>suppressed that in our society,</v>

960
00:42:45.471 --> 00:42:46.304
<v Speaker 2>if it's blossoming out in universities </v>
<v Speaker 2>when kids get away from their parents </v>

961
00:42:50.751 --> 00:42:53.630
<v Speaker 2>and can start to experiment with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own identity,</v>

962
00:42:53.631 --> 00:42:55.410
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're doing that through uh,</v>

963
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.281
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

964
00:42:56.281 --> 00:42:56.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

965
00:42:56.841 --> 00:42:59.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it looks like pretend play.</v>

966
00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pretend to be a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pretend to be a girl.</v>

967
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pretend to be an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pretend to be a war wolf.</v>

968
00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:11.000
<v Speaker 2>It's fantasy play and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>objection when people say,</v>

969
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:12.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to play your game.</v>

970
00:43:12.651 --> 00:43:14.610
<v Speaker 2>You can play your game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going you,</v>

971
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.060
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any right to compel me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>play your game.</v>

972
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.133
<v Speaker 2>But it may be that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>developmental impulse that's being </v>

973
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.153
<v Speaker 2>manifest there that didn't get its </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance to express itself at the proper </v>

974
00:43:26.691 --> 00:43:27.524
<v Speaker 2>stage of development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that is it really is </v>

975
00:43:29.841 --> 00:43:30.674
<v Speaker 2>strange.</v>

976
00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:32.780
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

977
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.633
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there definitely is some </v>

978
00:43:34.351 --> 00:43:36.580
<v Speaker 1>type of correlation because when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

979
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.473
<v Speaker 1>when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid and when know we're </v>

980
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.690
<v Speaker 1>going out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>

981
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:40.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

982
00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm old enough to where we didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any type of a technology other than like</v>

983
00:43:44.191 --> 00:43:46.830
<v Speaker 1>say the Super Nintendo was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

984
00:43:46.831 --> 00:43:47.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

985
00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.110
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

986
00:43:49.111 --> 00:43:49.944
<v Speaker 1>I would take the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only think kids can do this </v>

987
00:43:51.601 --> 00:43:53.250
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take public transportation.</v>

988
00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll be back by sundown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go to another shitty,</v>

989
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:56.993
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'll just go ride my bike and </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and my friends would have like </v>

990
00:43:59.131 --> 00:44:02.640
<v Speaker 1>missions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would do crazy stuff hugely.</v>

991
00:44:02.641 --> 00:44:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

992
00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I wish I recorded some of this stuff so </v>
<v Speaker 1>I can remember it.</v>

993
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:10.680
<v Speaker 1>But my point is that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely kids don't have anything like</v>

994
00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:11.491
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like you said,</v>

995
00:44:11.491 --> 00:44:12.810
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the mass media,</v>

996
00:44:12.811 --> 00:44:13.830
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the video games,</v>

997
00:44:13.831 --> 00:44:14.664
<v Speaker 1>as much as I love video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is so much structure that you </v>

998
00:44:18.391 --> 00:44:19.224
<v Speaker 1>can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really branch out and really </v>

999
00:44:21.181 --> 00:44:23.460
<v Speaker 1>create the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very limited to what you can do.</v>

1000
00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Even when like bdo games when you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>like create a character and stuff.</v>

1001
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:28.103
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that's as far as it can go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're still kind of limited to </v>

1002
00:44:30.151 --> 00:44:31.080
<v Speaker 1>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can,</v>

1003
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.850
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't fantasize.</v>

1004
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:33.833
<v Speaker 1>It's why I say I still like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still love reading books because you </v>

1005
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:38.670
<v Speaker 1>can just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you create your own world in it.</v>

1006
00:44:38.671 --> 00:44:40.890
<v Speaker 1>And then sometimes if somebody has read </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same book,</v>

1007
00:44:40.891 --> 00:44:42.510
<v Speaker 1>you can compare and contrast and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1008
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:43.613
<v Speaker 1>how do you see this character?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though if sometimes they describe </v>

1009
00:44:45.541 --> 00:44:47.640
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll still have an imagery of how they</v>

1010
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:49.260
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that</v>

1011
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:50.263
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think what happened in part </v>

1012
00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:52.440
<v Speaker 2>was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1013
00:44:52.441 --> 00:44:56.280
<v Speaker 2>kids engage in pretend play when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>too young to read,</v>

1014
00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.020
<v Speaker 2>but then when they start reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction,</v>

1015
00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:59.213
<v Speaker 2>they are still engaging in pretend play </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have to imagine the </v>

1016
00:45:02.251 --> 00:45:03.084
<v Speaker 2>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas in movies and in video games to </v>

1017
00:45:05.791 --> 00:45:09.450
<v Speaker 2>characters are basically put forth for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and that,</v>

1018
00:45:09.451 --> 00:45:12.610
<v Speaker 2>and that there's utility in that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1019
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.970
<v Speaker 2>there can be additional structure but </v>
<v Speaker 2>the law,</v>

1020
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:15.833
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that additional structure also stops </v>

1021
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:20.310
<v Speaker 2>you from having to use your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1022
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:23.910
<v Speaker 2>it's through your imagination that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment with all the different things</v>

1023
00:45:23.911 --> 00:45:27.330
<v Speaker 2>that you could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's just being pushed later</v>

1024
00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:28.164
<v Speaker 2>into development now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why the young people are so </v>

1025
00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:30.684
<v Speaker 2>outraged when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you violate their there pretend </v>

1026
00:45:33.541 --> 00:45:34.560
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1027
00:45:34.561 --> 00:45:37.290
<v Speaker 2>they look like kids playing to me except</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're really,</v>

1028
00:45:37.291 --> 00:45:38.640
<v Speaker 2>they're too old to be doing that.</v>

1029
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1030
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.450
<v Speaker 1>and that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why it's so,</v>

1031
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.420
<v Speaker 1>it's so absurd to me that say something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1032
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:46.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1033
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.460
<v Speaker 1>see 16 it could even be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pastor did that.</v>

1034
00:45:50.461 --> 00:45:53.280
<v Speaker 1>There's even a need for it that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like you said,</v>

1035
00:45:53.281 --> 00:45:55.860
<v Speaker 1>it does seem like make believe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend and it's like,</v>

1036
00:45:55.861 --> 00:45:59.310
<v Speaker 1>how are you taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you take this seriously?</v>

1037
00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:01.420
<v Speaker 1>How could you take this seriously and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1038
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:02.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's happening?</v>

1039
00:46:02.881 --> 00:46:05.640
<v Speaker 1>It also seems like such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a major,</v>

1040
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:06.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regression,</v>

1041
00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:10.150
<v Speaker 1>like something that you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer down on,</v>

1042
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.003
<v Speaker 1>like say on free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get in trouble by misusing </v>

1043
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:15.840
<v Speaker 1>someone's pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then now,</v>

1044
00:46:15.841 --> 00:46:17.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

1045
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.233
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>m one oh three motion the motion has </v>

1046
00:46:20.821 --> 00:46:21.654
<v Speaker 1>been brought up and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what has been going on with in one word </v>

1047
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:26.460
<v Speaker 1>in one or three?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you been keeping up with that?</v>

1048
00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.513
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1049
00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.473
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's happening </v>

1050
00:46:29.081 --> 00:46:31.250
<v Speaker 2>that's really interesting is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1051
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:32.223
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to do a couple of lecture </v>

1052
00:46:33.981 --> 00:46:37.990
<v Speaker 2>series or a lecture series in the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>year and I'm starting in May.</v>

1053
00:46:37.991 --> 00:46:38.824
<v Speaker 2>And what I want to do is start at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the Bible and talk about </v>

1054
00:46:42.191 --> 00:46:43.024
<v Speaker 2>the psychological significance of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stories right from the beginning to </v>

1055
00:46:45.371 --> 00:46:47.830
<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also,</v>

1056
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:51.370
<v Speaker 2>and this is something I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Patriot patrion funding is helping me</v>

1057
00:46:51.371 --> 00:46:52.204
<v Speaker 2>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's something else that I </v>

1058
00:46:53.051 --> 00:46:53.884
<v Speaker 2>want to do in parallel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that I started talking to a </v>

1059
00:46:56.261 --> 00:46:57.094
<v Speaker 2>group of moderate Muslims about a week </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half ago while and some a couple </v>

1060
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:01.241
<v Speaker 2>of months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

1061
00:47:01.241 --> 00:47:05.560
<v Speaker 2>very smart people and very committed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to put forth,</v>

1062
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:06.783
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to start the process of </v>

1063
00:47:08.501 --> 00:47:13.501
<v Speaker 2>describing what a reformed and moderate </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam might be.</v>

1064
00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:15.183
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's the right way to go </v>

1065
00:47:17.051 --> 00:47:17.884
<v Speaker 2>with regards to the tension that exists </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the West and the Islamic world </v>

1066
00:47:22.391 --> 00:47:25.090
<v Speaker 2>or even within Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>

1067
00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.540
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a lot of tension in Canada.</v>

1068
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm about anything really.</v>

1069
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:32.044
<v Speaker 2>But to the degree that there is tension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what needs to be done between new </v>

1070
00:47:35.501 --> 00:47:36.334
<v Speaker 2>immigrant communities and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities that they're integrated to </v>

1071
00:47:38.231 --> 00:47:43.231
<v Speaker 2>obviously is for a dialogue of consensus</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be B to b started.</v>

1072
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.300
<v Speaker 2>And hopefully that I'm going to engage </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that.</v>

1073
00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:49.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's the proper way to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia.</v>

1074
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:50.883
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the current government insisted that </v>

1075
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 2>this motion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1076
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:56.140
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a,</v>

1077
00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:57.243
<v Speaker 2>it's emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a expression of commitment on </v>

1078
00:47:59.771 --> 00:48:02.250
<v Speaker 2>the part of parliament to go and study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1079
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.313
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1080
00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:06.850
<v Speaker 2>an issue or to make a moral stance on an</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

1081
00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:09.460
<v Speaker 2>And they described</v>

1082
00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:11.663
<v Speaker 2>the concern with the emergent </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamophobia and the opposition parties </v>

1083
00:48:14.941 --> 00:48:19.941
<v Speaker 2>in Canada complained about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifications of Islam in this,</v>

1084
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:23.040
<v Speaker 2>in the wording of this motion and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1085
00:48:23.041 --> 00:48:23.640
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

1086
00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:24.473
<v Speaker 2>we will all support an Auntie prejudice </v>
<v Speaker 2>and anti harassment and </v>

1087
00:48:28.141 --> 00:48:31.260
<v Speaker 2>antidiscrimination motion cross </v>
<v Speaker 2>religions,</v>

1088
00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.153
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you use that word Islamophobia </v>

1089
00:48:35.401 --> 00:48:37.230
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to support it.</v>

1090
00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:38.453
<v Speaker 2>And so they offered to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the current government the </v>

1091
00:48:40.831 --> 00:48:43.920
<v Speaker 2>possibility of unanimous consent for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>motion,</v>

1092
00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:47.070
<v Speaker 2>but the originators of the bill wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>withdraw the wording,</v>

1093
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.790
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was absolutely appalling</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Islamophobia is a really,</v>

1094
00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:53.360
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress ball.</v>

1095
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:57.480
<v Speaker 2>It takes a medical term phobia and uses </v>
<v Speaker 2>it politically,</v>

1096
00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:00.720
<v Speaker 2>which is really a treacherous and sneaky</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to do.</v>

1097
00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:02.003
<v Speaker 2>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it specifies a specific religion when </v>

1098
00:49:04.621 --> 00:49:08.070
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence that that religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>is being specifically targeted.</v>

1099
00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.173
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no real evidence in Canada that </v>

1100
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:12.563
<v Speaker 2>the adherence of that religion or </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering from any more discrimination </v>

1101
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.610
<v Speaker 2>then the adherence of other minority </v>
<v Speaker 2>religions or even the adherence of,</v>

1102
00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:23.880
<v Speaker 2>of so called majority religions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a very bad idea.</v>

1103
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.863
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1104
00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:28.600
<v Speaker 2>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think just other approach is better.</v>

1105
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:29.883
<v Speaker 2>And so my I publicly opposed m one oh </v>
<v Speaker 2>three a with a certain amount of the </v>

1106
00:49:34.321 --> 00:49:37.530
<v Speaker 2>fact because I'd be talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who,</v>

1107
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:41.160
<v Speaker 2>who are running for the leadership of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the official opposition in Canada,</v>

1108
00:49:41.161 --> 00:49:41.994
<v Speaker 2>the Conservative Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've talked to a number of them </v>

1109
00:49:43.801 --> 00:49:44.634
<v Speaker 2>about [inaudible] three and about also </v>
<v Speaker 2>we shoes of responsibility among young </v>

1110
00:49:47.191 --> 00:49:48.024
<v Speaker 2>men because the conservatives finally </v>
<v Speaker 2>have something to sell at young people </v>

1111
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.390
<v Speaker 2>and they never have it for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time in the history of,</v>

1112
00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:58.020
<v Speaker 2>of conservatism during my lifetime </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

1113
00:49:58.021 --> 00:49:58.854
<v Speaker 2>The Conservatives have something to sell</v>
<v Speaker 2>to young people and that's </v>

1114
00:50:00.571 --> 00:50:01.404
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we've also been talking a lot </v>

1115
00:50:03.871 --> 00:50:05.730
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1116
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1117
00:50:06.961 --> 00:50:10.290
<v Speaker 2>so there was some opposition to I'm one </v>
<v Speaker 2>or three and I think the proper way to,</v>

1118
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.213
<v Speaker 2>to progress with that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to reduce the tension between the </v>

1119
00:50:14.701 --> 00:50:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Islamic world in general but also </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic newcomers in Canada and,</v>

1120
00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:22.770
<v Speaker 2>and longer term Canadians is to engage </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a dialogue with moderate people.</v>

1121
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:24.900
<v Speaker 2>And I hope that that's going to get off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>

1122
00:50:24.901 --> 00:50:25.734
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got the ball rolling in some very </v>

1123
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.333
<v Speaker 2>people already on board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got the ball rolling for that and </v>

1124
00:50:30.831 --> 00:50:34.460
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm going to play a role in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be really exciting.</v>

1125
00:50:34.461 --> 00:50:37.640
<v Speaker 2>It would be really fun to do that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>parallel with this biblical series.</v>

1126
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:39.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause then I can,</v>

1127
00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.500
<v Speaker 2>I can approach the fundamental stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1128
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:43.363
<v Speaker 2>of Judaism and Christianity at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time as engaging in a public discussion </v>

1129
00:50:47.571 --> 00:50:51.500
<v Speaker 2>about the meaning of Islam and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>implications of Islamic belief for,</v>

1130
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:54.110
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the broader political culture.</v>

1131
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.890
<v Speaker 2>So that's an exciting opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt about it.</v>

1132
00:50:58.450 --> 00:50:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds great.</v>

1133
00:50:59.381 --> 00:51:02.410
<v Speaker 1>And it sounds like a great way to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it too.</v>

1134
00:51:02.411 --> 00:51:04.060
<v Speaker 1>If you can do those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously,</v>

1135
00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.150
<v Speaker 1>especially he's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there can be any talk about like,</v>

1136
00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.510
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just a criticizing Islam or,</v>

1137
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:11.560
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

1138
00:51:11.561 --> 00:51:12.790
<v Speaker 1>When you also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

1139
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:13.421
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1140
00:51:13.421 --> 00:51:14.254
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about just religion and </v>

1141
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:17.770
<v Speaker 1>that kind of across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1142
00:51:17.771 --> 00:51:19.990
<v Speaker 1>and I'm trying to understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1143
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:21.463
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of people are too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's kind of like what's </v>

1144
00:51:25.571 --> 00:51:26.404
<v Speaker 1>so frustrating about what's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and things like say in one or </v>

1145
00:51:28.871 --> 00:51:33.871
<v Speaker 1>three even like existing or say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something for quite some time on,</v>

1146
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.863
<v Speaker 1>on youtube that just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain words that if you put </v>

1147
00:51:37.451 --> 00:51:38.740
<v Speaker 1>it in your title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your tags,</v>

1148
00:51:38.741 --> 00:51:42.310
<v Speaker 1>like your video would be demonetized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying it's advertiser,</v>

1149
00:51:42.311 --> 00:51:45.070
<v Speaker 1>it is an advertiser friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1150
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:47.560
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you wouldn't even be saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything harsh.</v>

1151
00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:48.453
<v Speaker 1>I like say sometimes they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just love to have an honest and </v>

1152
00:51:50.471 --> 00:51:51.304
<v Speaker 1>open dialect about Islam because I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that don't </v>

1153
00:51:53.321 --> 00:51:54.154
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there was a lot of people that are </v>

1154
00:51:55.181 --> 00:51:55.931
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1155
00:51:55.931 --> 00:51:56.764
<v Speaker 1>all Muslims are this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen quite a few people that </v>

1156
00:51:59.021 --> 00:51:59.531
<v Speaker 1>are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1157
00:51:59.531 --> 00:52:01.480
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to talk about this.</v>

1158
00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.673
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people don't want to talk about it </v>

1159
00:52:04.001 --> 00:52:04.834
<v Speaker 1>because people that were full time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna make any money off of </v>

1160
00:52:07.661 --> 00:52:08.451
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it sucks.</v>

1161
00:52:08.451 --> 00:52:09.284
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's such more of a </v>

1162
00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:14.260
<v Speaker 1>important issue that I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't like say I put out a video,</v>

1163
00:52:14.261 --> 00:52:16.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just talking about what happened in</v>

1164
00:52:16.001 --> 00:52:18.560
<v Speaker 1>London not too long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because I,</v>

1165
00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.020
<v Speaker 1>and I knew it was going to do monetize </v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1166
00:52:20.021 --> 00:52:20.920
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

1167
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I want to just at least put it out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just saying,</v>

1168
00:52:23.141 --> 00:52:24.010
<v Speaker 1>can we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we,</v>

1169
00:52:24.011 --> 00:52:25.180
<v Speaker 1>can we talk about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we,</v>

1170
00:52:25.181 --> 00:52:28.900
<v Speaker 1>can we be honest and say that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely some type of issues.</v>

1171
00:52:28.901 --> 00:52:30.640
<v Speaker 1>And like on both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1172
00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:31.713
<v Speaker 1>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1173
00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lack of communication and I </v>

1174
00:52:35.141 --> 00:52:35.501
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1175
00:52:35.501 --> 00:52:37.300
<v Speaker 1>what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're gonna do is,</v>

1176
00:52:37.301 --> 00:52:40.570
<v Speaker 1>is fantastic because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's desperately needed.</v>

1177
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:41.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1178
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.823
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1179
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fortunate because last April when I </v>

1180
00:52:47.241 --> 00:52:48.074
<v Speaker 2>set up my patron account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was way before this political </v>

1181
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.860
<v Speaker 2>political issue exploded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it mostly out of curiosity because</v>

1182
00:52:54.861 --> 00:52:55.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was making,</v>

1183
00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:56.773
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly low quality videos from a </v>

1184
00:52:58.461 --> 00:53:01.040
<v Speaker 2>production perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just using an ipad on a,</v>

1185
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.120
<v Speaker 2>on a tripod.</v>

1186
00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.113
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1187
00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:14.440
<v Speaker 2>I was just using an ipad on a tripod and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

1188
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:15.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could,</v>

1189
00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:16.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1190
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.130
<v Speaker 2>by that time I'd had about a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>

1191
00:53:18.131 --> 00:53:18.970
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1192
00:53:18.971 --> 00:53:19.990
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot,</v>

1193
00:53:19.991 --> 00:53:20.824
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I wrote a book that sold a million </v>

1194
00:53:21.791 --> 00:53:24.010
<v Speaker 2>copies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be dancing a jig out on the street.</v>

1195
00:53:24.011 --> 00:53:27.630
<v Speaker 2>So I was starting to take youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously because I thought,</v>

1196
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.670
<v Speaker 2>I thought about it for a while and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

1197
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:30.841
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1198
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I see what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1199
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:33.623
<v Speaker 2>this is like a Gutenberg revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the first time in human history </v>

1200
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 2>where the spoken word has as much reach </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a book and as much permanency.</v>

1201
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:43.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's a whole new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1202
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:45.810
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's way faster than a book.</v>

1203
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

1204
00:53:47.221 --> 00:53:48.090
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1205
00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:48.924
<v Speaker 2>this video we're making right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can have this published and in front </v>

1206
00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:54.780
<v Speaker 2>of an audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an immense audience,</v>

1207
00:53:54.781 --> 00:53:58.860
<v Speaker 2>and attract a couple of hundred thousand</v>
<v Speaker 2>viewers within a few days.</v>

1208
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:00.600
<v Speaker 2>It's unparalleled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought,</v>

1209
00:54:00.601 --> 00:54:01.434
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll set up a patriot and account </v>

1210
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:04.680
<v Speaker 2>because that was a new thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because I was,</v>

1211
00:54:04.681 --> 00:54:05.514
<v Speaker 2>I've been really curious about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative people can monetize what </v>

1212
00:54:07.681 --> 00:54:08.514
<v Speaker 2>they're doing and it's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was looking into that and I </v>

1213
00:54:11.731 --> 00:54:14.550
<v Speaker 2>found Patriot and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'll set up a patriot account,</v>

1214
00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:15.403
<v Speaker 2>see what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was fortunate because I decided </v>

1215
00:54:17.461 --> 00:54:21.360
<v Speaker 2>not to use advertiser generated revenue </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube.</v>

1216
00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.020
<v Speaker 2>I decided to use patron and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know it at the time,</v>

1217
00:54:25.021 --> 00:54:25.854
<v Speaker 2>but that also made me more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>immune to threats of such things as </v>

1218
00:54:28.591 --> 00:54:30.990
<v Speaker 2>demonetization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1219
00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:34.200
<v Speaker 2>which is a form of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly a form of censorship,</v>

1220
00:54:34.201 --> 00:54:35.760
<v Speaker 2>it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more like,</v>

1221
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.073
<v Speaker 2>it's more like an attempt to turn the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tremendous diversity of music on </v>

1222
00:54:43.771 --> 00:54:46.740
<v Speaker 2>youtube into elevator music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1223
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.460
<v Speaker 2>It can be contentious because then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't sell advertising on it.</v>

1224
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:52.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's not contentious.</v>

1225
00:54:52.231 --> 00:54:54.000
<v Speaker 2>And interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to watch it.</v>

1226
00:54:54.001 --> 00:54:57.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a suicide move in some sense on the</v>

1227
00:54:57.001 --> 00:55:00.300
<v Speaker 2>part of the advertisers because if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanitize youtube,</v>

1228
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.700
<v Speaker 2>then all that's going to happen is </v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

1229
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:07.620
<v Speaker 2>another free speech video site is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pop up and people are all gonna flock</v>

1230
00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:11.220
<v Speaker 2>there in no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's longterm suicidal move.</v>

1231
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:12.503
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are ways to protect yourself </v>

1232
00:55:14.731 --> 00:55:16.200
<v Speaker 2>against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1233
00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.113
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Patriot on seems to be an </v>

1234
00:55:17.971 --> 00:55:19.920
<v Speaker 2>interesting way of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>

1235
00:55:19.921 --> 00:55:22.410
<v Speaker 2>how many youtube videos have you had?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Demonetized</v>

1236
00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:23.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>

1237
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:24.610
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1238
00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:27.910
<v Speaker 1>luckily I haven't had too many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably had a total of like six.</v>

1239
00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.410
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1240
00:55:29.411 --> 00:55:30.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that,</v>

1241
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:31.783
<v Speaker 1>the main ones that have been demonetized</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the were pretty old and I wasn't </v>

1242
00:55:34.841 --> 00:55:37.120
<v Speaker 1>really going to generate any money for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them anyways.</v>

1243
00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:39.670
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and however,</v>

1244
00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.360
<v Speaker 1>this month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1245
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I've had one of them that was one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>better videos,</v>

1246
00:55:46.091 --> 00:55:48.190
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least it did better.</v>

1247
00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:49.500
<v Speaker 1>And it was the one about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1248
00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:50.373
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attack in London and that was </v>

1249
00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.400
<v Speaker 1>immediately to monetize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was just like,</v>

1250
00:55:54.401 --> 00:55:55.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1251
00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:56.560
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another one,</v>

1252
00:55:56.561 --> 00:55:57.740
<v Speaker 1>because because of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1253
00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.120
<v Speaker 1>the whole ad hysteria with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the companies pulling out,</v>

1254
00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.540
<v Speaker 1>they started to crack down a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>harder.</v>

1255
00:56:04.541 --> 00:56:07.130
<v Speaker 1>And they am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I responded to,</v>

1256
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:07.983
<v Speaker 1>there's this company called Mike and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just still put out a bunch of </v>

1257
00:56:09.971 --> 00:56:10.510
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

1258
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:11.343
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people are starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull back a little bit on their social </v>

1259
00:56:13.451 --> 00:56:16.300
<v Speaker 1>justice warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultra progressive nonsense,</v>

1260
00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.433
<v Speaker 1>but they're still pushing on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had a video called things by </v>

1261
00:56:19.871 --> 00:56:22.330
<v Speaker 1>people killed in 2016 and we're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bunch of trends,</v>

1262
00:56:22.331 --> 00:56:23.164
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A dancing moves and all this stuff </v>

1263
00:56:24.101 --> 00:56:26.260
<v Speaker 1>saying that if why people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1264
00:56:26.261 --> 00:56:27.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cringy a,</v>

1265
00:56:27.861 --> 00:56:29.470
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's still,</v>

1266
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:30.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being,</v>

1267
00:56:30.191 --> 00:56:33.070
<v Speaker 1>it's only true for nerdy white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

1268
00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:33.904
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it comes down to </v>

1269
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:36.720
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

1270
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it comes out even like say,</v>

1271
00:56:38.231 --> 00:56:39.064
<v Speaker 1>I mean just nerdy people in general when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see people dance or do something </v>

1272
00:56:41.891 --> 00:56:42.724
<v Speaker 1>that just have no rhythm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so cringey but you just can't </v>

1273
00:56:44.621 --> 00:56:46.600
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the secondhand embarrassment.</v>

1274
00:56:46.601 --> 00:56:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1275
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:49.900
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just put out some ridiculous stuff.</v>

1276
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:50.733
<v Speaker 1>So I reacted to that and that video did </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well and that got demonetized </v>

1277
00:56:55.031 --> 00:56:55.721
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm like,</v>

1278
00:56:55.721 --> 00:56:56.554
<v Speaker 1>oh great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not going to get anything from </v>

1279
00:56:57.941 --> 00:56:59.760
<v Speaker 1>that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One last thing I want to ask you because</v>

1280
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:01.390
<v Speaker 1>people really wanted to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1281
00:57:01.391 --> 00:57:04.780
<v Speaker 1>what is your opinion on pineapple pizza </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a topping?</v>

1282
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well a pineapple is upon you hate,</v>

1283
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:12.040
<v Speaker 1>you hate pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to work at a pizza restaurant and</v>

1284
00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:13.203
<v Speaker 1>I learned was that you actually have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime maximum of pizza ingestion and </v>

1285
00:57:18.041 --> 00:57:20.770
<v Speaker 1>once you hit that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't actually eat any more pizza.</v>

1286
00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:24.130
<v Speaker 1>And so I hit that when I was about 16 </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I worked in a pizza restaurant for</v>

1287
00:57:24.131 --> 00:57:24.964
<v Speaker 1>about four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I ate my 10000th pizza and that </v>

1288
00:57:28.181 --> 00:57:28.930
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1289
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:29.763
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1290
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:30.703
<v Speaker 1>There was something about the spice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be a Reagan know that </v>

1291
00:57:33.191 --> 00:57:34.024
<v Speaker 1>that specific spice that I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so even covering it up with </v>

1292
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:38.350
<v Speaker 1>pineapple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would improve it,</v>

1293
00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:42.070
<v Speaker 1>but it still makes it really difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to eat pizza.</v>

1294
00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:43.390
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

1295
00:57:43.391 --> 00:57:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1296
00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.520
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
