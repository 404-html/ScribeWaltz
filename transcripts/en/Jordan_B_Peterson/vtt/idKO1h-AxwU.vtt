1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my neighbors,</v>

2
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.700
<v Speaker 1>astronomers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a picture of like</v>

3
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Hoffa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see his head still attached with nobody.</v>

4
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean the things they could do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>photography or so when</v>

5
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>there is a little bit there is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>article,</v>

6
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>but no more pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures,</v>

7
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great grandmother</v>

8
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.880
<v Speaker 1>for two minutes after class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that makes a difference to</v>

9
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>shape and a bunch of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's lots of.</v>

10
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

11
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so today we're going to</v>

12
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass the picture.</v>

13
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll take a look at</v>

14
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>this picture here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is very interesting.</v>

15
00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:24.204
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a number of pictures </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this from around this time period </v>

16
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:29.034
<v Speaker 1>in European art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is about the best complete </v>

17
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:36.640
<v Speaker 1>representation that I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

18
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>so I'll pass this around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

19
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.140
<v Speaker 1>the picture is divided into two halves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the right side.</v>

20
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 1>This is the tree of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tree of knowledge of good and evil,</v>

21
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.550
<v Speaker 1>sort of combined into one image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not all that infrequent.</v>

22
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>On the right side of the images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eve Adam sitting in the background here,</v>

23
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>eve is handing out fruit from the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking it from a serpent's</v>

24
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 2>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

25
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.780
<v Speaker 2>that's the certainty of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taking the apple from the serpents mouth</v>

26
00:03:05.781 --> 00:03:06.614
<v Speaker 2>and handing into humanity over here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the background is this figure that </v>

27
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 2>clearly represents death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also you'll note in the tree,</v>

28
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:16.790
<v Speaker 2>one of the apples is replaced by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sculptor.</v>

29
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.243
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then on the right hand or the left hand </v>

30
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:20.854
<v Speaker 2>side of the image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a figure that represents the </v>

31
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:26.731
<v Speaker 2>church given maternal forum here seen as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a counterpart to eve and,</v>

32
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a picture of Christ crucified up</v>

33
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 2>in the branches of the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

34
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.853
<v Speaker 2>that symbolizes the notion that the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian notion that Christ was the </v>

35
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 2>second fruit of this tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first fruit was the,</v>

36
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.333
<v Speaker 2>was the fruit that bestowed on people </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of good and evil that had as </v>

37
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 2>its negative consequence consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>of death.</v>

38
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.343
<v Speaker 2>And the second fruit was the figure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hero here who's construed in most </v>

39
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:58.981
<v Speaker 2>myths as the answer to the question that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was posed by the original event.</v>

40
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>So you say Christian store story makes a</v>
<v Speaker 2>loop,</v>

41
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 2>basically it posits that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

42
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 2>which is the fact of mortality or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact of knowledge of mortality depending</v>

43
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 2>on how you look at it and that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>also an answer to that problem,</v>

44
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 2>which is whatever pattern of being as </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented by this figure.</v>

45
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.563
<v Speaker 2>So the thing that the finger </v>
<v Speaker 2>representing the church is handing out </v>

46
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:20.074
<v Speaker 2>our hosts and the hosts and the Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass or theoretically considered to be </v>

47
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 2>equivalent to Christ's body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a wrap.</v>

48
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 2>That's a reference to really archaic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

49
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Archaic Sacrificial Symbology,</v>

50
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 2>incredibly archaic nature based on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>notion that if you ingest something that</v>

51
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.124
<v Speaker 2>you can become like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the idea that sort of stands </v>

52
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:46.620
<v Speaker 2>behind the mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

53
00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:47.081
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

54
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 2>you can take a look at this painting one</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sorted like it,</v>

55
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.053
<v Speaker 2>although it's not quite as good an image</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this particular book on page 121 </v>

56
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 2>expressing the same sort of idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll just pass that around.</v>

57
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:03.544
<v Speaker 2>You can take a look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it because it makes a nice </v>

58
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 2>background for the talk Landis class </v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

59
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 2>which is today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

60
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna read you some things today </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the last part,</v>

61
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.023
<v Speaker 2>the Spanish girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because while I spent a long time </v>

62
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:20.100
<v Speaker 2>constructing them,</v>

63
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.513
<v Speaker 3>I think they're more</v>

64
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 2>because I have to cover a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of material today.</v>

65
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to miss the two essential </v>
<v Speaker 2>lines of the argument.</v>

66
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:31.174
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

67
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.043
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

68
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.013
<v Speaker 2>this whole course has been aimed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to understand motivations behind </v>

69
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.130
<v Speaker 2>acts of cruelty that have no apparent </v>
<v Speaker 2>justification.</v>

70
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:47.803
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to understand is what forces </v>

71
00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:52.034
<v Speaker 2>motivate individuals to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect their social territory in </v>

72
00:05:56.721 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is,</v>

73
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you shut the door please?</v>

74
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.383
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

75
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 2>So I mean the initial hypothesis </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically is predicated on the idea that</v>

76
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:21.340
<v Speaker 2>people have an innate response to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>abnormal.</v>

77
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.203
<v Speaker 2>He is terrifying at first encountered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly if that encounter is </v>

78
00:06:26.221 --> 00:06:27.054
<v Speaker 2>voluntary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason we construct </v>

79
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 2>organizations of social order is to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>that novelty at bay,</v>

80
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that we would rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>live where there's order.</v>

81
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:39.434
<v Speaker 2>Then we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's chaos because chaos has an </v>

82
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 2>intrinsically overwhelming how effective</v>
<v Speaker 2>valence.</v>

83
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.603
<v Speaker 2>So we have one level of motivation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect our territory that stems purely </v>

84
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

85
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our psychobiology.</v>

86
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Everything stems from our psychobiology </v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>

87
00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:02.921
<v Speaker 2>when it's most clear there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's a second level of phenomena</v>

88
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:03.914
<v Speaker 2>that have to be accounted for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've told you some stories more </v>

89
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:07.784
<v Speaker 2>recently that Gold Hagen had gathered </v>
<v Speaker 2>together when he was talking about the </v>

90
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Nazi death camps near the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>

91
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.810
<v Speaker 2>making the point that the Nazis did not </v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming that they were motivated as you</v>

92
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:20.954
<v Speaker 2>might assume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the desire to take over the world to </v>

93
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:23.384
<v Speaker 2>dominate the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be motivated by the desire </v>

94
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 2>to spread their particular pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs everywhere.</v>

95
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.323
<v Speaker 2>So there was no chaos anymore anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would expect that when they put </v>

96
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 2>people like the Jews are the Gypsies </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the concentration camps,</v>

97
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:38.444
<v Speaker 2>that they would have tried to extract </v>
<v Speaker 2>from them as much productive labor as </v>

98
00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 2>possible in order to further this </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular man.</v>

99
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 2>But it seems to be the case at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently,</v>

100
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:46.993
<v Speaker 2>that the Labor that was extracted from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the victims in the concentration camps </v>

101
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:51.674
<v Speaker 2>was had no productive value whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly wasn't useful in furthering </v>

102
00:07:57.651 --> 00:07:58.484
<v Speaker 2>the cause of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may have even happened it evidently </v>

103
00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:02.684
<v Speaker 2>at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of course the Germans lost </v>

104
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.493
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of their intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity when when the lucky Jewish </v>

105
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:12.290
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals managed to escape their </v>
<v Speaker 2>clutches,</v>

106
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Gold Haggett points out in social units </v>
<v Speaker 2>and details,</v>

107
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 2>this sort of thing quite frequently to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that much labor,</v>

108
00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:19.724
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was only implemented for the purpose of </v>

109
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 2>cruelty and humiliation.</v>

110
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.463
<v Speaker 2>So Gold Hagen tells a story about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>typical work operation which involved </v>

111
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.633
<v Speaker 2>moving a large rock from one place to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another wellbeing beat and then moving </v>

112
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:35.084
<v Speaker 2>it back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a parody of work not work </v>

113
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:37.874
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And obviously only instituted to </v>

114
00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:40.214
<v Speaker 2>humiliate and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and torture people who are already </v>

115
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 2>bought as victimized as you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly imagine.</v>

116
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.221
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

117
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 2>you need another level of motivation </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

118
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 2>that level of explanation to account for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of phenomena,</v>

119
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:54.870
<v Speaker 2>which is gratuitous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cruelty or even cruelty as a,</v>

120
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 2>as a sort of aesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a way of life,</v>

121
00:08:57.781 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 2>as something worth pursuing in and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

122
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.113
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think you can understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand what human beings </v>

123
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:05.394
<v Speaker 2>are like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You certainly don't understand </v>

124
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:06.804
<v Speaker 2>motivation for acts of social conflict </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you get both parts of the story </v>

125
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:13.980
<v Speaker 2>sort of firmly embedded in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say,</v>

126
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:14.814
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more purely the case that the fear </v>

127
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:18.144
<v Speaker 2>of unknown territory and motivates our </v>
<v Speaker 2>desire to associate it with a group </v>

128
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.570
<v Speaker 2>group is composed of people whose </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions we can predict.</v>

129
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while we're in that group,</v>

130
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 2>we can predict our own actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so pretty.</v>

131
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.200
<v Speaker 2>That pretty much keeps the novelty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment,</v>

132
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 2>so to speak at bay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the novelty that's,</v>

133
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in other people and ourselves</v>

134
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.963
<v Speaker 3>and you needed then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you have to account for this </v>

135
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 3>other level of phenomenon.</v>

136
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.790
<v Speaker 2>The way I attempted to do that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>by discussing mythologies of the dawn of</v>

137
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.340
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two of them in particular,</v>

138
00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:58.110
<v Speaker 2>the Buddhist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mythology of the</v>

139
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.790
<v Speaker 2>initial stages of the enlightenment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Buddha and also the myth,</v>

140
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 2>the methods containing the story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>genesis which describes how Adam and eve</v>

141
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 2>ate the fruit of the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the knowledge of good and evil,</v>

142
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:13.794
<v Speaker 2>and then immediately became aware not </v>
<v Speaker 2>only of their own mortality but of </v>

143
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 2>everything that that sort of signified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was</v>

144
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.470
<v Speaker 2>partly the fact that they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

145
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.513
<v Speaker 2>Partly the fact that now it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary for them to make moral </v>

146
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 2>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have that capacity part of it.</v>

147
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:28.194
<v Speaker 2>They were going to have to work in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that we haven't </v>

148
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:31.254
<v Speaker 2>concentrated on that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to work to sustain their </v>

149
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:33.894
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>

150
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:36.583
<v Speaker 3>You only.</v>

151
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.693
<v Speaker 2>You only have to work when you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>envision negative possibilities that </v>

152
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:44.520
<v Speaker 2>your instincts would not have normally </v>
<v Speaker 2>construed of themselves.</v>

153
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Mean animals don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just live.</v>

154
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:47.124
<v Speaker 2>We work because we can imagine a </v>
<v Speaker 2>plethora of negative possibilities that </v>

155
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:51.804
<v Speaker 2>do not exist in the present and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>always attempting to ensure that they </v>

156
00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:55.194
<v Speaker 2>don't exist in the future as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just a hypothetical place in a </v>

157
00:10:58.051 --> 00:10:58.884
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're the fact that we work means </v>

158
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:01.884
<v Speaker 2>that were dissociated in a sense from </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we'd like to do because we </v>

159
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:05.813
<v Speaker 2>certainly normally juxtapose work with </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we would like to do and the two </v>

160
00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:11.280
<v Speaker 2>aren't in the same category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work is what you do,</v>

161
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 2>so you get to do what you would like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

162
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:16.980
<v Speaker 2>at least under normal circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so part of the fall,</v>

163
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.660
<v Speaker 2>part of the consequences of the fall or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rise into selfconsciousness,</v>

164
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.790
<v Speaker 2>depending on how you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the necessity of endless work.</v>

165
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.313
<v Speaker 2>So knowledge of death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>endless work had basically about some </v>

166
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.190
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

167
00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:32.910
<v Speaker 2>it's also the case that went out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become self conscious.</v>

168
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 2>He puts on his fig leaf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He adopts the trappings of culture.</v>

169
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.593
<v Speaker 2>He also immediately hides from God and </v>
<v Speaker 2>while those ideas are all tangled </v>

170
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:41.724
<v Speaker 2>together in the Genesis Meth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Adam Heights from God because </v>

171
00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:48.260
<v Speaker 2>he's ashamed and the reason he's ashamed</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because he's clearly recognizes his</v>

172
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.230
<v Speaker 2>own vulnerability</v>

173
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:50.853
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

174
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>that vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the recognition that</v>

175
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.813
<v Speaker 3>that vulnerability makes it impossible </v>
<v Speaker 3>for him to to exceed to God or to see </v>

176
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in the mythological story,</v>

177
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:02.164
<v Speaker 3>and I think what that trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>represent this in part of the fact that </v>

178
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.990
<v Speaker 3>it's knowledge of our own vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes us doubt our,</v>

179
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 3>our.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you say are</v>

180
00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.693
<v Speaker 2>our fitness in the sight of God?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to talk about this without </v>

181
00:12:16.281 --> 00:12:17.114
<v Speaker 2>lapsing into mythological terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's knowledge of Berlin vulnerability </v>

182
00:12:19.551 --> 00:12:20.384
<v Speaker 2>that leads to our own shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's the simplest way to put </v>

183
00:12:22.401 --> 00:12:23.234
<v Speaker 2>it and that makes us hide from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities in ourselves that have </v>

184
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.580
<v Speaker 2>been our most potent.</v>

185
00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

186
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 2>so are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I told me a little bit of a split,</v>

187
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.250
<v Speaker 2>a story that sort of went like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that there's a feedback loop in a</v>

188
00:12:40.251 --> 00:12:44.030
<v Speaker 2>sense that's generated as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the dawning of self consciousness and</v>

189
00:12:44.031 --> 00:12:47.150
<v Speaker 2>one is that one is the generation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shame.</v>

190
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.300
<v Speaker 2>The other is the moving away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>destiny that's most appropriate.</v>

191
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.720
<v Speaker 2>That leads to a weakening of character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weakening of character,</v>

192
00:12:56.721 --> 00:12:59.300
<v Speaker 2>makes the world seem much more terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it is because</v>

193
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:00.963
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

194
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.950
<v Speaker 2>as you lose sight of the process that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can allow you to adapt to things the way</v>

195
00:13:07.951 --> 00:13:08.784
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the case that things that you can </v>

196
00:13:11.911 --> 00:13:16.911
<v Speaker 2>no longer handle take on a more and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive and hostile and vicious face.</v>

197
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.763
<v Speaker 2>So I guess the simplest way to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is to think that in the world is </v>

198
00:13:22.951 --> 00:13:26.460
<v Speaker 2>such a complex place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so unpredictable at its essence.</v>

199
00:13:26.461 --> 00:13:30.960
<v Speaker 2>It's so charged with danger everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in order to adapt to it properly,</v>

200
00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:33.390
<v Speaker 2>it's necessary to utilize all of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>

201
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.093
<v Speaker 2>Your own knowledge of your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations is enough to stop you from </v>

202
00:13:37.521 --> 00:13:39.600
<v Speaker 2>bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That those resources have any value.</v>

203
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.420
<v Speaker 2>The more you move away from those </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>

204
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.293
<v Speaker 2>partly because they take work partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't believe in them </v>

205
00:13:45.721 --> 00:13:48.160
<v Speaker 2>anymore that week or you get and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>more terrible the world.</v>

206
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.253
<v Speaker 2>Paris Hilton basically represented that </v>
<v Speaker 2>part in his description of Satan's </v>

207
00:13:53.521 --> 00:13:54.354
<v Speaker 2>generation of hail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around tying in another complex aspect </v>

208
00:13:58.291 --> 00:13:59.124
<v Speaker 2>of the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the inability to admit to </v>

209
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.253
<v Speaker 2>error.</v>

210
00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.620
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard</v>

211
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.713
<v Speaker 2>in brief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to demonstrate how old those ideas are </v>

212
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:09.663
<v Speaker 2>are pain without.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the basic notion is that it's </v>

213
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.213
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of our own essential </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability that makes us lack belief </v>

214
00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:26.964
<v Speaker 2>in our capacity to face the consequences</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our own errors or even to admit that </v>

215
00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:34.020
<v Speaker 2>those errors are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without that capacity,</v>

216
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.010
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible for us to further the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development of our personalities because</v>

217
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.593
<v Speaker 2>it's only after admission of air that </v>
<v Speaker 2>further exploration can take place and </v>

218
00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:45.540
<v Speaker 2>it's out of the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploration.</v>

219
00:14:45.541 --> 00:14:50.541
<v Speaker 2>That personality is generated and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrors of the world</v>

220
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.520
<v Speaker 2>transformed into something either </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive or at least irrelevant.</v>

221
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what we're hoping to do today to some</v>

222
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 2>degree in a very brief period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to describe how that process,</v>

223
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.193
<v Speaker 2>how all the negatives that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with with the processes that </v>

224
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:15.701
<v Speaker 2>we've described might be overcome to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree can to start that by reading</v>

225
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:21.610
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the argument basically hinges on</v>

226
00:15:36.751 --> 00:15:39.720
<v Speaker 2>this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so does the fact that there are negative</v>

227
00:15:39.721 --> 00:15:41.250
<v Speaker 2>things necessarily corrupt.</v>

228
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.410
<v Speaker 2>You can see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nietzsche said,</v>

229
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.470
<v Speaker 2>and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>quoting his David last week,</v>

230
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.323
<v Speaker 2>he said that everyone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>only he who suffers from an actuality </v>

231
00:15:56.561 --> 00:15:57.394
<v Speaker 2>has motivation to lie himself out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course that that statement was </v>

232
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.660
<v Speaker 2>his attempt to account for human </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior in general making the case.</v>

233
00:16:07.661 --> 00:16:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Then we all have reason to suffer from </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual on the m,</v>

234
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.460
<v Speaker 2>therefore are all motivated to lie </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves out of it.</v>

235
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Freud took an extreme position like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that our fear of reality,</v>

236
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.250
<v Speaker 2>which was essentially knowledge of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>own mortality,</v>

237
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.593
<v Speaker 2>was sufficient to have generated all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the religious and the artistic </v>

238
00:16:26.351 --> 00:16:27.184
<v Speaker 2>structures that we've erected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which Freud basically regarded as </v>

239
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.173
<v Speaker 2>neurotic delusions against the anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 2>about death as a powerful argument type </v>

240
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.533
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

241
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.253
<v Speaker 2>I guess the problem I have with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular perspective is that it's </v>

242
00:16:42.171 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's extraordinarily pessimistic because</v>

243
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:48.680
<v Speaker 2>it basically predicated on the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>unvarnished reality,</v>

244
00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:51.260
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is of necessity,</v>

245
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:53.700
<v Speaker 2>so terrible that it's impossible to face</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

246
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.120
<v Speaker 2>so then some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some false,</v>

247
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:57.323
<v Speaker 2>some sort of has to be erected between </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and your actual experience in order </v>

248
00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:00.734
<v Speaker 2>to make that experience tolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I can understand the rationale </v>

249
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:05.474
<v Speaker 2>behind that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brings up again in these social </v>

250
00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:11.630
<v Speaker 2>psychological studies that we'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That idea springs up again.</v>

251
00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:15.200
<v Speaker 2>You know that a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dilution is necessary for mental health.</v>

252
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.793
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess really what I want to do is </v>

253
00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:22.130
<v Speaker 2>explore the other day and they look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite perspective,</v>

254
00:17:22.131 --> 00:17:23.090
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

255
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:24.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not right.</v>

256
00:17:24.141 --> 00:17:26.760
<v Speaker 2>It's insufficient grasp of reality that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes it two terrible.</v>

257
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.030
<v Speaker 2>The mayor and the story I want to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you today is the story about,</v>

258
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.153
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

259
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.350
<v Speaker 2>how about the exploration of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular hypothesis.</v>

260
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.573
<v Speaker 2>And the first thing I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I might be useful because one </v>

261
00:17:40.071 --> 00:17:40.904
<v Speaker 2>of the things we've been trying to do in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this class so far is to draw </v>

262
00:17:42.441 --> 00:17:43.274
<v Speaker 2>distinctions between things you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that we can figure out distinctions </v>

263
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:46.874
<v Speaker 2>between various negative things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinctions between various positive </v>

264
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.153
<v Speaker 2>and to look at how the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination categorizes the world so </v>

265
00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:54.810
<v Speaker 2>that we can understand it more </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationally.</v>

266
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.093
<v Speaker 2>What are the things that I think is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>useful to draw a distinction between </v>

267
00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.693
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're trying to answer the </v>

268
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:01.254
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the world so terrible that cannot be </v>

269
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:03.863
<v Speaker 2>actually proceed properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to attempt to draw a distinction </v>

270
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:11.430
<v Speaker 2>between evil and tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to.</v>

271
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Because it's certainly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

272
00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:19.923
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly the case as we all know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the course of our life we're </v>

273
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.213
<v Speaker 2>going to encounter the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon of the Buddha encountered </v>

274
00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:29.260
<v Speaker 2>when he went outside of his outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his castle walls.</v>

275
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.553
<v Speaker 2>And there's no possibility in anyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence for them to escape sickness </v>

276
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.450
<v Speaker 2>for old age or death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean those,</v>

277
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:41.510
<v Speaker 2>those things are absolutely certain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly tended with negative effect,</v>

278
00:18:43.211 --> 00:18:47.560
<v Speaker 2>at least in terms of their apprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the question is under those,</v>

279
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.920
<v Speaker 2>given that those are the background </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions of existence,</v>

280
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.470
<v Speaker 2>is it possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

281
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.333
<v Speaker 2>that existence can be positive enough so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it can be apprehended accurately </v>

282
00:18:56.921 --> 00:18:57.754
<v Speaker 2>instead of hidden from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the things that you </v>

283
00:19:00.371 --> 00:19:01.204
<v Speaker 2>have to understand before you can answer</v>
<v Speaker 2>a question like that is the nature of </v>

284
00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:05.794
<v Speaker 2>the distinction between evil and tragedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in order to address that </v>

285
00:19:09.461 --> 00:19:10.294
<v Speaker 2>distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turned first to an argument that was </v>

286
00:19:12.341 --> 00:19:14.860
<v Speaker 2>put forth by Ivan in the brothers </v>
<v Speaker 2>Karamazov,</v>

287
00:19:14.861 --> 00:19:18.460
<v Speaker 2>which is regarded as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the most potent</v>

288
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 2>pro atheistic arguments that's ever been</v>
<v Speaker 2>sat down in literature.</v>

289
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.000
<v Speaker 2>I've been in low shower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two of the brothers Karamozov handle.</v>

290
00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:29.850
<v Speaker 2>Osha is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a spiritual person.</v>

291
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:33.760
<v Speaker 2>He wants to be a monk and his brother </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ivan is also,</v>

292
00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.620
<v Speaker 2>I suppose the same sort of spirituality </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the genetic perspective.</v>

293
00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:38.454
<v Speaker 2>They are brothers after all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also extraordinarily </v>

294
00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:40.884
<v Speaker 2>intellectual and his intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability has completely destroyed his </v>

295
00:19:44.221 --> 00:19:45.054
<v Speaker 2>ability to manifest the sort of faith </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that characterizes Losha and so </v>

296
00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:51.120
<v Speaker 2>they're sitting down one time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe they're both drunk.</v>

297
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember all those characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The SDS novelists are always drunk</v>

298
00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.150
<v Speaker 2>and they have a very lengthy discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>about about</v>

299
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the central meaning of the world,</v>

300
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.230
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't makes it very,</v>

301
00:20:07.231 --> 00:20:08.064
<v Speaker 2>very powerful case and it's the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's sort of the worst case </v>

302
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:14.350
<v Speaker 2>scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

303
00:20:14.351 --> 00:20:15.184
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how the world is constituted by </v>

304
00:20:17.851 --> 00:20:22.170
<v Speaker 2>all approaches I can can see above if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's constituted in this way.</v>

305
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 2>It's necessary to adopt the attitude of </v>
<v Speaker 2>girth is Mephistopheles,</v>

306
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:26.544
<v Speaker 2>which is basically that the conditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of existence are so unbearable that </v>

307
00:20:30.151 --> 00:20:33.090
<v Speaker 2>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that show itself has no justification.</v>

308
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.380
<v Speaker 2>It should cease to be</v>

309
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.030
<v Speaker 2>now under most conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't draw that sort of conclusion,</v>

310
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:39.864
<v Speaker 2>but there are times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when when our world's become </v>

311
00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:45.600
<v Speaker 2>much less secure than they normally are </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware,</v>

312
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.890
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing springs naturally the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind and you know,</v>

313
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.620
<v Speaker 2>as long as things are going according to</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan,</v>

314
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:51.454
<v Speaker 2>we don't think like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when the unexpected rises up and </v>

315
00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:56.320
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself in some extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive way,</v>

316
00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:58.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the first sort of notion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes,</v>

317
00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.080
<v Speaker 2>comes into our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to outline that argument.</v>

318
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.770
<v Speaker 2>This is from Jeffrey Burton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russell,</v>

319
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.800
<v Speaker 2>a for volume series on the devil in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water world.</v>

320
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.153
<v Speaker 2>He presents Ivan's argument for atheism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ivan's examples of evil are all taken </v>

321
00:21:24.391 --> 00:21:27.780
<v Speaker 2>from the data newspapers of 1876.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're unforgettable.</v>

322
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.123
<v Speaker 2>There's a noble man who orders his </v>
<v Speaker 2>hounds to tear a peasant boy to pieces </v>

323
00:21:31.711 --> 00:21:32.544
<v Speaker 2>in front of his mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man who whips his struggling horse on </v>

324
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.193
<v Speaker 2>generalized parents who lock their tiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter all night in a freezing privy </v>

325
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.303
<v Speaker 2>while she knocks on the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleading for mercy at Turk who </v>

326
00:21:43.471 --> 00:21:46.740
<v Speaker 2>entertains a baby with a shiny pistol </v>
<v Speaker 2>before blowing his brains out.</v>

327
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

328
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.473
<v Speaker 2>I haven't noticed that such horrors </v>
<v Speaker 2>occur daily and can be multiplied </v>

329
00:21:53.471 --> 00:21:58.471
<v Speaker 2>without an he states I took the case of </v>
<v Speaker 2>children to make my case clearer</v>

330
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:01.683
<v Speaker 2>and so of course what he's doing is he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>presenting a situation where the </v>

331
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 2>innocent are tormented because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an archetypal situation.</v>

332
00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because in our typical situation is</v>

333
00:22:10.451 --> 00:22:11.284
<v Speaker 2>where the most extreme situations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterize any particular case on </v>

334
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.793
<v Speaker 2>brought into the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to tell a very good </v>

335
00:22:18.851 --> 00:22:21.340
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do is you make the extreme case</v>

336
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:22.174
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I was doing because how </v>
<v Speaker 2>can you justify the suffering of </v>

337
00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:28.030
<v Speaker 2>innocence of the other tiers with which </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth is soaked?</v>

338
00:22:28.031 --> 00:22:28.864
<v Speaker 2>I will say nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're also states the relation of evil </v>

339
00:22:32.291 --> 00:22:36.790
<v Speaker 2>to God has in the century of Auschwitz </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Hiroshima once again became a center</v>

340
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.250
<v Speaker 2>of Philosophical and theological </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>

341
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.070
<v Speaker 2>The problem of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be stated simply,</v>

342
00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:45.160
<v Speaker 2>God is omnipotent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God is perfectly good.</v>

343
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Such a God would not permit evil to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist,</v>

344
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.540
<v Speaker 2>but we observed that evil exists.</v>

345
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God does not exist.</v>

346
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.753
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's absolutely necessary to </v>

347
00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:55.490
<v Speaker 2>realize that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

348
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.343
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this line of reasoning does not have to </v>

349
00:22:58.031 --> 00:23:01.600
<v Speaker 2>be formulated in a pure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>purely theological manner.</v>

350
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:07.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean whether or not you consider the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions of existence generally as God</v>

351
00:23:08.801 --> 00:23:09.634
<v Speaker 2>or as due to God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has no relationship really necessarily </v>

352
00:23:13.151 --> 00:23:16.390
<v Speaker 2>on the attitude you bring to bear on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions of existence,</v>

353
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.420
<v Speaker 2>whether you're an atheistic or religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>explicitly.</v>

354
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.493
<v Speaker 2>The same problem presents itself to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that things that are terrible </v>

355
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.090
<v Speaker 2>by any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

356
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.730
<v Speaker 2>any manner in which terrible can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>lead,</v>

357
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.460
<v Speaker 2>define,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly occur without apparent reason</v>

358
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.600
<v Speaker 2>and also without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

359
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:39.970
<v Speaker 2>without our ability to control them </v>
<v Speaker 2>under such circumstances which evidently</v>

360
00:23:39.971 --> 00:23:40.804
<v Speaker 2>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible to pause it in any </v>

361
00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:46.340
<v Speaker 2>tangible manner that life is worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>living</v>

362
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.013
<v Speaker 4>on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't have to be a religious </v>

363
00:23:49.071 --> 00:23:50.930
<v Speaker 4>argument or expressed in religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms.</v>

364
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:52.880
<v Speaker 4>Although at its core,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a religious.</v>

365
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:56.240
<v Speaker 4>The only religious argument really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the only question</v>

366
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.750
<v Speaker 4>variations on the theme or nearly </v>
<v Speaker 4>infinite.</v>

367
00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:04.751
<v Speaker 4>The problem is not only abstract and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>of course he is also personalized.</v>

368
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:09.590
<v Speaker 4>Immediate believers tend to forget that </v>
<v Speaker 4>God takes away everything that one cares</v>

369
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:10.880
<v Speaker 4>about possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comfort,</v>

370
00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 4>success,</v>
<v Speaker 4>professional craft knowledge,</v>

371
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 4>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>family and life.</v>

372
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:17.783
<v Speaker 4>What kind of God is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any decent religion must face this </v>

373
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:23.960
<v Speaker 4>question squarely and no answer is </v>
<v Speaker 4>credible.</v>

374
00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:26.060
<v Speaker 4>That cannot be given in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dying children.</v>

375
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.880
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's the.</v>

376
00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.920
<v Speaker 4>That's the argument there is setup for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the worst case scenario</v>

377
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.000
<v Speaker 4>is this typical of Dostoyevsky's novels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's.</v>

378
00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:35.883
<v Speaker 4>That's what makes him a great novelist </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally is five great novels all </v>

379
00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:40.580
<v Speaker 4>address problems that are basically </v>
<v Speaker 4>impossible.</v>

380
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.370
<v Speaker 4>The relationship of good evil and crime </v>
<v Speaker 4>and punishment.</v>

381
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:48.363
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the relationship of divinity and </v>

382
00:24:49.731 --> 00:24:54.440
<v Speaker 4>individuality and the idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the relationship of personal behavior to</v>

383
00:24:54.441 --> 00:24:56.300
<v Speaker 4>social catastrophe in the devils</v>

384
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.160
<v Speaker 4>and the relationship between fathers and</v>
<v Speaker 4>sons.</v>

385
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.293
<v Speaker 4>That's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the brothers Karamazov where this </v>

386
00:25:04.371 --> 00:25:09.371
<v Speaker 4>argument is also discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you say to a dying child?</v>

387
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.910
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

388
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 4>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're strong enough to do it.</v>

389
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.860
<v Speaker 4>Hold her hand and fight the Safra and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't control with the love that you</v>

390
00:25:18.861 --> 00:25:19.694
<v Speaker 4>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me that we use the horrors </v>

391
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:23.354
<v Speaker 4>of the world to justify our own evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We make the presumption that human </v>

392
00:25:27.141 --> 00:25:30.320
<v Speaker 4>vulnerability is a sufficient cause of </v>
<v Speaker 4>human cruelty.</v>

393
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:31.933
<v Speaker 4>We blamed God and God's creation for </v>
<v Speaker 4>twisting and perverting our souls and </v>

394
00:25:34.761 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 4>claim all the time to be innocent </v>
<v Speaker 4>victims of circumstance.</v>

395
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:43.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't have much experience as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>clinical psychologist to my patients,</v>

396
00:25:43.611 --> 00:25:44.444
<v Speaker 4>however stayed in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first was a woman about 35 years </v>

397
00:25:47.031 --> 00:25:48.880
<v Speaker 4>old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She looked 50.</v>

398
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.293
<v Speaker 4>She reminded me of a medieval peasant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>least my conception of the medieval </v>

399
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.193
<v Speaker 4>peasant.</v>

400
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.970
<v Speaker 4>She was dirty clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hair,</v>

401
00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.923
<v Speaker 4>teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dirty with the kind of filth that takes </v>

402
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:04.880
<v Speaker 4>months or even years to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was unbearably shy.</v>

403
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.030
<v Speaker 4>She approached anyone who she thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>was superior in status to her,</v>

404
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.163
<v Speaker 4>which was basically everyone hunched </v>
<v Speaker 4>over with is shaded by both hands as if </v>

405
00:26:13.251 --> 00:26:15.590
<v Speaker 4>she could not tolerate the light </v>
<v Speaker 4>emanating from her target.</v>

406
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:17.323
<v Speaker 4>She been in behavioral treatment as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>outpatient before and was a site known </v>

407
00:26:20.661 --> 00:26:21.494
<v Speaker 4>to the permanent staff at the clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Others have tried to help her overcome </v>

408
00:26:24.381 --> 00:26:26.700
<v Speaker 4>her unfortunate manner of self </v>
<v Speaker 4>presentation,</v>

409
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.040
<v Speaker 4>which of course many people on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>street shy away from her,</v>

410
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.810
<v Speaker 4>made them regard her as crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>unpredictable.</v>

411
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.660
<v Speaker 4>She could learn to stand or sit up </v>
<v Speaker 4>temporarily with her eyes on garden,</v>

412
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.040
<v Speaker 4>but she reverted to her old habits as </v>
<v Speaker 4>soon as she left the clinic.</v>

413
00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.653
<v Speaker 4>She might've been intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 4>impaired consequences of a biological </v>

414
00:26:44.491 --> 00:26:45.210
<v Speaker 4>fault.</v>

415
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 4>It's difficult to tell because their </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment was so appalling.</v>

416
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:49.044
<v Speaker 4>It may have caused or ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought perhaps that she had an Iq of </v>

417
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:52.764
<v Speaker 4>about 80 or 85.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was illiterate as well to live with </v>

418
00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:56.934
<v Speaker 4>her mother whose character I knew </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing about and with an elderly </v>

419
00:26:59.491 --> 00:27:03.510
<v Speaker 4>desperately ill and bedridden at her </v>
<v Speaker 4>boyfriend was a violent schizophrenia,</v>

420
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:04.403
<v Speaker 4>alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least as far as I can determine who </v>

421
00:27:06.451 --> 00:27:07.284
<v Speaker 4>ms dot traded her psychologically and </v>
<v Speaker 4>physically and was always modeling her </v>

422
00:27:09.721 --> 00:27:12.860
<v Speaker 4>simple mind with tirades about the devil</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the worship of sate.</v>

423
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.800
<v Speaker 4>She had nothing going for her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No beauty,</v>

424
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.230
<v Speaker 4>no intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will loving family.</v>

425
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Those skills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no employer,</v>

426
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.673
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She didn't come to therapy to resolve </v>

427
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:26.100
<v Speaker 4>her problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

428
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.203
<v Speaker 4>10 burden her solar to describe her </v>
<v Speaker 4>mistreatment and victimization at the </v>

429
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:30.594
<v Speaker 4>hands of others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She came because she wanted to make </v>

430
00:27:31.981 --> 00:27:34.170
<v Speaker 4>friends with someone who was permanently</v>
<v Speaker 4>hospitalized.</v>

431
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:35.683
<v Speaker 4>The clinic where I was interning was </v>
<v Speaker 4>associated with the largest psychiatric </v>

432
00:27:38.191 --> 00:27:39.024
<v Speaker 4>hospital.</v>

433
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.193
<v Speaker 4>All of the patients that still remained </v>
<v Speaker 4>after the shift to community care and </v>

434
00:27:42.621 --> 00:27:43.454
<v Speaker 4>the sixties were so incapacitated that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they could not survive on the streets </v>

435
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.123
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've seen street people and Aaron cat </v>

436
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.013
<v Speaker 4>incapacitated enough as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so imagine how fascinated people who </v>

437
00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:52.914
<v Speaker 4>weren't allowed to go back on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>streets where the basement of that </v>

438
00:27:55.711 --> 00:27:56.544
<v Speaker 4>hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a coke room down in the </v>

439
00:27:59.041 --> 00:27:59.874
<v Speaker 4>basement of the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hospital was connected by tunnels </v>

440
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:02.933
<v Speaker 4>all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think product because it was so cold </v>

441
00:28:04.201 --> 00:28:05.034
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked like a scene from Dante's </v>

442
00:28:07.351 --> 00:28:08.184
<v Speaker 4>inferno in that coke room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there were people in there that </v>

443
00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:10.644
<v Speaker 4>were so damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just beyond beyond your capacity </v>

444
00:28:13.201 --> 00:28:15.630
<v Speaker 4>to imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

445
00:28:15.631 --> 00:28:16.464
<v Speaker 4>she'd done some volunteer work up some </v>
<v Speaker 4>limited type in that hospital and </v>

446
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:22.200
<v Speaker 4>decided that she could maybe take </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone for a walk and make friends with</v>

447
00:28:22.201 --> 00:28:23.034
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

448
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.960
<v Speaker 4>I think she got the idea because she had</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dog when she walked regularly and when</v>

449
00:28:26.961 --> 00:28:30.540
<v Speaker 4>she liked to take care of all she wanted</v>
<v Speaker 4>from me was helping,</v>

450
00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:31.374
<v Speaker 4>arranging this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>help finding someone she could take </v>

451
00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:35.850
<v Speaker 4>outside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>help finding someone in the hospital,</v>

452
00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:38.010
<v Speaker 4>bureaucracy who would allow this to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

453
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I was very successful in </v>
<v Speaker 4>80,</v>

454
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.173
<v Speaker 4>but she didn't really seem to mind</v>
<v Speaker 4>said that one piece of evidence that </v>

455
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:48.810
<v Speaker 4>runs contrary to a theory is sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 4>to prove that theory.</v>

456
00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:50.403
<v Speaker 4>Just prove that theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course people don't think this way </v>

457
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:57.750
<v Speaker 4>and perhaps should not general theories </v>
<v Speaker 4>to useful to give up easily.</v>

458
00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.243
<v Speaker 4>It's too difficult to regenerate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence again should be consistent and </v>

459
00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:03.084
<v Speaker 4>believable before it's accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the existence of this woman made me </v>

460
00:29:05.971 --> 00:29:06.804
<v Speaker 4>think</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was destined for a </v>

461
00:29:08.731 --> 00:29:09.564
<v Speaker 4>psychopathological and from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>viewpoint of biological environmental </v>

462
00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 4>determinism has faded.</v>

463
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.513
<v Speaker 4>This faded as surely as anyone I'd ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>met and maybe she beat her dogs </v>

464
00:29:18.261 --> 00:29:19.094
<v Speaker 4>sometimes and was rude to her sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I didn't see her when she was </v>

465
00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:23.574
<v Speaker 4>vindictive or unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even when our simple wishes were </v>

466
00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:27.123
<v Speaker 4>thwarted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't want to say that she was the same </v>

467
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.510
<v Speaker 4>because I didn't know her well enough to</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell,</v>

468
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.450
<v Speaker 4>but the fact was that in her misery and </v>
<v Speaker 4>simplicity,</v>

469
00:29:33.451 --> 00:29:34.284
<v Speaker 4>she remained essentially without self </v>
<v Speaker 4>pity and still able to see outside of </v>

470
00:29:37.081 --> 00:29:37.914
<v Speaker 4>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hesitate to say that I learned more </v>

471
00:29:39.631 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 4>from her than she did it for me because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sounds literary have tried,</v>

472
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.630
<v Speaker 4>but she didn't learn anything from me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why wasn't she a criminal,</v>

473
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.980
<v Speaker 4>cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unbalanced,</v>

474
00:29:47.981 --> 00:29:50.050
<v Speaker 4>and miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had every reason to be,</v>

475
00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:51.453
<v Speaker 4>and yet she wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seemed to me that in her simple way </v>

476
00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:58.210
<v Speaker 4>she'd made the proper choices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She remained bloody but unbowed,</v>

477
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.640
<v Speaker 4>and she seemed to me rightly or wrongly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be a symbol of suffering.</v>

478
00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:05.470
<v Speaker 4>Humanity solely affected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet capable of courage and love</v>

479
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.560
<v Speaker 4>such I created all the theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will powers and spirits both of them who</v>

480
00:30:11.561 --> 00:30:14.830
<v Speaker 4>stood and fail and fail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not free.</v>

481
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.630
<v Speaker 4>What proof could they have given sincere</v>
<v Speaker 4>of true legions,</v>

482
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.590
<v Speaker 4>constant faith or love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're only what they needs must do.</v>

483
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:21.424
<v Speaker 4>Appeared on what they would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What praise could they receive a </v>

484
00:30:25.121 --> 00:30:28.900
<v Speaker 4>pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I from such obedience paid when will and</v>

485
00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:32.480
<v Speaker 4>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason also his choice useless to me,</v>

486
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:34.660
<v Speaker 4>of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both despoiled made passive,</v>

487
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:37.510
<v Speaker 4>both had served necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not me.</v>

488
00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:39.383
<v Speaker 4>They therefore as to right along so </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're created or can justly accused </v>

489
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:44.734
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maker or they're making or their fate </v>

490
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.580
<v Speaker 4>has it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Predestination overruled.</v>

491
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:52.460
<v Speaker 4>There will dispose by absolute decree or</v>
<v Speaker 4>high for knowledge.</v>

492
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.260
<v Speaker 4>They themselves decreed their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>report,</v>

493
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.790
<v Speaker 4>not I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

494
00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.633
<v Speaker 4>for new for knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had no influence on their fault which </v>

495
00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:00.724
<v Speaker 4>had no last group certain on Granola,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so with our so without least impulse or </v>

496
00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:06.874
<v Speaker 4>shadow of faith for by me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>immutably foreseeing a trespass authors </v>

497
00:31:10.841 --> 00:31:14.410
<v Speaker 4>to themselves in all both what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>judge and what they choose for.</v>

498
00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:16.500
<v Speaker 4>So I formed them free,</v>
<v Speaker 4>free.</v>

499
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.820
<v Speaker 4>They must remain until they enthralled </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

500
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.870
<v Speaker 4>High else must change their nature and </v>
<v Speaker 4>revoked the high decree,</v>

501
00:31:22.871 --> 00:31:25.900
<v Speaker 4>unchangeable eternal which ordained </v>
<v Speaker 4>their freedom.</v>

502
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.270
<v Speaker 4>They themselves are doing their fault.</v>

503
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:31.303
<v Speaker 4>That's God's discussion of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship between choice and evil in </v>

504
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.233
<v Speaker 4>milk.</v>

505
00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.053
<v Speaker 4>Have a patient I wished you described </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the schizophrenia can falling </v>

506
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:44.010
<v Speaker 4>inpatient ward had a different hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was about 29,</v>

507
00:31:44.011 --> 00:31:44.844
<v Speaker 4>a few years older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been in and out of confinement for </v>

508
00:31:47.121 --> 00:31:48.260
<v Speaker 4>seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I met him,</v>

509
00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.260
<v Speaker 4>he was of course on anti psychotic </v>
<v Speaker 4>medication,</v>

510
00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:54.320
<v Speaker 4>participated in occupational therapy </v>
<v Speaker 4>activities on the ward,</v>

511
00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.630
<v Speaker 4>taking coasters and pencil holders and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so on,</v>

512
00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.360
<v Speaker 4>but he couldn't maintain his attention </v>
<v Speaker 4>for any length of time.</v>

513
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.473
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't even much good at craft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My supervisor asked me to administer an </v>

514
00:32:04.071 --> 00:32:07.940
<v Speaker 4>intelligence test to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Standard wastes are more for the sake of</v>

515
00:32:07.941 --> 00:32:10.340
<v Speaker 4>my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then for any possible diagnostic good at</v>

516
00:32:10.341 --> 00:32:11.174
<v Speaker 4>my deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave him a dozen or so red and white </v>

517
00:32:13.221 --> 00:32:14.054
<v Speaker 4>blocks for the block design test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's supposed to arrange the blocks so </v>

518
00:32:17.451 --> 00:32:20.120
<v Speaker 4>they matched the pattern printed on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cars that came with the test,</v>

519
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.133
<v Speaker 4>pick them up and started to rearrange </v>
<v Speaker 4>them on the desk in front of them are </v>

520
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.450
<v Speaker 4>like timed them stupidly with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopwatch.</v>

521
00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:27.973
<v Speaker 4>Task was impossible for him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even at the simplest of stages to </v>

522
00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.080
<v Speaker 4>constantly look distracted and </v>
<v Speaker 4>frustrated.</v>

523
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.900
<v Speaker 4>I asked what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

524
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:38.840
<v Speaker 4>battle between good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going on in my head.</v>

525
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.360
<v Speaker 4>I start the testing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At that point.</v>

526
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.673
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know exactly what to make of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His comment was obviously celebrate the </v>

527
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.280
<v Speaker 4>testing seemed to make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was he experiencing?</v>

528
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.800
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't lying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

529
00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.520
<v Speaker 4>The face of such a statement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seemed ridiculous to continue.</v>

530
00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Spent some time with him that summer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never met anybody who was so blatantly</v>

531
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:03.680
<v Speaker 4>or we talked on the ward and </v>
<v Speaker 4>occasionally I would take him for a walk</v>

532
00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:04.514
<v Speaker 4>through the hospital grounds outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was the third side of first </v>

533
00:33:06.921 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 4>generation Middle Eastern immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His first born brother was a lawyer.</v>

534
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.260
<v Speaker 4>The other physician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his parents were obviously ambitious for</v>

535
00:33:15.261 --> 00:33:17.050
<v Speaker 4>their children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hardworking and discipline.</v>

536
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:18.303
<v Speaker 4>Being a graduate student at Mcgill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>working towards a master's degree in </v>

537
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:22.214
<v Speaker 4>immunology.</v>

538
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:26.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His brothers had said daunting example,</v>

539
00:33:26.631 --> 00:33:29.780
<v Speaker 4>and he felt pressured to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has experimented work at,</v>

540
00:33:29.781 --> 00:33:31.460
<v Speaker 4>not turned out as he had expected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

541
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.590
<v Speaker 4>any apparently came to believe that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>might not graduate,</v>

542
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:34.843
<v Speaker 4>not at least when you hope to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he faked his experimental results in </v>

543
00:33:37.071 --> 00:33:38.330
<v Speaker 4>wrote up his thesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

544
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:43.700
<v Speaker 4>he told me that the 90 finished reading,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he woke up and saw the devil standing at</v>

545
00:33:43.701 --> 00:33:44.534
<v Speaker 4>the foot of his bed and this event </v>
<v Speaker 4>trigger the onset of his mental illness </v>

546
00:33:47.331 --> 00:33:50.000
<v Speaker 4>from which he had never recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

547
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:51.283
<v Speaker 4>it might be said that the apparition </v>
<v Speaker 4>merely accompanied the expression of </v>

548
00:33:53.241 --> 00:33:54.074
<v Speaker 4>some stress induced pathological </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurological development whose </v>

549
00:33:56.781 --> 00:33:57.614
<v Speaker 4>appearance was biologically </v>
<v Speaker 4>predetermined and that the devil was a </v>

550
00:33:59.931 --> 00:34:03.260
<v Speaker 4>personification of his culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His conception of moral evil manifesting</v>

551
00:34:03.261 --> 00:34:05.840
<v Speaker 4>itself in fantasy as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his distress.</v>

552
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.750
<v Speaker 4>Such description would remain accurate </v>
<v Speaker 4>implausible,</v>

553
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:10.303
<v Speaker 4>but the fact remains that as a person he</v>
<v Speaker 4>saw the devil and the division </v>

554
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.650
<v Speaker 4>accompanied or was the event that </v>
<v Speaker 4>destroyed him.</v>

555
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.510
<v Speaker 4>He was afraid to tell me much of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>fantasy.</v>

556
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:21.344
<v Speaker 4>You very well developed fantasy world </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was only after I'd paid careful </v>

557
00:34:23.671 --> 00:34:26.630
<v Speaker 4>attention to him that he opened up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't bragging.</v>

558
00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:29.270
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to impress me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want to tell me this.</v>

559
00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:33.450
<v Speaker 4>It was terrified about what he thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was terrified as a consequence of the</v>

560
00:34:33.451 --> 00:34:35.400
<v Speaker 4>fantasies that impressed themselves upon</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

561
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.330
<v Speaker 4>He told me that he couldn't leave the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hospital because someone wanted to shoot</v>

562
00:34:39.331 --> 00:34:40.380
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

563
00:34:40.381 --> 00:34:43.380
<v Speaker 4>typical paranoid delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did someone wanted to kill him?</v>

564
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's hospitalized during the Cold War on</v>

565
00:34:47.641 --> 00:34:48.474
<v Speaker 4>its height,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps still during the time when the </v>

566
00:34:50.491 --> 00:34:53.520
<v Speaker 4>threat of purposeful nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 4>annihilation seem more plausible than it</v>

567
00:34:53.521 --> 00:34:54.354
<v Speaker 4>does now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many of the people I knew used this </v>

568
00:34:56.821 --> 00:34:57.654
<v Speaker 4>threat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the existence of this threat to justify </v>

569
00:34:59.371 --> 00:35:00.204
<v Speaker 4>to themselves their failure to </v>
<v Speaker 4>participate fully in life life which </v>

570
00:35:02.911 --> 00:35:05.610
<v Speaker 4>they thought of Romantically as do and </v>
<v Speaker 4>therefore it's pointless,</v>

571
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:07.223
<v Speaker 4>but there was some real terror in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>pose and the thought of countless </v>

572
00:35:09.781 --> 00:35:11.370
<v Speaker 4>missiles pointed here and there around </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>

573
00:35:11.371 --> 00:35:12.204
<v Speaker 4>sap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the energy and faith of everyone </v>

574
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:13.783
<v Speaker 4>hypocritical or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my schizophrenia patient believed that </v>

575
00:35:16.291 --> 00:35:20.370
<v Speaker 4>he was in fact the incarnation of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world in our lady force.</v>

576
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.260
<v Speaker 4>He was arrested upon his release from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hospital to make his way south who's</v>

577
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.140
<v Speaker 4>in Canada to a nuclear missile silo and </v>
<v Speaker 4>American territory,</v>

578
00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.050
<v Speaker 4>and to make the fateful decision that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would launch the Third World War,</v>

579
00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.493
<v Speaker 4>the people outside the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that is why they were waiting to </v>

580
00:35:35.851 --> 00:35:36.684
<v Speaker 4>shoot him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't want to tell me this story </v>

581
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.860
<v Speaker 4>because he thought that I might want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>kill him to</v>

582
00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.510
<v Speaker 4>my friends in graduate school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was quite comical.</v>

583
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.450
<v Speaker 4>Denied contact a patient like this one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>peculiar interest in human and humans,</v>

584
00:35:48.451 --> 00:35:50.160
<v Speaker 4>ideas regarding the collective </v>
<v Speaker 4>unconscious.</v>

585
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:50.994
<v Speaker 4>We're well known to them that seemed </v>
<v Speaker 4>absurdly fitting that I would end up </v>

586
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:54.720
<v Speaker 4>talking to someone with deletions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this type,</v>

587
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:57.090
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't know what to do with his </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

588
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.720
<v Speaker 4>Of course they were crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my patient,</v>

589
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.440
<v Speaker 4>but it still seemed to me that they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>true from a metaphorical viewpoint.</v>

590
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.910
<v Speaker 4>Historian totality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Length is individual choice between good</v>

591
00:36:08.911 --> 00:36:11.040
<v Speaker 4>and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a cumulative horror than facing the</v>

592
00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:11.874
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Historic implied that because he had </v>

593
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:15.150
<v Speaker 4>given into temptation at a critical </v>
<v Speaker 4>juncture,</v>

594
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.780
<v Speaker 4>he was in fact responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>horror of the potential of nuclear war.</v>

595
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.573
<v Speaker 4>How could this be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seemed insane to me to even consider </v>

596
00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:23.874
<v Speaker 4>that the active one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>powerless individual can be linked in </v>

597
00:36:25.351 --> 00:36:27.300
<v Speaker 4>some manner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That time of history as a whole,</v>

598
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:32.270
<v Speaker 4>no longer so sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've read much about evil,</v>

599
00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:33.933
<v Speaker 4>perpetration and growth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I no longer convinced that each of </v>

600
00:36:35.921 --> 00:36:36.754
<v Speaker 4>us are so innocent or harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is of course a logical to presume </v>

601
00:36:39.911 --> 00:36:40.744
<v Speaker 4>that one person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one speck of dust among the 4 billion </v>

602
00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:47.320
<v Speaker 4>modes is there any sense responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 4>the horrible course of human events,</v>

603
00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:50.590
<v Speaker 4>but that course itself is not logical </v>
<v Speaker 4>far from it,</v>

604
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:54.520
<v Speaker 4>and it seems likely that it depends on </v>
<v Speaker 4>processes that we do not understand.</v>

605
00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.753
<v Speaker 4>Jeffrey Burton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russell argues in his work on the </v>

606
00:36:59.471 --> 00:37:00.304
<v Speaker 4>history of the concept of the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the classic distinction drawn </v>

607
00:37:03.011 --> 00:37:05.650
<v Speaker 4>between Natural Evil and moral evil is </v>
<v Speaker 4>untenable.</v>

608
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.730
<v Speaker 4>It'll currencies such as plagues and </v>
<v Speaker 4>earthquakes belong in the same category.</v>

609
00:37:09.731 --> 00:37:14.731
<v Speaker 4>Companies dance as concentration camps </v>
<v Speaker 4>on wards the existence of natural evil,</v>

610
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.790
<v Speaker 4>for which God is theoretically </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible,</v>

611
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:21.400
<v Speaker 4>has been used as evidence for the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>potent arguments for the nonexistence of</v>

612
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:22.263
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say you put the nonexistence of any </v>

613
00:37:24.941 --> 00:37:29.350
<v Speaker 4>meaning such as I outlined previously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the states.</v>

614
00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:35.040
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps the entire cosmos is not worth a</v>
<v Speaker 4>single innocent child suffering.</v>

615
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.090
<v Speaker 4>How can the universe be constructed so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that pain is permitted?</v>

616
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.450
<v Speaker 4>How can a good God allow for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>existence of a suffering world?</v>

617
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.960
<v Speaker 4>It seems reasonable to me to draw a </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinction between tragedy and tragedy,</v>

618
00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:52.830
<v Speaker 4>has an ennobling aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least influential has been constantly</v>

619
00:37:52.831 --> 00:37:55.050
<v Speaker 4>explored it to that and great literature</v>
<v Speaker 4>and mythology.</v>

620
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:58.230
<v Speaker 4>Tragedy exists where the heroic </v>
<v Speaker 4>encounters limitation,</v>

621
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.360
<v Speaker 4>evil by contrast is anything but no more</v>
<v Speaker 4>participation in Alex whose sole purpose</v>

622
00:38:05.431 --> 00:38:08.310
<v Speaker 4>is expansion of medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pain and suffering destroys character,</v>

623
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.190
<v Speaker 4>forthright encounter with tragedy might </v>
<v Speaker 4>increase it.</v>

624
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.800
<v Speaker 4>This is the meaning of the symbol of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>crucifixion.</v>

625
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.713
<v Speaker 4>It's Christ full participation in freely</v>
<v Speaker 4>chosen acceptance of his fate which he </v>

626
00:38:18.511 --> 00:38:19.344
<v Speaker 4>shares with everyone that enables him to</v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest his full identity with God and </v>

627
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:23.743
<v Speaker 4>it's that identity which enables him to </v>
<v Speaker 4>bear that fate and which strips over </v>

628
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:27.293
<v Speaker 4>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And conversely it is our voluntary </v>

629
00:38:30.631 --> 00:38:34.050
<v Speaker 4>demeaning of our own characters which </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes the necessary tragic conditions of</v>

630
00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:35.200
<v Speaker 4>existence of pure evil.</v>

631
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.003
<v Speaker 4>Where did these conditions exist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are we sending to unbearable </v>

632
00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:43.234
<v Speaker 4>limitation to paying disease and death </v>
<v Speaker 4>and cruelty at the hands of nature and </v>

633
00:38:46.571 --> 00:38:47.404
<v Speaker 4>society?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me that it is because of </v>

634
00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:54.901
<v Speaker 4>game cannot be played without rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God and man are in a sense twins,</v>

635
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.133
<v Speaker 4>so there's a mid rush and this means the</v>
<v Speaker 4>God made man because he lacked </v>

636
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.693
<v Speaker 4>limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could have everything we wanted </v>

637
00:39:03.191 --> 00:39:07.030
<v Speaker 4>merely for wishing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If every tool performed every job,</v>

638
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.870
<v Speaker 4>if everyone was omniscient and immortal </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everything would be the same,</v>

639
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:15.130
<v Speaker 4>same old powerful thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God and creation wouldn't exist.</v>

640
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:16.323
<v Speaker 4>It is the differences between things </v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a function of their specific </v>

641
00:39:19.121 --> 00:39:23.770
<v Speaker 4>limitations that allows them to exist at</v>
<v Speaker 4>all should they be.</v>

642
00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.640
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me that we answered this </v>
<v Speaker 4>question implicitly,</v>

643
00:39:27.641 --> 00:39:30.730
<v Speaker 4>but profoundly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we lose someone loved and grieve,</v>

644
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:32.643
<v Speaker 4>grieve presupposes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Having love presupposes the judgment </v>

645
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.903
<v Speaker 4>that this person specific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bounded and vulnerable existence was </v>

646
00:39:40.241 --> 00:39:42.400
<v Speaker 4>valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was something that should have been.</v>

647
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.770
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Question lingers,</v>

648
00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.740
<v Speaker 4>why you shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things even loved things exist at all if</v>

649
00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:50.350
<v Speaker 4>they're necessarily limitations caused </v>
<v Speaker 4>such suffering.</v>

650
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:53.953
<v Speaker 4>I dreamed I was walking out of a deep </v>
<v Speaker 4>valley along the paved two lane highway </v>

651
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:57.853
<v Speaker 4>highway was located in northern Alberta </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I grew up and came out of the </v>

652
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:01.543
<v Speaker 4>valley for miles around and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep flat prairie asked the man </v>

653
00:40:05.061 --> 00:40:07.220
<v Speaker 4>hitchhiking could see another in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>distance.</v>

654
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.273
<v Speaker 4>As I approached him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could see that he was in the first </v>

655
00:40:10.371 --> 00:40:12.710
<v Speaker 4>stages of old age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he looked terribly strong.</v>

656
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.963
<v Speaker 4>Someone passed them in a car driving the</v>
<v Speaker 4>opposite direction and a female voice </v>

657
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.720
<v Speaker 4>yelled out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

658
00:40:17.721 --> 00:40:18.554
<v Speaker 4>he has a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was carrying what looked like a </v>

659
00:40:20.601 --> 00:40:23.510
<v Speaker 4>wooden handle kitchen knife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well worn and discolored,</v>

660
00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.000
<v Speaker 4>and it had a blade at least two and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>half feet long.</v>

661
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.210
<v Speaker 4>Cross the shoulder strap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the large leather sheath.</v>

662
00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.480
<v Speaker 4>He was walking along the edge of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>highway,</v>

663
00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.353
<v Speaker 4>muttering to himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had swinging the leg jerky and chaotic </v>

664
00:40:34.731 --> 00:40:35.564
<v Speaker 4>fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looked like the landlord lived next </v>

665
00:40:37.731 --> 00:40:40.850
<v Speaker 4>door to me when I was a graduate student</v>
<v Speaker 4>living in a poor district in Montreal.</v>

666
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:43.760
<v Speaker 4>My landlord was a powerful aging x </v>
<v Speaker 4>biker,</v>

667
00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.210
<v Speaker 4>former president of the local hell's </v>
<v Speaker 4>angels chapter by his own account.</v>

668
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.910
<v Speaker 4>He spent some time in prison as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>younger man.</v>

669
00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:50.893
<v Speaker 4>He's settled down somewhat typically as </v>
<v Speaker 4>he became more mature and had brought </v>

670
00:40:53.361 --> 00:40:56.600
<v Speaker 4>his drinking under control for a time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His wife committed suicide.</v>

671
00:40:56.601 --> 00:40:57.434
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I lived there and he went back to </v>

672
00:40:58.771 --> 00:40:59.690
<v Speaker 4>him as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ways,</v>

673
00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:03.550
<v Speaker 4>he often went on binge drinking sprees </v>
<v Speaker 4>and spent all the money he earned in the</v>

674
00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.810
<v Speaker 4>electronic shop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ran out of a small apartment.</v>

675
00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:06.973
<v Speaker 4>He would drink 40 or even $50 in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>single day and would return home in the </v>

676
00:41:10.251 --> 00:41:11.330
<v Speaker 4>evening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blind drunk,</v>

677
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:12.710
<v Speaker 4>howling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows little dawn,</v>

678
00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.870
<v Speaker 4>laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kissing between his teeth,</v>

679
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:17.390
<v Speaker 4>incoherent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good natured still,</v>

680
00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.000
<v Speaker 4>but able to become violent at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>slightest provocation,</v>

681
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.100
<v Speaker 4>took me once to his favorite haunts and </v>
<v Speaker 4>slightly better condition on his 1200 cc</v>

682
00:41:25.101 --> 00:41:25.934
<v Speaker 4>Honda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which had the acceleration of a jet </v>

683
00:41:26.821 --> 00:41:28.160
<v Speaker 4>plane for short distances.</v>

684
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.100
<v Speaker 4>We perched precariously on the back of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his bike,</v>

685
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:32.840
<v Speaker 4>clinging to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wearing his wife's,</v>

686
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:38.260
<v Speaker 4>which settled my head ridiculously as it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was at least five sizes too small drunk.</v>

687
00:41:38.271 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 4>He was almost in a singly destructive </v>
<v Speaker 4>and ended up in fights constantly,</v>

688
00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.980
<v Speaker 4>unavoidably because he wouldn't take </v>
<v Speaker 4>slights from people whose paths crossed,</v>

689
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.220
<v Speaker 4>who were insufficiently cautious in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation with him.</v>

690
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.103
<v Speaker 4>I heard by this figure he seemed upset </v>
<v Speaker 4>that no one would stop and pick them up </v>

691
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.970
<v Speaker 4>as if he were unaware of the dangers </v>
<v Speaker 4>posed.</v>

692
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 4>As I went by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His gaze fell on me and he started after</v>

693
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:02.120
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not from anger or for desire,</v>

694
00:42:02.121 --> 00:42:03.350
<v Speaker 4>for companionship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

695
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.440
<v Speaker 4>but he was too unpredictable for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't fast.</v>

696
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:08.300
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stayed ahead of him on the road.</v>

697
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.770
<v Speaker 4>Scene shifted and I wielding figure </v>
<v Speaker 4>nine.</v>

698
00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.820
<v Speaker 4>We're now on opposite sides of a huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>tree.</v>

699
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.013
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 yards in diameter on a spiral </v>

700
00:42:17.391 --> 00:42:18.590
<v Speaker 4>staircase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wander around,</v>

701
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:20.510
<v Speaker 4>wound around the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the depths below,</v>

702
00:42:20.511 --> 00:42:23.390
<v Speaker 4>into the heights above the staircase was</v>
<v Speaker 4>made out of old,</v>

703
00:42:23.391 --> 00:42:24.350
<v Speaker 4>worn dark wood.</v>

704
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.553
<v Speaker 4>Reminded me of the church pews in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>church I attended with my mother as a </v>

705
00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:30.620
<v Speaker 4>child where I was married.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His figure was looking for me.</v>

706
00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.100
<v Speaker 4>He's a long way back and I hit myself </v>
<v Speaker 4>from this view</v>

707
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:37.123
<v Speaker 4>as I send them the staircase.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember wanting to continue in my </v>

708
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:39.944
<v Speaker 4>original journey out of the valley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the flats around the plane with </v>

709
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:43.514
<v Speaker 4>the walking would be easy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the only way to stay away from the </v>

710
00:42:45.801 --> 00:42:49.580
<v Speaker 4>knife was to continue up the staircase </v>
<v Speaker 4>up the axis Mundi.</v>

711
00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:53.120
<v Speaker 4>That's awareness of death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The grim reaper,</v>

712
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:54.283
<v Speaker 4>terrible face of God compels us </v>
<v Speaker 4>inexorably upward towards the </v>

713
00:42:58.011 --> 00:42:58.844
<v Speaker 4>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sufficiently heightened to bear the </v>

714
00:42:59.991 --> 00:43:00.824
<v Speaker 4>thought.</v>

715
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.330
<v Speaker 4>The point of our limitations is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering.</v>

716
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.793
<v Speaker 4>It's existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Excel point of evil by contrast is </v>

717
00:43:10.051 --> 00:43:13.910
<v Speaker 4>conscious destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest desire for increase of pain,</v>

718
00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.053
<v Speaker 4>anxiety and suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've been granted the capacity to </v>

719
00:43:19.401 --> 00:43:21.860
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily bear the terrible weight of </v>
<v Speaker 4>our mortality,</v>

720
00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.253
<v Speaker 4>returned from that capacity and degrade </v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves because we're afraid of </v>

721
00:43:25.251 --> 00:43:26.084
<v Speaker 4>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the necessarily tragic </v>

722
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.830
<v Speaker 4>preconditions of existence are </v>
<v Speaker 4>intolerable.</v>

723
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.493
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps we could reserve answer to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>question of God's nature is </v>

724
00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:38.420
<v Speaker 4>responsibility for the presence of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>evil and creation.</v>

725
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:40.430
<v Speaker 4>Until we have solved the problem of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>own,</v>

726
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.953
<v Speaker 4>perhaps we could tolerate the horrors of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world if we left our characters in </v>

727
00:43:44.691 --> 00:43:45.524
<v Speaker 4>intact and develop them to the fullest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we took full advantage of every gift </v>

728
00:43:48.621 --> 00:43:49.454
<v Speaker 4>we've been granted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps the world would not look </v>

729
00:43:51.051 --> 00:43:55.070
<v Speaker 4>horrible that it seems to me that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not the earthquake,</v>

730
00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.800
<v Speaker 4>a flood or the cancer that makes life </v>
<v Speaker 4>intolerable,</v>

731
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.963
<v Speaker 4>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As those events appear who seemed </v>

732
00:44:00.711 --> 00:44:02.750
<v Speaker 4>capable of withstanding natural </v>
<v Speaker 4>disaster,</v>

733
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.290
<v Speaker 4>even if responding to that disaster in </v>
<v Speaker 4>an honorable and decent manner,</v>

734
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:08.083
<v Speaker 4>it is instead the pointless suffering </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we inflict upon each other that </v>

735
00:44:10.311 --> 00:44:12.500
<v Speaker 4>makes life appear corrupt beyond </v>
<v Speaker 4>acceptability,</v>

736
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:14.570
<v Speaker 4>and that undermines our ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest,</v>

737
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:15.413
<v Speaker 4>save faith in our central nature that </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes us work even more diligently for </v>

738
00:44:19.161 --> 00:44:21.170
<v Speaker 4>the destruction of everything that lives</v>
<v Speaker 4>and breathes.</v>

739
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.433
<v Speaker 4>It said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be therefore perfect as your father in </v>

740
00:44:26.661 --> 00:44:27.494
<v Speaker 4>heaven is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How seems stymied has always by as </v>

741
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 4>pilots are running query.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is truth?</v>

742
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if we don't know precisely what the</v>

743
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:42.360
<v Speaker 4>truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can certainly tell each of us what it</v>

744
00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:43.203
<v Speaker 4>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't greed and the desire above all </v>

745
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:48.340
<v Speaker 4>else for constant material game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't denial.</v>

746
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.193
<v Speaker 4>I've experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know full well to be real and the </v>

747
00:44:51.391 --> 00:44:53.970
<v Speaker 4>infliction of pain for the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pain,</v>

748
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.530
<v Speaker 4>it appears possible to stop doing those </v>
<v Speaker 4>things which we know beyond doubt,</v>

749
00:44:58.531 --> 00:44:59.364
<v Speaker 4>to be wrong and to become self </v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplined and honest and maybe </v>

750
00:45:02.761 --> 00:45:06.310
<v Speaker 4>therefore to become able to perceive the</v>
<v Speaker 4>nature of the positive group</v>

751
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.113
<v Speaker 4>maturity seems painfully simple,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so simple that it's a miracle of sorts </v>

752
00:45:12.211 --> 00:45:16.290
<v Speaker 4>that can ever be forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love God with all thy mind and all I and</v>

753
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:20.670
<v Speaker 4>all that heart sort of truth above all </v>
<v Speaker 4>and treat your fellow man as if you were</v>

754
00:45:20.671 --> 00:45:23.580
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not with a pity that undermines his self</v>

755
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:26.240
<v Speaker 4>respect and not with a justice that </v>
<v Speaker 4>elevates yourself above you,</v>

756
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:29.980
<v Speaker 4>but as it corrupted divinity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a light to the center,</v>

757
00:45:29.981 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 4>it's more difficult to rule oneself in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the city.</v>

758
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.263
<v Speaker 4>And this isn't a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is truth as literal as it can be </v>

759
00:45:35.701 --> 00:45:36.534
<v Speaker 4>made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is precisely for this reason that </v>

760
00:45:38.011 --> 00:45:41.570
<v Speaker 4>we're always trying to rule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The city is a perversion of pride.</v>

761
00:45:41.571 --> 00:45:42.404
<v Speaker 4>To see praying in public and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clean up the dust under our feet and </v>

762
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.393
<v Speaker 4>staff seems too mundane to treat those </v>
<v Speaker 4>we actually faced with respect and </v>

763
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:51.960
<v Speaker 4>dignity when we can be active against in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the street.</v>

764
00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.550
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's more important to strengthen </v>
<v Speaker 4>our characters that to repair the world.</v>

765
00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.590
<v Speaker 4>So much of that reputation seemed self.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Channing is selfishness and intellectual</v>

766
00:46:01.591 --> 00:46:02.424
<v Speaker 4>pride masquerading as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Creating a world polluted with good </v>

767
00:46:04.771 --> 00:46:05.604
<v Speaker 4>works</v>

768
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:06.793
<v Speaker 3>don't work</v>

769
00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:11.663
<v Speaker 4>who couldn't believe that it is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>little choices that we make everyday </v>

770
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.033
<v Speaker 4>between good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but turn the world to waste and hope to </v>

771
00:46:15.661 --> 00:46:16.494
<v Speaker 4>despair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is the case we see are immense </v>

772
00:46:19.471 --> 00:46:20.304
<v Speaker 4>capacity for evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly realize before us and great </v>

773
00:46:22.861 --> 00:46:25.800
<v Speaker 4>things and then small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can never seem to realize our infinite</v>

774
00:46:25.801 --> 00:46:29.220
<v Speaker 4>capacity for good can argue with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>soldiers.</v>

775
00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:32.850
<v Speaker 4>And when he states one man who stops </v>
<v Speaker 4>lying can bring tyranny.</v>

776
00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.810
<v Speaker 4>Christ said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Kingdom of Heaven is spread out,</v>

777
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:39.300
<v Speaker 4>spread out upon the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but men do not see it.</v>

778
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:41.003
<v Speaker 4>What if this were in fact the case?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if it was nothing but our self </v>

779
00:46:43.651 --> 00:46:44.880
<v Speaker 4>deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cowardice,</v>

780
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:47.550
<v Speaker 4>hatred and fear of polluted our </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience?</v>

781
00:46:47.551 --> 00:46:48.384
<v Speaker 4>And turn the world into hell hypothesis </v>
<v Speaker 4>at least at least as good as any other </v>

782
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:57.480
<v Speaker 4>admirable and capable of generating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't we make the experiment?</v>

783
00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.640
<v Speaker 4>Find out if it is true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to read you something else.</v>

784
00:47:14.911 --> 00:47:16.700
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>

785
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:17.843
<v Speaker 4>This is another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a description of the dream that </v>

786
00:47:21.391 --> 00:47:26.391
<v Speaker 4>I collected from my nephew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll read you the story about it because</v>

787
00:47:26.731 --> 00:47:28.530
<v Speaker 4>it's related to</v>

788
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.200
<v Speaker 2>the experiment that I was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>describing,</v>

789
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:34.670
<v Speaker 3>right</v>

790
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:38.600
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis that I was trying to generate</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that chapter was that,</v>

791
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:40.063
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

792
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:41.573
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're treating someone in </v>

793
00:47:42.451 --> 00:47:43.284
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy for an anxiety disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically means treating them </v>

794
00:47:47.191 --> 00:47:50.670
<v Speaker 2>because they're too afraid to continue </v>
<v Speaker 2>living their life in the way that it has</v>

795
00:47:50.671 --> 00:47:55.671
<v Speaker 2>to be lived even for it to continue it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It appears beyond reasonable doubt.</v>

796
00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Now that</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempting to convince the person of the</v>

797
00:48:02.191 --> 00:48:03.024
<v Speaker 2>unreality of their fear or of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unreality of the category of things to </v>

798
00:48:06.601 --> 00:48:10.140
<v Speaker 2>be afraid of is not useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't people do not respond to that?</v>

799
00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:14.280
<v Speaker 2>You can't talk someone out of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotic beliefs.</v>

800
00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:16.973
<v Speaker 2>All you can do is help them learn to </v>
<v Speaker 2>confront those things that terrify them </v>

801
00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:23.960
<v Speaker 2>and then perhaps what they learned is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can confront those things,</v>

802
00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:24.893
<v Speaker 2>terrify them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't learn that the thing itself </v>

803
00:48:26.221 --> 00:48:27.054
<v Speaker 2>is any less terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they seem to learn that their own </v>

804
00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:32.460
<v Speaker 2>conception of themselves with so </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathologically limited this,</v>

805
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:35.943
<v Speaker 2>that it was that conception that was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact leading to their to their </v>

806
00:48:38.591 --> 00:48:39.424
<v Speaker 2>discomfort because the neurotic person </v>
<v Speaker 2>who runs from everything that he or she </v>

807
00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:43.624
<v Speaker 2>is afraid of is possibly to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is that they are in essence </v>

808
00:48:46.931 --> 00:48:51.790
<v Speaker 2>is something so trivial that it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up to negative emotion and prevail</v>

809
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:52.833
<v Speaker 2>and in therapy what you do is structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>the situation so that the person can </v>

810
00:48:55.601 --> 00:48:58.780
<v Speaker 2>learn as a consequence of their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

811
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:01.570
<v Speaker 2>not a consequence of the therapists </v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

812
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Then if they're brave enough to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they can tolerate,</v>

813
00:49:04.991 --> 00:49:05.824
<v Speaker 2>looking at the devil in fact get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's so interesting </v>

814
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:09.394
<v Speaker 2>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's mysterious even from the </v>

815
00:49:10.901 --> 00:49:11.734
<v Speaker 2>standard psychoanalytic viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when you do so when you do that </v>

816
00:49:14.231 --> 00:49:15.064
<v Speaker 2>to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their ability to withstand fear </v>

817
00:49:17.351 --> 00:49:18.184
<v Speaker 2>generalizes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that if you teach them to </v>

818
00:49:19.751 --> 00:49:23.050
<v Speaker 2>withstand fear in one situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're better at doing it in other</v>

819
00:49:23.051 --> 00:49:26.230
<v Speaker 2>situations and their fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's symbolic underneath,</v>

820
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:27.610
<v Speaker 2>doesn't multiply everywhere.</v>

821
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:32.320
<v Speaker 2>That you haven't exposed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they may also get more confident,</v>

822
00:49:32.321 --> 00:49:34.530
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their interpersonal relationships and</v>

823
00:49:34.531 --> 00:49:35.364
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a very common contaminant of </v>

824
00:49:36.521 --> 00:49:39.010
<v Speaker 2>exposure therapy for agoraphobic women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

825
00:49:39.011 --> 00:49:39.844
<v Speaker 2>Then they start standing up to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>husbands because of course prior to </v>

826
00:49:42.161 --> 00:49:42.994
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their husbands were categorized in the </v>

827
00:49:44.441 --> 00:49:45.274
<v Speaker 2>category of all those things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>too terrible to face and what the </v>

828
00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:48.964
<v Speaker 2>therapist is teaching the client.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if the therapist doesn't know it </v>

829
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.100
<v Speaker 2>explicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you are the sort of creature who</v>

830
00:49:54.101 --> 00:49:54.934
<v Speaker 2>is capable of standing off to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>category of all things that are too </v>

831
00:49:57.221 --> 00:49:59.770
<v Speaker 2>terrible to face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all you have to do is give it a shot</v>

832
00:49:59.771 --> 00:50:01.270
<v Speaker 2>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is basically.</v>

833
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.673
<v Speaker 2>Which is to say basically that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to manifest some behavioral faith in </v>

834
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:06.694
<v Speaker 2>yourself and you can discover that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>by yourself and that's as far as I can </v>

835
00:50:09.341 --> 00:50:10.174
<v Speaker 2>tell and I've looked at different </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality theories and different </v>

836
00:50:12.371 --> 00:50:15.820
<v Speaker 2>theories of psychotherapy and me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tend to boil down to the same thing</v>

837
00:50:15.821 --> 00:50:20.380
<v Speaker 2>in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That same thing is that,</v>

838
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:22.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

839
00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:26.170
<v Speaker 2>you need a coherent theory about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are about and second of all,</v>

840
00:50:26.171 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 2>that exposure to the things that</v>

841
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.210
<v Speaker 4>frightened you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cures you.</v>

842
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.150
<v Speaker 4>There's a now chemical dictum that </v>
<v Speaker 4>according to you and was the primary all</v>

843
00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:42.400
<v Speaker 4>chemical dictum in steer clear linear </v>
<v Speaker 4>inventory.</v>

844
00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:45.650
<v Speaker 4>I hope that's pronounced right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my Latin isn't any good.</v>

845
00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:51.050
<v Speaker 4>The translation for that is it is found </v>
<v Speaker 4>incest pools and that was the El Kevin.</v>

846
00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:56.240
<v Speaker 4>That was the alchemists general theory </v>
<v Speaker 4>about where the philosopher's stone list</v>

847
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:57.074
<v Speaker 4>to be found and the philosopher's stone </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a material substance in theory that </v>

848
00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:04.070
<v Speaker 4>possess the power to grantee turtle </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

849
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:08.020
<v Speaker 4>but also to bring about eternal health </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you and.</v>

850
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:09.230
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in other words,</v>

851
00:51:09.231 --> 00:51:10.850
<v Speaker 4>it was a thing that would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Granted,</v>

852
00:51:10.851 --> 00:51:11.684
<v Speaker 4>they're all the wishes and the chemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>notion when you can find this thing </v>

853
00:51:17.361 --> 00:51:21.980
<v Speaker 4>where no one will look and what that </v>
<v Speaker 4>also means from the personal perspective</v>

854
00:51:21.981 --> 00:51:25.490
<v Speaker 4>is where you will look well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a strange notion,</v>

855
00:51:25.491 --> 00:51:26.324
<v Speaker 4>but it's a bit more comprehensible if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you start to think about it from the </v>

856
00:51:28.791 --> 00:51:29.624
<v Speaker 4>psychological perspective rather than </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the empirical perspective because </v>

857
00:51:32.241 --> 00:51:33.074
<v Speaker 4>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

858
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:38.950
<v Speaker 4>even though the places that we won't </v>
<v Speaker 4>look differ from person to person,</v>

859
00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:42.090
<v Speaker 4>from the perspective of a natural </v>
<v Speaker 4>category,</v>

860
00:51:42.091 --> 00:51:42.924
<v Speaker 4>it might be reasonable to pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that place where one will not look </v>

861
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:51.200
<v Speaker 4>is similar in some sense across </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals,</v>

862
00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:52.203
<v Speaker 4>which is only to say that all of us have</v>
<v Speaker 4>those particular things that we're </v>

863
00:51:56.481 --> 00:51:59.060
<v Speaker 4>afraid of facing and the particular is </v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

864
00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:03.470
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that those things exist is </v>
<v Speaker 4>standard across people.</v>

865
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:09.300
<v Speaker 4>King Arthur is night sitting around </v>
<v Speaker 4>table because they're all equal.</v>

866
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:10.613
<v Speaker 4>They set off to look for the holy grail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a symbol of salvation </v>

867
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:17.550
<v Speaker 4>symbolically container of the nourishing</v>
<v Speaker 4>blood of Christ,</v>

868
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:21.510
<v Speaker 4>which is another reference to </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrificial symbolism,</v>

869
00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:22.763
<v Speaker 4>keeper of redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Each night leaves on his quest </v>

870
00:52:24.631 --> 00:52:27.670
<v Speaker 4>individually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Each night enters the forest to begin to</v>

871
00:52:27.671 --> 00:52:29.730
<v Speaker 4>search at the point it looks darkest to </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

872
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.350
<v Speaker 4>When I was about halfway through reading</v>
<v Speaker 4>this manuscript,</v>

873
00:52:34.351 --> 00:52:36.270
<v Speaker 4>I went to visit my sister in law and her</v>
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>

874
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:39.660
<v Speaker 4>She had a son,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my nephew who's about five years old.</v>

875
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:40.913
<v Speaker 4>It's very verbal and intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was deeply immersed in a pretend </v>

876
00:52:44.101 --> 00:52:48.370
<v Speaker 4>world and like to dress up as a night </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a plastic helmet and sword</v>

877
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:50.873
<v Speaker 4>Martech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was happy during the day to all </v>

878
00:52:54.031 --> 00:52:56.940
<v Speaker 4>appearances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but didn't sleep well at night,</v>

879
00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.040
<v Speaker 4>had been having nightmares for some </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

880
00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:00.143
<v Speaker 4>He regularly screened for his mom in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>middle of his rest and appeared quite </v>

881
00:53:02.371 --> 00:53:04.560
<v Speaker 4>agitated by what was going on in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>nightmares.</v>

882
00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:08.250
<v Speaker 4>This was a daily occurrence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially enough so that the household</v>

883
00:53:08.251 --> 00:53:11.710
<v Speaker 4>was being disrupted</v>
<v Speaker 4>or house.</v>

884
00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:13.950
<v Speaker 4>One morning after woken up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he dreamed about,</v>

885
00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:15.593
<v Speaker 4>he told me in the presence of his family</v>
<v Speaker 4>that dwarf like beat creatures who came </v>

886
00:53:20.041 --> 00:53:21.520
<v Speaker 4>up to his knees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have been jumping,</v>

887
00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:22.883
<v Speaker 4>jumping up at him and biting him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting was just looking through </v>

888
00:53:25.951 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 4>some</v>

889
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:26.963
<v Speaker 2>mythological imagery on the weekend and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I found out that that while there is </v>

890
00:53:31.191 --> 00:53:35.160
<v Speaker 2>some archeological notions and don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know how valid they are,</v>

891
00:53:35.161 --> 00:53:35.994
<v Speaker 2>that there was a point in European </v>
<v Speaker 2>history where worship of the mother </v>

892
00:53:39.661 --> 00:53:40.494
<v Speaker 2>goddess was very widespread and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures that performed this worship </v>

893
00:53:43.281 --> 00:53:47.430
<v Speaker 2>word then overrun by patriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures later and patriarchal religions</v>

894
00:53:47.431 --> 00:53:49.170
<v Speaker 2>replaced these early matriarchal </v>
<v Speaker 2>religions.</v>

895
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:50.453
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar theories to that like bio </v>

896
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:55.823
<v Speaker 2>conference theory that human race was </v>
<v Speaker 2>once matriarchal and then was later </v>

897
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:04.491
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal have been discredited in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past and I'm not so sure that this isn't</v>

898
00:54:04.531 --> 00:54:08.400
<v Speaker 2>just a projection of mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure onto history,</v>

899
00:54:08.401 --> 00:54:11.310
<v Speaker 2>which happens very often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

900
00:54:11.311 --> 00:54:12.144
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are doesn't matter to this </v>

901
00:54:13.411 --> 00:54:15.150
<v Speaker 2>discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it matters.</v>

902
00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:17.183
<v Speaker 2>Many of these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are very many ancient images of </v>

903
00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.660
<v Speaker 2>goddess figures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've looked at some of them and I found</v>

904
00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:22.494
<v Speaker 2>out this week and that many of them are </v>
<v Speaker 2>figures of their fingers off the </v>

905
00:54:26.161 --> 00:54:28.980
<v Speaker 2>combination of a woman's body without </v>
<v Speaker 2>burden.</v>

906
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the figure has wings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it has a beat had.</v>

907
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:34.643
<v Speaker 2>It's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess this would be an example of </v>

908
00:54:37.471 --> 00:54:40.860
<v Speaker 2>synchronicity because I've been thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this.</v>

909
00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I just saw the movie crumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have any.</v>

910
00:54:43.021 --> 00:54:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that David Lynch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should all see that by the way,</v>

911
00:54:46.291 --> 00:54:47.124
<v Speaker 2>because it's first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting study of of an </v>

912
00:54:49.981 --> 00:54:53.100
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily pathological family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three brothers,</v>

913
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:54.263
<v Speaker 2>one who molests women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his bum in the streets of San Francisco </v>

914
00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.680
<v Speaker 2>who also sits on beds of nails and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a very ascetic attitude.</v>

915
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:04.440
<v Speaker 2>Another man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 years old,</v>

916
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.333
<v Speaker 2>never left home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never slept with any women depressed </v>

917
00:55:07.591 --> 00:55:10.440
<v Speaker 2>since he was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Multiple suicidal finding,</v>

918
00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:11.274
<v Speaker 2>kills himself a year after the movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>made and this other brother named crumb </v>

919
00:55:14.491 --> 00:55:15.324
<v Speaker 2>who's a famous underground cartoonist </v>
<v Speaker 2>who produces a lot of the images while </v>

920
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:23.100
<v Speaker 2>he perceives himself in relation to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ship to women in general as a small,</v>

921
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.173
<v Speaker 2>thin outcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of figured who tends to clean the </v>

922
00:55:27.361 --> 00:55:28.194
<v Speaker 2>back of very large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful looking women who by the way </v>

923
00:55:30.511 --> 00:55:33.510
<v Speaker 2>often have bird heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I found very interesting.</v>

924
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.673
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these figures that popped up in my </v>

925
00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:37.410
<v Speaker 2>nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dreams,</v>

926
00:55:37.411 --> 00:55:40.710
<v Speaker 2>these dwarf like beat creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where were these sorts of,</v>

927
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:42.443
<v Speaker 2>are this archaic sort of image </v>
<v Speaker 2>representing the source of all things </v>

928
00:55:46.781 --> 00:55:47.491
<v Speaker 2>and while you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

929
00:55:47.491 --> 00:55:48.324
<v Speaker 2>why would it beeped goddess be a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation for the source of all </v>

930
00:55:50.731 --> 00:55:51.480
<v Speaker 2>things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

931
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.313
<v Speaker 2>it has something to do with the notion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole bunch of notions </v>

932
00:55:54.571 --> 00:55:57.570
<v Speaker 2>compiled all together that one is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild birds.</v>

933
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:58.463
<v Speaker 2>They fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's spiritual creatures because </v>

934
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:01.524
<v Speaker 2>they're associated with the air and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sky and so they have a masculine aspect </v>

935
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:06.260
<v Speaker 2>like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it goes to,</v>

936
00:56:06.261 --> 00:56:08.610
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a masculine aspect.</v>

937
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:12.590
<v Speaker 2>And the goddess of course is more a more</v>
<v Speaker 2>down to earth bakers.</v>

938
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:16.170
<v Speaker 2>So these figures represent the union of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposites,</v>

939
00:56:16.171 --> 00:56:19.660
<v Speaker 2>just like the dragon of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a serpent with wings anyway.</v>

940
00:56:19.661 --> 00:56:21.870
<v Speaker 2>So that's what pops up in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular dream.</v>

941
00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:23.190
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

942
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:25.810
<v Speaker 4>he told me in the presence of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>

943
00:56:25.811 --> 00:56:27.850
<v Speaker 4>the door,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like creatures</v>

944
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:32.680
<v Speaker 4>who came up to his knees had been </v>
<v Speaker 4>jumping up at him and biting him.</v>

945
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:34.083
<v Speaker 4>Each preacher was covered with hair and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Greece that had a cross shaved and the </v>

946
00:56:36.941 --> 00:56:37.774
<v Speaker 4>hair on the top of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dream also featured a dragon who </v>

947
00:56:40.571 --> 00:56:41.404
<v Speaker 4>breathed fire after the dragon exhaled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fire turned into these dwarves who </v>

948
00:56:45.771 --> 00:56:47.860
<v Speaker 4>multiplied endlessly with each breath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

949
00:56:47.861 --> 00:56:48.694
<v Speaker 4>that was a great image too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He told the dream in a very serious </v>

950
00:56:52.581 --> 00:56:54.470
<v Speaker 4>voice to his parents and to my wife and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

951
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:56.480
<v Speaker 4>and we were shocked by it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same Ingredient,</v>

952
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:57.343
<v Speaker 4>horror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really interesting to watch him </v>

953
00:56:59.871 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 4>because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

954
00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:03.671
<v Speaker 4>while I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

955
00:57:03.671 --> 00:57:05.800
<v Speaker 4>he was always reading around this little</v>
<v Speaker 4>night outfit anyway,</v>

956
00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:06.634
<v Speaker 4>so he's in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it was composed of is very </v>

957
00:57:08.351 --> 00:57:09.184
<v Speaker 4>imaginative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then as soon as we asked them about </v>

958
00:57:10.871 --> 00:57:11.704
<v Speaker 4>the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he just launched into it without </v>

959
00:57:12.731 --> 00:57:13.564
<v Speaker 4>a pause where you could almost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was almost as if you could see the </v>

960
00:57:15.401 --> 00:57:16.234
<v Speaker 4>imagery running in his head and he just </v>
<v Speaker 4>told the story with no with no </v>

961
00:57:18.521 --> 00:57:19.690
<v Speaker 4>hesitation whatsoever.</v>

962
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:22.960
<v Speaker 4>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other thing,</v>

963
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:25.690
<v Speaker 4>I guess that was what made so </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting to watch him was,</v>

964
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:28.630
<v Speaker 4>was that his attention moved from </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside world in and we're,</v>

965
00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:29.493
<v Speaker 4>all of us were obviously inside because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't focusing on anything when he </v>

966
00:57:32.321 --> 00:57:34.870
<v Speaker 4>was telling the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just letting the imagery run.</v>

967
00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:38.650
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dream occurred at a transition point</v>

968
00:57:38.651 --> 00:57:39.484
<v Speaker 4>in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was leaving his mother to go to </v>

969
00:57:41.561 --> 00:57:44.230
<v Speaker 4>kindergarten and was joining the social </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

970
00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:46.600
<v Speaker 4>The Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

971
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:50.710
<v Speaker 4>served as a source of fear itself for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the unknown.</v>

972
00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:52.000
<v Speaker 4>In general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a burroughs,</v>

973
00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:55.450
<v Speaker 4>while the doors were individual things </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be afraid of.</v>

974
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:58.660
<v Speaker 4>So you see the mythological imagery with</v>
<v Speaker 4>dragon of chaos,</v>

975
00:57:58.661 --> 00:57:59.494
<v Speaker 4>the grease fires standing in the back of</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything and it produces these things </v>

976
00:58:02.141 --> 00:58:04.510
<v Speaker 4>that have this Artek,</v>
<v Speaker 4>matriarchal nature,</v>

977
00:58:04.511 --> 00:58:07.650
<v Speaker 4>which is the unknown as it actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifests itself and experience,</v>

978
00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:11.050
<v Speaker 4>and so there's this eternal source and </v>
<v Speaker 4>as it breathes fire,</v>

979
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:15.010
<v Speaker 4>particular things that frightened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>frightened him would pop up.</v>

980
00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:15.843
<v Speaker 4>And the thing that I thought so </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting is there is hydro mythology </v>

981
00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:21.510
<v Speaker 4>and a two because hydro of course is </v>
<v Speaker 4>multi headed dragon.</v>

982
00:58:21.511 --> 00:58:22.344
<v Speaker 4>He kind of had me like seven more grow </v>
<v Speaker 4>all basically all that's a pretty </v>

983
00:58:25.861 --> 00:58:26.694
<v Speaker 4>accurate representation of the way life </v>
<v Speaker 4>progress is under some conditions </v>

984
00:58:30.151 --> 00:58:30.984
<v Speaker 4>because every time you solve a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some other problem pops up somewhere </v>

985
00:58:33.811 --> 00:58:35.670
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or sometimes when you solve a problem,</v>

986
00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:36.683
<v Speaker 4>the solution that you use to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem generates a whole bunch of new </v>

987
00:58:38.791 --> 00:58:39.624
<v Speaker 4>problems and the hydro mythology is </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically just a representation of the </v>

988
00:58:42.961 --> 00:58:47.880
<v Speaker 4>idea that no matter how much time he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>running around putting out fires,</v>

989
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:50.820
<v Speaker 4>new fires keep popping up all over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

990
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:51.743
<v Speaker 4>That will always be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also a representation of the fact </v>

991
00:58:54.811 --> 00:58:55.644
<v Speaker 4>that a political utopia that's conceived</v>
<v Speaker 4>of as a permanent state is impossible </v>

992
00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:59.633
<v Speaker 4>because when you generate a solution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the solution to these problems and </v>

993
00:59:03.301 --> 00:59:04.134
<v Speaker 4>there's no way you can stop that partly </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the solution does far more </v>

994
00:59:08.101 --> 00:59:10.740
<v Speaker 4>things than you would like it to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is why,</v>

995
00:59:10.741 --> 00:59:13.530
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs have so called side effects.</v>

996
00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:16.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean you have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you applied to drug to it.</v>

997
00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.180
<v Speaker 4>The drug produces all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>

998
00:59:18.181 --> 00:59:20.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean hopefully that are smaller than </v>
<v Speaker 4>the original problem,</v>

999
00:59:20.611 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes knows maybe there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger and it still remains to be seen,</v>

1000
00:59:25.041 --> 00:59:25.874
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where their television has solved more </v>

1001
00:59:27.051 --> 00:59:30.290
<v Speaker 4>progress in his creative mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes is the reverse,</v>

1002
00:59:30.291 --> 00:59:33.770
<v Speaker 4>but whatever the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things do all sorts of things.</v>

1003
00:59:33.771 --> 00:59:35.210
<v Speaker 4>Other than what you think they'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

1004
00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:38.283
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked him why he could do about this </v>

1005
00:59:40.541 --> 00:59:41.374
<v Speaker 4>dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said immediately I would take my dad </v>

1006
00:59:45.491 --> 00:59:46.324
<v Speaker 4>and we'd go after the dragon jumped on </v>
<v Speaker 4>his head and I poke out at size with my </v>

1007
00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:51.970
<v Speaker 4>sword.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I go down its throat where the fire</v>

1008
00:59:51.971 --> 00:59:52.804
<v Speaker 4>came out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cut the box out that the fire came </v>

1009
00:59:55.391 --> 00:59:58.080
<v Speaker 4>from and make a shield from it without </v>
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>

1010
00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:00.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean not really blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe that he could.</v>

1011
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:02.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean the idea of going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1012
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.170
<v Speaker 4>he blinded the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I thought was very interesting,</v>

1013
01:00:05.171 --> 01:00:09.040
<v Speaker 4>but then he went down his throat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean not steps showed you that video.</v>

1014
01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:10.300
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they go inside the whale.</v>

1015
01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1016
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.660
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a dream?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then there was a twist of brilliance</v>

1017
01:00:16.661 --> 01:00:21.040
<v Speaker 4>in this dream because he said that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing to do was to take the box that the</v>

1018
01:00:21.041 --> 01:00:21.874
<v Speaker 4>fire came from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was the source of the unknown </v>

1019
01:00:23.681 --> 01:00:24.514
<v Speaker 4>itself and transform it into something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he could actually use against the </v>

1020
01:00:27.971 --> 01:00:28.804
<v Speaker 4>unknown.</v>

1021
01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:31.640
<v Speaker 4>That idea is so brilliant that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>

1022
01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.553
<v Speaker 4>it's a miracle of sorts that it can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>reproduced in the dream of a five year </v>

1023
01:00:34.901 --> 01:00:35.734
<v Speaker 4>old because what it says is that what </v>
<v Speaker 4>what is necessarily used to go to where </v>

1024
01:00:38.621 --> 01:00:39.454
<v Speaker 4>fear itself resides without knowing </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself resides to identify with that </v>

1025
01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:46.870
<v Speaker 4>thing and to use it as a defense against</v>
<v Speaker 4>the unknown itself,</v>

1026
01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:48.183
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what we do all the time</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we adapt to the fact that there </v>

1027
01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:54.970
<v Speaker 4>isn't a milling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is to say that when something I've</v>

1028
01:00:54.971 --> 01:00:55.804
<v Speaker 4>known occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means when some new information </v>

1029
01:00:58.001 --> 01:01:00.640
<v Speaker 4>pops up because the two things are </v>
<v Speaker 4>precisely equivalent.</v>

1030
01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:05.260
<v Speaker 4>It's as a consequence of exploring that </v>
<v Speaker 4>new information that you generate,</v>

1031
01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:08.650
<v Speaker 4>new things that you can use to further </v>
<v Speaker 4>the process of adaptation.</v>

1032
01:01:08.651 --> 01:01:09.311
<v Speaker 4>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1033
01:01:09.311 --> 01:01:12.340
<v Speaker 4>the unknown is the source of all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>

1034
01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.593
<v Speaker 4>We know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also the source of all the </v>

1035
01:01:15.131 --> 01:01:15.964
<v Speaker 4>answers to the problems and it is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>case that while we use nature against </v>

1036
01:01:20.651 --> 01:01:21.730
<v Speaker 4>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>

1037
01:01:21.731 --> 01:01:25.450
<v Speaker 4>to to quote an ancient source that I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember.</v>

1038
01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.850
<v Speaker 4>That's the process of constructing </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>

1039
01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.410
<v Speaker 4>is we use the material world to defend </v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves against the material world.</v>

1040
01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:35.740
<v Speaker 4>And hopefully the balance remains on our</v>
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

1041
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:42.930
<v Speaker 4>He had reproved preproduced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an archaic hero myth in perfect form.</v>

1042
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:44.873
<v Speaker 4>I thought the use of making a shield </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the firebox or thought the idea of </v>

1043
01:01:47.431 --> 01:01:49.380
<v Speaker 4>maintenance shield from the firebox was </v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant.</v>

1044
01:01:49.770 --> 01:01:52.580
<v Speaker 4>This gave him the strength of the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 4>to use against the dragging</v>

1045
01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.043
<v Speaker 4>his nightmares ended at that point and </v>
<v Speaker 4>did not return even though he had been </v>

1046
01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:00.990
<v Speaker 4>suffering from them almost every night </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a number of months.</v>

1047
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.333
<v Speaker 4>I asked his mother about his treatments </v>
<v Speaker 4>more than a year later and she reported </v>

1048
01:02:05.011 --> 01:02:07.140
<v Speaker 4>no further disturbance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

1049
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.900
<v Speaker 4>many of you are going to find that hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>to believe that that's true.</v>

1050
01:02:09.901 --> 01:02:10.734
<v Speaker 4>That's actually what had occurred or you</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying the thing is he was having this </v>

1051
01:02:14.491 --> 01:02:15.600
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>

1052
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:19.110
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was plaguing him in his nightmares,</v>

1053
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:22.060
<v Speaker 4>whatever those composed of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>those were composed of.</v>

1054
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.153
<v Speaker 4>He was running around like a night </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to act out the solution or you </v>

1055
01:02:27.001 --> 01:02:31.290
<v Speaker 4>didn't quite have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was using his behavior in ritualistic</v>

1056
01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:35.160
<v Speaker 4>forum to address a problem about </v>
<v Speaker 4>adaptation which he couldn't manage,</v>

1057
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:36.413
<v Speaker 4>but as soon as he made the dream </v>
<v Speaker 4>explicit and then came up with a </v>

1058
01:02:38.401 --> 01:02:40.140
<v Speaker 4>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem disappeared.</v>

1059
01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:46.030
<v Speaker 4>The little boy guided by his </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagination,</v>

1060
01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:49.660
<v Speaker 4>adopted identification with the hero </v>
<v Speaker 4>faced his worst nightmare.</v>

1061
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.480
<v Speaker 4>If we're to survive individually and </v>
<v Speaker 4>socially,</v>

1062
01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:55.750
<v Speaker 4>each of us must do the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>trick.</v>

1063
01:02:55.850 --> 01:03:00.850
<v Speaker 4>Wiliness inventor in film will be found.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the prime alchemical victim.</v>

1064
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:04.900
<v Speaker 4>What do you need most is always to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>found where you least wish to look.</v>

1065
01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.393
<v Speaker 4>It's not a mythological statement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the only recognition of the fact </v>

1066
01:03:09.731 --> 01:03:10.564
<v Speaker 4>that in order to adapt to ongoing </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences necessary to make use of </v>

1067
01:03:14.951 --> 01:03:15.784
<v Speaker 4>every experience that you've had and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's only those experiences that you </v>

1068
01:03:18.881 --> 01:03:19.714
<v Speaker 4>haven't made use of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you determined are too terrifying </v>

1069
01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.720
<v Speaker 4>to contemplate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then as a logical consequences,</v>

1070
01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:25.554
<v Speaker 4>it's necessarily the case that all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those things that you're allowed to </v>

1071
01:03:27.851 --> 01:03:30.220
<v Speaker 4>state classified as too terrible to </v>
<v Speaker 4>contemplate,</v>

1072
01:03:30.221 --> 01:03:31.054
<v Speaker 4>do in fact contain all that information </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you need to survive because it is </v>

1073
01:03:34.721 --> 01:03:35.550
<v Speaker 4>their locked.</v>

1074
01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:37.660
<v Speaker 4>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's their lack of use.</v>

1075
01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.793
<v Speaker 4>That has actually resulted in you </v>
<v Speaker 4>constructing a personality that's too </v>

1076
01:03:41.621 --> 01:03:45.970
<v Speaker 4>trivial to to withstand the full weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>of your experience.</v>

1077
01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.500
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if something's bugging you,</v>

1078
01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like let's say you have,</v>

1079
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.840
<v Speaker 4>you have a situation with your parents </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's never been resolved.</v>

1080
01:03:53.841 --> 01:03:57.210
<v Speaker 4>It's like bugging you for who knows some</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that things like that funding for</v>

1081
01:03:57.211 --> 01:03:58.044
<v Speaker 4>like decades without ever facing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason it's bugging us because that's a </v>

1082
01:04:02.141 --> 01:04:05.710
<v Speaker 4>little chunk of the unknown that your </v>
<v Speaker 4>limbic system has detected so to speak,</v>

1083
01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:07.420
<v Speaker 4>and it's always popping it up saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1084
01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:09.020
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1085
01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.310
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look.</v>

1086
01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.900
<v Speaker 4>Here's some information you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>paying attention to.</v>

1087
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:13.973
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to pay attention to it </v>

1088
01:04:14.561 --> 01:04:16.060
<v Speaker 4>because it makes me anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1089
01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:17.170
<v Speaker 4>he asked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes them anxious.</v>

1090
01:04:17.171 --> 01:04:18.004
<v Speaker 4>That's how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the form that new information </v>

1091
01:04:19.631 --> 01:04:21.010
<v Speaker 4>always takes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1092
01:04:21.011 --> 01:04:23.770
<v Speaker 4>That's how it interests into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness to begin with as something</v>

1093
01:04:23.771 --> 01:04:24.760
<v Speaker 4>that makes you anxious.</v>

1094
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:25.833
<v Speaker 4>Of course you have any number of reasons</v>
<v Speaker 4>to move away from it since it makes you </v>

1095
01:04:28.121 --> 01:04:28.954
<v Speaker 4>anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is if you keep doing </v>

1096
01:04:30.491 --> 01:04:32.110
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you don't make use of all the.</v>

1097
01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:35.020
<v Speaker 4>All the novel experience on the question</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1098
01:04:35.021 --> 01:04:35.854
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would you move away from it instead </v>

1099
01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:38.860
<v Speaker 4>of facing it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1100
01:04:38.861 --> 01:04:39.694
<v Speaker 4>the answer to that is obviously because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't think that you're capable of </v>

1101
01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:43.653
<v Speaker 4>facing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is to say that you've defined </v>

1102
01:04:45.461 --> 01:04:48.220
<v Speaker 4>yourself in opposition to this thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>which is intolerable,</v>

1103
01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.233
<v Speaker 4>and the definition that you use is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I am too insignificant or weak or </v>

1104
01:04:52.901 --> 01:04:53.734
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inconsequential consequential or unable </v>

1105
01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:56.733
<v Speaker 4>to face this aspect of my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I know by my own rules actually </v>

1106
01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:02.464
<v Speaker 4>exists.</v>

1107
01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:04.873
<v Speaker 3>No</v>

1108
01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:10.780
<v Speaker 4>anomalous information brings terror and </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibility,</v>

1109
01:05:10.781 --> 01:05:15.220
<v Speaker 4>revolution and transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rejection of an unbearable facts stifles</v>

1110
01:05:15.221 --> 01:05:17.050
<v Speaker 4>adaptation and strangles life.</v>

1111
01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:23.510
<v Speaker 4>There was a good man who owned the </v>
<v Speaker 4>vineyard.</v>

1112
01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:26.130
<v Speaker 4>He leased it to tenant farmers so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they might work at.</v>

1113
01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:27.830
<v Speaker 4>Then he might collect the produce from </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1114
01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:28.813
<v Speaker 4>He sends his servant so the tenants </v>
<v Speaker 4>might be having the proper use of the </v>

1115
01:05:31.071 --> 01:05:34.230
<v Speaker 4>vineyard bases to serve and beat him all</v>
<v Speaker 4>week.</v>

1116
01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:37.100
<v Speaker 4>Telling him serving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Went back and told his master.</v>

1117
01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.710
<v Speaker 4>The master said perhaps they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognize him.</v>

1118
01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:43.010
<v Speaker 4>He sends another servant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tenants beat this one as well.</v>

1119
01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:46.910
<v Speaker 4>Then no one has said his son and said </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps they will show respect to my son</v>

1120
01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.980
<v Speaker 4>because of the tenants knew that it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>he who was heir to the vineyard.</v>

1121
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:55.700
<v Speaker 4>They seized him and killed him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but him who has ears hear Christ said,</v>

1122
01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.640
<v Speaker 4>show me the stone which the builders </v>
<v Speaker 4>have rejected that.</v>

1123
01:05:58.641 --> 01:05:59.690
<v Speaker 4>We'll use the cornerstone.</v>

1124
01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Thank</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1125
01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.730
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That particular story,</v>

1126
01:06:06.731 --> 01:06:10.380
<v Speaker 4>as one of the sources for the notion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the philosopher's stone says,</v>

1127
01:06:10.381 --> 01:06:13.030
<v Speaker 4>show me the stone which the builders </v>
<v Speaker 4>have rejected that.</v>

1128
01:06:13.031 --> 01:06:15.860
<v Speaker 4>What is the cornerstone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1129
01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:17.320
<v Speaker 4>it's a complicated story.</v>

1130
01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Was he in the Jewish temple?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The quarter stone was the stone that had</v>

1131
01:06:24.711 --> 01:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>the perfect dimensions with all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stones are based on that.</v>

1132
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:29.283
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1133
01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Jesus as the savior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Messiah,</v>

1134
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:34.780
<v Speaker 1>and he is the one that.</v>

1135
01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

1136
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:36.783
<v Speaker 4>I would say that's a yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's part of the symbolic structure </v>

1137
01:06:43.021 --> 01:06:46.680
<v Speaker 4>that surrounds the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The story in a sense has more.</v>

1138
01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:47.573
<v Speaker 4>It has a more</v>

1139
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.300
<v Speaker 2>straightforward interpretation in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of it.</v>

1140
01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.610
<v Speaker 2>The moral of that story means is two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1141
01:06:53.611 --> 01:06:56.280
<v Speaker 2>One is then whatever it is you reject is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that you need.</v>

1142
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:58.950
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what it is,</v>

1143
01:06:58.951 --> 01:06:59.784
<v Speaker 2>it's just the fact is that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make use of all the things that present </v>

1144
01:07:02.221 --> 01:07:06.030
<v Speaker 2>themselves to you whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 2>find the map actively tolerable.</v>

1145
01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Now we already know that you determined </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1146
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.113
<v Speaker 2>what's an effective tolerable as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of the value structure that </v>

1147
01:07:12.151 --> 01:07:13.050
<v Speaker 2>you were raped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1148
01:07:13.051 --> 01:07:17.730
<v Speaker 2>You're always analyzing phenomena in </v>
<v Speaker 2>reference to the goals that you perceive</v>

1149
01:07:17.731 --> 01:07:18.564
<v Speaker 2>as valid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so whether something is actively </v>

1150
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:21.081
<v Speaker 2>tolerable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1151
01:07:21.081 --> 01:07:21.914
<v Speaker 2>it depends to an immense degree on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of what's important and </v>

1152
01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:29.430
<v Speaker 2>it's maybe the case that certain things </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you appear intolerable because you're</v>

1153
01:07:29.431 --> 01:07:32.940
<v Speaker 2>unwilling to give up a value structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really pathological.</v>

1154
01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:33.923
<v Speaker 2>If you gave up the value structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing we looked unbearable wouldn't </v>

1155
01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:36.684
<v Speaker 2>be unbearable at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be positive so you can switch </v>

1156
01:07:38.701 --> 01:07:39.534
<v Speaker 2>the valence and things very rapidly by </v>
<v Speaker 2>just transforming the thing that you </v>

1157
01:07:41.701 --> 01:07:43.030
<v Speaker 2>believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1158
01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:43.903
<v Speaker 2>we already know that certain forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anomalous information have the capacity </v>

1159
01:07:47.341 --> 01:07:51.720
<v Speaker 2>to completely overthrow the philosophies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you use to evaluate events.</v>

1160
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.520
<v Speaker 1>What about the first part of that story </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the other story there?</v>

1161
01:07:54.521 --> 01:07:58.960
<v Speaker 1>That seems a little bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't quite see that they are one.</v>

1162
01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that idea of the story is saying,</v>

1163
01:08:03.461 --> 01:08:04.294
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these two events are precisely the same </v>

1164
01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:10.090
<v Speaker 2>is that if you define yourself as that </v>
<v Speaker 2>creature,</v>

1165
01:08:10.091 --> 01:08:15.091
<v Speaker 2>which is unable to accommodate two or </v>
<v Speaker 2>assimilate negative events,</v>

1166
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:16.263
<v Speaker 2>you've Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've abandoned your identification </v>

1167
01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:19.460
<v Speaker 2>with the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that means.</v>

1168
01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:20.413
<v Speaker 2>What did the individual characters </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolizing the story about the </v>

1169
01:08:22.041 --> 01:08:26.750
<v Speaker 2>vineyard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They symbolize?</v>

1170
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:28.423
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was trying to get at with </v>

1171
01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:30.460
<v Speaker 2>them with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1172
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:32.320
<v Speaker 2>the owner of the vineyard symbolizes </v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

1173
01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:33.423
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the story is trying to represent is </v>

1174
01:08:36.411 --> 01:08:39.350
<v Speaker 2>the idea that sacrifice of identity with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hero,</v>

1175
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:43.700
<v Speaker 2>which is equivalent to this death </v>
<v Speaker 2>internally is equivalent to rejection of</v>

1176
01:08:43.701 --> 01:08:47.390
<v Speaker 2>the novelist information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it means because it's.</v>

1177
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:48.583
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing that I've been trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to lay out describing the relationship </v>

1178
01:08:51.591 --> 01:08:55.070
<v Speaker 2>between the process that's represented </v>
<v Speaker 2>by Satan's Milton Satan.</v>

1179
01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.633
<v Speaker 2>There's no difference between saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing is to to intolerable to face </v>

1180
01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:06.500
<v Speaker 2>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am too little deface it.</v>

1181
01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.513
<v Speaker 2>Those are exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So removing yourself away from </v>

1182
01:09:11.001 --> 01:09:15.530
<v Speaker 2>information that you regard as to </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened to tolerate is identical to a</v>

1183
01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.720
<v Speaker 2>destruction of identification with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hero.</v>

1184
01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:19.330
<v Speaker 2>So why the two services?</v>

1185
01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.780
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're wondering what are the.</v>

1186
01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.990
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that from?</v>

1187
01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1188
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:29.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know actually what route.</v>

1189
01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:30.583
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

1190
01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.740
<v Speaker 1>What's</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1191
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1192
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:40.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I guess what those figures </v>

1193
01:09:42.561 --> 01:09:46.010
<v Speaker 2>represent his approximations to the hero</v>
<v Speaker 2>that which,</v>

1194
01:09:46.011 --> 01:09:48.440
<v Speaker 2>which would fit perfectly well and into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1195
01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.930
<v Speaker 2>into the interpretation that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>prophets.</v>

1196
01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.233
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what they like to hear hero </v>

1197
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:54.860
<v Speaker 2>even less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1198
01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:55.694
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't too thrilled with people </v>

1199
01:09:56.301 --> 01:10:00.930
<v Speaker 2>who approximated the hero precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that will.</v>

1200
01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.920
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a rare.</v>

1201
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:03.793
<v Speaker 2>It's referenced to the fact that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to devour people in groups tend to </v>

1202
01:10:06.951 --> 01:10:10.100
<v Speaker 2>devour those individuals upon which the </v>
<v Speaker 2>group actually depends.</v>

1203
01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:13.730
<v Speaker 2>And what this story is pointing out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

1204
01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:14.564
<v Speaker 2>is that that would even be the case if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they figured that constituted the </v>

1205
01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:19.203
<v Speaker 2>archetypical individual upon whom the </v>
<v Speaker 2>group depends appeared how people would </v>

1206
01:10:22.761 --> 01:10:24.890
<v Speaker 2>still be motivated to do precisely the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

1207
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:26.383
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1208
01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:32.933
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then the next thing which I really </v>

1209
01:10:35.551 --> 01:10:37.320
<v Speaker 2>don't have time to go into in much </v>
<v Speaker 2>detail,</v>

1210
01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:39.780
<v Speaker 2>so you have to read this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this will give you some,</v>

1211
01:10:40.050 --> 01:10:43.140
<v Speaker 2>some intimation of at least what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on and know.</v>

1212
01:10:43.141 --> 01:10:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

1213
01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.790
<v Speaker 2>while it's been my position </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally,</v>

1214
01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:51.660
<v Speaker 2>that people have paid an insufficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of attention to use writings.</v>

1215
01:10:51.810 --> 01:10:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're confusing,</v>

1216
01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.173
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give some reasons why that might be </v>

1217
01:10:56.161 --> 01:11:00.000
<v Speaker 2>the case in the manuscript.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of his students were women.</v>

1218
01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Most of them were outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>academic tradition.</v>

1219
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:03.383
<v Speaker 2>He discussed religious imagery to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>large degree in psychology tends to shy </v>

1220
01:11:06.481 --> 01:11:10.170
<v Speaker 2>away from any religious imagery because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very young scientists and it's just</v>

1221
01:11:10.171 --> 01:11:15.171
<v Speaker 2>dissociated itself from philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dominated by materialistic way more</v>

1222
01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:17.970
<v Speaker 2>materialists in psychology than there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in physics for example.</v>

1223
01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:19.763
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly the case with youngs </v>

1224
01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:25.440
<v Speaker 2>early writings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's even more dramatically the case</v>

1225
01:11:25.441 --> 01:11:26.274
<v Speaker 2>with his later writings and all his </v>
<v Speaker 2>later writings deal with alchemy and </v>

1226
01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:31.650
<v Speaker 2>nobody's been able to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell he was talking about.</v>

1227
01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Why spend all this time trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>decipher these l chemical writings,</v>

1228
01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.240
<v Speaker 2>but what was the trying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was young was trying to</v>

1229
01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.520
<v Speaker 2>outline was the symbolic representations</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the internal process that occurs when</v>

1230
01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:55.410
<v Speaker 2>people do precisely what my nephew in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this dream said that he should do,</v>

1231
01:11:55.830 --> 01:12:00.830
<v Speaker 2>which is to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the consequences of.</v>

1232
01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.020
<v Speaker 2>You can put it all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

1233
01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:09.260
<v Speaker 2>What are the consequences of admission </v>
<v Speaker 2>of error or what are the consequences of</v>

1234
01:12:09.421 --> 01:12:10.254
<v Speaker 2>identification with Harold?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or what are the consequences of the </v>

1235
01:12:13.771 --> 01:12:16.230
<v Speaker 2>adoption of a stance of religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>humility?</v>

1236
01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:17.363
<v Speaker 2>Because all those things piled together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually constitute the same </v>

1237
01:12:19.531 --> 01:12:21.540
<v Speaker 2>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you said was,</v>

1238
01:12:21.541 --> 01:12:22.374
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1239
01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:25.003
<v Speaker 2>it's possible for people to undergo </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutions in their cognitive </v>

1240
01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:31.700
<v Speaker 2>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that from Thomas Kuhn much later</v>

1241
01:12:31.701 --> 01:12:32.534
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is not only true for empirical </v>

1242
01:12:34.881 --> 01:12:37.820
<v Speaker 2>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also for moral structures so we know</v>

1243
01:12:37.821 --> 01:12:38.654
<v Speaker 2>that's the case and people have updated </v>
<v Speaker 2>their views of the world over and over </v>

1244
01:12:41.211 --> 01:12:42.044
<v Speaker 2>and what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you was trying to point out was </v>

1245
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:47.540
<v Speaker 2>that this could actually happen within </v>
<v Speaker 2>an individual and not only that it could</v>

1246
01:12:47.541 --> 01:12:48.374
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that it had happened many times in </v>

1247
01:12:49.821 --> 01:12:50.654
<v Speaker 2>the past and there was symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 2>representations of all the stages of </v>

1248
01:12:53.121 --> 01:12:53.954
<v Speaker 2>this particular process and most of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to be pretty familiar to you </v>

1249
01:12:56.781 --> 01:12:57.614
<v Speaker 2>already because I'd be trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>reference to them all the time in the </v>

1250
01:12:59.631 --> 01:13:04.280
<v Speaker 2>diagrams that I've been using you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically stated that there were 45</v>

1251
01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:07.493
<v Speaker 2>sequences of events</v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently intermingled in terms of the </v>

1252
01:13:12.961 --> 01:13:15.360
<v Speaker 2>narrative structure that characterized </v>
<v Speaker 2>the alchemy,</v>

1253
01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.513
<v Speaker 2>some more the alchemist trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>while they were people who possessed by </v>

1254
01:13:20.821 --> 01:13:23.910
<v Speaker 2>an intimation of the insufficiency of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the churches.</v>

1255
01:13:23.911 --> 01:13:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Rick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rick,</v>

1256
01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.800
<v Speaker 2>a representation of reality followed </v>
<v Speaker 2>their notion that there was still valued</v>

1257
01:13:32.291 --> 01:13:36.950
<v Speaker 2>to be apprehended in the interpretation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and discovery of matter.</v>

1258
01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:39.613
<v Speaker 2>The alchemists were the first scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a service knowing from the empirical </v>

1259
01:13:42.931 --> 01:13:46.920
<v Speaker 2>perspective because they didn't have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimental method method methodology,</v>

1260
01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:48.443
<v Speaker 2>but from the standpoint of interest </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were the first people who </v>

1261
01:13:51.041 --> 01:13:51.874
<v Speaker 2>were willing to pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That in this huge domain that had </v>

1262
01:13:54.391 --> 01:13:57.240
<v Speaker 2>essentially been outlawed as heretical </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the church,</v>

1263
01:13:57.570 --> 01:14:00.550
<v Speaker 2>something of interest still might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to be found.</v>

1264
01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:01.291
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

1265
01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:02.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Church says,</v>

1266
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.860
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of these historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>events,</v>

1267
01:14:04.861 --> 01:14:08.310
<v Speaker 2>humanity is being redeemed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The alchemists,</v>

1268
01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:09.630
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked around and said,</v>

1269
01:14:09.631 --> 01:14:11.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this redemption taking place,</v>

1270
01:14:11.651 --> 01:14:15.010
<v Speaker 2>things are still in pretty sad shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe there's something more going on</v>

1271
01:14:15.011 --> 01:14:15.190
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1272
01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Then we might that might meet the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All they become interested in.</v>

1273
01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.053
<v Speaker 2>So you want you almost trying to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to explain why it was that we developed </v>

1274
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:27.670
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially why developed in Europe.</v>

1275
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:29.143
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were the historical precedence to </v>

1276
01:14:31.841 --> 01:14:32.674
<v Speaker 2>the explosion of science in the last 500</v>
<v Speaker 2>years following the reasonably logical </v>

1277
01:14:37.451 --> 01:14:38.284
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis that something of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude was likely prepared by us at </v>

1278
01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:46.030
<v Speaker 2>least several centuries of previous </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought rather than just like coming out</v>

1279
01:14:46.031 --> 01:14:48.710
<v Speaker 2>of nowhere all of a sudden and only in </v>
<v Speaker 2>one culture so.</v>

1280
01:14:48.711 --> 01:14:49.544
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that preceded the </v>

1281
01:14:51.371 --> 01:14:55.330
<v Speaker 2>development of science was the notion </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the pursuit of</v>

1282
01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:59.560
<v Speaker 2>knowledge about material might in fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>be valuable.</v>

1283
01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:02.380
<v Speaker 2>So that's the hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>test the hypothesis,</v>

1284
01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:03.243
<v Speaker 2>the abundant life science is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigated the transformations of the </v>

1285
01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:08.044
<v Speaker 2>material world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might find some information of </v>

1286
01:15:09.911 --> 01:15:11.170
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>

1287
01:15:11.171 --> 01:15:13.330
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this first popped up in the form of what</v>

1288
01:15:13.331 --> 01:15:15.850
<v Speaker 2>might be regarded as a kind of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream,</v>

1289
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:18.100
<v Speaker 2>and the dream was the dream of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher stone,</v>

1290
01:15:18.101 --> 01:15:18.934
<v Speaker 2>which was that there was a material </v>
<v Speaker 2>substance that if you only possessed it </v>

1291
01:15:22.241 --> 01:15:24.790
<v Speaker 2>with grandpa and of your wishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can say,</v>

1292
01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:26.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it that motivates science?</v>

1293
01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:27.673
<v Speaker 2>This is why you thought that science was</v>
<v Speaker 2>still embedded in the mythological </v>

1294
01:15:30.011 --> 01:15:30.844
<v Speaker 2>format.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1295
01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:35.980
<v Speaker 2>that's what motivates us at the border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're convinced that if we can just find</v>

1296
01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:36.843
<v Speaker 2>out enough about the way things are made</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we won't have to get old anymore </v>

1297
01:15:40.751 --> 01:15:41.584
<v Speaker 2>and we won't have to get sick anymore </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there'll be enough for everyone and </v>

1298
01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.353
<v Speaker 2>all that seems like a perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable hypothesis as far as I can </v>

1299
01:15:47.771 --> 01:15:52.771
<v Speaker 2>tell me</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

1300
01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:54.690
<v Speaker 2>He tried out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1301
01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:56.610
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

1302
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:59.250
<v Speaker 2>and this is I suppose where the argument</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets very,</v>

1303
01:15:59.251 --> 01:16:00.480
<v Speaker 2>very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>

1304
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:07.030
<v Speaker 2>what the outcome is set out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigate was not matter as we can see</v>

1305
01:16:07.031 --> 01:16:07.864
<v Speaker 2>that because they didn't know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter was as we can see that they </v>

1306
01:16:10.851 --> 01:16:11.684
<v Speaker 2>didn't even have way of representing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blacking entirely an empirical </v>

1307
01:16:14.181 --> 01:16:15.014
<v Speaker 2>methodology for what they were actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to explorer was the unknown part of </v>

1308
01:16:19.911 --> 01:16:21.920
<v Speaker 2>which was mattered in the material </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1309
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:26.660
<v Speaker 2>As from the from the medieval </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective and young basically made the</v>

1310
01:16:26.661 --> 01:16:31.661
<v Speaker 2>point that what the outcome was did was </v>
<v Speaker 2>posited that the notions of the church,</v>

1311
01:16:32.961 --> 01:16:35.930
<v Speaker 2>which is the group identity basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not complained,</v>

1312
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:37.880
<v Speaker 2>were insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is to say that you</v>

1313
01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.670
<v Speaker 2>positive that the alchemist was someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was willing to admit to him,</v>

1314
01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:44.983
<v Speaker 2>to himself that the manner in which the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world had been interpreted was not </v>

1315
01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.333
<v Speaker 2>complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is to say that there was still </v>

1316
01:16:51.171 --> 01:16:52.940
<v Speaker 2>something left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say,</v>

1317
01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:53.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>

1318
01:16:53.690 --> 01:16:54.523
<v Speaker 2>He regarded himself as something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was still ignorant and also the church </v>

1319
01:16:58.011 --> 01:16:58.844
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was essentially totalitarian was </v>

1320
01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.600
<v Speaker 2>too military infrastructure is could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagined,</v>

1321
01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.390
<v Speaker 2>was nonetheless incomplete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you said,</v>

1322
01:17:05.391 --> 01:17:06.224
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was merely the process of that </v>

1323
01:17:08.391 --> 01:17:10.910
<v Speaker 2>preset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I don't know everything.</v>

1324
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:11.743
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's still something left to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explore necessarily produced and our </v>

1325
01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:15.964
<v Speaker 2>identity of the alchemist with the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they didn't know what I </v>

1326
01:17:18.201 --> 01:17:19.034
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because what they were doing was </v>

1327
01:17:20.091 --> 01:17:22.470
<v Speaker 2>acting out the role of the hero and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can say,</v>

1328
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:23.301
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you do that,</v>

1329
01:17:23.301 --> 01:17:24.134
<v Speaker 2>certain things happen and those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are expressed to no chemical symbolism </v>

1330
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:28.670
<v Speaker 2>and what happens when you drop the role </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the hero,</v>

1331
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:29.743
<v Speaker 2>but were you already know that it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a mission that unknown </v>

1332
01:17:32.271 --> 01:17:35.390
<v Speaker 2>information exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The information comes in.</v>

1333
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:39.130
<v Speaker 2>It blows the structure of your previous </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldview.</v>

1334
01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:40.173
<v Speaker 2>He descended into a a situation that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterized by emotional chaos as a </v>

1335
01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:49.910
<v Speaker 2>consequence of processes that occur in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that state of chaos.</v>

1336
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:52.100
<v Speaker 2>There's a reconstruction of a new world </v>
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>

1337
01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.033
<v Speaker 2>but how is that represented?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now can be the first stage is we're </v>

1338
01:17:56.091 --> 01:17:59.540
<v Speaker 2>represented either by the prime of </v>
<v Speaker 2>material or the descent of the king.</v>

1339
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.553
<v Speaker 2>Now you guys should know enough about </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolism to start to understand what </v>

1340
01:18:02.631 --> 01:18:03.441
<v Speaker 2>this means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1341
01:18:03.441 --> 01:18:06.500
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens to you when you first admit</v>

1342
01:18:06.501 --> 01:18:09.770
<v Speaker 2>that something that meant everything to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might not be complete?</v>

1343
01:18:09.771 --> 01:18:10.071
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1344
01:18:10.071 --> 01:18:12.590
<v Speaker 2>that can be represented as two ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending in two ways,</v>

1345
01:18:12.591 --> 01:18:13.424
<v Speaker 2>depending on what stage of the process </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to be represented by the depth </v>

1346
01:18:16.851 --> 01:18:21.851
<v Speaker 2>of the cake or by your identity with </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was called in Alchemy,</v>

1347
01:18:22.521 --> 01:18:24.920
<v Speaker 2>the primary material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically chaos,</v>

1348
01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.350
<v Speaker 2>the dragon of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can say,</v>

1349
01:18:27.351 --> 01:18:28.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two things are the same.</v>

1350
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Why pause?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of the descent of the king,</v>

1351
01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.620
<v Speaker 2>the descendant of King and beyond your </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1352
01:18:33.621 --> 01:18:35.750
<v Speaker 2>or the death of the king or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distillation of became.</v>

1353
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.943
<v Speaker 2>Remember the alchemists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were trying to explain things like </v>

1354
01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:41.840
<v Speaker 2>why matter would dissolve saying salt </v>
<v Speaker 2>water and mercury.</v>

1355
01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:47.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's a weird mixture of empirical </v>
<v Speaker 2>speculation and metaphysical theorizing.</v>

1356
01:18:48.921 --> 01:18:51.140
<v Speaker 2>You remember the alchemist didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any scientific techniques,</v>

1357
01:18:51.141 --> 01:18:54.440
<v Speaker 2>so all they could do when they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulating material,</v>

1358
01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:55.543
<v Speaker 2>the material world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was demonic like church </v>

1359
01:18:56.931 --> 01:18:58.240
<v Speaker 2>association,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was used,</v>

1360
01:18:58.241 --> 01:19:02.400
<v Speaker 2>their fantasies and what were their </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasies full of last mythologies,</v>

1361
01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Christian mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was their worldview fundamentally.</v>

1362
01:19:05.061 --> 01:19:06.800
<v Speaker 2>So of course that's all they saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

1363
01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:07.730
<v Speaker 2>It's all they knew.</v>

1364
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:12.380
<v Speaker 2>That's the dragon of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prime of material,</v>

1365
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:14.240
<v Speaker 2>the source of all things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1366
01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:15.523
<v Speaker 2>in the medieval view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the primary material was not just </v>

1367
01:19:17.691 --> 01:19:18.524
<v Speaker 2>something material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was much more akin to these </v>

1368
01:19:20.151 --> 01:19:20.984
<v Speaker 2>mythological notions of the dragon that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've discussed because the outcome is </v>

1369
01:19:23.861 --> 01:19:26.810
<v Speaker 2>set well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the world comes from is a weird</v>

1370
01:19:26.811 --> 01:19:31.160
<v Speaker 2>intermingling of all those things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>will eventually become society,</v>

1371
01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.353
<v Speaker 2>the individual soul and matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I think an unbelievably </v>

1372
01:19:35.781 --> 01:19:40.340
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated perspective because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1373
01:19:40.341 --> 01:19:42.140
<v Speaker 2>that's something you'll have to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about on your own,</v>

1374
01:19:42.141 --> 01:19:42.974
<v Speaker 2>but it is the case that whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>source of all things is is that thing </v>

1375
01:19:46.761 --> 01:19:51.170
<v Speaker 2>which in time turns into the subject and</v>
<v Speaker 2>an object plus society at large.</v>

1376
01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Now we tend to think of that something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing as something purely material,</v>

1377
01:19:56.151 --> 01:19:56.984
<v Speaker 2>but that's because we make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presupposition that whatever we are a </v>

1378
01:19:58.991 --> 01:19:59.824
<v Speaker 2>subject is something that's reducing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever is through the material and I </v>

1379
01:20:03.261 --> 01:20:04.730
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that might be true,</v>

1380
01:20:04.731 --> 01:20:08.700
<v Speaker 2>but if it is the case that whatever we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are is reducible to something material,</v>

1381
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:13.080
<v Speaker 2>by the time we figured you figured out </v>
<v Speaker 2>how that relationship exists,</v>

1382
01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.513
<v Speaker 2>the way we interpret matter will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different from the way we </v>

1383
01:20:16.681 --> 01:20:19.020
<v Speaker 2>interpreted now and that's.</v>

1384
01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:19.883
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing that really argues </v>

1385
01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:22.734
<v Speaker 2>against a simple minded material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reductionism is the presupposition that </v>

1386
01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:28.800
<v Speaker 2>you understand the phenomena to which </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reducing everything,</v>

1387
01:20:28.801 --> 01:20:33.510
<v Speaker 2>which you know clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1388
01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:37.140
<v Speaker 2>all these stages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are descriptions of this process.</v>

1389
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:52.783
<v Speaker 3>The key,</v>

1390
01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.073
<v Speaker 2>the death of the king produces </v>
<v Speaker 2>immersement and chaos that was also </v>

1391
01:20:58.171 --> 01:21:01.530
<v Speaker 2>described as the Nigredo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an interesting stage.</v>

1392
01:21:01.531 --> 01:21:04.560
<v Speaker 2>It's often represented in an alchemical </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolism,</v>

1393
01:21:04.561 --> 01:21:05.394
<v Speaker 2>has a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An old man who was black who was very </v>

1394
01:21:07.471 --> 01:21:08.304
<v Speaker 2>close to death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting in a pit like breathing out of </v>

1395
01:21:09.781 --> 01:21:11.730
<v Speaker 2>the Raven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's symbol.</v>

1396
01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.760
<v Speaker 2>It's symbolic of anxiety and depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally more than that.</v>

1397
01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Also emotional chaos and all you one was</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to point out in this analysis,</v>

1398
01:21:22.491 --> 01:21:23.460
<v Speaker 2>so our committee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the.</v>

1399
01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:24.983
<v Speaker 2>If you lose a moral philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your emotions become dysregulated and </v>

1400
01:21:28.531 --> 01:21:30.420
<v Speaker 2>you're swamped with anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

1401
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:34.290
<v Speaker 2>The outcome is regarded that as a state </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this process of transformation.</v>

1402
01:21:34.291 --> 01:21:35.124
<v Speaker 2>Not as a final statement necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the kind of thing that needs </v>

1403
01:21:37.051 --> 01:21:37.884
<v Speaker 2>she's describing when he talks about </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing at the edge of the cliff and </v>

1404
01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.840
<v Speaker 2>looking off into the abyss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1405
01:21:41.841 --> 01:21:42.750
<v Speaker 2>that's the UBS.</v>

1406
01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:50.610
<v Speaker 2>The chaos is represented by on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon also by the queen of chaos.</v>

1407
01:21:50.611 --> 01:21:52.590
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my representation anyways.</v>

1408
01:21:52.591 --> 01:21:53.640
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1409
01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.273
<v Speaker 2>the notion here was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that was to be dissolved in the </v>

1410
01:22:00.331 --> 01:22:04.730
<v Speaker 2>salt solvent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The king and chaos can be represented as</v>

1411
01:22:04.731 --> 01:22:05.680
<v Speaker 2>a Kenyan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a queen,</v>

1412
01:22:05.681 --> 01:22:06.514
<v Speaker 2>the queen sorting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making reference to the sort of </v>

1413
01:22:08.611 --> 01:22:11.850
<v Speaker 2>matriarchal symbolism that we've talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the past and that was the union of</v>

1414
01:22:11.851 --> 01:22:12.684
<v Speaker 2>those two things that would produce a </v>
<v Speaker 2>new structure and that's an idea that's </v>

1415
01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:18.300
<v Speaker 2>very much like the old Egyptian idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1416
01:22:18.301 --> 01:22:19.134
<v Speaker 2>cirrus going into the underworld or or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the Egyptians have that the </v>

1417
01:22:24.331 --> 01:22:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian Pharaoh was simultaneously the </v>
<v Speaker 2>old dead Pharaoh and the new federal,</v>

1418
01:22:29.490 --> 01:22:30.323
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a particular philosophical </v>

1419
01:22:34.081 --> 01:22:34.914
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the manner in which you would </v>

1420
01:22:36.061 --> 01:22:36.894
<v Speaker 2>describe an aspect of value to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment and it dissolves all things </v>

1421
01:22:41.521 --> 01:22:42.354
<v Speaker 2>that you had classified are no longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>classifiable and you're swamped as a </v>

1422
01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:46.314
<v Speaker 2>consequence.</v>

1423
01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:47.543
<v Speaker 2>Swamp with anxiety and depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are two of emotional phenomena </v>

1424
01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:53.730
<v Speaker 2>that that whole classification system </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't directed to inhabit.</v>

1425
01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:57.840
<v Speaker 2>To begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that system blows itself apart,</v>

1426
01:22:57.841 --> 01:22:58.674
<v Speaker 2>those emotions come back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And and how do you construct a new </v>

1427
01:23:01.141 --> 01:23:01.974
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1428
01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:06.920
<v Speaker 2>you use the anomalous information that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>blowing your old system apart,</v>

1429
01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:10.390
<v Speaker 2>plus everything that you had known </v>
<v Speaker 2>before to erect something new.</v>

1430
01:23:10.391 --> 01:23:11.224
<v Speaker 2>And the outcome is symbolized by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union of the king border and the Queen </v>

1431
01:23:14.321 --> 01:23:15.910
<v Speaker 2>of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual union,</v>

1432
01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:18.063
<v Speaker 2>something that notion that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>illusion to incest symbolism and their </v>

1433
01:23:22.001 --> 01:23:22.834
<v Speaker 2>offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The divine son was the new state of </v>

1434
01:23:24.971 --> 01:23:27.760
<v Speaker 2>order on the outcome associated that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with</v>

1435
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:36.130
<v Speaker 2>with the philosopher's stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything,</v>

1436
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.863
<v Speaker 2>either a permanent state of order or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanent state of redemption or the </v>

1437
01:23:43.161 --> 01:23:43.994
<v Speaker 2>process that gives rise to that when she</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the aspect that we're more </v>

1438
01:23:46.761 --> 01:23:51.761
<v Speaker 2>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1439
01:23:51.821 --> 01:23:54.070
<v Speaker 2>That's too much to bring that discussion</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make,</v>

1440
01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.340
<v Speaker 2>to do justice to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ideas,</v>

1441
01:23:56.350 --> 01:24:00.280
<v Speaker 2>but they can't really be summarized </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly.</v>

1442
01:24:01.730 --> 01:24:02.563
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1443
01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I just ask you one thing that's always </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested me is there it is.</v>

1444
01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.730
<v Speaker 2>The Union of opposites</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially given the context,</v>

1445
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:24.560
<v Speaker 2>the context of the theory of this class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take the union of opposites to me,</v>

1446
01:24:24.570 --> 01:24:28.660
<v Speaker 2>sort of a creative type of stable </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy of goals.</v>

1447
01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.353
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1448
01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:35.850
<v Speaker 2>but those goals are essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 2>separate things in competition.</v>

1449
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:38.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean if they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're not organized or</v>

1450
01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:41.430
<v Speaker 2>effects often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1451
01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:42.293
<v Speaker 2>Why did it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You characterize it as a union of </v>

1452
01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:44.313
<v Speaker 2>opposites because the fact that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>in competition doesn't necessarily mean </v>

1453
01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:49.840
<v Speaker 2>that there isn't a structure where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have exactly one opposed to another.</v>

1454
01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.133
<v Speaker 2>What did he mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he get that out of you got that out </v>

1455
01:24:54.881 --> 01:24:57.010
<v Speaker 2>of symbolism I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

1456
01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:01.720
<v Speaker 2>why isn't it represented more in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sort of chaotic competition for other</v>

1457
01:25:01.721 --> 01:25:03.780
<v Speaker 2>than that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In terms of the.</v>

1458
01:25:04.530 --> 01:25:05.363
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I think it's mostly because he </v>

1459
01:25:07.591 --> 01:25:08.424
<v Speaker 2>viewed the competition of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more from the perspective of the </v>

1460
01:25:10.621 --> 01:25:11.454
<v Speaker 2>mythological structures that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed where things are held in </v>

1461
01:25:13.381 --> 01:25:14.214
<v Speaker 2>opposite the positive aspect of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the creative unknown at the negative </v>

1462
01:25:18.151 --> 01:25:20.250
<v Speaker 2>aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the positive aspect of the known and the</v>

1463
01:25:20.251 --> 01:25:21.084
<v Speaker 2>negative and there's clearly a structure</v>
<v Speaker 2>of opposites there and if you what if </v>

1464
01:25:24.611 --> 01:25:25.444
<v Speaker 2>you take the biological perspective that</v>
<v Speaker 2>what young is referring to is the </v>

1465
01:25:28.561 --> 01:25:32.820
<v Speaker 2>integration of different effects driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophies in a sense.</v>

1466
01:25:32.821 --> 01:25:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Then the notion that they're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition breaks down to some degree.</v>

1467
01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:42.140
<v Speaker 2>There's still a certain amount of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you say was that Kurt,</v>

1468
01:25:42.150 --> 01:25:42.983
<v Speaker 2>to to guess that they were represented </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way simply because that's an easy </v>

1469
01:25:46.591 --> 01:25:48.600
<v Speaker 2>way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to review conflicting things is in terms</v>

1470
01:25:48.601 --> 01:25:51.330
<v Speaker 2>of a simple up opposition.</v>

1471
01:25:55.730 --> 01:25:56.563
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're gonna spend more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that too though because like let's say </v>

1472
01:25:59.691 --> 01:26:00.524
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1473
01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:03.093
<v Speaker 2>let's say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two things you want in a given </v>

1474
01:26:07.731 --> 01:26:09.950
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict with one another,</v>

1475
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:13.160
<v Speaker 2>so that means you value one thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you value.</v>

1476
01:26:13.161 --> 01:26:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Now you're in love with someone they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like your job.</v>

1477
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:17.143
<v Speaker 2>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those are two affectively driven </v>

1478
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.073
<v Speaker 2>philosophies in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>structures of value that are brought </v>

1479
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:27.080
<v Speaker 2>into conflict as a consequence of a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

1480
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:28.183
<v Speaker 2>In those situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those forces would war and opposition </v>

1481
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:32.203
<v Speaker 2>and that's part of the reason why this </v>
<v Speaker 2>has always represented as opposing </v>

1482
01:26:34.161 --> 01:26:38.390
<v Speaker 2>forces mean you don't have a conflict </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you have a conflict of duty.</v>

1483
01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:39.613
<v Speaker 2>You have a conflict of duty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When one thing you think is important </v>

1484
01:26:41.931 --> 01:26:42.764
<v Speaker 2>and valuable and morally appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflicts very powerfully with another </v>

1485
01:26:46.581 --> 01:26:48.800
<v Speaker 2>thing that you think is valuable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>morally inappropriate.</v>

1486
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Then you're caught in the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>torn apart by these two.</v>

1487
01:26:52.191 --> 01:26:53.024
<v Speaker 2>Flow down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you and was trying to </v>

1488
01:26:54.021 --> 01:26:56.960
<v Speaker 2>point out was that your a structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>evaluation,</v>

1489
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:57.823
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you love this person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you valued this job are </v>

1490
01:27:00.471 --> 01:27:01.304
<v Speaker 2>structures that have developed as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of an incredibly lengthy </v>

1491
01:27:04.491 --> 01:27:07.100
<v Speaker 2>historical process and even the notion </v>
<v Speaker 2>of love,</v>

1492
01:27:07.101 --> 01:27:11.120
<v Speaker 2>although it might be rooted in certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological predispositions,</v>

1493
01:27:11.450 --> 01:27:15.050
<v Speaker 2>is a cultural construct that's developed</v>
<v Speaker 2>over thousands and thousands of years.</v>

1494
01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:15.883
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fed in part for example by the </v>

1495
01:27:17.841 --> 01:27:19.210
<v Speaker 2>notions of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1496
01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:22.453
<v Speaker 2>what's the medieval notion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Central many medieval notion of </v>

1497
01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:30.170
<v Speaker 2>gallantry chivalry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1498
01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean love is the construction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>

1499
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:33.223
<v Speaker 2>Why do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you so attracted to your job in </v>

1500
01:27:35.091 --> 01:27:36.530
<v Speaker 2>that particular circumstance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1501
01:27:36.531 --> 01:27:40.760
<v Speaker 2>it's very complicated job as being </v>
<v Speaker 2>described values as a consequence of all</v>

1502
01:27:40.761 --> 01:27:41.594
<v Speaker 2>sorts of processes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your way of holding anxiety and </v>

1503
01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:45.194
<v Speaker 2>depression at bay had they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the way that you described </v>

1504
01:27:48.321 --> 01:27:51.620
<v Speaker 2>determinant meaning to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of a larger social structure.</v>

1505
01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:56.200
<v Speaker 2>When you put those forces in opposition </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a given circumstance or when they can</v>

1506
01:27:56.201 --> 01:27:57.034
<v Speaker 2>flip in a given circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're torn apart as a consequence of </v>

1507
01:27:59.331 --> 01:28:02.180
<v Speaker 2>their conflict that makes you the pawn </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the gods,</v>

1508
01:28:02.181 --> 01:28:05.980
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you was trying to describe in his l</v>

1509
01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:06.853
<v Speaker 2>chemical sequences is the process by </v>
<v Speaker 2>which all these conflicting hierarchies </v>

1510
01:28:11.571 --> 01:28:15.320
<v Speaker 2>of value could be brought into one </v>
<v Speaker 2>internally.</v>

1511
01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Coherent story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My story he was trying to represent,</v>

1512
01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:19.460
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1513
01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:20.293
<v Speaker 2>by the end of the chemical period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more psychologically sophisticated </v>

1514
01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:25.363
<v Speaker 2>alchemists were drawing an analogy </v>
<v Speaker 2>between whatever the hell the </v>

1515
01:28:27.921 --> 01:28:31.050
<v Speaker 2>philosopher's stone was in Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very peculiar thing.</v>

1516
01:28:31.051 --> 01:28:31.884
<v Speaker 2>So as they had more or less left the </v>
<v Speaker 2>church in order to pursue this process </v>

1517
01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:35.870
<v Speaker 2>to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what does that mean?</v>

1518
01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:37.213
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the philosopher's stone was the thing </v>

1519
01:28:39.741 --> 01:28:40.574
<v Speaker 2>that represented that thing that's of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate value and in Christian </v>

1520
01:28:43.581 --> 01:28:45.560
<v Speaker 2>mythology that's also love Christ </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent.</v>

1521
01:28:45.561 --> 01:28:46.394
<v Speaker 2>So it's not very surprising that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would end up falling into the same </v>

1522
01:28:48.291 --> 01:28:49.400
<v Speaker 2>category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1523
01:28:49.401 --> 01:28:50.234
<v Speaker 2>because it was the existence of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>category that gave rise to both those </v>

1524
01:28:53.541 --> 01:28:55.010
<v Speaker 2>concrete examples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

1525
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question is,</v>

1526
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:57.103
<v Speaker 2>what the hell does this represent what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to get at painful even dot </v>

1527
01:29:01.221 --> 01:29:03.000
<v Speaker 2>last lecture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1528
01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:04.673
<v Speaker 2>we know already that this process might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be regarded as the continual process by </v>

1529
01:29:12.031 --> 01:29:16.230
<v Speaker 2>which particular answers to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical question,</v>

1530
01:29:16.231 --> 01:29:20.610
<v Speaker 2>what is the good or generates like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's one philosophical Schema,</v>

1531
01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:22.000
<v Speaker 2>new information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>

1532
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.050
<v Speaker 2>The part it's replaced by another one </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's theoretically more complete.</v>

1533
01:29:25.051 --> 01:29:28.470
<v Speaker 2>New information comes in and blows it </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart and so on and so forth.</v>

1534
01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Always never ending says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1535
01:29:31.921 --> 01:29:34.830
<v Speaker 2>how do you get out of 12?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We sent over months ago.</v>

1536
01:29:34.831 --> 01:29:35.664
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pop out of identification with any </v>

1537
01:29:37.741 --> 01:29:38.574
<v Speaker 2>of the states which is adolescent </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification with an ideology anyways </v>

1538
01:29:42.721 --> 01:29:43.554
<v Speaker 2>under all circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you start to identify with the </v>

1539
01:29:46.081 --> 01:29:46.914
<v Speaker 2>process which is the process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntary encountered with the unknown </v>

1540
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:55.400
<v Speaker 2>descent into this chaotic state and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconstruction says,</v>

1541
01:29:55.410 --> 01:29:56.243
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only have two modes of protection </v>

1542
01:29:57.301 --> 01:30:01.470
<v Speaker 2>against a known one is identification </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a particular system of beliefs.</v>

1543
01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:02.453
<v Speaker 2>The other is identification with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process by which chaos itself can be </v>

1544
01:30:05.671 --> 01:30:07.920
<v Speaker 2>transformed in order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a saying,</v>

1545
01:30:07.921 --> 01:30:09.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this constant,</v>

1546
01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:10.373
<v Speaker 2>and this is represented various in </v>
<v Speaker 2>various ways and mythology sometimes as </v>

1547
01:30:13.861 --> 01:30:18.090
<v Speaker 2>the philosopher's stone sometime as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure of a given prophet like Moses,</v>

1548
01:30:18.091 --> 01:30:20.250
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's price,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's Buddha,</v>

1549
01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:21.443
<v Speaker 2>what is supposed to represent his </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification with the process of </v>

1550
01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:26.670
<v Speaker 2>adaptation and not the outcome.</v>

1551
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:27.953
<v Speaker 2>You said</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your youngest concerned with is </v>

1552
01:30:31.441 --> 01:30:33.960
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchical structuring of value </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>

1553
01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:36.120
<v Speaker 2>That's what do you mean by the Union of </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposites?</v>

1554
01:30:36.121 --> 01:30:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you said was,</v>

1555
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:38.183
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only one answer to the problem </v>

1556
01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:41.123
<v Speaker 2>of what's more important than what else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say there's only one answer </v>

1557
01:30:45.211 --> 01:30:48.900
<v Speaker 2>in a sense to the problem of how value </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be hierarchically organized,</v>

1558
01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:49.973
<v Speaker 2>and his answer was essentially the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's at the pyramid of the hierarchy </v>

1559
01:30:55.711 --> 01:30:56.544
<v Speaker 2>of values should be the process by which</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole hierarchy is constructed and </v>

1560
01:31:00.631 --> 01:31:02.640
<v Speaker 2>that means everything should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>subordinate to it.</v>

1561
01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:04.380
<v Speaker 2>So when you read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1562
01:31:04.381 --> 01:31:09.150
<v Speaker 2>in the new testament notions that say </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more difficult for a rich man to.</v>

1563
01:31:09.570 --> 01:31:10.403
<v Speaker 2>It's easier for a rich man to go through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eye of a needle than to enter into </v>

1564
01:31:12.181 --> 01:31:13.014
<v Speaker 2>the Kingdom of heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the story means is if you think </v>

1565
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:19.740
<v Speaker 2>that security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means how do I deal with death,</v>

1566
01:31:19.770 --> 01:31:22.050
<v Speaker 2>how do I deal with the Old Lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I deal with sickness,</v>

1567
01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:25.620
<v Speaker 2>can be found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think that money,</v>

1568
01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:26.783
<v Speaker 2>material possessions for that matter can</v>
<v Speaker 2>provide you with the kind of security </v>

1569
01:31:29.461 --> 01:31:30.294
<v Speaker 2>that you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is security in the face of all </v>

1570
01:31:31.351 --> 01:31:33.810
<v Speaker 2>those terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're wrong because it won't work,</v>

1571
01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:37.950
<v Speaker 2>and furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you put the desire for money,</v>

1572
01:31:37.951 --> 01:31:41.340
<v Speaker 2>which is security basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>above all else,</v>

1573
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:42.353
<v Speaker 2>you'll sacrifice necessarily sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 2>identification with the only process </v>

1574
01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.190
<v Speaker 2>that could in the final analysis offer </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>

1575
01:31:48.191 --> 01:31:49.560
<v Speaker 2>the kind of protection that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>needing.</v>

1576
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:51.180
<v Speaker 2>So it's not going to work.</v>

1577
01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:53.711
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1578
01:31:53.711 --> 01:31:57.970
<v Speaker 5>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's an assumption here that order is</v>

1579
01:31:57.971 --> 01:31:59.410
<v Speaker 5>a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1580
01:31:59.850 --> 01:32:00.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what you're.</v>

1581
01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:02.410
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an assumption here,</v>

1582
01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:04.013
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1583
01:32:04.710 --> 01:32:05.543
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem with these states is </v>

1584
01:32:07.271 --> 01:32:10.540
<v Speaker 2>that is the assumption orders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good chaos isn't.</v>

1585
01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:11.600
<v Speaker 2>That's wrong,</v>

1586
01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:12.830
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

1587
01:32:12.831 --> 01:32:13.664
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then you get to that point and what </v>

1588
01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:17.810
<v Speaker 5>an unresolved issue I have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that okay?</v>

1589
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:18.703
<v Speaker 5>If you placed yourself with the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 5>goal of the identification with the </v>

1590
01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:24.050
<v Speaker 5>process,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1591
01:32:24.051 --> 01:32:26.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't see how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

1592
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:27.210
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1593
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:28.183
<v Speaker 5>actively moved towards the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look into that which we are all capable </v>

1594
01:32:32.691 --> 01:32:35.000
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I see I am capable of evil,</v>

1595
01:32:35.001 --> 01:32:39.620
<v Speaker 5>I am capable of killing someone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am capable of,</v>

1596
01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:41.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these things.</v>

1597
01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.520
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

1598
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:47.930
<v Speaker 5>how does that fit into that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does that fit into that framework?</v>

1599
01:32:47.931 --> 01:32:48.150
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1600
01:32:48.150 --> 01:32:48.983
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me more to expand your notion of </v>

1601
01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:56.430
<v Speaker 2>what it is that you are and also perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring up the capabilities that you would</v>

1602
01:32:56.431 --> 01:32:57.264
<v Speaker 2>be unwilling to use or even unwilling to</v>
<v Speaker 2>admit to at times in situations where </v>

1603
01:33:01.411 --> 01:33:03.600
<v Speaker 2>they might be appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it isn't until,</v>

1604
01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:04.493
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may be that in order to survive </v>

1605
01:33:06.421 --> 01:33:08.220
<v Speaker 2>optimally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means,</v>

1606
01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:12.120
<v Speaker 2>that you might have to have access to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole realm of aggressive impulses.</v>

1607
01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:15.690
<v Speaker 2>The existence of which you're not even </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to admit.</v>

1608
01:33:16.050 --> 01:33:16.711
<v Speaker 2>So we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1609
01:33:16.711 --> 01:33:20.280
<v Speaker 2>if you can actually come to grips with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that your behavioral capacities</v>

1610
01:33:20.281 --> 01:33:23.400
<v Speaker 2>are much broader on the negative side </v>
<v Speaker 2>than you might have on the negative side</v>

1611
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:24.263
<v Speaker 2>as you define it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you might have never been willing </v>

1612
01:33:25.951 --> 01:33:26.784
<v Speaker 2>to admit and you can also start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that you may have </v>

1613
01:33:28.801 --> 01:33:32.280
<v Speaker 2>capabilities that you have not even </v>
<v Speaker 2>begun to explore,</v>

1614
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:33.343
<v Speaker 2>and it's certainly the case that all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although aggression can be used in all </v>

1615
01:33:35.641 --> 01:33:37.470
<v Speaker 2>sorts of ways that appear clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative,</v>

1616
01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:38.573
<v Speaker 2>that there's any number of situations </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the capacity to maintain your </v>

1617
01:33:41.941 --> 01:33:42.774
<v Speaker 2>ground or even to move forward in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>face of tremendous opposition is </v>

1618
01:33:45.690 --> 01:33:47.490
<v Speaker 2>absolutely necessary to you.</v>

1619
01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:49.950
<v Speaker 2>So that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be one part of the excel.</v>

1620
01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:52.770
<v Speaker 2>It's also the case that until you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable,</v>

1621
01:33:52.890 --> 01:33:53.723
<v Speaker 2>have at least conceiving conceptually of</v>
<v Speaker 2>how significant the errors that you're </v>

1622
01:33:57.691 --> 01:33:58.524
<v Speaker 2>making might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't got a hope in hell of doing </v>

1623
01:34:00.181 --> 01:34:02.160
<v Speaker 2>anything about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even see that they're there.</v>

1624
01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.060
<v Speaker 2>He say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1625
01:34:03.061 --> 01:34:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the sort of person that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever do anything like that,</v>

1626
01:34:05.551 --> 01:34:08.720
<v Speaker 2>which is of course just patently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patently ridiculous.</v>

1627
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:12.510
<v Speaker 5>Once you see that you are capable of </v>
<v Speaker 5>killing someone or are capable of,</v>

1628
01:34:12.710 --> 01:34:14.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>aggressive behavior,</v>

1629
01:34:15.730 --> 01:34:19.320
<v Speaker 5>it almost makes you not the hero not to </v>
<v Speaker 5>act upon those.</v>

1630
01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:20.990
<v Speaker 5>Aggressiveness stinks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1631
01:34:20.991 --> 01:34:22.800
<v Speaker 5>there may be some certain cases where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1632
01:34:24.190 --> 01:34:25.860
<v Speaker 2>that's actually our right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1633
01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:26.813
<v Speaker 2>if you're four years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years old and you go to the </v>

1634
01:34:28.201 --> 01:34:30.270
<v Speaker 2>playground and the nine year old pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you flat,</v>

1635
01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:32.550
<v Speaker 2>you can't go home thinking while I did </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right thing,</v>

1636
01:34:32.551 --> 01:34:33.384
<v Speaker 2>I was nonviolent because the reason you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were nonviolent just because you got </v>

1637
01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:36.693
<v Speaker 2>pounded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clap.</v>

1638
01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Now it's different situation entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go out somewhere and you have the</v>

1639
01:34:40.291 --> 01:34:41.124
<v Speaker 2>capability of truly aggressive response </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're provoking and you don't </v>

1640
01:34:44.071 --> 01:34:46.530
<v Speaker 2>manifest it well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's a different circumstance,</v>

1641
01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:49.690
<v Speaker 2>but the mere lack of ability to respond </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a negative way,</v>

1642
01:34:49.691 --> 01:34:51.870
<v Speaker 2>it's no indication whatsoever of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality.</v>

1643
01:34:52.110 --> 01:34:54.180
<v Speaker 2>That's why I need you to send no </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing.</v>

1644
01:34:54.181 --> 01:34:55.014
<v Speaker 2>Morality is cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't because he thought all </v>

1645
01:34:57.471 --> 01:35:02.471
<v Speaker 2>morality equals cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because much of much of what passes</v>

1646
01:35:03.111 --> 01:35:07.490
<v Speaker 2>for what much of what people define to </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves as their own morality is just</v>

1647
01:35:07.491 --> 01:35:08.324
<v Speaker 2>their own cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the reason why I figures </v>

1648
01:35:10.490 --> 01:35:11.323
<v Speaker 2>like the gangster are so popular in </v>
<v Speaker 2>American mythology because they act out </v>

1649
01:35:15.141 --> 01:35:17.450
<v Speaker 2>what everyone would actually like to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1650
01:35:17.451 --> 01:35:20.510
<v Speaker 2>but is too moral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't the case at all too cowardly</v>

1651
01:35:20.511 --> 01:35:23.450
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's positive and well,</v>

1652
01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:28.940
<v Speaker 5>how can you simultaneously say that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>the person who denies,</v>

1653
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.020
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>error,</v>

1654
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.903
<v Speaker 5>the are the person who denies this </v>
<v Speaker 5>within them as evil and yet killing is </v>

1655
01:35:35.911 --> 01:35:37.300
<v Speaker 5>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1656
01:35:37.710 --> 01:35:39.330
<v Speaker 5>how can you say those two things?</v>

1657
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say the ladder.</v>

1658
01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:44.490
<v Speaker 5>What killing isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's what I'm trying to get at.</v>

1659
01:35:44.491 --> 01:35:47.940
<v Speaker 5>Like are we trying to say here that </v>
<v Speaker 5>killing is evil?</v>

1660
01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:50.600
<v Speaker 5>Look</v>

1661
01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.000
<v Speaker 2>there only one way to answer that </v>
<v Speaker 2>question I guess.</v>

1662
01:35:53.001 --> 01:35:53.834
<v Speaker 2>And that is one of the things that are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's constantly </v>

1663
01:35:57.171 --> 01:36:00.980
<v Speaker 2>referred to in hero mythologies is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that</v>

1664
01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:05.610
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't break a traditional rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1665
01:36:05.611 --> 01:36:07.160
<v Speaker 2>So that answers that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1666
01:36:07.230 --> 01:36:08.063
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's a problem with that in </v>

1667
01:36:10.081 --> 01:36:10.914
<v Speaker 2>the traditional rules as listed are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sufficient and complete guide to </v>

1668
01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:16.710
<v Speaker 2>adaptations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then the question is,</v>

1669
01:36:16.711 --> 01:36:17.544
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under what circumstances is it </v>

1670
01:36:18.361 --> 01:36:20.910
<v Speaker 2>reasonable to break a rule?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a different issue.</v>

1671
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:23.970
<v Speaker 2>And so in the broad sense you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1672
01:36:23.971 --> 01:36:25.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to be good?</v>

1673
01:36:25.321 --> 01:36:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Well then you follow the Ten </v>
<v Speaker 2>Commandments.</v>

1674
01:36:26.881 --> 01:36:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are there rules upon which </v>
<v Speaker 2>most civilized societies are structured,</v>

1675
01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:32.393
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are situations in which the </v>

1676
01:36:34.261 --> 01:36:36.150
<v Speaker 2>rules conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1677
01:36:36.330 --> 01:36:37.163
<v Speaker 2>or whether where perhaps they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily applicable well under those </v>

1678
01:36:40.141 --> 01:36:42.630
<v Speaker 2>circumstances than what can guide your </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality.</v>

1679
01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the question that we're trying to</v>

1680
01:36:43.981 --> 01:36:48.150
<v Speaker 2>answer here because we also need to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this is the theory,</v>

1681
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:51.240
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the practical implication?</v>

1682
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Because that's one thing that you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to know.</v>

1683
01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:54.913
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the only reason that any </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these stories have any relevance to </v>

1684
01:36:56.941 --> 01:37:01.941
<v Speaker 2>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1685
01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.153
<v Speaker 2>it's your attitude towards the novelist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Information in large part determines </v>

1686
01:37:08.821 --> 01:37:10.730
<v Speaker 2>your morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say,</v>

1687
01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:12.780
<v Speaker 2>let's see if we can figure out what that</v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

1688
01:37:15.490 --> 01:37:16.380
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1689
01:37:16.381 --> 01:37:17.740
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the case that</v>

1690
01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:22.910
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1691
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:25.610
<v Speaker 2>you might ask yourself the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does life have?</v>

1692
01:37:25.611 --> 01:37:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Any beans?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1693
01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:28.730
<v Speaker 2>that's the question that people often </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask themselves and I would say,</v>

1694
01:37:28.731 --> 01:37:30.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that you mean by that?</v>

1695
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does meaning mean?</v>

1696
01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it means implication for action.</v>

1697
01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what we mean when we say </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>

1698
01:37:36.141 --> 01:37:38.480
<v Speaker 2>are we meeting emotional significance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say,</v>

1699
01:37:38.481 --> 01:37:39.314
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to look at this </v>

1700
01:37:39.961 --> 01:37:41.540
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emotional significance.</v>

1701
01:37:41.850 --> 01:37:42.683
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does anomalous information for </v>

1702
01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Dusek well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>

1703
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:48.470
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's involuntary</v>

1704
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:51.990
<v Speaker 3>hope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hope,</v>

1705
01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 3>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1706
01:37:58.670 --> 01:38:03.530
<v Speaker 2>isn't that interesting means that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>some significance for my behavior or the</v>

1707
01:38:03.531 --> 01:38:06.440
<v Speaker 2>way that I interpret things that I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>never considered before.</v>

1708
01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:12.913
<v Speaker 3>Speed.</v>

1709
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to read the last three days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll pretty much do this.</v>

1710
01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.233
<v Speaker 2>Do a same interest is meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning is the manifestation of the </v>

1711
01:38:38.991 --> 01:38:41.930
<v Speaker 2>divine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the individual adaptive path.</v>

1712
01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:44.473
<v Speaker 2>Pursued of interest necessarily exposes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual tomorrow when social </v>

1713
01:38:48.231 --> 01:38:49.064
<v Speaker 2>limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm produces a symbolic death of </v>

1714
01:38:50.811 --> 01:38:51.644
<v Speaker 2>personality which sort of simultaneously</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the precondition to renewal an </v>

1715
01:38:55.101 --> 01:38:58.940
<v Speaker 2>antidote to the necessity of real death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When circumstances inevitably change.</v>

1716
01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.010
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1717
01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:02.083
<v Speaker 2>if you watch your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are going to be phenomena that </v>

1718
01:39:03.891 --> 01:39:08.150
<v Speaker 2>appear to you as if they're meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say they attract your interest.</v>

1719
01:39:08.151 --> 01:39:08.984
<v Speaker 2>You can watch yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your interest will be attracted by the </v>

1720
01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:13.130
<v Speaker 2>not even on your own accord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1721
01:39:13.131 --> 01:39:13.964
<v Speaker 2>just by the fact that those phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>for reasons that you might not </v>

1722
01:39:15.891 --> 01:39:19.010
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce an orienting response or in your</v>

1723
01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.930
<v Speaker 2>heightened your interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1724
01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:24.890
<v Speaker 2>I would say that that's evidence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of the unknown,</v>

1725
01:39:24.891 --> 01:39:25.724
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from within the perspective of your </v>

1726
01:39:27.171 --> 01:39:28.004
<v Speaker 2>particular philosophical framework says </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you follow those things that appear </v>

1727
01:39:31.161 --> 01:39:34.640
<v Speaker 2>to you as meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what you want to do anyways,</v>

1728
01:39:34.641 --> 01:39:35.474
<v Speaker 2>because it is the case that that is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing that people want to do </v>

1729
01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:38.480
<v Speaker 2>virtually.</v>

1730
01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.313
<v Speaker 2>By definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What will happen is you'll end up </v>

1731
01:39:43.221 --> 01:39:45.590
<v Speaker 2>participating in the process that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>described,</v>

1732
01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:46.573
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that if you hold onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>your interest and don't let it go </v>

1733
01:39:48.501 --> 01:39:49.334
<v Speaker 2>despite all the social pressure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find not to do it because you're </v>

1734
01:39:52.791 --> 01:39:53.624
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be doing the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else says is useful and the </v>

1735
01:39:55.851 --> 01:39:56.684
<v Speaker 2>fact that it's going to expose to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of things that you didn't </v>

1736
01:39:58.281 --> 01:39:59.360
<v Speaker 2>understand to begin with.</v>

1737
01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:00.893
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if I find it immensely interesting </v>

1738
01:40:04.741 --> 01:40:05.574
<v Speaker 3>to cut to it?</v>

1739
01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1740
01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:07.910
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is absolutely,</v>

1741
01:40:07.911 --> 01:40:09.980
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will definitely discuss that.</v>

1742
01:40:09.981 --> 01:40:10.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1743
01:40:10.610 --> 01:40:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two poles obviously say you know</v>

1744
01:40:13.161 --> 01:40:15.050
<v Speaker 2>what's like Joseph Campbell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1745
01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:16.430
<v Speaker 2>follow your bliss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1746
01:40:16.431 --> 01:40:17.264
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first thing that pops into the </v>

1747
01:40:18.261 --> 01:40:20.690
<v Speaker 2>head of the good paranoid is exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what Daniel popped up.</v>

1748
01:40:20.691 --> 01:40:23.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if my interest is serial killing?</v>

1749
01:40:23.630 --> 01:40:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Because if you read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you read accounts of serial killers,</v>

1750
01:40:26.571 --> 01:40:27.404
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you find very rapidly is that </v>

1751
01:40:28.670 --> 01:40:29.503
<v Speaker 2>they're very interested in what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing and so if you are very </v>

1752
01:40:31.671 --> 01:40:32.504
<v Speaker 2>interested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't start doing and they got </v>

1753
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:37.670
<v Speaker 2>their interest expanded as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>continued to pursue the territory.</v>

1754
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:38.803
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well obviously interesting in of itself </v>

1755
01:40:41.811 --> 01:40:42.644
<v Speaker 2>is known as sufficient guide because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can interest can manifest itself within </v>

1756
01:40:46.401 --> 01:40:49.750
<v Speaker 2>the confines of the personality that so </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathological than in,</v>

1757
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.820
<v Speaker 2>in and of itself is a sign post for </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathology.</v>

1758
01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:54.063
<v Speaker 2>When I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1759
01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:57.100
<v Speaker 2>that's why we concentrated so much on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1760
01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:00.910
<v Speaker 2>So if you feel your head up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>garbage,</v>

1761
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:01.833
<v Speaker 2>what did labels is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no longer going to be healthy and </v>

1762
01:41:04.631 --> 01:41:05.464
<v Speaker 2>so there's two poles to the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral process that we've been </v>

1763
01:41:07.451 --> 01:41:09.970
<v Speaker 2>describing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is do what you're interested in.</v>

1764
01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you do what you're interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1765
01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:15.460
<v Speaker 2>The second thing is don't lie to </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself because if you lie to yourself,</v>

1766
01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.330
<v Speaker 2>you're going to work the mechanism that </v>
<v Speaker 2>produces interest as a phenomena because</v>

1767
01:41:19.690 --> 01:41:21.050
<v Speaker 2>we already know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1768
01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:25.540
<v Speaker 2>we already know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What occurs to you as anomalous,</v>

1769
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:28.270
<v Speaker 2>what pops up in your phenomenological </v>
<v Speaker 2>field as meaningful?</v>

1770
01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:29.313
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be dependent very much on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the philosophical theory that you bring </v>

1771
01:41:32.201 --> 01:41:34.900
<v Speaker 2>to bear on the event is write your </v>
<v Speaker 2>goals,</v>

1772
01:41:34.930 --> 01:41:37.000
<v Speaker 2>the ends you have in mind and so on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so forth,</v>

1773
01:41:37.001 --> 01:41:39.250
<v Speaker 2>determined the significance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena.</v>

1774
01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:40.653
<v Speaker 2>The only way you can ensure that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures are healthy is if their </v>

1775
01:41:44.771 --> 01:41:45.604
<v Speaker 2>existence accounts for all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that you've actually had in </v>

1776
01:41:48.131 --> 01:41:48.964
<v Speaker 2>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that you've constantly </v>

1777
01:41:50.351 --> 01:41:51.184
<v Speaker 2>modified and updated your worldview to </v>
<v Speaker 2>account for all of the experience that </v>

1778
01:41:54.731 --> 01:41:56.890
<v Speaker 2>you've had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't do that,</v>

1779
01:41:57.370 --> 01:41:58.203
<v Speaker 2>you're living within a philosophy that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>twisted off cedric precisely to the </v>

1780
01:42:01.301 --> 01:42:03.580
<v Speaker 2>degree that you've twisted it off </v>
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>

1781
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:04.863
<v Speaker 2>The more that it's twisted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more that whole structure is going </v>

1782
01:42:07.231 --> 01:42:10.240
<v Speaker 2>to produce intimations of meaning where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they shouldn't be,</v>

1783
01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:13.690
<v Speaker 2>and then if you follow those well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll lead you places that perhaps you</v>

1784
01:42:13.691 --> 01:42:16.630
<v Speaker 2>would have never really wanted to go or </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe deeply,</v>

1785
01:42:16.631 --> 01:42:17.464
<v Speaker 2>unconsciously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps leading you exactly where you </v>

1786
01:42:19.331 --> 01:42:21.550
<v Speaker 2>want it to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how you look at it.</v>

1787
01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:25.150
<v Speaker 2>So there's two poles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is when it comes right down to it,</v>

1788
01:42:25.151 --> 01:42:28.050
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that you have to rely on </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the phenomena,</v>

1789
01:42:28.090 --> 01:42:28.923
<v Speaker 2>meaning you know what it occurs and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean if you're immersed in </v>

1790
01:42:31.601 --> 01:42:33.430
<v Speaker 2>something you really love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they?</v>

1791
01:42:33.490 --> 01:42:38.490
<v Speaker 2>One of the phenomena that might be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the self consciousness vanishes.</v>

1792
01:42:38.741 --> 01:42:41.300
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing you can see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>performers who are really great,</v>

1793
01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:42.453
<v Speaker 2>they're really immersed in what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is that they're very attractive </v>

1794
01:42:44.981 --> 01:42:45.814
<v Speaker 2>because they've mastered that domain so </v>
<v Speaker 2>well that they pay absolutely no </v>

1795
01:42:49.001 --> 01:42:49.834
<v Speaker 2>attention to themselves as phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 2>while they're doing whatever it is </v>

1796
01:42:51.671 --> 01:42:52.504
<v Speaker 2>they've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another thing is if you're immersed in </v>

1797
01:42:54.281 --> 01:42:55.114
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your notion of time tends to </v>

1798
01:42:56.951 --> 01:42:57.784
<v Speaker 2>disappear so you can be working very </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard on whatever it is that you're </v>

1799
01:42:59.891 --> 01:43:00.940
<v Speaker 2>interested in book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

1800
01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:02.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did it all the time?</v>

1801
01:43:02.171 --> 01:43:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say,</v>

1802
01:43:03.281 --> 01:43:04.114
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another indication that that's </v>

1803
01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:10.540
<v Speaker 2>that phenomenon is producing an added </v>
<v Speaker 2>note to self consciousness because a big</v>

1804
01:43:10.871 --> 01:43:13.660
<v Speaker 2>aspect of self consciousness is tick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>

1805
01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:16.150
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tick of the consciousness of time.</v>

1806
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:19.300
<v Speaker 2>What pops you out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning?</v>

1807
01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:21.993
<v Speaker 2>Where does meaning manifest itself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It manifests itself on the border </v>

1808
01:43:25.391 --> 01:43:29.280
<v Speaker 2>between order and chaos and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>it does that is because that's where all</v>

1809
01:43:29.290 --> 01:43:34.090
<v Speaker 2>the adaptive processes are taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you have to be operating in</v>

1810
01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:37.930
<v Speaker 2>in order to ensure that the phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you use to interpret the world with</v>

1811
01:43:37.931 --> 01:43:38.764
<v Speaker 2>the structures you use to interpret the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world are constantly being updated and </v>

1812
01:43:41.381 --> 01:43:42.214
<v Speaker 2>also those of your society are </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly being updated because after </v>

1813
01:43:45.281 --> 01:43:49.120
<v Speaker 2>all I discover something and then I tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to you and that's how.</v>

1814
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 2>So that means that the individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>process of creative</v>

1815
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:55.070
<v Speaker 4>exploration updates the social world as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

1816
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.903
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1817
01:43:58.410 --> 01:44:00.030
<v Speaker 4>it's not a simple matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1818
01:44:00.031 --> 01:44:01.920
<v Speaker 4>the other thing Campbell's statement for</v>
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>

1819
01:44:01.921 --> 01:44:03.000
<v Speaker 4>is follow your bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1820
01:44:03.001 --> 01:44:06.450
<v Speaker 4>this strikes me as quite quite one sided</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the sense as well,</v>

1821
01:44:07.230 --> 01:44:09.630
<v Speaker 4>and I guess that's the problem with new </v>
<v Speaker 4>age philosophy.</v>

1822
01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:11.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I like his works on alchemy.</v>

1823
01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:12.423
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1824
01:44:12.690 --> 01:44:15.180
<v Speaker 4>you look where you don't want to look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1825
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:16.103
<v Speaker 4>if someone tells you that it strikes me </v>
<v Speaker 4>that maybe you could believe it seems </v>

1826
01:44:18.811 --> 01:44:20.880
<v Speaker 4>realistic to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather than a message that says,</v>

1827
01:44:20.881 --> 01:44:21.830
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do,</v>

1828
01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:24.720
<v Speaker 4>if you do in some simplistic sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever makes you happy,</v>

1829
01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:26.500
<v Speaker 4>that's perfectly fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so young,</v>

1830
01:44:26.570 --> 01:44:27.403
<v Speaker 4>escaping through his analysis of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical process that if you pay </v>

1831
01:44:30.751 --> 01:44:31.584
<v Speaker 4>attention to what you find meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will take you to the place where you </v>

1832
01:44:33.781 --> 01:44:34.614
<v Speaker 4>would least likely to want to go first</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of because of the necessity of </v>

1833
01:44:39.481 --> 01:44:40.590
<v Speaker 4>this process emerging.</v>

1834
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1835
01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:54.893
<v Speaker 4>The abandonment of meaning ensures the </v>
<v Speaker 4>induction of the demonic mode of </v>

1836
01:44:56.911 --> 01:44:57.744
<v Speaker 4>adaptation because the individual hates </v>
<v Speaker 4>point is pain and frustration and we'll </v>

1837
01:45:02.641 --> 01:45:03.474
<v Speaker 4>work towards destruction of its source.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This work constitutes his revenge </v>

1838
01:45:06.481 --> 01:45:09.450
<v Speaker 4>against existence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is pride is rendered unbearable.</v>

1839
01:45:11.070 --> 01:45:11.903
<v Speaker 4>Rebirth is reestablishment of interest </v>
<v Speaker 4>after adoption of culturally determined </v>

1840
01:45:16.111 --> 01:45:16.944
<v Speaker 4>competence is rebirth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes the individualist practically </v>

1841
01:45:19.591 --> 01:45:20.424
<v Speaker 4>adapted as anyone in history has </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivated is he has courage to be the </v>

1842
01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:28.230
<v Speaker 4>rebirth of interest moves man to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>border between the known culture and the</v>

1843
01:45:28.231 --> 01:45:29.064
<v Speaker 4>unknown nature and thereby expands is </v>
<v Speaker 4>adaptive competence his in the world in </v>

1844
01:45:34.411 --> 01:45:36.540
<v Speaker 4>this manner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the domain of history is expanded.</v>

1845
01:45:37.890 --> 01:45:38.723
<v Speaker 4>This capability for extension is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifestation of God within the </v>

1846
01:45:41.101 --> 01:45:41.934
<v Speaker 4>individual in the modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Socialization should allow the </v>

1847
01:45:45.121 --> 01:45:48.900
<v Speaker 4>individual to devote the power of </v>
<v Speaker 4>history to the act of exploration.</v>

1848
01:45:50.190 --> 01:45:52.740
<v Speaker 4>Interest manifested in the absence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>self deceit,</v>

1849
01:45:52.741 --> 01:45:53.574
<v Speaker 4>places each of us on the border of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unknown and removes the tragedy from </v>

1850
01:45:56.941 --> 01:45:57.774
<v Speaker 4>temporality.</v>

1851
01:45:58.650 --> 01:45:59.483
<v Speaker 4>The pursuit of subjective of interest in</v>
<v Speaker 4>there inevitably brings each individual </v>

1852
01:46:02.281 --> 01:46:03.114
<v Speaker 4>into contact with his own fears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>such contact mediocre in the social </v>

1853
01:46:06.871 --> 01:46:07.704
<v Speaker 4>sphere when expression of individuality </v>
<v Speaker 4>conflicts with normative behavior or in </v>

1854
01:46:11.281 --> 01:46:12.114
<v Speaker 4>this sphere of the absolutely unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When pursuit of individual interest </v>

1855
01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:16.013
<v Speaker 4>takes man beyond the cultural Canada and</v>
<v Speaker 4>places him against the forces that </v>

1856
01:46:18.931 --> 01:46:19.764
<v Speaker 4>govern mortality and limitation per se.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The heroic motive being is predicated </v>

1857
01:46:24.361 --> 01:46:27.930
<v Speaker 4>upon the assumption that something </v>
<v Speaker 4>divine exists within the individual that</v>

1858
01:46:27.931 --> 01:46:31.890
<v Speaker 4>is capable of manifesting itself when </v>
<v Speaker 4>called upon when necessary.</v>

1859
01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:33.353
<v Speaker 4>This is individual possibility arises to</v>
<v Speaker 4>meet the challenge presented by life </v>

1860
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:38.303
<v Speaker 4>without faith in the heroic challenge </v>
<v Speaker 4>must be avoided from the practical </v>

1861
01:46:41.821 --> 01:46:42.654
<v Speaker 4>viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this means the abandonment of </v>

1862
01:46:43.561 --> 01:46:46.260
<v Speaker 4>subjectivity and the search for </v>
<v Speaker 4>security.</v>

1863
01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:47.933
<v Speaker 4>This choice eliminates the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 4>for personal development and increases </v>

1864
01:46:51.181 --> 01:46:52.014
<v Speaker 4>the likelihood of fanatic identification</v>
<v Speaker 4>with history or adoption about outright </v>

1865
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:56.103
<v Speaker 4>distractedness.</v>

1866
01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:00.660
<v Speaker 4>Selfconsciousness means in knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual vulnerability.</v>

1867
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:02.223
<v Speaker 4>The process by which this knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to be can destroy faith and </v>

1868
01:47:04.501 --> 01:47:05.334
<v Speaker 4>individual work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What this means in concrete terms is </v>

1869
01:47:07.531 --> 01:47:10.950
<v Speaker 4>that in the course of development and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the individual may come to sacrifice his</v>

1870
01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:11.813
<v Speaker 4>own experience because it's pursuit </v>
<v Speaker 4>creates social conflict or exposes </v>

1871
01:47:15.361 --> 01:47:18.270
<v Speaker 4>individual inadequacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

1872
01:47:18.271 --> 01:47:19.104
<v Speaker 4>it is only through such conflict that </v>
<v Speaker 4>change takes place and weakness must be </v>

1873
01:47:21.721 --> 01:47:24.240
<v Speaker 4>recognized before it can be transformed </v>
<v Speaker 4>into strength.</v>

1874
01:47:24.930 --> 01:47:28.410
<v Speaker 4>This means that the sacrifice of </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuality eliminates any possibility</v>

1875
01:47:28.411 --> 01:47:30.720
<v Speaker 4>that individual strength can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>discovered or developed,</v>

1876
01:47:31.050 --> 01:47:31.883
<v Speaker 4>and then history itself can progress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Individuals whose life is without </v>

1877
01:47:35.911 --> 01:47:36.744
<v Speaker 4>meaning hate themselves for their </v>
<v Speaker 4>weakness and hate life or making them </v>

1878
01:47:39.991 --> 01:47:40.824
<v Speaker 4>weak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His hatred manifests itself and </v>

1879
01:47:42.331 --> 01:47:43.164
<v Speaker 4>identification with destructive power </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's mythological historical and </v>

1880
01:47:46.381 --> 01:47:47.214
<v Speaker 4>biological manifestations and in desire </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the absolute extinction of </v>

1881
01:47:50.011 --> 01:47:52.560
<v Speaker 4>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Such identification leads,</v>

1882
01:47:52.561 --> 01:47:54.870
<v Speaker 4>Manda poison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever he touches degenerate,</v>

1883
01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:55.853
<v Speaker 4>unnecessary misery in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 4>inevitable suffering to turn this </v>

1884
01:47:58.681 --> 01:48:02.340
<v Speaker 4>fellows against themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to intermingle earth with hail merely to</v>

1885
01:48:02.341 --> 01:48:04.530
<v Speaker 4>attain vengeance upon God garden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his creation,</v>

1886
01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.980
<v Speaker 4>the human purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if such a thing can be considered,</v>

1887
01:48:08.010 --> 01:48:08.843
<v Speaker 4>is to pursue meaning to extend the </v>
<v Speaker 4>domain of light and consciousness in </v>

1888
01:48:12.151 --> 01:48:13.320
<v Speaker 4>spite of limitation.</v>

1889
01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:17.670
<v Speaker 4>Meaningful event exists on the boundary </v>
<v Speaker 4>between security and novelty.</v>

1890
01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:18.953
<v Speaker 4>The pursuit of meaning exposes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual to the unknown in gradual </v>

1891
01:48:21.571 --> 01:48:22.404
<v Speaker 4>fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allowing him to develop strength and </v>

1892
01:48:23.881 --> 01:48:24.714
<v Speaker 4>adaptive ability in proportion to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>seriousness of his pursuit is during </v>

1893
01:48:28.621 --> 01:48:32.760
<v Speaker 4>contact with an unknown that human power</v>
<v Speaker 4>grows individually and then historically</v>

1894
01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:34.973
<v Speaker 4>meaning is the subjective experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>associated with that contact and </v>

1895
01:48:37.181 --> 01:48:38.014
<v Speaker 4>sufficient proportion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the great religious misstate that </v>

1896
01:48:42.271 --> 01:48:43.104
<v Speaker 4>continued pursuit of meaning adopted </v>
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily and without self deception </v>

1897
01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:50.070
<v Speaker 4>will lead the individual to discover his</v>
<v Speaker 4>identity with God and to the bead,</v>

1898
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:52.680
<v Speaker 4>thereby capable of withstanding the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tragedy of life.</v>

1899
01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:56.370
<v Speaker 4>Abandoned of such meaning reduces man </v>
<v Speaker 4>who is more than weaknesses.</v>

1900
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:59.520
<v Speaker 4>It makes them hate life and work towards</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's elimination.</v>

1901
01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:03.900
<v Speaker 4>It could be said that meeting is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>most profound manifestation of instinct,</v>

1902
01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:08.460
<v Speaker 4>so that's why I think Adam hid from God </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the garden of Eden.</v>

1903
01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:13.110
<v Speaker 4>Man is a creature attracted by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unknown and adapted for its conquest.</v>

1904
01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:14.953
<v Speaker 4>The subjective sense of meeting is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>instinct governing rate of contact with </v>

1905
01:49:17.611 --> 01:49:20.850
<v Speaker 4>the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too much exposure turns changed to chaos</v>

1906
01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:23.850
<v Speaker 4>and too little promote stagnation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>degeneration.</v>

1907
01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:25.343
<v Speaker 4>The appropriate balance produces a </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful individual confidence in the </v>

1908
01:49:28.321 --> 01:49:29.154
<v Speaker 4>ability to withstand life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever more able to deal with nature and </v>

1909
01:49:31.621 --> 01:49:34.230
<v Speaker 4>society and ever closer to the heroic </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideal.</v>

1910
01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:39.360
<v Speaker 4>Each individual constitutional unique </v>
<v Speaker 4>finds meaning in different pursuits.</v>

1911
01:49:39.570 --> 01:49:41.880
<v Speaker 4>If he has the courage to maintain his </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference,</v>

1912
01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:43.493
<v Speaker 4>manifestation of individual diversity </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformed into knowledge that can be </v>

1913
01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:51.400
<v Speaker 4>transferred socially changes the face of</v>
<v Speaker 4>history itself and moves each generation</v>

1914
01:49:51.401 --> 01:49:56.401
<v Speaker 4>of men farther into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Social and biological conditions defined</v>

1915
01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:57.413
<v Speaker 4>the boundaries of individual existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The unfailing pursuit of interest </v>

1916
01:50:00.611 --> 01:50:01.444
<v Speaker 4>provides the subject of means by which </v>
<v Speaker 4>these conditions can be met and their </v>

1917
01:50:04.211 --> 01:50:05.044
<v Speaker 4>boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Transcendent meaning is the instinct </v>

1918
01:50:07.661 --> 01:50:09.010
<v Speaker 4>that makes life possible.</v>

1919
01:50:09.390 --> 01:50:10.223
<v Speaker 4>When it is abandoned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>individuality loses its redemptive </v>

1920
01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:13.353
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The great lie is that meaning does not </v>

1921
01:50:15.281 --> 01:50:16.114
<v Speaker 4>exist or that it is not important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When meaning is denied hatred for life </v>

1922
01:50:19.901 --> 01:50:22.240
<v Speaker 4>and the for destruction inevitably </v>
<v Speaker 4>rules.</v>

1923
01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:26.810
<v Speaker 4>If you bring forth what is within you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you bring forth will save you.</v>

1924
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:29.200
<v Speaker 4>If you do not bring forth what is within</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1925
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:30.303
<v Speaker 4>what you do not bring forth will destroy</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wisdom of the group can serve as a </v>

1926
01:50:34.571 --> 01:50:35.404
<v Speaker 4>forest that mediates between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dependency of childhood and the </v>

1927
01:50:37.361 --> 01:50:38.194
<v Speaker 4>responsibility of the adult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This makes history of the power that </v>

1928
01:50:40.841 --> 01:50:41.674
<v Speaker 4>serves the individual society predicated</v>
<v Speaker 4>upon belief in the divinity of the </v>

1929
01:50:45.851 --> 01:50:46.684
<v Speaker 4>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allows individual interests to flourish </v>

1930
01:50:48.491 --> 01:50:52.450
<v Speaker 4>and to serve as the forest that opposes </v>
<v Speaker 4>the tyranny of culture and the terror of</v>

1931
01:50:52.451 --> 01:50:53.284
<v Speaker 4>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The denial of meaning by contrast </v>

1932
01:50:55.810 --> 01:50:59.980
<v Speaker 4>ensures absolute identification with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>group or interest psychic degeneration.</v>

1933
01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:00.813
<v Speaker 4>If such identification fails,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the denial of meaning makes the </v>

1934
01:51:04.211 --> 01:51:05.044
<v Speaker 4>individual desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the validity of identification is </v>

1935
01:51:07.601 --> 01:51:11.860
<v Speaker 4>challenged and the great maternal sea of</v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos threatens his weakness,</v>

1936
01:51:11.861 --> 01:51:12.694
<v Speaker 4>makes them hate life as well and to work</v>
<v Speaker 4>for it's devastation in him and as well </v>

1937
01:51:15.951 --> 01:51:16.784
<v Speaker 4>as those around the lie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the Central Act in this drama of </v>

1938
01:51:19.571 --> 01:51:20.404
<v Speaker 4>corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are the secrets sayings which the </v>

1939
01:51:23.411 --> 01:51:24.244
<v Speaker 4>living Jesus Spoken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which did a most Judas Thomas wrote </v>

1940
01:51:26.141 --> 01:51:29.050
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is from the Nag Hammadi Library,</v>

1941
01:51:29.970 --> 01:51:30.803
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever finds the interpretation of </v>

1942
01:51:32.921 --> 01:51:36.490
<v Speaker 4>these sayings will not experience death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ said,</v>

1943
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:40.090
<v Speaker 4>let him who seeks continue seeking until</v>
<v Speaker 4>he finds,</v>

1944
01:51:40.330 --> 01:51:41.163
<v Speaker 4>when he becomes troubled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he will be astonished and he will rule </v>

1945
01:51:44.081 --> 01:51:48.880
<v Speaker 4>over the all Jesus said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if those who lead you say to you,</v>

1946
01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:53.440
<v Speaker 4>see the kingdom is in the sky than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>birds of the sky will precede you.</v>

1947
01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:54.783
<v Speaker 4>If they say to you it is in the sea and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fish will proceed you rather the </v>

1948
01:51:58.691 --> 01:52:00.820
<v Speaker 4>kingdom is inside of you and it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside of you.</v>

1949
01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:02.193
<v Speaker 4>When you come to know yourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you will become known and you will </v>

1950
01:52:04.781 --> 01:52:05.614
<v Speaker 4>realize that is in you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it is you who are the sons of the </v>

1951
01:52:07.811 --> 01:52:10.480
<v Speaker 4>living father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you will not know yourselves,</v>

1952
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:13.360
<v Speaker 4>you dwell in poverty and it is you who </v>
<v Speaker 4>are that poverty.</v>

1953
01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:16.510
<v Speaker 4>Christ said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old man,</v>

1954
01:52:16.511 --> 01:52:17.344
<v Speaker 4>olden days will not hesitate to ask a </v>
<v Speaker 4>small child seven days old about the </v>

1955
01:52:20.321 --> 01:52:21.154
<v Speaker 4>place of life and he will live for many </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are first will become lost and they </v>

1956
01:52:24.431 --> 01:52:26.980
<v Speaker 4>will become one in the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ said,</v>

1957
01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:28.773
<v Speaker 4>recognize what is in your site and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>which is hidden from you will be </v>

1958
01:52:32.051 --> 01:52:32.884
<v Speaker 4>complaining to you for there is nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>hidden which will not become manifest </v>

1959
01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:40.480
<v Speaker 4>his disciples and said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you want us to fast?</v>

1960
01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:43.060
<v Speaker 4>How shall we pray?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shall we give arms?</v>

1961
01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 4>What Diet shall we observe?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christ said,</v>

1962
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:48.860
<v Speaker 4>do not tell lines and do not do what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>hate.</v>

1963
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:50.143
<v Speaker 4>For all things are playing in this side </v>
<v Speaker 4>of heaven for nothing hidden will not </v>

1964
01:52:52.581 --> 01:52:56.090
<v Speaker 4>become manifest and nothing covered will</v>
<v Speaker 4>remain without being uncovered.</v>

1965
01:53:07.790 --> 01:53:08.623
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1966
01:53:13.210 --> 01:53:16.420
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
