1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.583
<v Speaker 1>Hi everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So first I'd like to thank all of my </v>

2
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>viewers and listeners for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and support.</v>

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.100
<v Speaker 1>It's been absolutely overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still haven't reconciled myself to it,</v>

4
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:14.124
<v Speaker 1>but so far so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope to continue to produce </v>

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.773
<v Speaker 1>content that strikes a chord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would also like to thank my </v>

6
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>patrons supporters who have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily generous and helpful and</v>

7
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:27.294
<v Speaker 1>whose support has enabled many of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects that I'm going to discuss </v>

8
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:31.704
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what's been happening and </v>

9
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen over the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of months.</v>

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.443
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I'd like to announce is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the release today of my new youtube </v>

11
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>channel called Jordan B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson clips.</v>

12
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>It will feature clips that are five to </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes long,</v>

13
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:50.454
<v Speaker 1>some of which will be original and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of which will be derived from youtube </v>

14
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:58.191
<v Speaker 1>videos that have already been posted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious what the optimal length</v>

15
00:00:58.561 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>is for a youtube video.</v>

16
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.713
<v Speaker 1>It's new technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my team and I are experimenting </v>

17
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>with videos of different lengths to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what might be optimal.</v>

18
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>So we plan to release two to three </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos a week on that.</v>

19
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:11.521
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:12.354
<v Speaker 1>that's Jordan B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson clips and thank you to Gillian </v>

21
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Vardy who's going to be my daughter in </v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

22
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>She's engaged to my son Julian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's also helping on this project.</v>

23
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:21.024
<v Speaker 1>And also my daughter Mikayla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is about to have a baby in about a </v>

24
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.313
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're all doing the editing and </v>

25
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:27.564
<v Speaker 1>setting up the channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so thank you very much to them for </v>

26
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>the hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the first announcement.</v>

27
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>The second thing I would like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>announce is the release,</v>

28
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:37.344
<v Speaker 1>sometimes later this month of a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>website that will enable students to </v>

29
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.683
<v Speaker 1>enter their course descriptions of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>university courses and perhaps their </v>

30
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 1>high school courses as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with the professor's name,</v>

31
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>the discipline and the university.</v>

32
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.393
<v Speaker 1>And the website has an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence corps that will do a </v>

33
00:01:57.811 --> 00:01:58.644
<v Speaker 1>linguistic analysis of the content of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the course description and rate it as </v>

34
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.640
<v Speaker 1>postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neo,</v>

35
00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:04.474
<v Speaker 1>Marxist or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're interested in taking </v>

36
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:08.034
<v Speaker 1>postmodern neo Marxist courses in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university and undergoing that pathway </v>

37
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>of cult like indoctrination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can use the website to do that.</v>

38
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:21.441
<v Speaker 1>And if you'd like to avoid that and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself a classical education and learn</v>

39
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:22.554
<v Speaker 1>to speak and write and communicate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thank and familiarize yourself with the </v>

40
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>great works of civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can use it to do that.</v>

41
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 1>So we're hoping that that will be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily useful website.</v>

42
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.413
<v Speaker 1>And the overarching goal in part </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitated by that website is to cut </v>

43
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:37.434
<v Speaker 1>the enrollment in postmodern Neil </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxist courses of indoctrination in </v>

44
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>university across the Western world by </v>
<v Speaker 1>75% over the next five years.</v>

45
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's announcement number two.</v>

46
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.643
<v Speaker 1>Announcement number three is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to release a psychometrically </v>

47
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>valid personality test called the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>five aspects scale,</v>

48
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>and it's online form within the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

49
00:02:58.741 --> 00:02:59.574
<v Speaker 1>So you'll be able to go there and do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>five factor analysis of your own </v>

50
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>personality that will give you your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ratings for extroversion,</v>

51
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

52
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.273
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as breaking each of those down </v>

53
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>into two aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for extroversion,</v>

54
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>that's assertiveness and enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For neuroticism,</v>

55
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>it's withdrawal and volatility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For agreeableness,</v>

56
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>it's compassion and politeness for </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>

57
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.123
<v Speaker 1>its openness proper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is interest in aesthetics and </v>

58
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>interest in ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's intellect.</v>

59
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:32.314
<v Speaker 1>So openness will break down into </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness and intellect and finally </v>

60
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness into industriousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and orderliness.</v>

61
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.603
<v Speaker 1>And that will enable you to receive a </v>
<v Speaker 1>report on your personality that will </v>

62
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:43.324
<v Speaker 1>detail how you compare to other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of a percentile on each of </v>

63
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>those five major trait dimensions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 10 subsidiary dimensions.</v>

64
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.700
<v Speaker 1>We will also soon after release a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couples or dyad form of the same test so</v>

65
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.294
<v Speaker 1>that once you take the test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a friend take it or a </v>

66
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 1>sister or a brother or a child or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>parent or an employee for that matter.</v>

67
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.863
<v Speaker 1>And it will give you each a report on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your respective personalities but will </v>

68
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:12.154
<v Speaker 1>also inform you as to your similarities </v>
<v Speaker 1>and differences and where you were </v>

69
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:15.484
<v Speaker 1>clashing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you won't and what the basis for </v>

70
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 1>your misunderstandings might be and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work through them.</v>

71
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the third announcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then for the fourth announcement,</v>

72
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.533
<v Speaker 1>you may know that we've already created </v>
<v Speaker 1>a set of programs called the self </v>

73
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 1>authoring suite that helps adults right </v>
<v Speaker 1>about their past experiences,</v>

74
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 1>analyze their personalities in written </v>
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>

75
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.183
<v Speaker 1>That's different than getting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality report and make a plan for </v>

76
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:39.724
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The future authoring program has helped </v>

77
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:43.384
<v Speaker 1>university students increase the </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of staying in their courses </v>

78
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 1>by about 30% and increased their grade </v>
<v Speaker 1>point averages by about 25%.</v>

79
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.303
<v Speaker 1>We're going to release a high school </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of that at the beginning of </v>

80
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.233
<v Speaker 1>September.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're really looking forward to that </v>

81
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>and that that will take elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past authoring,</v>

82
00:04:58.781 --> 00:04:59.614
<v Speaker 1>president authoring and future authoring</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make them all accessible to high </v>

83
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:02.974
<v Speaker 1>school students who will be asked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look three to six months down the road </v>

84
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>in terms of character development and </v>
<v Speaker 1>future plans.</v>

85
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.963
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just putting the finishing touches </v>

86
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>on my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life,</v>

87
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.603
<v Speaker 1>an antidote to chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will be published by Penguin </v>

88
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Random House Canada and released January</v>
<v Speaker 1>9th,</v>

89
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.313
<v Speaker 1>2018.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm hoping that that book will </v>

90
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.503
<v Speaker 1>provide further background information </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarding the sorts of things that I've </v>

91
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 1>been discussing in my youtube lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the biblical series and uh,</v>

92
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.770
<v Speaker 1>provide an introduction to my ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially more straightforward and,</v>

93
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 1>and public friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

94
00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Then my previous book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning.</v>

95
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's the announcement stream.</v>

96
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it all is.</v>

97
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 1>In summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've launched a new youtube channel,</v>

98
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Jordan B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson clips.</v>

99
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be three to five videos a week.</v>

100
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Going up on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From five to five minutes long,</v>

101
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.223
<v Speaker 1>we're going to launch a postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxists content analyzer and consumer </v>

102
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 1>information site for university students</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wish to avoid being indoctrinated by</v>

103
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.520
<v Speaker 1>the radical leftists who've taken over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the humanities.</v>

104
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:08.354
<v Speaker 1>And we're hoping that that will help </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform the universities back into </v>

105
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>something approximating what they should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

106
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 1>We're going to release the big five </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect scale,</v>

107
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>which will enable people to get an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate indication of their personality</v>

108
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>along the big five dimensions and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>break each of the big five down into two</v>

109
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.913
<v Speaker 1>canonical aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've developed a high school self </v>

110
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>authoring suite that should come out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>September,</v>

111
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>that'll help high school students write </v>
<v Speaker 1>about themselves and understand who they</v>

112
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 1>are and start planning for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm putting the finishing touches on</v>

113
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 1>my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life,</v>

114
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.603
<v Speaker 1>an antidote to chaos that's already </v>
<v Speaker 1>available by the way for preorder at </v>

115
