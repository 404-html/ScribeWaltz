<v Speaker 1>The Bible is a series of books written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>edited,</v>

2
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:14.541
<v Speaker 1>and assembled over thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It contains the most influential stories</v>

3
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:16.074
<v Speaker 1>of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowledge of these stories is essential </v>

4
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>to a deep understanding of western </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.433
<v Speaker 1>which is in turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vital to proper psychological health as </v>

6
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our cultural animals,</v>

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.863
<v Speaker 1>and to societal stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These stories are neither history as we </v>

8
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>commonly conceived that nor empirical </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.513
<v Speaker 1>Instead their investigations into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of being itself and calls to </v>

10
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within that being,</v>

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>they have deep psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.253
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to make a quick video to </v>

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.843
<v Speaker 1>remind everyone or let everybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching know that I'm starting my </v>

14
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.344
<v Speaker 1>series on the stories of the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychological significance of the </v>

15
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>stories on the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On Tuesday,</v>

16
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>May 16th at the Isabel Bader theater in </v>
<v Speaker 1>downtown Toronto.</v>

17
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll put the address and everything at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the video.</v>

18
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:10.644
<v Speaker 1>In the description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to delve into the biblical </v>

19
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>stories from a psychological perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've wanted to do it for a long time</v>

20
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>and have done it in part in my maps of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning series,</v>

21
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:20.424
<v Speaker 1>but the biblical stories are are what </v>
<v Speaker 1>their canonical in relationship to the </v>

22
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>rest of our culture.</v>

23
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization itself,</v>

24
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>unless you're grounded in the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories there.</v>

25
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.933
<v Speaker 1>There are like a precondition for </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of the humanities and and </v>

26
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of history for that matter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want to improve my understanding of</v>

27
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:43.464
<v Speaker 1>them and share what I'm able to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with everybody that I can and so I </v>

28
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>wanted to just make a quick video to let</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone know that I'm going to run a 12</v>

29
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>week series about two hours lecture per </v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

30
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.673
<v Speaker 1>starting May 16th and running until </v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately mid August pretty much </v>

31
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>every week except a couple where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get the theater.</v>

32
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>It's really nice theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be good.</v>

33
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:04.884
<v Speaker 1>I'd also like to let everybody know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the videos will be a taped a thanks to </v>

35
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>initially showed them as soon as we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get them edited and all of that.</v>

36
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still season tickets left.</v>
