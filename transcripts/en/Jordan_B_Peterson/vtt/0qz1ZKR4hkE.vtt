1
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.553
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at the structure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise as it's presented in the in </v>

2
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.223
<v Speaker 1>genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first aspect of the initial </v>

3
00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:44.390
<v Speaker 1>paradisical state is unself </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

4
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:45.224
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at factor at an analytic </v>

5
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:50.810
<v Speaker 1>studies of human personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you note that self consciousness,</v>

6
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:53.240
<v Speaker 1>although it is arguably our greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>gift,</v>

7
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>also loads almost entirely on the factor</v>
<v Speaker 1>that defines negative effect.</v>

8
00:00:57.921 --> 00:01:02.300
<v Speaker 1>And you might also notice that when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say I became self conscious,</v>

9
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.283
<v Speaker 1>you generally put a negative cast on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in that I was talking before a </v>

10
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:09.620
<v Speaker 1>group of people and suddenly I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>seized by self consciousness.</v>

11
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.573
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was flooded by negative emotion and </v>

12
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:17.240
<v Speaker 1>was fundamentally a mobilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very paradoxical,</v>

13
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.400
<v Speaker 1>a very paradoxical state of being that </v>
<v Speaker 1>our highest a gift say,</v>

14
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.383
<v Speaker 1>and the only one that clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishes us from animals is also </v>

15
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:31.421
<v Speaker 1>that which when manifested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes us almost unbearably anxious.</v>

16
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.923
<v Speaker 1>The initial paradise state when Adam and</v>
<v Speaker 1>eve first walk in the garden of Eden is </v>

17
00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>characterized by an animal like unself </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

18
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Adam and eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they are,</v>

19
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>are not clearly segregated from the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

20
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

21
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:48.614
<v Speaker 1>of their own nakedness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you think about what nakedness </v>

22
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.613
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you immediately understand that that's </v>

23
00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>also a very profound dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

24
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with children that are around the age of</v>

25
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them,</v>

26
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.993
<v Speaker 1>regardless of their motive upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to become very concerned about </v>

27
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say with regards to bodily functions and</v>

28
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:08.414
<v Speaker 1>also very concerned about ever showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves without clothing and it's </v>

29
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:14.084
<v Speaker 1>perfectly reasonable to presume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a consequence of their emergent </v>

30
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:18.444
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness and event that takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>place somewhere between the ages of two </v>

31
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:24.080
<v Speaker 1>and five and that's a defining moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 1>That makes them segregated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will say from their mother.</v>

33
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.633
<v Speaker 1>And so you also have images of paradise </v>
<v Speaker 1>that float through Western history that </v>

34
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>are characterized by the image of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious union between the mother and</v>

35
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:39.021
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

36
00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:39.854
<v Speaker 1>which is a which has an images stick </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation that eradicates the </v>

37
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.040
<v Speaker 1>tension of self consciousness both for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother and for the child.</v>

38
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.933
<v Speaker 1>So the notion that the child is living </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a paradise will condition that </v>

39
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:58.421
<v Speaker 1>somehow lost as he or she approaches </v>
<v Speaker 1>adulthood gives another sort of symbolic</v>

40
00:02:58.671 --> 00:02:59.504
<v Speaker 1>layer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The notion of the pre self conscious </v>

41
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.853
<v Speaker 1>paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also a place where order in chaos </v>

42
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.903
<v Speaker 1>are imperfect balance and you know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what paradise means is para </v>

43
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.083
<v Speaker 1>around days a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wall while Eden means delight or a </v>

44
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:21.751
<v Speaker 1>place of delight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paradise Paradise is a walled garden,</v>

45
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>a wild place of delight and a garden is </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely that place where the forces of</v>

46
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>nature or chaos and the forces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture are held in perfect balance,</v>

47
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a garden is,</v>

48
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.043
<v Speaker 1>its nature given form by culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a place that's architecturally </v>

49
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.063
<v Speaker 1>pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place where the intervention of human </v>

50
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>activity has produced a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability that transcends that of nature</v>

51
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>because it's a cultural construct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that transcends that of culture</v>

52
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:50.884
<v Speaker 1>because all of the plants and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing things that constitute a garden </v>

53
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:54.904
<v Speaker 1>are somehow transcendent even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're under the cultivating hand of </v>

54
00:03:58.421 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>culture and the individual.</v>

55
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.790
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the manner in which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall story is represented,</v>

56
00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:08.624
<v Speaker 1>you all can also see that the place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous stability can be regarded as a </v>

57
00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:14.564
<v Speaker 1>kind of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you remember the story of Moses </v>

58
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.323
<v Speaker 1>leading his people through the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clearly the case that when the </v>

59
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:20.864
<v Speaker 1>Israelites were in the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they got away from the </v>

60
00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:25.010
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was easy to look back and say,</v>

61
00:04:25.011 --> 00:04:25.844
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 1>tough as it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place that we were before.</v>

63
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:31.070
<v Speaker 1>It was much better than the place we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

64
00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:31.904
<v Speaker 1>So it's perfectly reasonable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectable for people who are caught in </v>

65
00:04:35.751 --> 00:04:40.751
<v Speaker 1>a crisis to look back to the time prior </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the dawn of that crisis with longing,</v>

66
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.493
<v Speaker 1>even if the crisis that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>presently experiencing is a necessary </v>

67
00:04:45.171 --> 00:04:47.600
<v Speaker 1>precondition for further development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

68
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.860
<v Speaker 1>So the story that's laid out in genesis </v>
<v Speaker 1>has has its structure.</v>

69
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we became self conscious,</v>

70
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.990
<v Speaker 1>the world was perfect as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the rise of self consciousness.</v>

71
00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:04.190
<v Speaker 1>We were thrown out of the Garden of Eden</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of Paradise and destined to live the</v>

72
00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:05.024
<v Speaker 1>profane existence that characterizes our</v>
<v Speaker 1>president mode of being where we're </v>

73
00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:08.774
<v Speaker 1>subject to knowledge of mortality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of illness and </v>

74
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.673
<v Speaker 1>alienation from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wouldn't it be ever so great if we </v>

75
00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:16.334
<v Speaker 1>could only return to that condition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsolved consciousness and make all our </v>

76
00:05:20.301 --> 00:05:25.301
<v Speaker 1>problems go away and you see this kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of pathological paradisical reminiscence</v>

77
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.390
<v Speaker 1>manifesting itself in the most banal </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of conservatism,</v>

78
00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:30.224
<v Speaker 1>which are always projecting the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideal past somewhere back into the </v>

79
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.923
<v Speaker 1>unattainable reaches of time and also in</v>
<v Speaker 1>those situations that obtained </v>

80
00:05:39.801 --> 00:05:40.634
<v Speaker 1>psychologically when people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely possessed by depression and </v>

81
00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:48.101
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and wish for their consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come to an end,</v>

82
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.620
<v Speaker 1>if not metaphorically so they desire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

83
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.483
<v Speaker 1>Then actually so that suicide is viewed </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a kind of unconsciousness who's </v>

84
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.463
<v Speaker 1>paradisical nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The absence of all opposition is viewed </v>

85
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 1>as clearly preferable to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulties of actually maintaining.</v>

86
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Being</v>
<v Speaker 1>Julianna says,</v>

87
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.850
<v Speaker 1>the idea of paradise once and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise lost is not something unique to</v>

88
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:18.674
<v Speaker 1>western or a great eastern societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a widespread motif just as wide as </v>

89
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>this as the flood motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of where you go in the world,</v>

90
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:32.801
<v Speaker 1>you find this notion when heaven had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been abruptly separated from the earth,</v>

91
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.633
<v Speaker 1>that is when it had become remote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As in our days when the tree or vine </v>

92
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:39.704
<v Speaker 1>connecting Earth to heaven had been cut </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the mountain which used to touch the </v>

93
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:43.544
<v Speaker 1>sky had been flattened out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the paradisical stage was over and </v>

94
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>man entered into his present fallen </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>

95
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all myths of Paradise show us primordial</v>

96
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>man enjoying a beatitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneity and freedom,</v>

97
00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.933
<v Speaker 1>which he has unfortunately lost in </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the fall that is of what </v>

98
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:03.644
<v Speaker 1>followed upon the mythical event that </v>
<v Speaker 1>caused the rupture between heaven and </v>

99
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:07.904
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

100
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.600
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eden is delight,</v>

101
00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:19.650
<v Speaker 1>a place of delight by terminological </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>

102
00:07:19.651 --> 00:07:20.484
<v Speaker 1>Whereas paradise is a walled garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you what knowing that </v>

103
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 1>does for analysis of the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between eastern and Western thought.</v>

104
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 1>So let me tell you quickly the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha and I'm going to represent it</v>

105
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.883
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist starts his life in what's </v>

106
00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:43.524
<v Speaker 1>essentially a walled garden by all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by all reasonable comparative analysis </v>

107
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.130
<v Speaker 1>and as a consequence of his emergent </v>
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness.</v>

108
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.103
<v Speaker 1>The unselfconscious childlike perfection</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that early state is permanently </v>

109
00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.463
<v Speaker 1>disrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a situation where the </v>

110
00:08:00.241 --> 00:08:01.074
<v Speaker 1>greatest redemption story of the east </v>
<v Speaker 1>follows precisely the same grammatical </v>

111
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:07.230
<v Speaker 1>track as the greatest creation story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the West.</v>

112
00:08:07.231 --> 00:08:08.064
<v Speaker 1>So this is the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhas farther is visited by an angel </v>

113
00:08:11.401 --> 00:08:12.234
<v Speaker 1>who tells him that his son is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow up to be the greatest temporal </v>

114
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:16.973
<v Speaker 1>profane ruler the world has ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a great spiritual leader and his </v>

115
00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:20.790
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

116
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Being a pragmatic and conservative man </v>
<v Speaker 1>decides that there's no possible way.</v>

117
00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:26.604
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to allow my son to take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambivalent road of spiritual </v>

118
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.283
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to allow him to fall </v>

119
00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:34.344
<v Speaker 1>completely in love with the world so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he will remain attached to his </v>

120
00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:42.390
<v Speaker 1>domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So prior to Buddha's birth,</v>

121
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.530
<v Speaker 1>his father constructs a great city with </v>
<v Speaker 1>walls around it.</v>

122
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:51.180
<v Speaker 1>And inside that city he removes all </v>
<v Speaker 1>signs of pain,</v>

123
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.190
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and disappointment.</v>

124
00:08:53.191 --> 00:08:54.024
<v Speaker 1>Any sign of ugliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theat and the only people that are </v>

125
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:57.234
<v Speaker 1>allowed to exist within the city are </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who are in perfect mental and </v>

126
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>physical health who are paragons of </v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty and virtue.</v>

127
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:05.874
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that lurks behind that </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal story is that when a father </v>

128
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:11.184
<v Speaker 1>has a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the his moral obligation is to shield </v>

129
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:17.064
<v Speaker 1>the developing consciousness of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>child from contact with any of the </v>

130
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:21.174
<v Speaker 1>horrors of life that could provide the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child with an experienced too traumatic </v>

131
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:26.994
<v Speaker 1>for that developing consciousness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>apprehend so because it's an archetypal </v>

132
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 1>story that relates to the development of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all people,</v>

133
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:33.234
<v Speaker 1>not just the redemptive savior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the motif that the Buddhist </v>

134
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:37.374
<v Speaker 1>story initially follows at good father </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes his child fall in love with life </v>

135
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:42.743
<v Speaker 1>by enticing that child into a direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with all that life has to </v>

136
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 1>offer.</v>

137
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.760
<v Speaker 1>So Buddha grows up within this walled </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden,</v>

138
00:09:49.761 --> 00:09:54.761
<v Speaker 1>this unselfconscious paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but precisely because he's been shielded</v>

139
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.840
<v Speaker 1>to this degree and allowed to mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His consciousness continues to expand,</v>

140
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.073
<v Speaker 1>and the world outside the boundaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>that his parents have established for </v>

141
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:05.214
<v Speaker 1>him starts to attract his attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know already that the forbidden </v>

142
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:10.471
<v Speaker 1>fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:11.304
<v Speaker 1>The layer of what's outside the walls is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that human beings just can't </v>

144
00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 1>keep their mangy little paws off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

145
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.933
<v Speaker 1>We are absolutely uncontrollably curious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the best way to make sure that we </v>

146
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:22.824
<v Speaker 1>investigate something is to lay down a </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that says whatever you do </v>

147
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 1>under whatever circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never look there,</v>

148
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:30.444
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the automatic systems that </v>

149
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:32.694
<v Speaker 1>underlie our orienting and that motivate</v>
<v Speaker 1>our seeking experience are constantly </v>

150
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 1>pulling our attention precisely to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>forbidden spot,</v>

151
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 1>compelling us to investigate exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that which has been forbidden.</v>

152
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:47.991
<v Speaker 1>So because Buddha is a consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing in a healthy manner,</v>

153
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.193
<v Speaker 1>he immediately becomes curious about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what lies beyond the the limits that </v>

154
00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:53.934
<v Speaker 1>have been established with him and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a decision to go outside of </v>

155
00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

156
00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.003
<v Speaker 1>Which seems a particularly ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do given that in principle he </v>

157
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 1>has everything you could possibly want </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the walls,</v>

158
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:09.450
<v Speaker 1>but then again we have the troublesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of the original sin of Adam,</v>

159
00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:10.284
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is if any of you are offered a </v>

160
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:14.100
<v Speaker 1>forbidden fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

161
00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>under circumstances mythologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to those that are obtained in</v>

162
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:19.794
<v Speaker 1>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd immediately reach your hand out </v>

163
00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:21.954
<v Speaker 1>and take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what we haven't got for human </v>

164
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:27.390
<v Speaker 1>beings is always far more compelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>than what we have got.</v>

165
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.000
<v Speaker 1>So Buddha goes outside the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his father,</v>

166
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>who's a good father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although somewhat conservative,</v>

167
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:39.534
<v Speaker 1>decides he's going to rig the game a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit so it gets rid of everybody </v>

168
00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:46.350
<v Speaker 1>that's diseased or unhappy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable or ugly or old or anything</v>

169
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:48.840
<v Speaker 1>that could possibly disturb the Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any lines,</v>

170
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:49.674
<v Speaker 1>the streets with flower waving women and</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts pedals on the road and sends his </v>

171
00:11:53.961 --> 00:11:54.794
<v Speaker 1>son out in a gilded chariot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the gods who were lurking around </v>

172
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:58.144
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the troublemaking gods who represent </v>

173
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 1>chaos and disorder in the unknown decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stand in front of Buddha.</v>

174
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 1>A sick man who hobbles unsteadily </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

175
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.733
<v Speaker 1>And Buddha asks his his retainer </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely what this phenomena represent </v>

176
00:12:15.111 --> 00:12:16.300
<v Speaker 1>sand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His retainer says,</v>

177
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:16.931
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:17.764
<v Speaker 1>human beings like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sincere human are subject to the </v>

179
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:24.490
<v Speaker 1>deterioration of these physical powers </v>
<v Speaker 1>in an arbitrary way.</v>

180
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.353
<v Speaker 1>And this man is one person who's been so</v>
<v Speaker 1>affected and so buddha is completely </v>

181
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.353
<v Speaker 1>disenchanted by his exploratory move out</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the terrible unknown and runs back </v>

182
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:36.244
<v Speaker 1>into the castle walls and shuts the door</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is perfectly happy to think of </v>

183
00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 1>nothing for months.</v>

184
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.680
<v Speaker 1>But then as his anxiety habituates and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his curiosity grows,</v>

185
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.340
<v Speaker 1>he can't stand the notion of never going</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the walls again and outside.</v>

186
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:49.174
<v Speaker 1>He goes again and this time where after </v>
<v Speaker 1>his father prepares the route ever so </v>

187
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:54.274
<v Speaker 1>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the godsend insight and old man who </v>

188
00:12:56.561 --> 00:12:57.394
<v Speaker 1>hobbles interview and mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks at him in shock and horror and </v>

189
00:13:00.311 --> 00:13:04.450
<v Speaker 1>says to his retainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just precisely what's going on here.</v>

190
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 1>And His retainer says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

191
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 1>that's an old man and everybody gets all</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to get old too.</v>

192
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:15.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way of all humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the point at which voted.</v>

193
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Self consciousness expands not to only </v>
<v Speaker 1>include the possibility of degeneration,</v>

194
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:25.630
<v Speaker 1>but to include the temporal horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's characteristic of life.</v>

195
00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:26.464
<v Speaker 1>And he finds that so terribly shocking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he runs back into the castle and </v>

196
00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:30.574
<v Speaker 1>shuts the walls down and plays with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends for another six months or maybe </v>

197
00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:35.620
<v Speaker 1>a year till his anxiety.</v>

198
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Finally habituates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes out one final time.</v>

199
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:42.730
<v Speaker 1>And this time the godsend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A funeral parade for him and he sees his</v>

200
00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 1>first dad body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is such a terrible shock to him</v>

201
00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:49.120
<v Speaker 1>that he can't even go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>castle.</v>

202
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:49.954
<v Speaker 1>So his father prepares for him a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>party in the woods near the castle full </v>

203
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:54.544
<v Speaker 1>of nude dancing women who are perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to flaunt themselves and to </v>

204
00:13:58.061 --> 00:13:58.894
<v Speaker 1>offer themselves to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Buddha is so absolutely a </v>

205
00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:02.064
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really shocked by this notion of </v>

206
00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:04.444
<v Speaker 1>emergent death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he can't take any pleasure </v>

207
00:14:06.131 --> 00:14:08.110
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever and what's being offered to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

208
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.260
<v Speaker 1>and he leaves the kingdom once and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

209
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:12.130
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

210
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.470
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what happens to you when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you grow up.</v>

211
00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're reasonably well socialized and</v>

212
00:14:17.381 --> 00:14:18.214
<v Speaker 1>properly looked after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your curiosity gets the better of </v>

213
00:14:20.141 --> 00:14:20.974
<v Speaker 1>you and you keep going out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world until what year parents have </v>

214
00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:26.740
<v Speaker 1>established for you is no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient for you.</v>

215
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.560
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence of that movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>out into the world,</v>

216
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you find out all sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of your own life that not</v>

217
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:36.970
<v Speaker 1>only your parents can't precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain to you,</v>

218
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.983
<v Speaker 1>but even the broader formal structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your culture have a very difficult </v>

219
00:14:42.101 --> 00:14:42.934
<v Speaker 1>time handling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you finally do encounter such </v>

220
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:50.080
<v Speaker 1>realities and allow their effect on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fully manifest itself all,</v>

221
00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 1>then you're finally independent and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer can return home,</v>

222
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:55.843
<v Speaker 1>but from that point forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are also burdened as Adam is </v>

223
00:14:58.761 --> 00:14:59.594
<v Speaker 1>burdened when he loses his Paradise Hill</v>
<v Speaker 1>unselfconscious snus with the full </v>

224
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 1>revelation of what it means to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited and alive.</v>

225
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.190
<v Speaker 1>So what happens to Buddha as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of this revelation,</v>

226
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.940
<v Speaker 1>he becomes an apprentice and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronicles of the Buddhist adventure are</v>

227
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:17.834
<v Speaker 1>careful to say that he becomes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's most proficient practitioner of </v>

228
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.393
<v Speaker 1>Samka,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a philosophical precursor to </v>

229
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:29.810
<v Speaker 1>yoga and then to yoga so he masters all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the positions and the assanas until he's</v>

230
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:33.380
<v Speaker 1>disciplined physically to an almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlimited degree.</v>

231
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.520
<v Speaker 1>And then he decides that he'll adopt a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stance of world renunciation,</v>

232
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 1>which is also something he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkably good at.</v>

233
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.753
<v Speaker 1>And he starved himself until the chronic</v>
<v Speaker 1>lewis say he resembles nothing so much </v>

234
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:44.923
<v Speaker 1>as a pile of dust and then having </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhausted all the disciplinary </v>

235
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:52.400
<v Speaker 1>structures that his sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture has to offer him,</v>

236
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 1>but still not precisely finding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer that he's looking for.</v>

237
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.433
<v Speaker 1>He retreats into the forest place of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown and sits himself at the base of </v>

238
00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:06.161
<v Speaker 1>a tree underneath the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's visited by visions and temptations.</v>

239
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:10.340
<v Speaker 1>The first division is in essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>erotic one life itself,</v>

240
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.203
<v Speaker 1>camps him back out of his self conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>state into the domain of pure physical </v>

241
00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:18.020
<v Speaker 1>pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfectly reasonable temptation,</v>

242
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:18.854
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one that is powerful enough so that </v>

243
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Hindu philosophers say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>

244
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:26.000
<v Speaker 1>as their churches and cathedrals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered with erotic drawings.</v>

245
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.390
<v Speaker 1>If you can't get past the erotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawings into the church,</v>

246
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.790
<v Speaker 1>that's the domain that you should still </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabit,</v>

247
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:35.300
<v Speaker 1>right in the dawning phases of life at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least till middle age.</v>

248
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.133
<v Speaker 1>That's the appropriate motive being to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be enticed and seduced by the physical </v>

249
00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:43.280
<v Speaker 1>pleasures that life has to offer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the final analysis,</v>

250
00:16:43.281 --> 00:16:44.114
<v Speaker 1>those are not sufficient to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of emergent self consciousness </v>

251
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.523
<v Speaker 1>and so the angel of death visits him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>offered him the opportunity to exist </v>

252
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.080
<v Speaker 1>permanently in a state of Nirvana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very,</v>

253
00:16:57.081 --> 00:17:00.320
<v Speaker 1>very interesting twist on this story </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to wonder,</v>

254
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:01.154
<v Speaker 1>given the association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say between suicidality and the notion </v>

255
00:17:04.821 --> 00:17:05.654
<v Speaker 1>of paradise that exists underneath that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If what Buddha isn't being offered by </v>

256
00:17:08.691 --> 00:17:09.524
<v Speaker 1>the angel of death is in fact death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sensation of all the problems of </v>

257
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:14.084
<v Speaker 1>being regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he rejects that attains enlightenment </v>

258
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:17.894
<v Speaker 1>briefly and then decides to return to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world to share what he's discovered </v>

259
00:17:21.231 --> 00:17:22.064
<v Speaker 1>with all of suffering humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea being that the Buddha who is </v>

260
00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:26.744
<v Speaker 1>the awakened or enlightened one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of attaining a transcendent </v>

261
00:17:31.131 --> 00:17:31.964
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also knows fully that because human </v>

262
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:39.971
<v Speaker 1>beings have a shared social aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not possible for any one person to</v>

263
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:43.490
<v Speaker 1>attain redemption until all people </v>
<v Speaker 1>attain redemption.</v>

264
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.473
<v Speaker 1>The reason being that it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to be transcendent and </v>

265
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:51.480
<v Speaker 1>enlightened when you see someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick lying in a ditch,</v>

266
00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.613
<v Speaker 1>so then we shift from that back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis and the attempted fall of man </v>

267
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.670
<v Speaker 1>and read the third chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were both naked,</v>

268
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.160
<v Speaker 1>the man and his wife and were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>ashamed.</v>

269
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

270
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud pointed out one of human beings,</v>

271
00:18:14.091 --> 00:18:18.170
<v Speaker 1>most common nightmares is to be stripped</v>
<v Speaker 1>of clothing in front of a crowd.</v>

272
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.660
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would that be precisely?</v>

273
00:18:20.661 --> 00:18:21.494
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your naked self is the most vulnerable </v>

274
00:18:24.741 --> 00:18:25.910
<v Speaker 1>aspect of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

275
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.923
<v Speaker 1>Were all closed and for good reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly that's protection from the </v>

276
00:18:30.111 --> 00:18:31.820
<v Speaker 1>terrible natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

277
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:36.970
<v Speaker 1>but it also offers this the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>of placing a barrier between ourselves,</v>

278
00:18:37.521 --> 00:18:38.354
<v Speaker 1>our vulnerable cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the searching and critical gaze of </v>

279
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:42.290
<v Speaker 1>the community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

280
00:18:42.291 --> 00:18:43.124
<v Speaker 1>Because not only are we vulnerable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rigors of nature were also </v>

281
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:47.443
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to the depredations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticisms of society and the notion </v>

282
00:18:51.681 --> 00:18:54.890
<v Speaker 1>that a man and a woman could exist naked</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not know.</v>

283
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:55.723
<v Speaker 1>It is a clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a clear of finger pointing in the </v>

284
00:18:59.091 --> 00:18:59.924
<v Speaker 1>direction of a story that says these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were not conscious or if </v>

285
00:19:04.211 --> 00:19:05.044
<v Speaker 1>conscious they certainly were not self </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious and what's how does the story </v>

286
00:19:09.171 --> 00:19:10.004
<v Speaker 1>develop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The serpent was more subtle than any </v>

287
00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:15.980
<v Speaker 1>beast of the field which the Lord God </v>
<v Speaker 1>had made and he said unto the woman,</v>

288
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Yea Hath God said you shall not eat of </v>
<v Speaker 1>every tree of the garden.</v>

289
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.430
<v Speaker 1>And the woman said unto the serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

290
00:19:22.431 --> 00:19:24.590
<v Speaker 1>we meet of the fruit of the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the garden,</v>

291
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.770
<v Speaker 1>but of the fruit of the tree which is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the center of the garden.</v>

292
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.160
<v Speaker 1>God Hath said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should not eat of it,</v>

293
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.320
<v Speaker 1>neither shall you touch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lest you die,</v>

294
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:37.700
<v Speaker 1>and the serpent said to the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't die,</v>

295
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.390
<v Speaker 1>for God knows that in the day you eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>thereof.</v>

296
00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Then your eyes shall be opened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

297
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.470
<v Speaker 1>A clear pointing to the notion of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>awakening and an illumination,</v>

298
00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.000
<v Speaker 1>and you should be like gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing good and evil,</v>

299
00:19:53.001 --> 00:19:53.834
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which attributes to humanity a dawning </v>

300
00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:56.953
<v Speaker 1>sense of morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explicit morality of faculty for </v>

301
00:20:00.171 --> 00:20:03.740
<v Speaker 1>comprehension that we do not share with </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other animal,</v>

302
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:04.783
<v Speaker 1>and when the woman saw that the tree was</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for food and that it was pleasant </v>

303
00:20:07.371 --> 00:20:10.040
<v Speaker 1>to the eyes and a tree to be desired to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make one wise,</v>

304
00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.053
<v Speaker 1>she took of the fruit thereof and did </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat and gave also unto her husband with </v>

305
00:20:14.121 --> 00:20:18.650
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did eat women trouble.</v>

306
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.620
<v Speaker 1>What's the tree?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

307
00:20:21.621 --> 00:20:23.450
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

308
00:20:23.451 --> 00:20:24.650
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

309
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:26.443
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience from this particular </v>

310
00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:29.294
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think about that in a vertical </v>

311
00:20:32.001 --> 00:20:34.190
<v Speaker 1>planes with the layers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one on top of another,</v>

312
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:38.180
<v Speaker 1>then you can imagine the tree as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that unites these three layers.</v>

313
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.800
<v Speaker 1>The tree is the domain that unites chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>and order and the individual,</v>

314
00:20:42.801 --> 00:20:44.900
<v Speaker 1>the structure running up through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of it.</v>

315
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.913
<v Speaker 1>And you see a representation of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough from norse </v>

316
00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 1>mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is egg sale.</v>

317
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:51.880
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

318
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tree of the gods,</v>

319
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.060
<v Speaker 1>the tree that stands in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the norse paradise.</v>

320
00:20:58.061 --> 00:20:58.894
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about this particular tree </v>

321
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:01.774
<v Speaker 1>is that if you look at its roots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the roots are covered with snakes </v>

322
00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:05.404
<v Speaker 1>and serpents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sand underneath the snakes and serpents </v>

323
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.193
<v Speaker 1>is water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that you see that the tree it </v>

324
00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:14.380
<v Speaker 1>stands at the center of the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooted in chaos,</v>

325
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:15.214
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally is rooted in whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that constitutes the pre cosmogony </v>

326
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.913
<v Speaker 1>matrix of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the central aspects of this </v>

327
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:30.361
<v Speaker 1>domain are nicely laid out as the domain</v>
<v Speaker 1>of territoriality.</v>

328
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.413
<v Speaker 1>The end of the borders that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual understands and the habitual </v>

329
00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:35.314
<v Speaker 1>territory that he inhabits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the tree in the center </v>

330
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:43.230
<v Speaker 1>represents whatever it is that central </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this to our mode of being,</v>

331
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.730
<v Speaker 1>and so let's take a look at that in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>detail and flesh it out.</v>

332
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.073
<v Speaker 1>Symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find really add is saying the tree </v>

333
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:55.723
<v Speaker 1>stands hypothetically at the center of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is precisely that structure </v>

334
00:21:59.081 --> 00:21:59.914
<v Speaker 1>that Sharman climb when they make their </v>
<v Speaker 1>transition from the normal mode </v>

335
00:22:03.401 --> 00:22:06.280
<v Speaker 1>diversely being into their transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 1>mode of being.</v>

336
00:22:06.281 --> 00:22:07.150
<v Speaker 1>So Elliot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

337
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.223
<v Speaker 1>the symbolism of the ascension into </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven by means of a tree is clearly </v>

338
00:22:11.411 --> 00:22:14.910
<v Speaker 1>illustrated by the ceremony of </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiation of a shaman.</v>

339
00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.470
<v Speaker 1>The candidate climbs up a post in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of his,</v>

340
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.313
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His tent reaches with summit and goes </v>

341
00:22:20.141 --> 00:22:20.974
<v Speaker 1>out by the small coal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know that this opening made to </v>

342
00:22:23.201 --> 00:22:24.034
<v Speaker 1>let out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The smoke is likened to the whole made </v>

343
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:26.884
<v Speaker 1>by the pollstar in the vault of heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine there's a </v>

344
00:22:29.651 --> 00:22:30.484
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization of the world as </v>
<v Speaker 1>centered around a particular access and </v>

345
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:38.060
<v Speaker 1>that the tent is regarded as at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trans Trans.</v>

346
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.903
<v Speaker 1>Literally as a symbolic equivalent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that cosmological structure among other </v>

347
00:22:43.511 --> 00:22:44.344
<v Speaker 1>people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tent pole is called the pillar of </v>

348
00:22:45.431 --> 00:22:50.070
<v Speaker 1>the sky and as compared to the pole star</v>
<v Speaker 1>around which the world rotates a,</v>

349
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.600
<v Speaker 1>at least from the visual perspective and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name Dallas,</v>

350
00:22:52.601 --> 00:22:53.434
<v Speaker 1>where the nail of the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the ritual posts set up in the </v>

351
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:56.464
<v Speaker 1>middle of the court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an image of the cosmic tree which is </v>

352
00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:02.350
<v Speaker 1>found at the center of the world with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pole star shining directly above it.</v>

353
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.950
<v Speaker 1>By sending it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the candidate enters into heaven.</v>

354
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.010
<v Speaker 1>That is why as soon as he comes out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the smoke hole of the tent,</v>

355
00:23:09.011 --> 00:23:12.430
<v Speaker 1>he gives a loud cry invoking the help of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gods up there.</v>

356
00:23:12.431 --> 00:23:14.140
<v Speaker 1>He finds himself in their presence.</v>

357
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.013
<v Speaker 1>The tree is an absolutely archaic symbol</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me most likely that it </v>

358
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:28.240
<v Speaker 1>represents the structure of the nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

359
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.253
<v Speaker 1>I think a structure that's rooted not so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much in the spinal sensory motor </v>

360
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:35.770
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but deeply in the autonomic structure,</v>

361
00:23:35.771 --> 00:23:40.771
<v Speaker 1>stretching down into the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body and planting the mind firmly in its</v>

362
00:23:42.131 --> 00:23:42.964
<v Speaker 1>material substrate so that the autonomic</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and its projections up into the </v>

363
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.013
<v Speaker 1>Amygdala and the limbic system and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>up into the cortex constitute the </v>

364
00:23:50.691 --> 00:23:51.524
<v Speaker 1>interface between the spiritual domain </v>
<v Speaker 1>that our psyche and habits and the </v>

365
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:56.930
<v Speaker 1>material domain that constitutes our </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

366
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:02.410
<v Speaker 1>The tree at the center of our being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

367
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Tree do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it bears fruit well,</v>

368
00:24:04.981 --> 00:24:06.360
<v Speaker 1>what sort of fruit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

369
00:24:06.361 --> 00:24:07.194
<v Speaker 1>there are multiple medieval </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations that are quite peculiar </v>

370
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.000
<v Speaker 1>showing Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

371
00:24:12.001 --> 00:24:15.270
<v Speaker 1>as the fruit of the tree of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of good and evil,</v>

372
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.850
<v Speaker 1>the fruit of the tree of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what does that mean?</v>

373
00:24:17.851 --> 00:24:18.684
<v Speaker 1>It means that conceptualizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the hero are products of whatever </v>

374
00:24:23.011 --> 00:24:23.844
<v Speaker 1>it is that this tree represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tree is something that produces </v>

375
00:24:27.061 --> 00:24:27.894
<v Speaker 1>fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fruit is also something that can be </v>

376
00:24:29.371 --> 00:24:31.890
<v Speaker 1>ingested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as</v>

377
00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Eric Newman point out,</v>

378
00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.390
<v Speaker 1>wherever liquor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit,</v>

379
00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:40.493
<v Speaker 1>herbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. Appear as the vehicles of life and </v>

380
00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:45.660
<v Speaker 1>mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the water and bread of life.</v>

381
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.070
<v Speaker 1>The sAcrament of the host and every form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of food cult down to the present day.</v>

382
00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.980
<v Speaker 1>We have an ancient moat of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression before us,</v>

383
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.083
<v Speaker 1>so imagine the idea of the piagetian </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of assimilation and then </v>

384
00:24:58.471 --> 00:24:59.304
<v Speaker 1>accommodation and then understand it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar type of nutritive underlying </v>

385
00:25:03.811 --> 00:25:04.644
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea being that there is a tight </v>

386
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:12.010
<v Speaker 1>analogy between ingesting something </v>
<v Speaker 1>material and undergoing a transformation</v>

387
00:25:12.011 --> 00:25:15.240
<v Speaker 1>of of energy attendant upon that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

388
00:25:15.241 --> 00:25:16.074
<v Speaker 1>which is what happens when you eat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingesting a piece of information which </v>

389
00:25:19.561 --> 00:25:23.040
<v Speaker 1>offers you a new mode of doing things so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

390
00:25:23.041 --> 00:25:26.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will trade work for information.</v>

391
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:27.223
<v Speaker 1>They will trade food for information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There must be a kind of equivalence </v>

392
00:25:31.021 --> 00:25:31.854
<v Speaker 1>between work and information and food </v>
<v Speaker 1>and information because otherwise the </v>

393
00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:39.150
<v Speaker 1>trade wouldn't make sense and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that if you're informed,</v>

394
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.283
<v Speaker 1>you can undertake transformations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and the material world in a </v>

395
00:25:43.741 --> 00:25:44.574
<v Speaker 1>much more efficient manner because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what being informed means and </v>

396
00:25:47.641 --> 00:25:48.474
<v Speaker 1>that means that being informed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquiring some information and eating </v>

397
00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:52.884
<v Speaker 1>something are all tied up in a complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>way into the same metaphorical </v>

398
00:25:55.891 --> 00:25:56.724
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

399
00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Eat something forbidden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transform as a consequence.</v>

400
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:02.483
<v Speaker 1>Conscious realization is acted out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the elementary scheme of nutritive that </v>

401
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.093
<v Speaker 1>simulation and the ritual act of </v>
<v Speaker 1>concrete eating is the first form of </v>

402
00:26:09.931 --> 00:26:14.931
<v Speaker 1>assimilation known to man the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assimilation ingestion of the content.</v>

403
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:20.040
<v Speaker 1>The eaten food produces an interchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transformation of the body cells through</v>

404
00:26:20.041 --> 00:26:24.390
<v Speaker 1>food intake is the most elementary of </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal changes experienced by man.</v>

405
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.510
<v Speaker 1>How a weary enfeebled and famished man </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be turned into an alert,</v>

406
00:26:29.511 --> 00:26:30.344
<v Speaker 1>strong and satisfied being or a man </v>
<v Speaker 1>perishing of thirst can be refreshed or </v>

407
00:26:33.741 --> 00:26:36.140
<v Speaker 1>even transformed by an intoxicating </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>

408
00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:41.410
<v Speaker 1>This is and must remain a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience so long as man shall exist.</v>

409
00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:42.741
<v Speaker 1>Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new ones.</v>

410
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:43.574
<v Speaker 1>Point being that our psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of the capacity of </v>

411
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:49.854
<v Speaker 1>psychological transformation through </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating is a metaphor waiting to be </v>

412
00:26:53.461 --> 00:26:57.020
<v Speaker 1>applied to the equivalent experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we obtained,</v>

413
00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:57.893
<v Speaker 1>the equivalent excitement and sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformative possibility that we </v>

414
00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:06.111
<v Speaker 1>acquire as a consequence of coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>across some new and truly valuable piece</v>

415
00:27:06.301 --> 00:27:07.134
<v Speaker 1>of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have any idea that the tree that </v>

416
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:10.524
<v Speaker 1>stands at the center of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual mode of being and </v>

417
00:27:13.311 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 1>something that bears fruit and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingestion of that fruit.</v>

418
00:27:17.131 --> 00:27:17.964
<v Speaker 1>That idea say or that that piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information is something that can </v>

419
00:27:20.971 --> 00:27:23.550
<v Speaker 1>produce a permanent transformation.</v>
