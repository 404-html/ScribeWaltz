<v Speaker 2>The Liberty Lecture is intended to </v>

12
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:13.384

<v Speaker 2>variety of areas including environmental</v>

17
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:36.460
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental law and governance,</v>

19
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.790
<v Speaker 2>water law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and university governance.</v>

20
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.403
<v Speaker 2>Our guest today is Dr. Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a professor of psychology at the </v>

21
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.340
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto and a clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist.</v>

22
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.753
<v Speaker 2>He as many publications include his </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently published book 12 rules for </v>

23
00:01:56.591 --> 00:01:57.424
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an antidote to chaos and his research </v>

24
00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:01.534
<v Speaker 2>spans a number of topics including the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology of religion and the modern </v>

25
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 2>understanding of creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

26
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 2>I know that today's lecture has </v>
<v Speaker 2>generated a great deal of interest as is</v>

27
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:15.094
<v Speaker 2>evident from the packed hall here today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also generated a certain amount of </v>

28
00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:22.150
<v Speaker 2>heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The proposed topic,</v>

29
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.253
<v Speaker 2>the rising tide of compelled speech in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada is for many a controversial one </v>

30
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.243
<v Speaker 2>and I know that many of you in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience will hold widely divergent </v>

31
00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:34.324
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>

32
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.303
<v Speaker 2>I fully support your opportunity to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard and should you wish challenge the </v>

33
00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:40.924
<v Speaker 2>speakers to defend their positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that today's speakers likewise </v>

34
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:45.664
<v Speaker 2>share this conviction and we'll welcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>your comments and questions as might be </v>

35
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.060
<v Speaker 2>appropriate for a lecture series named </v>
<v Speaker 2>after liberty.</v>

36
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.930
<v Speaker 2>I believe it is also important for me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>affirm at outset that the core values of</v>

37
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:02.224
<v Speaker 2>the Faculty of law end of Queens </v>
<v Speaker 2>University include academic freedom and </v>

38
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 2>respectful dialogue among those with </v>
<v Speaker 2>differing views.</v>

39
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.603
<v Speaker 2>This includes providing our speakers </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the opportunity to be heard and </v>

40
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:16.834
<v Speaker 2>providing all of you with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to respond in a respectful </v>

41
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free from any harassment or any attempts</v>

42
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:25.564
<v Speaker 2>to shut down the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is in this spirit of free and </v>

43
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:30.874
<v Speaker 2>respectful academic exchange that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleased to launch her this new lecture </v>

44
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.374
<v Speaker 2>series.</v>

<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

49
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:02.974
<v Speaker 3>which is that this event would not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened without the initiative in </v>

<v Speaker 3>support of Greg Kids.</v>

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 3>As principal of Wolf said on his blog,</v>

<v Speaker 3>A the first thing I would like to say is</v>

74
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:01.964

<v Speaker 3>sale.</v>

<v Speaker 3>12 rules for like 12,</v>

78
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 3>12 rules for like wanting to get the 12 </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it was,</v>

79
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:16.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

80

<v Speaker 3>that's not 12 steps.</v>

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.320
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

82
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.973
<v Speaker 3>we are going to proceed as follows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan and I are going to have a </v>

83
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:28.004
<v Speaker 3>conversation for half an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 40 minutes and then we are going </v>

84
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:34.664
<v Speaker 3>to throw the floor open to questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll describe what kinds of questions </v>

85
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.870
<v Speaker 3>that you should ask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

86
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.793
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get to that stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but our topic is the rising tide of </v>

87
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.074
<v Speaker 3>compelled speech in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am going to take just a couple of </v>

88
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:53.743
<v Speaker 3>minutes to give us some context and set </v>
<v Speaker 3>it up and then I'll ask Jordan to tell </v>

89
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:00.374
<v Speaker 3>us what he thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You may have seen the CBC production of </v>

90
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 3>the tutors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The story of King Henry the eighth</v>

91
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.963
<v Speaker 3>in one episode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the king has condemned Thomas Moore to </v>

92
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:27.221
<v Speaker 3>death</v>
<v Speaker 3>for refusing to say that the king is the</v>

93
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:32.501
<v Speaker 3>head of the Church of England</v>
<v Speaker 3>more is it his cell awaiting execution?</v>

94
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.333
<v Speaker 3>A friend comes to him to plead with him </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say what it is the king wants to </v>

95
00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:45.714
<v Speaker 3>hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Morris says he cannot do that for he </v>

96
00:07:51.421 --> 00:07:56.421
<v Speaker 3>does not believe it to be true</v>
<v Speaker 3>in exasperations.</v>

97
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.370
<v Speaker 3>The friends says</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to believe it.</v>

98
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.323
<v Speaker 3>You just have to say it</v>
<v Speaker 3>when your brain makes that kind of </v>

99
00:08:14.951 --> 00:08:15.784
<v Speaker 3>calculation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you are under the thumb of a </v>

100
00:08:20.881 --> 00:08:25.881
<v Speaker 3>tyrant</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Thomas Moore lost his head.</v>

101
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.460
<v Speaker 3>The tide of compelled speech in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 3>is rising.</v>

102
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.453
<v Speaker 3>The Law Society of Ontario has </v>
<v Speaker 3>introduced a new policy that requires </v>

103
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.063
<v Speaker 3>each lawyer to develop a statement of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Principles which endorses and </v>

104
00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:52.390
<v Speaker 3>acknowledges an obligation to promote </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain values.</v>

105
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.960
<v Speaker 3>The Ontario Human Rights Commission says</v>
<v Speaker 3>that under the Human Rights Code,</v>

106
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.573
<v Speaker 3>failing to address somebody by their </v>
<v Speaker 3>preferred Pronoun will constitute </v>

107
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.580
<v Speaker 3>discrimination for which you may be </v>
<v Speaker 3>investigated and prosecuted.</v>

108
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:21.550
<v Speaker 3>The Elementary Teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Federation of Ontario has introduced new</v>

109
00:09:22.221 --> 00:09:23.054
<v Speaker 3>curriculum</v>
<v Speaker 3>to require teachers to teach elementary </v>

110
00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:27.824
<v Speaker 3>students about white privilege</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Federal Summer Jay Grants </v>

111
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 3>Program requires applicants to attest to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the values,</v>

112
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.730
<v Speaker 3>but the government believes it.</v>

113
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

114
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.730
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to believe it.</v>

115
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:58.550
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

116
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.390
<v Speaker 4>that's pure narcissism at work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

117
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.640
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

118
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.673
<v Speaker 4>it due to hijack hijacking event like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this that other people put time and </v>

119
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:12.744
<v Speaker 4>effort into and to use the civility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the crowd and the civility of the </v>

120
00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:21.680
<v Speaker 4>organizers as an excuse to blatantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>yellow.</v>

121
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.320
<v Speaker 4>You're ill informed opinions is no way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to conduct a civil dialogue.</v>

122
00:11:25.321 --> 00:11:27.420
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people who do that,</v>

123
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:28.254
<v Speaker 4>she'd be embarrassed.</v>

124
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:38.730
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

125
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.700
<v Speaker 4>I would also say that as students and as</v>
<v Speaker 4>faculty members,</v>

126
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:44.803
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't put up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way that you should allow </v>

127
00:11:46.821 --> 00:11:47.654
<v Speaker 4>people who are doing this to hijack your</v>
<v Speaker 4>educational opportunities and to bend </v>

128
00:11:50.991 --> 00:11:54.610
<v Speaker 4>and twist the functions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the structures of the university.</v>

129
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 4>It's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not In any way at all.</v>

130
00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.000
<v Speaker 4>He would say that was a very disgraceful</v>
<v Speaker 4>display fundamentally.</v>

131
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 4>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's stick with it.</v>

132
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.443
<v Speaker 4>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you think people are afraid of </v>

133
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:12.100
<v Speaker 4>free speech?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

134
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:12.963
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people develop an ideological view of </v>

135
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:15.844
<v Speaker 4>the world because they don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>think through things in real detail and </v>

136
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.233
<v Speaker 4>they're aided and embedded in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>endeavor by their pathological </v>

137
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.420
<v Speaker 4>professors who are feeding them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

138
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.653
<v Speaker 4>what would I say over simplified?</v>
<v Speaker 4>An oversimplified radical view of the </v>

139
00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 4>world in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is fundamentally based in,</v>

140
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.610
<v Speaker 4>in resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that there's no reason for,</v>

141
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a left wing view of the world and we can</v>

142
00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:39.370
<v Speaker 4>get to that later.</v>

143
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.550
<v Speaker 4>It's easy virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

144
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:43.384
<v Speaker 4>you can stand up in front of 900 people </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your plot card and your and your </v>

145
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 4>screeching and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can declaim to the entire audience,</v>

146
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:51.544
<v Speaker 4>your fundamental moral superiority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can tell everyone at once that </v>

147
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:55.744
<v Speaker 4>they're all beneath you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing for the right thing and </v>

148
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 4>absolutely none of that is earned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

149
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:01.990
<v Speaker 4>like what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the hell was that?</v>

150
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 4>There's no seriously man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's just,</v>

151
00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:07.580
<v Speaker 4>it's just complete misbehavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's embarrassing.</v>

152
00:13:07.581 --> 00:13:10.210
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who do that don't have enough</v>

153
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:13.690
<v Speaker 4>sense to go hide their head in shame </v>
<v Speaker 4>just tells you how badly socialized they</v>

154
00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:16.810
<v Speaker 4>are and how terribly educated they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is,</v>

155
00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:20.590
<v Speaker 4>the thing that's so awful is that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are professors and educators who promote</v>

156
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:21.101
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>

157
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how you change the world.</v>

158
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 4>It's like it is how you change the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

159
00:13:23.831 --> 00:13:25.720
<v Speaker 4>but it's certainly not how you make it </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

160
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.880
<v Speaker 4>You make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clearly,</v>

161
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is no comfort in that and,</v>

162
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.980
<v Speaker 4>and there's nothing about it this </v>
<v Speaker 4>impressive.</v>

163
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:33.843
<v Speaker 4>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's no better in some sense than a two </v>

164
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:37.760
<v Speaker 4>year old having a tantrum on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

165
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:38.643
<v Speaker 4>it shows as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it approximate the same level of </v>

166
00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:42.454
<v Speaker 4>psychosocial development.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when the fact that that this is </v>

167
00:13:45.101 --> 00:13:45.934
<v Speaker 4>happening continually universities is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it truly makes me embarrassed to be </v>

168
00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:50.974
<v Speaker 4>associated with the university.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now I say that with great </v>

169
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.600
<v Speaker 4>displeasure because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

170
00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:56.434
<v Speaker 4>I'd been working for great universities </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a very long time and the university </v>

171
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:01.420
<v Speaker 4>has an absolutely remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 4>institution.</v>

172
00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's survived for a thousand years.</v>

173
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.650
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to see it,</v>

174
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.760
<v Speaker 4>to see it brought down by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by people whose behavior would be out of</v>

175
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:11.910
<v Speaker 4>place at a four year old's birthday </v>
<v Speaker 4>party is,</v>

176
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.890
<v Speaker 4>is something something bizible to </v>
<v Speaker 4>behold.</v>

177
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:16.643
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what about the actions of government </v>

178
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.430
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it is government after all,</v>

179
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.760
<v Speaker 4>that is the source of this compelled </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech as law,</v>

180
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.960
<v Speaker 4>as well as other ways in which they seek</v>
<v Speaker 4>to restrict speech.</v>

181
00:14:28.961 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 4>But the compelled speech is the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>egregious form of violation.</v>

182
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell us about that.</v>

183
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:36.034
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying,</v>

184
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.310
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to sort this out </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

185
00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.144
<v Speaker 4>if you're a clinician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say one of the problems you </v>

186
00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:44.014
<v Speaker 4>always have when you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior that's gone astray is to </v>

187
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.200
<v Speaker 4>understand at what level of analysis you</v>
<v Speaker 4>should address it.</v>

188
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it a theological problem?</v>

189
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.450
<v Speaker 4>Is it a philosophical problem?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it a psychological problem?</v>

190
00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:58.310
<v Speaker 4>Is it social,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it economic?</v>

191
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.640
<v Speaker 4>These are very complicated questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it a trivial issue?</v>

192
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:03.230
<v Speaker 4>Is it an issue of rights?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>

193
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.083
<v Speaker 4>is it something else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people who put in the bill see 16 </v>

194
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:08.294
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and its associated legislation make the </v>

195
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:11.144
<v Speaker 4>claim that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a legislative move that's </v>

196
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.290
<v Speaker 4>facilitated by nothing but compassion </v>
<v Speaker 4>and desire to expand the domain of,</v>

197
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of let's say,</v>

198
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 4>of of rights and freedoms.</v>

199
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:21.703
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing wrong in principle with </v>

200
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.630
<v Speaker 4>expanding the domain of rights and </v>
<v Speaker 4>freedoms,</v>

201
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:27.583
<v Speaker 4>except of course for every right and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for every freedom there's an </v>

202
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:33.620
<v Speaker 4>attendant responsibility and obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to keep that in mind.</v>

203
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 4>When I looked at bill [inaudible] 16 and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the legislation that surrounded it,</v>

204
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 4>especially that was written by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ontario Human Rights Commission,</v>

205
00:15:40.701 --> 00:15:41.534
<v Speaker 4>the policies that surrounded it and also</v>
<v Speaker 4>the policies that gave rise to the </v>

206
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 4>social justice tribunals named social </v>
<v Speaker 4>justice tribunals.</v>

207
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.510
<v Speaker 4>Appallingly enough that that that gave </v>
<v Speaker 4>rise to those tribunals in Ontario.</v>

208
00:15:53.511 --> 00:15:55.640
<v Speaker 4>The things I read just made my hair </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand on end.</v>

209
00:15:55.641 --> 00:15:56.474
<v Speaker 4>You know the social justice tribunals </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the right to place themselves </v>

210
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Speaker 4>outside of legal [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside of jurors prudential precedents.</v>

211
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.110
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell is that?</v>

212
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.460
<v Speaker 4>That's really what you're going to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>the case.</v>

213
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.323
<v Speaker 4>The only way I think that you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>justify doing that is it if you torture </v>

214
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.073
<v Speaker 4>yourself into the ideological </v>
<v Speaker 4>proposition that English common law is </v>

215
00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:18.770
<v Speaker 4>somehow an oppressive branch of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy.</v>

216
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:19.603
<v Speaker 4>And because of that you have every right</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even obligation to place yourself </v>

217
00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:26.390
<v Speaker 4>outside of its structure of precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we don't want to.</v>

218
00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 4>Police are so outside of the structure </v>
<v Speaker 4>of precedent of English common law.</v>

219
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:30.704
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the supreme achievements of </v>

220
00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:34.250
<v Speaker 4>the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

221
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:35.323
<v Speaker 4>it's produced societies that are as free</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as productive as any societies have </v>

222
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:43.331
<v Speaker 4>ever been anywhere on the planet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly are now and t to dare to state</v>

223
00:16:44.391 --> 00:16:47.090
<v Speaker 4>that you would place yourself outside of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that precedent.</v>

224
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.550
<v Speaker 4>That's the sort of thing that made my </v>
<v Speaker 4>hair stand on end.</v>

225
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.063
<v Speaker 4>And there were other elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>policies that were equally </v>

226
00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:54.170
<v Speaker 4>reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not least,</v>

227
00:16:54.171 --> 00:16:56.660
<v Speaker 4>their complete incoherence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>formulation.</v>

228
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't understand some of it,</v>

229
00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:00.830
<v Speaker 4>like I don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

230
00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:02.820
<v Speaker 4>with regards to the gender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

231
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:04.003
<v Speaker 4>propositions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it can be that you can be anywhere </v>

232
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Speaker 4>on the gender spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>

233
00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:08.354
<v Speaker 4>it's not a spectrum technically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it actually matters which words you </v>

234
00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:11.360
<v Speaker 4>use.</v>

235
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.193
<v Speaker 4>If you're writing law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can be anywhere or nowhere on that </v>

236
00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:15.194
<v Speaker 4>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

237
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:16.423
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't believe that the people who </v>

238
00:17:18.051 --> 00:17:18.531
<v Speaker 4>wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

239
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:19.364
<v Speaker 4>what it means either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you don't write things that you </v>

240
00:17:21.051 --> 00:17:21.884
<v Speaker 4>don't understand into the damn law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't do that because the law </v>

241
00:17:25.071 --> 00:17:28.910
<v Speaker 4>unfolds in society and it tangles people</v>
<v Speaker 4>up as it unfolds.</v>

242
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 4>And it's no joke when that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you'll be very,</v>

243
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:35.270
<v Speaker 4>very careful when you're writing law and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you certainly don't want to write law to</v>

244
00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:37.700
<v Speaker 4>push forward your ideological </v>
<v Speaker 4>commitments,</v>

245
00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:42.170
<v Speaker 4>especially in the face of precedent </v>
<v Speaker 4>because precedent is what keeps law from</v>

246
00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:45.320
<v Speaker 4>degenerating into audiology essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So and so.</v>

247
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>

248
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:47.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tap to answer your question,</v>

249
00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:48.923
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

250
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.830
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

251
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.873
<v Speaker 4>more fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that this argument has </v>

252
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:57.300
<v Speaker 4>ever been about the rights of </v>
<v Speaker 4>transgender people.</v>

253
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.553
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's an attempt by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>radical left ideologues to push their </v>

254
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 4>ideological agenda forward using,</v>
<v Speaker 4>using,</v>

255
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.310
<v Speaker 4>they're using attempts to manipulate the</v>
<v Speaker 4>linguistic domain.</v>

256
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.143
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not willing to seat the loot </v>
<v Speaker 4>linguistic domain because I don't think </v>

257
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:12.744
<v Speaker 4>there are any more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything more important than the words </v>

258
00:18:14.881 --> 00:18:17.460
<v Speaker 4>that you use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when the government says we,</v>

259
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:18.294
<v Speaker 4>you should start using these words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should start thinking hard about </v>

260
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:21.384
<v Speaker 4>your damn government because your words </v>
<v Speaker 4>are no different than your thoughts and </v>

261
00:18:24.691 --> 00:18:26.280
<v Speaker 4>your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Orient Yourself,</v>

262
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.343
<v Speaker 4>your thoughts orient you in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if someone who's going to tell you </v>

263
00:18:30.091 --> 00:18:30.924
<v Speaker 4>what it is that you have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're going to disorient you and </v>

264
00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:34.674
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I wouldn't recommend that because </v>

265
00:18:35.941 --> 00:18:38.250
<v Speaker 4>there's lots of terrible things that can</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen to you.</v>

266
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.293
<v Speaker 4>And if you're disoriented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to run into a very large </v>

267
00:18:41.311 --> 00:18:44.010
<v Speaker 4>number of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's how it looks to me.</v>

268
00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:45.010
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

269
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:45.820
<v Speaker 4>but the</v>

270
00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:50.260
<v Speaker 3>ideological context of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like something has changed.</v>

271
00:18:50.261 --> 00:18:51.094
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you think back decades </v>

272
00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.130
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberals were,</v>

273
00:18:57.131 --> 00:18:57.964
<v Speaker 3>the champions are free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it was the conservatives at a </v>

274
00:19:01.511 --> 00:19:04.300
<v Speaker 3>certain moment in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are the sensors,</v>

275
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

276
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.903
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sought to curb a blasphemy and </v>

277
00:19:08.351 --> 00:19:11.500
<v Speaker 3>obscenity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sedition and so on.</v>

278
00:19:11.501 --> 00:19:13.360
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Liberals said,</v>

279
00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.820
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>free speech is the way we want to go.</v>

280
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:21.310
<v Speaker 3>And yet today that has flipped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

281
00:19:21.311 --> 00:19:22.144
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look back to what left leaning </v>

282
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.610
<v Speaker 3>officials and authorities and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

283
00:19:28.611 --> 00:19:30.970
<v Speaker 3>and figures said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lemme just give you one quote.</v>

284
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.833
<v Speaker 3>This is Samuel Gompers who is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>founder of the American Federation of </v>

285
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.580
<v Speaker 3>Labor in 1886 he said this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

286
00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:47.560
<v Speaker 3>the freedom of speech has been granted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the people in order that they may say</v>

287
00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:50.490
<v Speaker 3>the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

288
00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.370
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Misquoted,</v>

289
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.630
<v Speaker 3>that have not been granted to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

290
00:19:55.631 --> 00:19:56.464
<v Speaker 3>In order that they may say the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>which please and which are based upon </v>

291
00:20:00.251 --> 00:20:01.084
<v Speaker 3>excepted thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the right to say the things which </v>

292
00:20:04.841 --> 00:20:05.674
<v Speaker 3>displease the right to say the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>which may convey the new and yet </v>

293
00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:13.810
<v Speaker 3>unexpected thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right to say things even though they</v>

294
00:20:13.811 --> 00:20:14.644
<v Speaker 3>do a wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that is not a sentiment now carried </v>

295
00:20:17.501 --> 00:20:21.730
<v Speaker 3>on by the left and today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What has happened?</v>

296
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.573
<v Speaker 4>Well again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see that it's a consequence of </v>

297
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:30.210
<v Speaker 4>continual adjective agitation by I would</v>
<v Speaker 4>say a minority of of the left,</v>

298
00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:31.044
<v Speaker 4>the radical left in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and those are people who aren't Marxist </v>

299
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.693
<v Speaker 4>Slash Neo Marxist in their fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideological orientation and have joined </v>

300
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:44.451
<v Speaker 4>that in an unholy union with the worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>of French postmodernism and they push it</v>

301
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.530
<v Speaker 4>ideological certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the thing that,</v>

302
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:51.603
<v Speaker 4>the thing that's really distressing </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that is that if you know anything </v>

303
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:54.874
<v Speaker 4>about the history of oppressed people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say much as I hate to engage in </v>

304
00:20:58.571 --> 00:21:01.150
<v Speaker 4>that particular form of dialogue under </v>
<v Speaker 4>the current conditions,</v>

305
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.770
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty obvious that it's freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 4>speech is freedom.</v>

306
00:21:05.771 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 4>That's particularly important for people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who don't have anything else,</v>

307
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:09.850
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

308
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.120
<v Speaker 4>if you're supporting freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not supporting the status quo.</v>

309
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:14.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just think about,</v>

310
00:21:14.051 --> 00:21:14.884
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's use the logic of the radical </v>

311
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:16.864
<v Speaker 4>leftists and assume that society is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tyrannical hierarchy and the people at </v>

312
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:22.600
<v Speaker 4>the top have the upper hand in </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

313
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:28.050
<v Speaker 4>including access to communication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These people are not your friends.</v>

314
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you say</v>

315
00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.653
<v Speaker 1>mark my words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sounds of the barbarians pounding </v>

316
00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:55.770
<v Speaker 1>out the gate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

317
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

318
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that use of in Kuwait,</v>

319
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.393
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it in Kuwait </v>
<v Speaker 4>sensation is the best formulation of </v>

320
00:22:15.341 --> 00:22:16.174
<v Speaker 4>their argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's not much difference between </v>

321
00:22:18.341 --> 00:22:20.380
<v Speaker 4>knocking on the doors and knocking on </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

322
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 4>So keep that in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not amusing.</v>

323
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing for it.</v>

324
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:31.420
<v Speaker 4>The thing that's also quite appalling is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's no evidence whatsoever that</v>

325
00:22:31.421 --> 00:22:33.290
<v Speaker 4>the people who are conducting these </v>
<v Speaker 4>protests,</v>

326
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.143
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it is that they're protesting </v>

327
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:36.400
<v Speaker 4>against.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

328
00:22:36.401 --> 00:22:37.234
<v Speaker 4>I was in,</v>

329
00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:45.950
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

330
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.193
<v Speaker 4>I was in the midst of a discussion and </v>
<v Speaker 4>attempting to make the case that it's </v>

331
00:22:51.461 --> 00:22:52.294
<v Speaker 4>freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it is what people who have </v>

332
00:22:54.491 --> 00:22:56.440
<v Speaker 4>nothing still have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

333
00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.280
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at the tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure of our society,</v>

334
00:23:00.281 --> 00:23:04.210
<v Speaker 4>let's say the people at the top have </v>
<v Speaker 4>access to means of communication.</v>

335
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.283
<v Speaker 4>Everyone knows that it's the people at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottom who have the right to say </v>

336
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:11.290
<v Speaker 4>what they think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>however badly they say it,</v>

337
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.470
<v Speaker 4>that enables them to get a toe hold into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the system and to,</v>

338
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.820
<v Speaker 4>and to make their suffering known.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what freedom of speech is for.</v>

339
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.940
<v Speaker 4>And so like what's the protest against </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

340
00:23:21.941 --> 00:23:22.774
<v Speaker 4>And I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the rowdy called Neo Marxists </v>

341
00:23:25.121 --> 00:23:25.954
<v Speaker 4>types.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They speak the language of power and </v>

342
00:23:27.551 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 4>that's what you're speaking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you want to live in a world where</v>

343
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 4>everyone speaks the language of power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then just let them do what they're doing</v>

344
00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:37.510
<v Speaker 4>and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>

345
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.690
<v Speaker 4>It's not a pretty rote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're all in a position,</v>

346
00:23:40.691 --> 00:23:41.524
<v Speaker 4>you're on a situation in your life now </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you have to make decisions about </v>

347
00:23:43.781 --> 00:23:44.614
<v Speaker 4>this sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like is this the sort of institution </v>

348
00:23:46.581 --> 00:23:47.780
<v Speaker 4>that you want this to be?</v>

349
00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:50.980
<v Speaker 3>What are the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

350
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.833
<v Speaker 3>one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments against what you said about </v>

351
00:23:56.161 --> 00:23:57.250
<v Speaker 3>the pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

352
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

353
00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.113
<v Speaker 3>after all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you're being asked to do is to say </v>

354
00:24:03.781 --> 00:24:04.614
<v Speaker 3>something that is reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not unreasonable to address </v>

355
00:24:08.071 --> 00:24:10.140
<v Speaker 3>somebody by the pronouns that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>prefer.</v>

356
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.550
<v Speaker 3>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think of any kind of speech which</v>

357
00:24:17.551 --> 00:24:22.551
<v Speaker 3>is prescribed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine a statute that said people shall</v>

358
00:24:23.791 --> 00:24:28.791
<v Speaker 3>use the words hello and please and thank</v>
<v Speaker 3>you in their conversations.</v>

359
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.890
<v Speaker 3>That statute is untenable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

360
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:40.430
<v Speaker 3>Because it now requires people to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain words in their conversations,</v>

361
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.250
<v Speaker 3>even if those words are reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

362
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.370
<v Speaker 3>So that is not the question and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>not your case.</v>

363
00:24:47.371 --> 00:24:50.580
<v Speaker 3>You are making that using a pronoun was </v>
<v Speaker 3>unreasonable in itself,</v>

364
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.830
<v Speaker 3>though I have that correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

365
00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.050
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

366
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.110
<v Speaker 4>there's a couple of things I'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say about that.</v>

367
00:24:59.010 --> 00:24:59.843
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked up the process by which the </v>

368
00:25:02.431 --> 00:25:07.431
<v Speaker 4>Ontario government formulated it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>legislation with regards to the pronouns</v>

369
00:25:07.531 --> 00:25:08.364
<v Speaker 4>and the consultation process that used </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the consultation process was deeply </v>

370
00:25:12.421 --> 00:25:16.260
<v Speaker 4>flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They contacted activists and say,</v>

371
00:25:16.261 --> 00:25:19.260
<v Speaker 4>let's activists of the Trans Community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

372
00:25:19.261 --> 00:25:21.870
<v Speaker 4>well there's a couple of things I'd like</v>
<v Speaker 4>to say about that.</v>

373
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.510
<v Speaker 4>The first is there is no trans </v>
<v Speaker 4>community,</v>

374
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trans people are as diverse as any other</v>

375
00:25:28.051 --> 00:25:28.884
<v Speaker 4>group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to the idea that somehow because of </v>

376
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:35.100
<v Speaker 4>one of their attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they constitute a homogenous group is,</v>

377
00:25:35.101 --> 00:25:35.901
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

378
00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 4>you think that that would be a false </v>
<v Speaker 4>with dip,</v>

379
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:38.543
<v Speaker 4>the people who are concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 4>treating groups of people adequately </v>

380
00:25:43.051 --> 00:25:45.840
<v Speaker 4>would be loath to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to put forward.</v>

381
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.183
<v Speaker 4>But even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's absolutely no evidence </v>

382
00:25:48.811 --> 00:25:49.644
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever that the activist types are </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually representatives of any of the </v>

383
00:25:53.431 --> 00:25:56.970
<v Speaker 4>communities that they hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 4>activate on behalf of.</v>

384
00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're not elected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not appointed,</v>

385
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.370
<v Speaker 4>they don't pull,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do this.</v>

386
00:26:02.371 --> 00:26:03.360
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

387
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.673
<v Speaker 4>here's a group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a minority group and it's </v>

388
00:26:06.961 --> 00:26:10.230
<v Speaker 4>oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a member of that group and therefore</v>

389
00:26:10.231 --> 00:26:11.850
<v Speaker 4>I stand for the group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

390
00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:13.470
<v Speaker 4>actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>

391
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.760
<v Speaker 4>You don't stand for your group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You may be standing for yourself.</v>

392
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.183
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't stand for men and I don't have </v>

393
00:26:20.641 --> 00:26:22.170
<v Speaker 4>to stand for white men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

394
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm not entitled to speak on their </v>
<v Speaker 4>behalf.</v>

395
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:25.973
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea that it's the trans </v>
<v Speaker 4>community that wanted this sis I </v>

396
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.580
<v Speaker 4>completely unsustainable idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly unproven.</v>

397
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.200
<v Speaker 4>I've had like 40 letters from trans </v>
<v Speaker 4>people since I started to engage in this</v>

398
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.663
<v Speaker 4>call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It</v>

399
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.920
<v Speaker 4>is chaotic battle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only one of them was mildly critical</v>

400
00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Speaker 4>of what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the other ones,</v>

401
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.430
<v Speaker 4>there aren't that many trans people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

402
00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:52.860
<v Speaker 4>So to get 40 letters is actually quite a</v>
<v Speaker 4>few.</v>

403
00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific Paul,</v>

404
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.513
<v Speaker 4>but it's at least as scientific as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>process by which the Ontario government </v>

405
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.560
<v Speaker 4>generated it's legislation.</v>

406
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

407
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.553
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not generating legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what these people said to a person </v>

408
00:27:16.701 --> 00:27:17.534
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't ask to be the newest whipping </v>

409
00:27:21.021 --> 00:27:21.854
<v Speaker 4>boy for the radical postmodernists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All it's done is made my life more </v>

410
00:27:25.761 --> 00:27:27.110
<v Speaker 4>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

411
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.880
<v Speaker 4>that basic letter would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

412
00:27:28.881 --> 00:27:29.714
<v Speaker 4>I'm transitioning from one gender to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other and it's very difficult and I'm </v>

413
00:27:32.301 --> 00:27:34.040
<v Speaker 4>not sure that it's the right thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

414
00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.413
<v Speaker 4>And this has made the process </v>
<v Speaker 4>spectacularly more difficult on all </v>

415
00:27:40.881 --> 00:27:42.470
<v Speaker 4>fronts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

416
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.393
<v Speaker 4>and these people don't speak for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just because they say they do that </v>

417
00:27:46.911 --> 00:27:47.744
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the other thing that we seem to </v>

418
00:27:50.271 --> 00:27:53.930
<v Speaker 4>have swallowed as a society is this </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy notion that,</v>

419
00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.390
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all that we should be portioned</v>

420
00:27:56.391 --> 00:28:00.230
<v Speaker 4>up into our different minority groups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is a return to tribalism,</v>

421
00:28:00.231 --> 00:28:01.064
<v Speaker 4>an unbelievably dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't really think of anything more </v>

422
00:28:03.351 --> 00:28:04.340
<v Speaker 4>dangerous than that.</v>

423
00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:05.773
<v Speaker 4>And then we've swallowed the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you identify yourself as a member of </v>

424
00:28:09.531 --> 00:28:12.320
<v Speaker 4>a minority group and then you bring </v>
<v Speaker 4>forward a grievance,</v>

425
00:28:12.321 --> 00:28:15.710
<v Speaker 4>you have to be treated as if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>valid representative of that group.</v>

426
00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.860
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

427
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.210
<v Speaker 4>why in the world would we do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's guilt,</v>

428
00:28:20.211 --> 00:28:21.044
<v Speaker 4>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's part of it or I think it's </v>

429
00:28:24.081 --> 00:28:26.510
<v Speaker 4>mostly guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to stand up and say,</v>

430
00:28:26.511 --> 00:28:27.344
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know who died and made you king so </v>

431
00:28:29.331 --> 00:28:30.870
<v Speaker 4>to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

432
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.120
<v Speaker 4>Can we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can we stay on that logic for a moment?</v>

433
00:28:35.121 --> 00:28:36.440
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea.</v>

434
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:37.303
<v Speaker 4>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this compelled speech material seems to </v>

435
00:28:41.461 --> 00:28:46.461
<v Speaker 4>insist upon treating people not as </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals,</v>

436
00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:47.814
<v Speaker 4>but as members of groups to either blame</v>
<v Speaker 4>them or to favor them as a member of a </v>

437
00:28:52.861 --> 00:28:55.590
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we take that logic and extend it.</v>

438
00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:56.483
<v Speaker 4>You know that the group identity thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes intersectionality where you're </v>

439
00:29:00.361 --> 00:29:01.194
<v Speaker 4>not just blogging to one group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're also have these </v>

440
00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.980
<v Speaker 4>characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spin that out for us.</v>

441
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.790
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

442
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.550
<v Speaker 4>What is the logic of that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where does it lead us to?</v>

443
00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.571
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

444
00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:14.350
<v Speaker 4>so the first thing I would say to </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone in the room is,</v>

445
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.273
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is why I decided to do with </v>

446
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.350
<v Speaker 4>what I did right from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

447
00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.240
<v Speaker 4>is that I don't want to play the group </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity game.</v>

448
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.733
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to construe the world in </v>
<v Speaker 4>those terms and I'm not going to use </v>

449
00:29:29.741 --> 00:29:33.340
<v Speaker 4>terminology that would require me to </v>
<v Speaker 4>formulate my thoughts manner.</v>

450
00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.383
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a terrible catastrophe to </v>
<v Speaker 4>divide us all up into our tribal </v>

451
00:29:37.361 --> 00:29:40.180
<v Speaker 4>entities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see anything positive about that</v>

452
00:29:40.181 --> 00:29:44.020
<v Speaker 4>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I just don't want to go there.</v>

453
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.640
<v Speaker 4>And then second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

454
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:46.503
<v Speaker 4>and maybe this is even more relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you may or may not have heard about </v>

455
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:50.884
<v Speaker 4>intersectionality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Intersectionality is a new development </v>

456
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:56.140
<v Speaker 4>on the radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's actually,</v>

457
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.000
<v Speaker 4>if I wasn't so in tandem to Quan </v>
<v Speaker 4>seriousness in these matters,</v>

458
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.360
<v Speaker 4>I would be constantly laughing about </v>
<v Speaker 4>intersectionality.</v>

459
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.493
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is that it's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>radical left has discovered its own </v>

460
00:30:08.381 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Speaker 4>Achilles heel.</v>

461
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:10.893
<v Speaker 4>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the problem with dividing us up </v>

462
00:30:12.491 --> 00:30:15.910
<v Speaker 4>into groups?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's many.</v>

463
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:16.953
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the descent into tribalism is not </v>

464
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 4>least among them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the next is that,</v>

465
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:21.843
<v Speaker 4>well it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it turns out that we don't fit into one </v>

466
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:25.480
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any of us,</v>

467
00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:29.170
<v Speaker 4>we fit into multiple groups and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>obvious at all.</v>

468
00:30:29.171 --> 00:30:32.560
<v Speaker 4>Which of those groups should take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be of paramount importance.</v>

469
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:33.723
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a ratio group and an ethnic </v>

470
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.733
<v Speaker 4>ethnic group and there's groups of </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence and there's groups of </v>

471
00:30:37.691 --> 00:30:39.550
<v Speaker 4>temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new scripts of attractiveness,</v>

472
00:30:39.551 --> 00:30:43.210
<v Speaker 4>and there's groups of wealth and you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>multiply them really indefinitely.</v>

473
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:44.223
<v Speaker 4>And I do mean indefinitely because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can categorize a finite number of </v>

474
00:30:47.351 --> 00:30:49.750
<v Speaker 4>entities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a virtually infinite number of ways.</v>

475
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.240
<v Speaker 4>And so the intersection lists discovered</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

476
00:30:52.241 --> 00:30:52.781
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

477
00:30:52.781 --> 00:30:54.010
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

478
00:30:54.011 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 4>let's say there's Latinos and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's Asians.</v>

479
00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:57.963
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

480
00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:58.960
<v Speaker 4>well wait a minute.</v>

481
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.470
<v Speaker 4>There's male and female Latinos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's male and female Asians,</v>

482
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:07.390
<v Speaker 4>so so do we treat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the division into two enough or do we</v>

483
00:31:07.391 --> 00:31:09.520
<v Speaker 4>need a division into for a while?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

484
00:31:09.521 --> 00:31:13.390
<v Speaker 4>well then there's socioeconomic class of</v>
<v Speaker 4>male and female,</v>

485
00:31:13.391 --> 00:31:14.224
<v Speaker 4>Asians and male and female Latinos and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can keep fractionating the </v>

486
00:31:18.671 --> 00:31:20.920
<v Speaker 4>groups and and technically without,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

487
00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:23.260
<v Speaker 4>and you actually see this happening in </v>
<v Speaker 4>real time,</v>

488
00:31:23.261 --> 00:31:25.480
<v Speaker 4>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the,</v>

489
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:31.050
<v Speaker 4>as the acronym for the LGBT activists </v>
<v Speaker 4>continues to expand really without end.</v>

490
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.620
<v Speaker 4>And see what's at the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>intersectionality.</v>

491
00:31:35.621 --> 00:31:36.880
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suspect,</v>

492
00:31:36.881 --> 00:31:40.210
<v Speaker 4>will be discovered eventually by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>radical leftists if they get that far,</v>

493
00:31:40.211 --> 00:31:43.840
<v Speaker 4>is that you have to fractionate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>groups right down to the individual.</v>

494
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.880
<v Speaker 4>And that's what Western culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussed in articulated,</v>

495
00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.740
<v Speaker 4>discovered in articulated over the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>5,000 years.</v>

496
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:51.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

497
00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:54.490
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The group isn't the paramount division.</v>

498
00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:58.120
<v Speaker 4>It's the individual because unless you </v>
<v Speaker 4>treat each person like an individual,</v>

499
00:31:58.121 --> 00:32:01.120
<v Speaker 4>you're not taking all the intersections </v>
<v Speaker 4>into account.</v>

500
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.840
<v Speaker 4>And so it's extraordinarily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's extraordinarily comedic,</v>

501
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:10.530
<v Speaker 4>but it also isn't as if it's treating </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone as they're an individual,</v>

502
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:12.244
<v Speaker 4>as if they're an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is an instant solution that will bring </v>

503
00:32:14.471 --> 00:32:16.360
<v Speaker 4>us to utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

504
00:32:16.361 --> 00:32:17.194
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like Winston Churchill said that </v>

505
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:19.420
<v Speaker 4>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

506
00:32:19.421 --> 00:32:20.254
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's essentially the least terrible </v>

507
00:32:22.391 --> 00:32:23.224
<v Speaker 4>approach we have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Life isn't the sort of problem that </v>

508
00:32:26.021 --> 00:32:29.110
<v Speaker 4>is amenable to an instantaneous utopian </v>
<v Speaker 4>solution.</v>

509
00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:29.944
<v Speaker 4>But our best bet is to meet each other </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the desire for peace and </v>

510
00:32:34.541 --> 00:32:35.374
<v Speaker 4>productivity on this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the stage that enables individual </v>

511
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 4>interaction because then we meet soul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the soul,</v>

512
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:42.584
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we also meet in a domain that we </v>

513
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:48.350
<v Speaker 4>bear responsibility for as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's also extremely important,</v>

514
00:32:48.351 --> 00:32:49.184
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should be responsible for what you </v>

515
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:50.900
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>

516
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.540
<v Speaker 4>You should have to suffer the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of what you say,</v>

517
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:54.583
<v Speaker 4>not least so that you learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the individual is paramount as </v>

518
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:01.970
<v Speaker 4>far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the fundamental principle</v>

519
00:33:01.971 --> 00:33:02.804
<v Speaker 4>of Western civilization know it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>only the west that has come across that </v>

520
00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:07.364
<v Speaker 4>discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think we've done the best job so </v>

521
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:09.674
<v Speaker 4>far of articulating it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we don't want to lose that </v>

522
00:33:12.621 --> 00:33:16.100
<v Speaker 4>because the alternative isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 4>multicultural utopia.</v>

523
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.570
<v Speaker 4>The alternative is a descent into tribal</v>
<v Speaker 4>barbarism and,</v>

524
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 4>and there are people who would be just </v>
<v Speaker 4>as happy if that happened.</v>

525
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:28.020
<v Speaker 4>But I would suggest that it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>destiny that in a weak person would,</v>

526
00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.600
<v Speaker 5>would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would long for.</v>

527
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you feel like taking a few questions,</v>

528
00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.460
<v Speaker 5>do you feel like taking some questions </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the students?</v>

529
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.540
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

530
00:33:39.541 --> 00:33:40.374
<v Speaker 5>so we're going to have questions and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd like you to participate in this </v>

531
00:33:42.871 --> 00:33:47.871
<v Speaker 5>conversation now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Please do ask a question.</v>

532
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.490
<v Speaker 5>We welcome you up to say what you'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>

533
00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:58.610
<v Speaker 5>If there is a preamble to the question </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fairly shorts then so be it.</v>

534
00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.383
<v Speaker 5>But please do ask a question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not actually anybody speeches and </v>

535
00:34:03.421 --> 00:34:05.880
<v Speaker 5>we do primarily want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Jordan has to say.</v>

536
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.630
<v Speaker 5>So feel free to line up at the two </v>
<v Speaker 5>microphones.</v>

537
00:34:09.631 --> 00:34:12.540
<v Speaker 5>We'll take one at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go ahead sir.</v>

538
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:14.910
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so first of all,</v>

539
00:34:14.911 --> 00:34:16.890
<v Speaker 6>thank you so much for being here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really enjoyed it.</v>

540
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:17.783
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

541
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:23.050
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

542
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.020
<v Speaker 6>and a second,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

543
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.870
<v Speaker 6>this ties into my question I had just </v>
<v Speaker 6>last week.</v>

544
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:35.250
<v Speaker 6>My free speech coalition at Bishop's </v>
<v Speaker 6>University was officially ratified and I</v>

545
00:34:35.251 --> 00:34:38.580
<v Speaker 6>would love to invite you to be our first</v>
<v Speaker 6>guest speaker if that's at all possible.</v>

546
00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:40.323
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

547
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.613
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

548
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:44.540
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and my,</v>

549
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.790
<v Speaker 6>my question pertains to this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

550
00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:47.643
<v Speaker 6>for Dr. Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would you consider the most under </v>

551
00:34:49.971 --> 00:34:50.804
<v Speaker 6>discussed or overlooked ideas and topics</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you think should be discussed in </v>

552
00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:57.494
<v Speaker 6>the club?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I know we're looking for </v>

553
00:34:58.161 --> 00:34:58.994
<v Speaker 6>controversial ideas that we think are </v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe not as discussed as much as they </v>

554
00:35:01.941 --> 00:35:02.774
<v Speaker 6>should be.</v>

555
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:08.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a difficult question.</v>

556
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:09.503
<v Speaker 4>I would say that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't obvious to me that on </v>

557
00:35:14.881 --> 00:35:18.960
<v Speaker 4>university campuses at the present time </v>
<v Speaker 4>or in the education system in general,</v>

558
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:20.543
<v Speaker 4>we've done a good job of taking stock of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the advantages and disadvantages of our </v>

559
00:35:24.061 --> 00:35:24.894
<v Speaker 4>current sociopolitical systems now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think there's enough data so that </v>

560
00:35:29.491 --> 00:35:31.740
<v Speaker 4>we could start having intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

561
00:35:31.741 --> 00:35:32.574
<v Speaker 4>So one thing I would recommend to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>all if you're interested is a book I </v>

562
00:35:36.211 --> 00:35:39.810
<v Speaker 4>just finished reading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called the great leveler,</v>

563
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.213
<v Speaker 4>the great leveler by Walter Shy Dale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a discussion of inequality and </v>

564
00:35:46.381 --> 00:35:48.180
<v Speaker 4>it's a very intelligent book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one of,</v>

565
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.360
<v Speaker 4>so inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you may or may not know,</v>

566
00:35:51.361 --> 00:35:54.360
<v Speaker 4>is rife throughout human societies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

567
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:57.930
<v Speaker 4>And that's the case in the present day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's been the case historically,</v>

568
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.230
<v Speaker 4>but it's also the case in animal </v>
<v Speaker 4>societies by every measure.</v>

569
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:04.350
<v Speaker 4>So inequality is the rule of life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

570
00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.410
<v Speaker 4>And that doesn't mean it's not an </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethical catastrophe.</v>

571
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.393
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying that the fact of </v>

572
00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:15.930
<v Speaker 4>inequality cannot be laid at the feet of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the west or of capitalism or,</v>

573
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.450
<v Speaker 4>or really have any human construction </v>
<v Speaker 4>for that matter.</v>

574
00:36:18.451 --> 00:36:22.980
<v Speaker 4>One of the things Shydel did was to </v>
<v Speaker 4>investigate empirically the relationship</v>

575
00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:26.220
<v Speaker 4>between inequality and the pole of </v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

576
00:36:26.221 --> 00:36:27.054
<v Speaker 4>So because let's say if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you surveyed a very large number of </v>

577
00:36:30.931 --> 00:36:34.980
<v Speaker 4>states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could determine whether this,</v>

578
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.870
<v Speaker 4>the governments were left wing or right </v>
<v Speaker 4>wing,</v>

579
00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:41.220
<v Speaker 4>and then you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could do a compilation of inequality</v>

580
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.180
<v Speaker 4>coefficients and you could find out if </v>
<v Speaker 4>left wing governments had any,</v>

581
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 4>any ability to ameliorate inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just as an empirical question.</v>

582
00:36:49.651 --> 00:36:52.080
<v Speaker 4>And the answer that Shydel generated was</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

583
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.273
<v Speaker 4>there's no difference whatsoever in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>inequality coefficiency left and right </v>

584
00:36:55.861 --> 00:36:56.694
<v Speaker 4>wing states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what that points to is a much more </v>

585
00:36:58.591 --> 00:36:59.850
<v Speaker 4>fundamental problem.</v>

586
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.863
<v Speaker 4>And shydel in his book also points out </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the only known historical forces </v>

587
00:37:04.561 --> 00:37:05.394
<v Speaker 4>that limit inequality or that produce </v>
<v Speaker 4>equality are war revolution and </v>

588
00:37:09.271 --> 00:37:12.900
<v Speaker 4>pestilence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's doesn't look like it's easily under</v>

589
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.460
<v Speaker 4>under human control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

590
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Marxists talked about inequality and</v>

591
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.233
<v Speaker 4>the fact that capital tends to </v>
<v Speaker 4>accumulate in the hands of fewer and </v>

592
00:37:20.341 --> 00:37:21.174
<v Speaker 4>fewer people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is sort of true except that the </v>

593
00:37:23.131 --> 00:37:26.070
<v Speaker 4>people at the top tend to rotate lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>more quickly than that.</v>

594
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.830
<v Speaker 4>Then the communists and the Marxists </v>
<v Speaker 4>separate presumed,</v>

595
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.370
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't look like that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of capitalism.</v>

596
00:37:32.371 --> 00:37:36.000
<v Speaker 4>It looks like it's a much deeper process</v>
<v Speaker 4>and capitalism at least,</v>

597
00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:36.834
<v Speaker 4>well it's shoveling money and resources </v>
<v Speaker 4>up to the top also does lift the bottom </v>

598
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.930
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very quickly.</v>

599
00:37:42.931 --> 00:37:43.764
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is something we need to have a </v>

600
00:37:44.851 --> 00:37:46.680
<v Speaker 4>serious discussion about it at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>university.</v>

601
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:49.380
<v Speaker 4>So like one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause we shouldn't be doing this,</v>

602
00:37:49.381 --> 00:37:51.090
<v Speaker 4>we should be partying in the streets.</v>

603
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.073
<v Speaker 4>And here's one reason why do you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the level of absolute poverty in </v>

604
00:37:55.351 --> 00:37:56.184
<v Speaker 4>the world fell by 50% between the year </v>
<v Speaker 4>2000 and the year 2012 do you know that </v>

605
00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:05.430
<v Speaker 4>was three years faster than the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>optimistic UN projection considered?</v>

606
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:09.240
<v Speaker 4>It was the fastest decline in absolute </v>
<v Speaker 4>poverty that the world has ever seen.</v>

607
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:11.970
<v Speaker 4>And like that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know about,</v>

608
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:13.043
<v Speaker 4>there's hundreds of thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that week right now that are being </v>

609
00:38:15.061 --> 00:38:15.894
<v Speaker 4>connected to the power grid and almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody has access to high speed </v>

610
00:38:18.901 --> 00:38:20.480
<v Speaker 4>computation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

611
00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:21.331
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

612
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:22.164
<v Speaker 4>the struggling economies in Africa have </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the last four years being the </v>

613
00:38:25.201 --> 00:38:26.034
<v Speaker 4>fastest growing economies in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>know there's almost no absolute </v>

614
00:38:29.191 --> 00:38:30.024
<v Speaker 4>privation left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There aren't people starving except for </v>

615
00:38:31.981 --> 00:38:32.814
<v Speaker 4>political reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're at a point where obesity is the </v>

616
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:38.290
<v Speaker 4>worst problem than starvation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

617
00:38:38.291 --> 00:38:39.124
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now I also think that a lot of that </v>

618
00:38:41.471 --> 00:38:42.304
<v Speaker 4>was purchased out the cost of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the dreams and hopes of the working </v>

619
00:38:45.701 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 4>class in the west.</v>

620
00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:47.643
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what we did some stamps for </v>

621
00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:49.444
<v Speaker 4>about a 30 year period with sacrificed </v>
<v Speaker 4>the aspirations of the Western working </v>

622
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:53.914
<v Speaker 4>class to alleviate poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get India and China and in Southeast </v>

623
00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:57.993
<v Speaker 4>Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it looks like that might've been a </v>

624
00:38:58.631 --> 00:39:01.120
<v Speaker 4>really good deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although it was a little bit hard on the</v>

625
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:03.760
<v Speaker 4>working class people and that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken into account,</v>

626
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.960
<v Speaker 4>but we're not having discussions of is </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort universities.</v>

627
00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:07.803
<v Speaker 4>It's like we're stuck in 1980 or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>in 1960 we haven't updated our bottles </v>

628
00:39:12.161 --> 00:39:12.994
<v Speaker 4>to take into account the new and often </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily positive realities and </v>

629
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.380
<v Speaker 4>we're tearing ourselves apart in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>west with this identity politics,</v>

630
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:23.410
<v Speaker 4>idiocy at the same time that things are </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting better and better,</v>

631
00:39:23.411 --> 00:39:27.790
<v Speaker 4>faster and faster than they ever have by</v>
<v Speaker 4>a huge margin in the history of mankind.</v>

632
00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.193
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's time to wake up and throw off the </v>

633
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.033
<v Speaker 4>impression of the Cold War and to look </v>
<v Speaker 4>around and see what's what's available </v>

634
00:39:37.991 --> 00:39:42.640
<v Speaker 4>in front of us and what we could upon </v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be much better than Oh yes.</v>

635
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

636
00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.750
<v Speaker 4>told that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

637
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:57.320
<v Speaker 4>there are developments outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry for the noise.</v>

638
00:39:57.321 --> 00:39:58.220
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>

639
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.050
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll they're doing the best they can.</v>

640
00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes ma'am.</v>

641
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.690
<v Speaker 1>So was there a fetus and you've said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Eric had was,</v>

642
00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.700
<v Speaker 1>or one of your most priorities is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of truth.</v>

643
00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:10.993
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you just clarify what you mean </v>

644
00:40:13.451 --> 00:40:16.850
<v Speaker 1>when you're presented with a situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you have to worry,</v>

645
00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:21.580
<v Speaker 1>you're being asked to refer to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>to their preferred pronouns and is it,</v>

646
00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:25.030
<v Speaker 1>is it a true thing you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it their truth is your truth</v>

647
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.300
<v Speaker 1>be the issue</v>

648
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.430
<v Speaker 4>requested the individual to be addressed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a certain matter?</v>

649
00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:34.913
<v Speaker 4>It's the compulsion of that by law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at least issues get conflated </v>

650
00:40:39.961 --> 00:40:41.430
<v Speaker 4>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

651
00:40:41.431 --> 00:40:43.350
<v Speaker 4>I've dealt with all sorts of people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>my life,</v>

652
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.633
<v Speaker 4>a much broader range of people than most</v>
<v Speaker 4>people ever encounter in the course of </v>

653
00:40:47.761 --> 00:40:48.594
<v Speaker 4>their entire lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm perfectly capable of deciding </v>

654
00:40:51.691 --> 00:40:54.030
<v Speaker 4>how to treat someone on a one to one </v>
<v Speaker 4>basis.</v>

655
00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.313
<v Speaker 4>But when the demand for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for terminology becomes part of the </v>

656
00:40:58.021 --> 00:41:00.750
<v Speaker 4>legal system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what the rationale is,</v>

657
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.120
<v Speaker 4>it's not happening as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>

658
00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:05.010
<v Speaker 4>And people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

659
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.080
<v Speaker 4>we're pushing it forward because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>compassion.</v>

660
00:41:07.081 --> 00:41:09.960
<v Speaker 4>And maybe you could start just being </v>
<v Speaker 4>such a mean professor.</v>

661
00:41:09.961 --> 00:41:11.880
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why should I believe that?</v>

662
00:41:11.881 --> 00:41:15.300
<v Speaker 4>You know what the hell you're doing with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your compelling laws.</v>

663
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.050
<v Speaker 4>You're willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're willing to move past illegal wine</v>

664
00:41:19.051 --> 00:41:22.140
<v Speaker 4>in the sand that's been drawn for let's </v>
<v Speaker 4>say 700 years.</v>

665
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.063
<v Speaker 4>You do not write compelled speech into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the legislation all but we're doing it </v>

666
00:41:26.221 --> 00:41:28.320
<v Speaker 4>with the best of intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

667
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.490
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>

668
00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.560
<v Speaker 4>So these issues have to be separate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

669
00:41:33.561 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 4>if this was</v>

670
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.903
<v Speaker 5>about transgender rights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would have disappeared in September </v>

671
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:42.890
<v Speaker 5>of 2016 it's not about transgender </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights and everyone knows it.</v>

672
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:46.220
<v Speaker 5>So this is not about transgender rights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What these,</v>

673
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.173
<v Speaker 5>what these people are doing outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about something far deeper than </v>

674
00:41:49.941 --> 00:41:53.210
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But can we ask the question this way?</v>

675
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.113
<v Speaker 5>Can we say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't it doesn't everybody have the </v>

676
00:41:57.261 --> 00:41:58.094
<v Speaker 5>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the liberty to decide how to present </v>

677
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:05.360
<v Speaker 5>themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know how to be who they want to be,</v>

678
00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.710
<v Speaker 5>what to wear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>

679
00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.580
<v Speaker 5>what gender to call themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer is yes.</v>

680
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:16.030
<v Speaker 5>Everybody has the liberty to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What everybody else has liberty too.</v>

681
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.213
<v Speaker 5>And the liberty to do that doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 5>they have the right to compel other </v>

682
00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:24.050
<v Speaker 5>people to agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

683
00:42:24.051 --> 00:42:24.884
<v Speaker 5>liberty is not the right to demand that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the world validate the choices that </v>

684
00:42:28.941 --> 00:42:30.710
<v Speaker 5>you've made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have your choices,</v>

685
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:31.723
<v Speaker 5>you have the freedom to make the choices</v>
<v Speaker 5>and everybody else has the freedom to </v>

686
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 5>make their choices too and to approve or</v>
<v Speaker 5>disapprove.</v>

687
00:42:37.371 --> 00:42:39.110
<v Speaker 5>But they call you this or like all your </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

688
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.033
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>liberty is a two way street and </v>

689
00:42:42.141 --> 00:42:44.510
<v Speaker 5>everybody has it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the fact that you've made choices,</v>

690
00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:45.603
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't mean everybody else doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have the same ability to make the same </v>

691
00:42:47.781 --> 00:42:48.614
<v Speaker 5>choices.</v>

692
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:56.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

693
00:42:58.930 --> 00:42:59.441
<v Speaker 2>Back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

694
00:42:59.441 --> 00:43:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please go ahead.</v>

695
00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was loud.</v>

696
00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.080
<v Speaker 2>I just want to thank you for being here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really big fan and um,</v>

697
00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I have a bad habit of making or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

698
00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:13.540
<v Speaker 2>getting in arguments with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical leftists and I'm the most common</v>

699
00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:14.403
<v Speaker 2>argument they present to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I generally is bills you 16 only covers </v>

700
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:19.383
<v Speaker 2>the Ontario human rights code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those are protected areas under the </v>

701
00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:23.621
<v Speaker 2>Ontario Human Rights Code,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

702
00:43:23.621 --> 00:43:24.580
<v Speaker 2>such as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

703
00:43:24.581 --> 00:43:25.780
<v Speaker 2>universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

704
00:43:25.781 --> 00:43:27.190
<v Speaker 2>elementary schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

705
00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:31.240
<v Speaker 2>I was just wondering how you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat this argument?</v>

706
00:43:31.241 --> 00:43:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Seeing is their argument is generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

707
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:38.380
<v Speaker 2>they're only dealing with vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups such as young students and um,</v>

708
00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.370
<v Speaker 2>he's still good about</v>

709
00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.630
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>

710
00:43:41.631 --> 00:43:43.670
<v Speaker 4>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's restricted in scope.</v>

711
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not restricted enough.</v>

712
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:47.050
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

713
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.300
<v Speaker 5>here's a couple of facts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

714
00:43:50.301 --> 00:43:51.134
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

715
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:54.450
<v Speaker 4>when I first made my video is about bill</v>
<v Speaker 4>sees 16,</v>

716
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.553
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I suggested was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the act of making the video itself </v>

717
00:43:59.251 --> 00:44:02.250
<v Speaker 4>could well have been illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course,</v>

718
00:44:02.251 --> 00:44:06.810
<v Speaker 4>people immediately accused me of fear </v>
<v Speaker 4>mongering done perhaps with reasons.</v>

719
00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:07.763
<v Speaker 4>It's not always easy to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 4>full intent of the new piece of </v>

720
00:44:10.711 --> 00:44:14.010
<v Speaker 4>legislation surrounding policies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I can tell you one thing.</v>

721
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.690
<v Speaker 4>When the lawyers at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Toronto read through the new legislation</v>

722
00:44:18.691 --> 00:44:19.524
<v Speaker 4>and the surrounding policies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they also decided that what I was doing </v>

723
00:44:21.961 --> 00:44:25.950
<v Speaker 4>might've been transgressing the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why they wrote me two letters</v>

724
00:44:25.951 --> 00:44:27.260
<v Speaker 4>telling me to stop.</v>

725
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:30.600
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's fact number one.</v>

726
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fact</v>

727
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.810
<v Speaker 7>number two two words.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Lindsay Shepherd.</v>

728
00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:46.323
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

729
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.473
<v Speaker 7>let's say for the argument that I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 7>paranoid megalomaniac and that I'm a </v>

730
00:44:51.901 --> 00:44:52.734
<v Speaker 7>bigot and all of the other things that </v>
<v Speaker 7>people have decided that I might be </v>

731
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:56.401
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

732
00:44:56.401 --> 00:45:00.090
<v Speaker 7>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in my paranoid Megalomania,</v>

733
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:04.080
<v Speaker 7>I never envisioned a situation where a </v>
<v Speaker 7>teaching assistant,</v>

734
00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:04.914
<v Speaker 7>a 22 year old teaching assistant at a </v>
<v Speaker 7>major Canadian university would be hold </v>

735
00:45:08.641 --> 00:45:09.474
<v Speaker 7>in front of a quasi myo is inquisition </v>
<v Speaker 7>and have to record it because she dared </v>

736
00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:15.444
<v Speaker 7>to show five minutes of a video from a </v>
<v Speaker 7>mainstream news program run by public </v>

737
00:45:21.061 --> 00:45:23.670
<v Speaker 7>television funded by the government of </v>
<v Speaker 7>Ontario.</v>

738
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.330
<v Speaker 7>So paranoid as I was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>

739
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.450
<v Speaker 7>it isn't obvious that I was paranoid </v>
<v Speaker 7>enough.</v>

740
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.100
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I don't see that.</v>

741
00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:37.710
<v Speaker 7>I don't see how either of those examples</v>
<v Speaker 7>can be disputed.</v>

742
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:40.050
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't like the University of Toronto</v>

743
00:45:40.051 --> 00:45:42.420
<v Speaker 7>wrote me two letters without thinking </v>
<v Speaker 7>about it.</v>

744
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:46.830
<v Speaker 7>They went and consulted their high </v>
<v Speaker 7>powered lawyers and the lawyers reviewed</v>

745
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:48.870
<v Speaker 7>the policies and the legislation and </v>
<v Speaker 7>they thought,</v>

746
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.070
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dr. Peterson,</v>

747
00:45:50.071 --> 00:45:52.260
<v Speaker 7>he might be contravening that </v>
<v Speaker 7>legislation.</v>

748
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.333
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was a weird paradoxical gift to me </v>

749
00:45:55.531 --> 00:45:56.364
<v Speaker 7>that they sent out those two letters </v>
<v Speaker 7>telling me to stop because it was </v>

750
00:45:58.591 --> 00:46:01.590
<v Speaker 7>instant proof that what I was doing was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

751
00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:05.130
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't say right because God only </v>
<v Speaker 7>knows about that.</v>

752
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.233
<v Speaker 7>But at least it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my interpretation of the bill and its </v>

753
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:09.594
<v Speaker 7>intent was correct.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So can we just make this observation </v>

754
00:46:13.591 --> 00:46:14.460
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

755
00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:19.230
<v Speaker 7>that response to Jordan's critique of </v>
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] 16,</v>

756
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.860
<v Speaker 8>the one that went,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh he's overreacting.</v>

757
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:27.250
<v Speaker 8>Nobody's going to be punished or sent to</v>
<v Speaker 8>jail for this is silly in this stance.</v>

758
00:46:27.471 --> 00:46:31.370
<v Speaker 8>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 8>every single legal rule there is,</v>

759
00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:37.020
<v Speaker 8>is a legal rule only because it is </v>
<v Speaker 8>backed with the mom,</v>

760
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:40.190
<v Speaker 8>monopolistic violence of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're re</v>

761
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:45.530
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

762
00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.260
<v Speaker 8>There's no such thing as a rural without</v>
<v Speaker 8>punishment.</v>

763
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:52.880
<v Speaker 8>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if for example,</v>

764
00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:56.990
<v Speaker 8>there's a no parking sign,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what the practice science says,</v>

765
00:46:56.991 --> 00:46:59.360
<v Speaker 8>oh by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>please don't park here.</v>

766
00:46:59.361 --> 00:47:00.194
<v Speaker 8>But there are no tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well people are going to park cause </v>

767
00:47:03.081 --> 00:47:03.914
<v Speaker 8>that's not really a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So if you have a rule in the human </v>

768
00:47:06.651 --> 00:47:08.630
<v Speaker 8>rights code,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and if you breach it,</v>

769
00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:13.310
<v Speaker 8>if that's discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well then true that the first thing that</v>

770
00:47:13.311 --> 00:47:15.440
<v Speaker 8>happens to you is not going to be thrown</v>
<v Speaker 8>in jail.</v>

771
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:19.010
<v Speaker 8>But there's a process,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a series of steps,</v>

772
00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.400
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>The first one might be a mediation or an</v>

773
00:47:22.401 --> 00:47:24.290
<v Speaker 8>investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and then there might be a fine.</v>

774
00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:25.663
<v Speaker 8>And then if you don't pay the fine,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then your wages might be garnished or </v>

775
00:47:28.281 --> 00:47:30.820
<v Speaker 8>you might be ordered to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But believe me,</v>

776
00:47:30.821 --> 00:47:33.970
<v Speaker 8>if you refuse and refuse and refuse and </v>
<v Speaker 8>refuse,</v>

777
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.193
<v Speaker 8>that order will become a court order.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then if you don't obey the court </v>

778
00:47:38.621 --> 00:47:40.570
<v Speaker 8>order,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you'll be in contempt of court.</v>

779
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.690
<v Speaker 8>And then that will lead to arrest and a </v>
<v Speaker 8>presentment.</v>

780
00:47:43.691 --> 00:47:46.480
<v Speaker 8>So every single rule in the human rights</v>
<v Speaker 8>code</v>

781
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:53.160
<v Speaker 8>is effectively enforced with the most </v>
<v Speaker 8>severe violence the state has,</v>

782
00:47:53.741 --> 00:47:54.574
<v Speaker 8>even though it's not actually practiced </v>
<v Speaker 8>most of the time because most people </v>

783
00:47:58.091 --> 00:47:58.924
<v Speaker 8>obey</v>

784
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.240
<v Speaker 9>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we also don't want to underestimate,</v>

785
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:03.623
<v Speaker 9>I don't know how many of you have had </v>
<v Speaker 9>the pleasure of being dragged before a </v>

786
00:48:06.441 --> 00:48:07.274
<v Speaker 9>board that investigates your behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I would tell you that even if you </v>

787
00:48:10.911 --> 00:48:11.744
<v Speaker 9>don't end up paying a fine or in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's nothing particularly pleasant </v>

788
00:48:14.811 --> 00:48:17.390
<v Speaker 9>about the process itself.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's enough.</v>

789
00:48:17.391 --> 00:48:19.820
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you wonder why people don't speak up and</v>

790
00:48:19.821 --> 00:48:20.654
<v Speaker 9>I can tell you one of the reasons that </v>
<v Speaker 9>they don't speak up is because merely </v>

791
00:48:22.851 --> 00:48:25.370
<v Speaker 9>being dragged in front of a board of </v>
<v Speaker 9>inquiry,</v>

792
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:30.590
<v Speaker 9>innocent or guilty is enough to pretty </v>
<v Speaker 9>much do you in for a whole year.</v>

793
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:31.773
<v Speaker 9>Like if you're a sensible person and </v>
<v Speaker 9>you're concerned with propriety and you </v>

794
00:48:35.601 --> 00:48:39.380
<v Speaker 9>want to maintain the stability of your </v>
<v Speaker 9>life and your reputation is important to</v>

795
00:48:39.381 --> 00:48:41.700
<v Speaker 9>you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>perhaps because of the stip,</v>

796
00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:46.040
<v Speaker 9>the stability of your family depends on </v>
<v Speaker 9>it to be investigated for such things as</v>

797
00:48:46.041 --> 00:48:47.810
<v Speaker 9>a punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 9>All of it's all,</v>

798
00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:48.733
<v Speaker 9>it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's no pleasant business and many of </v>

799
00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:51.494
<v Speaker 9>you will stuff I would,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I would equate being investigated by a </v>

800
00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:56.533
<v Speaker 9>non punitive port,</v>
<v Speaker 9>let's say with these punishments that </v>

801
00:48:59.121 --> 00:49:00.980
<v Speaker 9>Bruce described quite hard on the </v>
<v Speaker 9>distance.</v>

802
00:49:00.981 --> 00:49:01.814
<v Speaker 9>I would equate that to having a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a fairly serious disease in terms of </v>

803
00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:06.913
<v Speaker 9>its,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in terms of it's psychological and </v>

804
00:49:08.541 --> 00:49:12.630
<v Speaker 9>physical impact.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I would also say no,</v>

805
00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:17.680
<v Speaker 9>I won't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let's go with an express right place.</v>

806
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:18.523
<v Speaker 9>Thank you.</v>

807
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.650
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can vote</v>

808
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:25.450
<v Speaker 5>as embarrassing as what's happening out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there is for peace university.</v>

809
00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:26.920
<v Speaker 5>I think what it does want to hate your </v>
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>

810
00:49:26.921 --> 00:49:29.650
<v Speaker 5>how we're doing here is and how we can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those people are so thank you.</v>

811
00:49:29.651 --> 00:49:30.484
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

812
00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:38.980
<v Speaker 1>in terms of my question,</v>

813
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:41.600
<v Speaker 5>most of your belief that it's extremely </v>
<v Speaker 5>important.</v>

814
00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.880
<v Speaker 5>Everything that we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

815
00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.650
<v Speaker 5>to speak our mind speaking really that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>why we're here.</v>

816
00:49:45.651 --> 00:49:47.810
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in terms of practicality,</v>

817
00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:51.060
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of things that get in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way of her license students.</v>

818
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.650
<v Speaker 5>We have our</v>
<v Speaker 5>prospective.</v>

819
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:54.680
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

820
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:55.543
<v Speaker 5>in terms of practicality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are kind of maybe your tips and </v>

821
00:49:58.071 --> 00:50:01.550
<v Speaker 5>your perspective on the steps that </v>
<v Speaker 5>students can take to kind of speak their</v>

822
00:50:01.551 --> 00:50:05.980
<v Speaker 5>mind while not sacrificing your future </v>
<v Speaker 5>prospects?</v>

823
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:07.303
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I can tell you a couple of things that </v>

824
00:50:08.661 --> 00:50:09.494
<v Speaker 9>are very practical.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Don't write in your essay is what you </v>

825
00:50:12.741 --> 00:50:13.574
<v Speaker 9>think the professor wants to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's absolutely no excuse whatsoever </v>

826
00:50:18.741 --> 00:50:20.150
<v Speaker 9>for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now,</v>

827
00:50:20.151 --> 00:50:22.340
<v Speaker 9>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 9>most professors,</v>

828
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:27.020
<v Speaker 9>even those who have descended into a </v>
<v Speaker 9>state of ideological possession,</v>

829
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 9>say most</v>

830
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:29.083
<v Speaker 7>of them still have enough character to </v>
<v Speaker 7>braid and essay that's well written </v>

831
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:36.050
<v Speaker 7>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you're actually taking less of a risk</v>

832
00:50:36.051 --> 00:50:38.720
<v Speaker 7>than you would think by stating what you</v>
<v Speaker 7>have to stay.</v>

833
00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.980
<v Speaker 7>But if you start practicing when you </v>
<v Speaker 7>were in university glue mistakes,</v>

834
00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 7>you're rather low pandering to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>audience,</v>

835
00:50:46.521 --> 00:50:50.000
<v Speaker 7>let's say and say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what do you think will get you buy?</v>

836
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:52.400
<v Speaker 7>You're going to train yourself to do </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

837
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:53.383
<v Speaker 7>And what that means is you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>train yourself in the false </v>

838
00:50:55.191 --> 00:50:56.024
<v Speaker 7>certification of your character and your</v>
<v Speaker 7>character is the only thing you have to </v>

839
00:50:59.241 --> 00:51:02.090
<v Speaker 7>guide you through life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No people dream of riches.</v>

840
00:51:02.091 --> 00:51:03.770
<v Speaker 7>And they dream of luxury and all of </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

841
00:51:03.771 --> 00:51:07.820
<v Speaker 7>But that's a thin defense against the </v>
<v Speaker 7>harsh realities of world.</v>

842
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:08.683
<v Speaker 7>You have your character.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so what you do when you go to </v>

843
00:51:10.731 --> 00:51:11.564
<v Speaker 7>university is you learn to see what you </v>
<v Speaker 7>think is clearly as you can and to take </v>

844
00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:16.970
<v Speaker 7>the slings and arrows that come along </v>
<v Speaker 7>with that.</v>

845
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 7>Not In an arrogant manner,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

846
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:20.120
<v Speaker 7>Because like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the hell do you know?</v>

847
00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:22.190
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you've got plenty to learn,</v>

848
00:51:22.191 --> 00:51:23.960
<v Speaker 7>but you want to formulate your thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 7>carefully.</v>

849
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:26.120
<v Speaker 7>You want to write what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

850
00:51:26.121 --> 00:51:28.250
<v Speaker 7>why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because when you're writing,</v>

851
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.173
<v Speaker 7>you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're laying out the arguments that </v>

852
00:51:32.241 --> 00:51:33.074
<v Speaker 7>you're going to use to structure your </v>
<v Speaker 7>existence in the world throughout your </v>

853
00:51:36.441 --> 00:51:39.370
<v Speaker 7>entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if you start to twist and bend those</v>

854
00:51:39.371 --> 00:51:42.650
<v Speaker 7>for expedient reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to warp your soul.</v>

855
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:43.933
<v Speaker 7>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could talk about that </v>

856
00:51:44.511 --> 00:51:46.820
<v Speaker 7>neurophysiologically if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

857
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:51.890
<v Speaker 7>you become what you practice,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you automate what you practice.</v>

858
00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:56.750
<v Speaker 7>So if you automate expedient speech for </v>
<v Speaker 7>the sake of short term gain,</v>

859
00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.370
<v Speaker 7>then that's what you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>produce.</v>

860
00:51:58.371 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 7>You're going to produce expedient speech</v>
<v Speaker 7>for short term gain.</v>

861
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:02.870
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>God help you if you do that,</v>

862
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:04.023
<v Speaker 7>like there is nothing that you will </v>
<v Speaker 7>possibly do in your entire life that </v>

863
00:52:08.991 --> 00:52:13.760
<v Speaker 7>will serve you better than to get </v>
<v Speaker 7>control of your voice in university.</v>

864
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:16.100
<v Speaker 7>I remember seeing you do that by </v>
<v Speaker 7>reading,</v>

865
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.230
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You read great people.</v>

866
00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:19.183
<v Speaker 7>You do that by writing what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You stay true to yourself while you </v>

867
00:52:22.281 --> 00:52:23.114
<v Speaker 7>write what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you take the risks and you gain the </v>

868
00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:25.574
<v Speaker 7>benefits that go along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You learn to stand up and speak and to </v>

869
00:52:28.611 --> 00:52:29.444
<v Speaker 7>listen carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that makes you a negotiator of </v>

870
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:32.953
<v Speaker 7>unparalleled power.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if you're a negotiator of </v>

871
00:52:35.061 --> 00:52:35.894
<v Speaker 7>unparalleled power,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's nothing in the world that won't </v>

872
00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:38.654
<v Speaker 7>open itself up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's what you're doing in </v>

873
00:52:41.031 --> 00:52:43.520
<v Speaker 7>university.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if you find professors who,</v>

874
00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:47.510
<v Speaker 7>who reject that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and there's fewer of them than you might</v>

875
00:52:47.511 --> 00:52:48.344
<v Speaker 7>think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then it's your sacred obligation to </v>

876
00:52:51.891 --> 00:52:52.724
<v Speaker 7>stand up for yourself against that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because it's going to happen to you </v>

877
00:52:55.611 --> 00:52:56.444
<v Speaker 7>throughout your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you might as well start practicing </v>

878
00:52:58.401 --> 00:53:02.600
<v Speaker 7>how to do it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's how it looks to me.</v>

879
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:03.950
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's an old saying that I,</v>

880
00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:05.000
<v Speaker 7>I right.</v>

881
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:10.690
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

882
00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.353
<v Speaker 7>I write in order to know what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you'll note how compelled speech </v>

883
00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.320
<v Speaker 7>interferes in that process.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

884
00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:23.423
<v Speaker 7>So the idea that you have to write what </v>
<v Speaker 7>your wants is the form of compelled </v>

885
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:28.340
<v Speaker 7>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like it.</v>

886
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:32.460
<v Speaker 7>I really do believe that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamental issue as a therapist,</v>

887
00:53:32.461 --> 00:53:36.240
<v Speaker 7>say when I'm trying to help someone set </v>
<v Speaker 7>their life straight,</v>

888
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:40.440
<v Speaker 7>I do my best not to compel their speech.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the reason for that is quite clear.</v>

889
00:53:40.441 --> 00:53:45.441
<v Speaker 7>It's like you have your destiny with all</v>
<v Speaker 7>its attended triumphs and sufferings and</v>

890
00:53:46.651 --> 00:53:50.430
<v Speaker 7>it's on your shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to tell you how to think.</v>

891
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:51.623
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to tell you how to think </v>
<v Speaker 7>because I do not know how you should </v>

892
00:53:54.031 --> 00:53:56.940
<v Speaker 7>think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to figure that out for yourself</v>

893
00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:59.760
<v Speaker 7>and then you have to bear the </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsibility for that.</v>

894
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:03.360
<v Speaker 7>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you were a terribly arrogant fool.</v>

895
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.193
<v Speaker 7>If you dare to tell someone else how it </v>
<v Speaker 7>is that they should conduct themselves </v>

896
00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:09.420
<v Speaker 7>through life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now.</v>

897
00:54:09.421 --> 00:54:11.310
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>having said that,</v>

898
00:54:11.311 --> 00:54:12.690
<v Speaker 7>while obviously I say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

899
00:54:12.691 --> 00:54:14.880
<v Speaker 7>you should tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or at least you shouldn't lie,</v>

900
00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:17.660
<v Speaker 7>but that's not a dictate of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>

901
00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:19.340
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of,</v>

902
00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:20.850
<v Speaker 7>of action,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so to speak.</v>

903
00:54:20.851 --> 00:54:23.160
<v Speaker 7>It's a dictate of process.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

904
00:54:23.161 --> 00:54:23.761
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't,</v>

905
00:54:23.761 --> 00:54:24.594
<v Speaker 7>you shouldn't interfere with the </v>
<v Speaker 7>mechanism that allows you to solve all </v>

906
00:54:27.121 --> 00:54:29.310
<v Speaker 7>the problems that you will face in your </v>
<v Speaker 7>life.</v>

907
00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:32.360
<v Speaker 7>And you come to university maybe to </v>
<v Speaker 7>prepare for,</v>

908
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:33.180
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for a,</v>

909
00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.450
<v Speaker 7>for a profession,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

910
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:35.453
<v Speaker 7>and to set yourself up economically,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but to set yourself economic up </v>

911
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:40.050
<v Speaker 7>economically,</v>
<v Speaker 7>properly.</v>

912
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.120
<v Speaker 7>I don't care what your profession is </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to be.</v>

913
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.230
<v Speaker 7>There is no one who is more powerful </v>
<v Speaker 7>than someone who can communicate.</v>

914
00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.770
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't matter what the field,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't matter if you're a plumber or</v>

915
00:54:49.771 --> 00:54:50.604
<v Speaker 7>a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you can formulate your thoughts </v>

916
00:54:52.531 --> 00:54:55.890
<v Speaker 7>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you can conduct yourself honorably in</v>

917
00:54:55.891 --> 00:54:59.820
<v Speaker 7>your action and your speech,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're articulate and careful,</v>

918
00:54:59.821 --> 00:55:00.654
<v Speaker 7>then the world opens itself up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have an unlimited horizon of </v>

919
00:55:04.441 --> 00:55:06.900
<v Speaker 7>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So thank you very much.</v>

920
00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.053
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

921
00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:13.130
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

922
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:17.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you both for coming with,</v>

923
00:55:17.821 --> 00:55:18.654
<v Speaker 4>firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to thank everyone in the room </v>

924
00:55:20.161 --> 00:55:23.280
<v Speaker 4>was not devolved into the hysteria we </v>
<v Speaker 4>see outside.</v>

925
00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:24.383
<v Speaker 4>They would prefer that we lost our </v>
<v Speaker 4>sanity and that our society with </v>

926
00:55:27.901 --> 00:55:31.290
<v Speaker 4>fracture into the nonsense we see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So by sitting here,</v>

927
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:34.890
<v Speaker 4>being as patient as you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is how we keep our academy.</v>

928
00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:37.080
<v Speaker 4>This is how we keep our society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

929
00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:42.490
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

930
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:48.770
<v Speaker 4>my question is a simple one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

931
00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:52.200
<v Speaker 4>we see more and more of this new </v>
<v Speaker 4>language I call of leftism,</v>

932
00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:53.820
<v Speaker 4>intersectionality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>equity,</v>

933
00:55:53.821 --> 00:55:55.200
<v Speaker 4>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inclusion,</v>

934
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.333
<v Speaker 4>and we see people from all political and</v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophical stripes adopting this new </v>

935
00:56:00.541 --> 00:56:01.374
<v Speaker 4>vernacular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this in any way dignifying that as a </v>

936
00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:05.214
<v Speaker 4>position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this dignifying the philosophical </v>

937
00:56:08.071 --> 00:56:08.904
<v Speaker 4>bases of these words?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do people recognize that when they use </v>

938
00:56:11.551 --> 00:56:12.384
<v Speaker 4>these links,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these words that they were making that </v>

939
00:56:14.401 --> 00:56:17.700
<v Speaker 4>somehow a truth that we all ought to </v>
<v Speaker 4>accept?</v>

940
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should we or should we not?</v>

941
00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:19.943
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people,</v>

942
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:22.000
<v Speaker 7>you recognize that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Again,</v>

943
00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.660
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd like reiterate,</v>

944
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:27.330
<v Speaker 7>the reason I made those videos to begin </v>
<v Speaker 7>with was because I don't,</v>

945
00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:28.623
<v Speaker 7>I was unwilling to cede the linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 7>territory as soon as you think it's </v>

946
00:56:32.231 --> 00:56:33.064
<v Speaker 7>already happening to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So imagine that we just defined the </v>

947
00:56:36.341 --> 00:56:39.250
<v Speaker 7>sociopolitical landscape in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 7>identity politics,</v>

948
00:56:39.251 --> 00:56:40.900
<v Speaker 7>which is happening very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In fact,</v>

949
00:56:40.901 --> 00:56:42.460
<v Speaker 7>we're compelled to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

950
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.560
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

951
00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:47.830
<v Speaker 7>well then,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then what happens is you get activity on</v>

952
00:56:47.831 --> 00:56:52.690
<v Speaker 7>the identity politics front on the left </v>
<v Speaker 7>and on the right the left says,</v>

953
00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:53.973
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the oppressed shall rise and take their </v>

954
00:56:55.361 --> 00:56:57.550
<v Speaker 7>rightful place.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the right says,</v>

955
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:59.170
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>over my dead body,</v>

956
00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:00.183
<v Speaker 7>and probably yours too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So as soon as we played the identity </v>

957
00:57:03.551 --> 00:57:06.070
<v Speaker 7>politics game,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's where we're at.</v>

958
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.860
<v Speaker 7>And we start playing it by accepting the</v>
<v Speaker 7>terminology.</v>

959
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.233
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>already I find myself stumbling when I </v>

960
00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:13.870
<v Speaker 7>use the word sex instead of gender.</v>

961
00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:15.513
<v Speaker 7>And that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I have to consciously overcome a </v>

962
00:57:17.681 --> 00:57:21.730
<v Speaker 7>resistance to use the word sex instead </v>
<v Speaker 7>of gender because you know,</v>

963
00:57:21.731 --> 00:57:26.290
<v Speaker 7>I'm actually quite an agreeable person </v>
<v Speaker 7>and it actually pains me to,</v>

964
00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:29.020
<v Speaker 7>to go against the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's say,</v>

965
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:29.883
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not temperamentally suited for it </v>

966
00:57:31.001 --> 00:57:32.830
<v Speaker 7>precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 7>strangely enough.</v>

967
00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:38.070
<v Speaker 7>And so I feel the compulsion to use this</v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of language welling up inside of me</v>

968
00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:41.230
<v Speaker 7>just to be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to be nice,</v>

969
00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:42.640
<v Speaker 7>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

970
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:46.390
<v Speaker 7>but I know where identity politics </v>
<v Speaker 7>leads.</v>

971
00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:50.710
<v Speaker 7>It leads to the ghoulag.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It leads to the concentration camps.</v>

972
00:57:50.711 --> 00:57:54.280
<v Speaker 7>It leads to blood in the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We don't need that here.</v>

973
00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:57.700
<v Speaker 7>We're doing pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So we could leave it.</v>

974
00:57:58.890 --> 00:58:03.260
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

975
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:08.740
<v Speaker 6>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Professor Peterson.</v>

976
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.840
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I studied history for the duration of my</v>

977
00:58:10.841 --> 00:58:15.610
<v Speaker 6>degree and I think it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 6>sickeningly ironic that the people who,</v>

978
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:17.710
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are using their free speech,</v>

979
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:21.340
<v Speaker 6>one to take away your free speech and </v>
<v Speaker 6>furthermore,</v>

980
00:58:21.341 --> 00:58:22.174
<v Speaker 6>that they can't see the irony of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>situation of how tyrannical there being </v>

981
00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:25.961
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my question is,</v>

982
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:26.794
<v Speaker 6>however,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've noticed from a lot of what you've </v>

983
00:58:28.781 --> 00:58:31.680
<v Speaker 6>talked about and I've been watching you </v>
<v Speaker 6>since your rise in 2060,</v>

984
00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:33.610
<v Speaker 6>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

985
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:36.280
<v Speaker 6>and I know that you're a Christian and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't want to divulge into that,</v>

986
00:58:36.281 --> 00:58:41.260
<v Speaker 6>but I notice a lot of sort of North </v>
<v Speaker 6>American Protestant work ethic in,</v>

987
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:42.190
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

988
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:43.210
<v Speaker 6>in your lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

989
00:58:43.211 --> 00:58:43.960
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

990
00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.880
<v Speaker 6>self redemption and to be your own </v>
<v Speaker 6>person.</v>

991
00:58:45.881 --> 00:58:48.580
<v Speaker 6>Like we've been talking about that last </v>
<v Speaker 6>like hour and a half I suppose.</v>

992
00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:53.440
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a ever rising tide where people are,</v>

993
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:54.363
<v Speaker 6>or rather in the western world where </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's becoming increasingly rather </v>

994
00:58:57.371 --> 00:58:59.800
<v Speaker 6>decreasingly Christian and specifically </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

995
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:00.693
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Decreasingly religious in this </v>

996
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:04.300
<v Speaker 6>specifically decreasingly Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how can you,</v>

997
00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:09.010
<v Speaker 6>what do you think is the best suggestion</v>
<v Speaker 6>in order to be able to uphold those such</v>

998
00:59:09.011 --> 00:59:11.770
<v Speaker 6>important values that have been across </v>
<v Speaker 6>the world,</v>

999
00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:12.683
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from the American cultural influences </v>

1000
00:59:13.701 --> 00:59:15.940
<v Speaker 6>since the end of the Second World War?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I apologize for the long question.</v>

1001
00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:16.780
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1002
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.300
<v Speaker 7>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The no,</v>

1003
00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 7>people have asked me repeatedly my </v>
<v Speaker 7>religious views,</v>

1004
00:59:22.431 --> 00:59:23.264
<v Speaker 7>and I've</v>
<v Speaker 7>answered them in a variety of different </v>

1005
00:59:26.121 --> 00:59:28.160
<v Speaker 7>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but they say,</v>

1006
00:59:28.161 --> 00:59:29.750
<v Speaker 7>do you believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say?</v>

1007
00:59:29.850 --> 00:59:32.330
<v Speaker 7>And my response to that always is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1008
00:59:32.331 --> 00:59:35.120
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what you mean when you ask </v>
<v Speaker 7>me that question.</v>

1009
00:59:35.121 --> 00:59:38.180
<v Speaker 7>So I don't know how to answer it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what you mean by belief,</v>

1010
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:42.770
<v Speaker 7>but I can tell you something that I </v>
<v Speaker 7>believe and I would say this is a way of</v>

1011
00:59:42.771 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 7>speaking symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do believe so.</v>

1012
00:59:46.311 --> 00:59:48.140
<v Speaker 7>I was thinking the other day and we </v>
<v Speaker 7>could go,</v>

1013
00:59:48.141 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 7>I was thinking about this I this little </v>
<v Speaker 7>fantasy that entered my mind.</v>

1014
00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:56.570
<v Speaker 7>I was thinking about Saint Joseph's </v>
<v Speaker 7>oratorial in Montreal and Saint Joseph's</v>

1015
00:59:56.571 --> 00:59:58.550
<v Speaker 7>oratory.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a very large religious building.</v>

1016
00:59:58.551 --> 00:59:59.384
<v Speaker 7>It's one of the biggest cathedral like </v>
<v Speaker 7>structures in the world and it's set on </v>

1017
01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:05.300
<v Speaker 7>the hill and mount royal and it's set up</v>
<v Speaker 7>where it can catch the sun,</v>

1018
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:05.900
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

1019
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.450
<v Speaker 7>So it's an image of the heavenly city on</v>
<v Speaker 7>the hill,</v>

1020
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.313
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's an image of the structures that we </v>

1021
01:00:11.301 --> 01:00:12.134
<v Speaker 7>strive to create.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what it is in independent of its </v>

1022
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:17.300
<v Speaker 7>specifically Christian or religious </v>
<v Speaker 7>function.</v>

1023
01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:19.520
<v Speaker 7>That's what it stands for symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1024
01:00:19.521 --> 01:00:20.870
<v Speaker 7>So it's the city on the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

1025
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:25.220
<v Speaker 7>it's what we're striving towards when we</v>
<v Speaker 7>walk up hill in life.</v>

1026
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:26.323
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

1027
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:27.343
<v Speaker 7>the way that the oratory was structured,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's hundreds of steps leading to it </v>

1028
01:00:30.531 --> 01:00:31.364
<v Speaker 7>up front.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And in the early part of the 20th </v>

1029
01:00:32.931 --> 01:00:33.764
<v Speaker 7>century,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot of people who had physical </v>

1030
01:00:34.521 --> 01:00:35.354
<v Speaker 7>disabilities came there and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>struggled up the step on their crutches </v>

1031
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.550
<v Speaker 7>and many of them left their crutches in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the oratorial.</v>

1032
01:00:40.551 --> 01:00:42.380
<v Speaker 7>You can see hundreds of them if you go </v>
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>

1033
01:00:42.381 --> 01:00:43.214
<v Speaker 7>It's quite an interesting site.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I was thinking about that and I was </v>

1034
01:00:45.921 --> 01:00:48.800
<v Speaker 7>thinking about what that meant and this </v>
<v Speaker 7>is what it means.</v>

1035
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.060
<v Speaker 7>It means that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone has their disabilities,</v>

1036
01:00:53.061 --> 01:00:55.520
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I know that some people are far more</v>

1037
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:58.850
<v Speaker 7>terribly effected than other people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm perfectly aware of that.</v>

1038
01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.310
<v Speaker 7>But the question is what do you do about</v>
<v Speaker 7>that?</v>

1039
01:01:01.311 --> 01:01:02.144
<v Speaker 7>And what you do is you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you set yourself up on your damn </v>

1040
01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:07.550
<v Speaker 7>crutches and you struggle up the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 7>hill.</v>

1041
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.810
<v Speaker 7>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you struggle up the hill towards the</v>

1042
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:12.643
<v Speaker 7>Kingdom of God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what you do because the </v>

1043
01:01:13.611 --> 01:01:16.190
<v Speaker 7>alternative is to descend into the </v>
<v Speaker 7>abyss.</v>

1044
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.160
<v Speaker 7>That's the alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then so to say,</v>

1045
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:19.994
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you believe it's like I believe that </v>

1046
01:01:21.111 --> 01:01:25.100
<v Speaker 7>you should struggle uphill towards the </v>
<v Speaker 7>city of God on your crutches.</v>

1047
01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:26.953
<v Speaker 7>That's what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the opposite of the descent into </v>

1048
01:01:29.811 --> 01:01:32.570
<v Speaker 7>the abyss.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so that's,</v>

1049
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:35.510
<v Speaker 7>that's at the foundation of our </v>
<v Speaker 7>civilization.</v>

1050
01:01:35.511 --> 01:01:37.220
<v Speaker 7>That idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1051
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.810
<v Speaker 7>argue with it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you will,</v>

1052
01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:41.990
<v Speaker 7>see if you can figure out why that's not</v>
<v Speaker 7>an acceptable idea.</v>

1053
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.240
<v Speaker 7>Maybe you should help someone's struggle</v>
<v Speaker 7>up the hill.</v>

1054
01:01:44.241 --> 01:01:45.830
<v Speaker 7>Perhaps you should,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1055
01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:46.664
<v Speaker 7>you can lend a hand to someone or you </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't want to take the burden away from </v>

1056
01:01:49.311 --> 01:01:53.600
<v Speaker 7>them entirely because there's something </v>
<v Speaker 7>noble about struggling up the Damn Hill,</v>

1057
01:01:53.601 --> 01:01:55.400
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's something that's adventure.</v>

1058
01:01:55.401 --> 01:01:58.520
<v Speaker 7>That's the call to proper being.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1059
01:01:58.521 --> 01:02:01.910
<v Speaker 7>well we don't need to forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1060
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:02.803
<v Speaker 7>we don't need to forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The universities have been there since </v>

1061
01:02:05.151 --> 01:02:10.151
<v Speaker 7>time in memorial to try to push that </v>
<v Speaker 7>idea forward through the generations and</v>

1062
01:02:10.281 --> 01:02:13.100
<v Speaker 7>everyone needs to know that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what gives you life,</v>

1063
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.830
<v Speaker 7>not happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Forget about that.</v>

1064
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:17.900
<v Speaker 7>If it comes while,</v>
<v Speaker 7>great,</v>

1065
01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.640
<v Speaker 7>except it dignity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nobility,</v>

1066
01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.740
<v Speaker 7>character,</v>
<v Speaker 7>truth,</v>

1067
01:02:22.741 --> 01:02:24.540
<v Speaker 7>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 7>beauty.</v>

1068
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:27.470
<v Speaker 7>Those are the things to aim for honor to</v>
<v Speaker 7>and say.</v>

1069
01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.980
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] thank you very much and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>hope when all this is done,</v>

1070
01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:32.814
<v Speaker 7>I hope you take a nice long,</v>
<v Speaker 7>big vacation cause I think you really </v>

1071
01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:34.944
<v Speaker 7>deserve it.</v>

1072
01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:40.403
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

1073
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:43.310
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Peterson first,</v>

1074
01:02:43.311 --> 01:02:48.311
<v Speaker 10>thank you for coming and I'm so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 10>trying to ease my parents grew up in the</v>

1075
01:02:50.091 --> 01:02:50.924
<v Speaker 10>cultural revolution of China,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so I took particular attention when you </v>

1076
01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:55.903
<v Speaker 10>mentioned the multiple occasions </v>
<v Speaker 10>comparing what's happening in the West </v>

1077
01:02:59.211 --> 01:03:00.620
<v Speaker 10>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 10>two miles,</v>

1078
01:03:00.621 --> 01:03:01.454
<v Speaker 10>China and I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I agree and it's pretty obvious the </v>

1079
01:03:03.981 --> 01:03:07.850
<v Speaker 10>connection between their radiology,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the identity politics and the oppression</v>

1080
01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:08.684
<v Speaker 10>versus oppressed viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But my question is mostly about how </v>

1081
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.220
<v Speaker 10>they're promoting the political agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

1082
01:03:16.221 --> 01:03:17.054
<v Speaker 10>I see that the political agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the philosophy behind the political </v>

1083
01:03:19.841 --> 01:03:20.674
<v Speaker 10>gender are very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but at the same time I see a shocking </v>

1084
01:03:24.201 --> 01:03:27.500
<v Speaker 10>similarity in the way that they're </v>
<v Speaker 10>promoting that political agenda.</v>

1085
01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:31.280
<v Speaker 10>Specifically backing back in the culture</v>
<v Speaker 10>revolution,</v>

1086
01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.293
<v Speaker 10>anyone who dare to say anything that </v>
<v Speaker 10>it's not fully for the movement was </v>

1087
01:03:36.621 --> 01:03:37.454
<v Speaker 10>classified as Ntu revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Just as now who anyone who dare to say </v>

1088
01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:42.584
<v Speaker 10>anything that goes remotely,</v>
<v Speaker 10>not fully aligning with whatever they </v>

1089
01:03:46.671 --> 01:03:50.270
<v Speaker 10>want to promote is classified as hate </v>
<v Speaker 10>speech.</v>

1090
01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:53.450
<v Speaker 10>Although it has nothing to do with hate </v>
<v Speaker 10>hating anybody.</v>

1091
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:57.440
<v Speaker 10>So since the same thing is happening </v>
<v Speaker 10>here and a mouse,</v>

1092
01:03:57.441 --> 01:03:59.720
<v Speaker 10>China,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what would you say?</v>

1093
01:03:59.721 --> 01:03:59.941
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what?</v>

1094
01:03:59.941 --> 01:04:00.774
<v Speaker 10>What do you think is the connection </v>
<v Speaker 10>between the philosophy and veer idiotic </v>

1095
01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:08.260
<v Speaker 10>s over simplifying and tyrannical way of</v>
<v Speaker 10>him,</v>

1096
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:09.740
<v Speaker 10>of trying to promoting it?</v>

1097
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.660
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the first thing,</v>

1098
01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.213
<v Speaker 7>the first thing we should make clear is </v>
<v Speaker 7>that there is such a thing as hate </v>

1099
01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:19.730
<v Speaker 7>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1100
01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:20.603
<v Speaker 7>Like let's not be naive about this and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you can use words to inflame and words </v>

1101
01:04:24.751 --> 01:04:25.584
<v Speaker 7>can be very dangerous tools.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People use them and hateful matters all </v>

1102
01:04:28.771 --> 01:04:30.810
<v Speaker 7>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not the issue.</v>

1103
01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:31.913
<v Speaker 7>That's obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The issue is whether or not you should </v>

1104
01:04:35.461 --> 01:04:38.820
<v Speaker 7>regulate out and even more importantly </v>
<v Speaker 7>whether the state should regulate it.</v>

1105
01:04:38.821 --> 01:04:42.300
<v Speaker 7>And the reason that's an issue is </v>
<v Speaker 7>because who's going to define it?</v>

1106
01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.850
<v Speaker 7>I'll tell you who's going to define hate</v>
<v Speaker 7>speech.</v>

1107
01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:45.953
<v Speaker 7>It's the people who are doing that that </v>
<v Speaker 7>are going to define hate speech and </v>

1108
01:04:48.421 --> 01:04:51.900
<v Speaker 7>right now they're are defining you </v>
<v Speaker 7>sitting in here as hate speech.</v>

1109
01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:54.720
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's exactly what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 7>while we sit here.</v>

1110
01:04:54.721 --> 01:04:59.310
<v Speaker 7>It's like who would be interested in </v>
<v Speaker 7>defining the parameters of hate speech?</v>

1111
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.233
<v Speaker 7>Here's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The people that you would least want to </v>

1112
01:05:02.851 --> 01:05:06.930
<v Speaker 7>have adopt that responsibility and and </v>
<v Speaker 7>hate speech.</v>

1113
01:05:06.931 --> 01:05:10.410
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say I was interviewed a while back</v>

1114
01:05:10.411 --> 01:05:12.690
<v Speaker 7>and the journalist asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1115
01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:16.350
<v Speaker 7>why should your right to a fan trump </v>
<v Speaker 7>someone's right to be secure?</v>

1116
01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1117
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:22.300
<v Speaker 7>well let's say I'm talking to one person</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you might say,</v>

1118
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:23.890
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't have the right to offend them.</v>

1119
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.753
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>

1120
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:25.923
<v Speaker 7>what if I'm talking to 10 people?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do I have the right to offend one of </v>

1121
01:05:28.961 --> 01:05:31.840
<v Speaker 7>those people when I speak to the board,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if it's a thousand people,</v>

1122
01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.550
<v Speaker 7>what you're saying,</v>

1123
01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:46.523
<v Speaker 7>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't have a conversation about </v>

1124
01:05:48.631 --> 01:05:49.464
<v Speaker 7>something serious without offense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like if I'm thinking about something </v>

1125
01:05:53.101 --> 01:05:55.650
<v Speaker 7>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I often myself,</v>

1126
01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.140
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know it's seriously mean that I really</v>

1127
01:05:58.141 --> 01:05:58.974
<v Speaker 7>mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So like if I'm laying out a set of </v>

1128
01:06:00.661 --> 01:06:02.130
<v Speaker 7>hypotheses,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

1129
01:06:02.131 --> 01:06:04.890
<v Speaker 7>about a complex social,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a social problem,</v>

1130
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.980
<v Speaker 7>I might lay out 20 hypothesis and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 7>two of them.</v>

1131
01:06:07.981 --> 01:06:08.880
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>

1132
01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:11.850
<v Speaker 7>I hope that's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but like maybe it is true.</v>

1133
01:06:11.851 --> 01:06:12.684
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sometimes you discover things as a </v>

1134
01:06:14.041 --> 01:06:14.874
<v Speaker 7>social scientist that you wish weren't </v>
<v Speaker 7>true and those are usually the things </v>

1135
01:06:17.371 --> 01:06:19.350
<v Speaker 7>that you've discovered that are actually</v>
<v Speaker 7>true,</v>

1136
01:06:19.351 --> 01:06:21.150
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because they violate your assumptions.</v>

1137
01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:26.480
<v Speaker 7>So you can't even think if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 7>willing to offend yourself.</v>

1138
01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:27.893
<v Speaker 7>That's what thinking does.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you're ever talking about something </v>

1139
01:06:30.061 --> 01:06:30.894
<v Speaker 7>wouldn't be serious if it didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 7>the possibility of frightening and </v>

1140
01:06:33.901 --> 01:06:35.720
<v Speaker 7>offending people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's kind of how the,</v>

1141
01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:38.280
<v Speaker 7>that's Kinda like the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 7>seriousness.</v>

1142
01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:38.791
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1143
01:06:38.791 --> 01:06:42.630
<v Speaker 7>we can only talk about things that no </v>
<v Speaker 7>one ever gets upset about.</v>

1144
01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.753
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1145
01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:45.750
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

1146
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:48.210
<v Speaker 7>then it's like you're trapped in an </v>
<v Speaker 7>elevator for,</v>

1147
01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:51.780
<v Speaker 7>for the rest of infinity listening to </v>
<v Speaker 7>nothing but music.</v>

1148
01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.553
<v Speaker 7>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's an,</v>

1149
01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:56.430
<v Speaker 7>that's a kind of hell man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you're going to think,</v>

1150
01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:58.800
<v Speaker 7>and also if you're going to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to,</v>

1151
01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.113
<v Speaker 7>you're going to offend people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're going to go after their deepest </v>

1152
01:07:02.221 --> 01:07:04.500
<v Speaker 7>presuppositions and end your own as </v>
<v Speaker 7>well.</v>

1153
01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.530
<v Speaker 7>You're going to shatter them at times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be brutal.</v>

1154
01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:08.453
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you all know that because every </v>

1155
01:07:10.501 --> 01:07:11.334
<v Speaker 7>single one of you has had a serious </v>
<v Speaker 7>conversation with someone that you love </v>

1156
01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:18.660
<v Speaker 7>and the probability that that was an </v>
<v Speaker 7>easy conversation and that either of you</v>

1157
01:07:18.661 --> 01:07:21.810
<v Speaker 7>escaped without offense and terror is </v>
<v Speaker 7>zero.</v>

1158
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.910
<v Speaker 7>If you haven't had a conversation like </v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

1159
01:07:23.911 --> 01:07:25.040
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well</v>

1160
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:29.540
<v Speaker 7>you're not human,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1161
01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.130
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

1162
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.770
<v Speaker 7>Cause everyone has conversations like </v>
<v Speaker 7>that all the time,</v>

1163
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.633
<v Speaker 7>except when they run from them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is most of the time and no bloody </v>

1164
01:07:38.391 --> 01:07:39.860
<v Speaker 7>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1165
01:07:39.861 --> 01:07:40.694
<v Speaker 7>real conversations or there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 7>worse than a real conversation except </v>

1166
01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:47.330
<v Speaker 7>the war that you have if you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 7>the conversation.</v>

1167
01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:50.410
<v Speaker 7>That's basically how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just want to underline,</v>

1168
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:59.270
<v Speaker 7>I just want to underline Jordan's first </v>
<v Speaker 7>point,</v>

1169
01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:04.100
<v Speaker 8>which is really that it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 8>dangerous thing.</v>

1170
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
<v Speaker 8>Any legal rule that relies on some kind </v>
<v Speaker 8>of reasonableness because reasonableness</v>

1171
01:08:11.181 --> 01:08:14.060
<v Speaker 8>lives in the eyes of the beholder.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1172
01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:19.570
<v Speaker 8>those out there think that you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 8>uttering hate speech.</v>

1173
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:25.150
<v Speaker 8>They think that you guys should be the </v>
<v Speaker 8>one who are arrested and just imagine if</v>

1174
01:08:25.191 --> 01:08:28.820
<v Speaker 8>they were the ones who had the reins of </v>
<v Speaker 8>government power.</v>

1175
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:31.320
<v Speaker 8>Just all very well.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you.</v>

1176
01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:32.183
<v Speaker 8>Both hate speech is a reasonable idea,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but as soon as you give up the control </v>

1177
01:08:35.691 --> 01:08:39.680
<v Speaker 8>about what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're liable to run into real trouble.</v>

1178
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:43.390
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A little monster.</v>

1179
01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:44.371
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

1180
01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:46.890
<v Speaker 6>Mr. Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My name is Zachary Milligan.</v>

1181
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:48.420
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>first off,</v>

1182
01:08:48.421 --> 01:08:49.254
<v Speaker 6>I'd just like to start by actually thank</v>
<v Speaker 6>you for all the hardship and troubles </v>

1183
01:08:52.981 --> 01:08:57.510
<v Speaker 6>even dirt for standing up for our rights</v>
<v Speaker 6>and being a part of this debate.</v>

1184
01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.393
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I come from a dairy farm and math need </v>

1185
01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:02.843
<v Speaker 6>rural res conservatively.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And my question is in the face of when </v>

1186
01:09:06.391 --> 01:09:08.910
<v Speaker 6>we have a social situation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so divisive,</v>

1187
01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:12.450
<v Speaker 6>when you genuinely believe what you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing is the right thing.</v>

1188
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:15.360
<v Speaker 6>In this particular instance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>since you have experience with it,</v>

1189
01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:19.320
<v Speaker 6>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is there a more effective,</v>

1190
01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:21.960
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to say an easy way to reach</v>
<v Speaker 6>out for them.</v>

1191
01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.213
<v Speaker 6>What do you think's the best way to try </v>
<v Speaker 6>and talk some sense into those folks </v>

1192
01:09:25.951 --> 01:09:27.660
<v Speaker 6>outside and the one on one setting?</v>

1193
01:09:28.150 --> 01:09:31.310
<v Speaker 7>So the first thing is is I don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>necessarily the date,</v>

1194
01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:32.793
<v Speaker 7>I don't necessarily think that what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing is the right thing because you </v>

1195
01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:36.904
<v Speaker 7>know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to be careful when you make a </v>

1196
01:09:37.931 --> 01:09:40.180
<v Speaker 7>claim like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I can tell you one thing,</v>

1197
01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:41.583
<v Speaker 7>I'm not going to let anyone stand in the</v>
<v Speaker 7>way of me trying to figure out what the </v>

1198
01:09:45.761 --> 01:09:48.250
<v Speaker 7>right thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the thing.</v>

1199
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.330
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1200
01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:57.893
<v Speaker 7>and then I would say we're doing exactly</v>
<v Speaker 7>what we should be doing right now in </v>

1201
01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:04.560
<v Speaker 7>this discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just exactly right,</v>

1202
01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:05.933
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1203
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.810
<v Speaker 7>admittedly we have to talk over the </v>
<v Speaker 7>noise,</v>

1204
01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.673
<v Speaker 7>but that's really not that big a </v>
<v Speaker 7>catastrophe and everybody's in here is </v>

1205
01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:16.080
<v Speaker 7>comporting themselves in a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 7>manner.</v>

1206
01:10:16.081 --> 01:10:19.380
<v Speaker 7>And we're trying to struggle our way </v>
<v Speaker 7>through the topics and we're,</v>

1207
01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.393
<v Speaker 7>we're asking questions and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're trying to have a genuine dialogue </v>

1208
01:10:22.831 --> 01:10:24.930
<v Speaker 7>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's what we've got.</v>

1209
01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.810
<v Speaker 7>We've got,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've got three things.</v>

1210
01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:32.670
<v Speaker 7>We've got negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've got slavery,</v>

1211
01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:36.210
<v Speaker 7>and we've got tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And those are your choices.</v>

1212
01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.850
<v Speaker 7>And so this is negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1213
01:10:38.851 --> 01:10:39.684
<v Speaker 7>That's public discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the reason that freedom of speech </v>

1214
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.790
<v Speaker 7>thought is obviously important.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everyone can understand that.</v>

1215
01:10:44.791 --> 01:10:45.331
<v Speaker 7>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1216
01:10:45.331 --> 01:10:46.164
<v Speaker 7>you don't need to speak freely because </v>
<v Speaker 7>you can think who's going to get inside </v>

1217
01:10:48.961 --> 01:10:51.630
<v Speaker 7>your head.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the problem with that is that that's</v>

1218
01:10:51.631 --> 01:10:52.464
<v Speaker 7>not it.</v>

1219
01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:56.460
<v Speaker 7>You can't think very well because there </v>
<v Speaker 7>you are and your little world,</v>

1220
01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:58.950
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>with all your biases and your ignorance,</v>

1221
01:10:59.010 --> 01:10:59.843
<v Speaker 7>you're wrong about so many things and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to learn it really </v>

1222
01:11:01.861 --> 01:11:03.030
<v Speaker 7>painfully.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1223
01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.073
<v Speaker 7>and then maybe you can trot out some of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the things you think erroneously and </v>

1224
01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.033
<v Speaker 7>ignorantly and other people will give </v>
<v Speaker 7>you a tap on the side of the head </v>

1225
01:11:10.291 --> 01:11:12.540
<v Speaker 7>instead of running you over with a </v>
<v Speaker 7>freight train,</v>

1226
01:11:12.541 --> 01:11:13.374
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They'll give you a little tap on the </v>

1227
01:11:14.221 --> 01:11:16.560
<v Speaker 7>side of the head and maybe you'll walk </v>
<v Speaker 7>away a little smarter.</v>

1228
01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.640
<v Speaker 7>And that's why freedom of speech is so </v>
<v Speaker 7>important is because a lot of thinking,</v>

1229
01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:24.240
<v Speaker 7>especially about things that are beyond </v>
<v Speaker 7>you for whatever reason,</v>

1230
01:11:24.241 --> 01:11:25.074
<v Speaker 7>have to take place publicly as we </v>
<v Speaker 7>stumble around towards an adequate </v>

1231
01:11:28.711 --> 01:11:31.140
<v Speaker 7>formulation of the problems that beset </v>
<v Speaker 7>us.</v>

1232
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:34.860
<v Speaker 7>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well in this book I wrote,</v>

1233
01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:35.850
<v Speaker 7>I have a rule.</v>

1234
01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:37.053
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's rule eight which is tell </v>

1235
01:11:38.851 --> 01:11:41.670
<v Speaker 7>the truth or at least don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would say,</v>

1236
01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:43.410
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's another reasonable,</v>

1237
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:45.103
<v Speaker 7>reasonable way to start approaching the </v>
<v Speaker 7>situation is it's not so easy to tell </v>

1238
01:11:48.451 --> 01:11:50.310
<v Speaker 7>the truth because like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what do you know?</v>

1239
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.200
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't come out and say,</v>

1240
01:11:52.201 --> 01:11:53.100
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's the truth,</v>

1241
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.113
<v Speaker 7>but I know what one thing you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is when you know that what you're </v>

1242
01:11:57.181 --> 01:11:58.014
<v Speaker 7>saying is a lie by your own standards,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can not say it and you can have a </v>

1243
01:12:02.281 --> 01:12:03.114
<v Speaker 7>consultation with yourself and you can </v>
<v Speaker 7>try to learn to say those things that </v>

1244
01:12:06.601 --> 01:12:09.540
<v Speaker 7>make you strong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Instead of saying those things that make</v>

1245
01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:10.374
<v Speaker 7>you weak and you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you contribute to the health of the </v>

1246
01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:16.590
<v Speaker 7>public dialogue in an incalculable </v>
<v Speaker 7>manner that way.</v>

1247
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.513
<v Speaker 7>And this is another issue that pertains </v>
<v Speaker 7>to the dignity and importance of the </v>

1248
01:12:20.521 --> 01:12:21.270
<v Speaker 7>individual.</v>

1249
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:25.080
<v Speaker 7>How you conduct yourself in your life is</v>
<v Speaker 7>way more important than you think.</v>

1250
01:12:25.930 --> 01:12:26.321
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I,</v>

1251
01:12:26.321 --> 01:12:27.154
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that that's a daunting idea </v>

1252
01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:29.520
<v Speaker 7>because,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1253
01:12:29.521 --> 01:12:31.990
<v Speaker 7>let's say you're nihilistic and life is </v>
<v Speaker 7>meaningless.</v>

1254
01:12:31.991 --> 01:12:32.281
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1255
01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:35.440
<v Speaker 7>what's the payoff for that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think while there's no payoff,</v>

1256
01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:35.941
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1257
01:12:35.941 --> 01:12:36.601
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there is,</v>

1258
01:12:36.601 --> 01:12:39.870
<v Speaker 7>you have no responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a pretty decent pay off.</v>

1259
01:12:39.871 --> 01:12:40.704
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to pay the price of </v>

1260
01:12:41.131 --> 01:12:43.590
<v Speaker 7>meaninglessness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it doesn't matter what you do.</v>

1261
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.200
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we'll flip that over and said,</v>

1262
01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:46.050
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1263
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:48.000
<v Speaker 7>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're wrong.</v>

1264
01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:51.240
<v Speaker 7>Your life is meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's way more meaningful than you think,</v>

1265
01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:55.200
<v Speaker 7>but you have to bear responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 7>your thoughts and your actions.</v>

1266
01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:56.723
<v Speaker 7>It's like you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there'll be plenty of meaning and not </v>

1267
01:12:57.901 --> 01:13:00.210
<v Speaker 7>well that if you understand that </v>
<v Speaker 7>property,</v>

1268
01:13:00.211 --> 01:13:01.044
<v Speaker 7>that will,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that will cleave you to the depths of </v>

1269
01:13:03.151 --> 01:13:03.984
<v Speaker 7>your soul and maybe you learn to speak </v>
<v Speaker 7>carefully and to act carefully and that </v>

1270
01:13:07.621 --> 01:13:11.580
<v Speaker 7>will have a beneficial effect on </v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone around you if far more.</v>

1271
01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:15.610
<v Speaker 7>You're far more powerful in the place </v>
<v Speaker 7>you stand in the place you sit and stand</v>

1272
01:13:15.611 --> 01:13:16.444
<v Speaker 7>than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I think everyone has an intimation </v>

1273
01:13:18.211 --> 01:13:20.400
<v Speaker 7>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if you don't think that's true,</v>

1274
01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:24.360
<v Speaker 7>then try treating people around you as </v>
<v Speaker 7>if it's not true.</v>

1275
01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.673
<v Speaker 7>Tried treating people that you know in </v>
<v Speaker 7>your life as if they don't matter and </v>

1276
01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:29.904
<v Speaker 7>just see what kind of response you get.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People are not going to be happy with </v>

1277
01:13:33.271 --> 01:13:35.010
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not in any sense whatsoever.</v>

1278
01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:37.170
<v Speaker 7>You'll,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll ruin all your relationships.</v>

1279
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:39.480
<v Speaker 7>You have to treat people as if they </v>
<v Speaker 7>matter.</v>

1280
01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:43.380
<v Speaker 7>And maybe you have to treat them as if </v>
<v Speaker 7>they matter because maybe they do.</v>

1281
01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:47.380
<v Speaker 7>And that goes for you too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so if you matter,</v>

1282
01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:50.400
<v Speaker 7>then you should act like you matter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's a very,</v>

1283
01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.910
<v Speaker 7>that's a very daunting proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's for sure.</v>

1284
01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:55.440
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>As a foot,</v>

1285
01:13:55.441 --> 01:13:56.780
<v Speaker 7>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 7>As a</v>

1286
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:02.090
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

1287
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:08.010
<v Speaker 7>it's just a footnote to that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's just observe this in legal terms.</v>

1288
01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 7>There are only two categories of </v>
<v Speaker 7>actions,</v>

1289
01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:17.140
<v Speaker 5>voluntary and involuntary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't let anybody tell you otherwise,</v>

1290
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.053
<v Speaker 5>either you're choosing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're on your own and handling the </v>

1291
01:14:21.131 --> 01:14:24.010
<v Speaker 5>consequences or the government is </v>
<v Speaker 5>telling you what to do.</v>

1292
01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:26.110
<v Speaker 5>Those are the only two possibilities.</v>

1293
01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:28.543
<v Speaker 6>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sir.</v>

1294
01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:36.093
<v Speaker 1>At the back of my head.</v>

1295
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:38.190
<v Speaker 6>Oh Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hello,</v>

1296
01:14:38.191 --> 01:14:39.024
<v Speaker 6>Dr. Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would like to recall the part in your </v>

1297
01:14:41.851 --> 01:14:46.851
<v Speaker 6>conversation in which you mentioned how </v>
<v Speaker 6>the radical left switched from the 1960s</v>

1298
01:14:48.421 --> 01:14:53.421
<v Speaker 6>and seventies to being back when they </v>
<v Speaker 6>were a pro free speech and their recent,</v>

1299
01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:56.730
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>opposition to it.</v>

1300
01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:58.853
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know that you often mentioned their </v>

1301
01:15:00.901 --> 01:15:03.210
<v Speaker 6>obsession with power,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least among them.</v>

1302
01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:04.890
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

1303
01:15:05.190 --> 01:15:06.023
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least among their more marxists </v>

1304
01:15:07.111 --> 01:15:09.790
<v Speaker 6>types.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was one no undoing.</v>

1305
01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:10.643
<v Speaker 6>If perhaps they think that now that now </v>
<v Speaker 6>is the opportunity where they can </v>

1306
01:15:14.401 --> 01:15:15.234
<v Speaker 6>consolidate their power and if they do </v>
<v Speaker 6>so successfully that it will become the </v>

1307
01:15:19.501 --> 01:15:23.010
<v Speaker 6>mortality of our civilization for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>next thousand years.</v>

1308
01:15:23.011 --> 01:15:25.470
<v Speaker 6>Like Christianity was when Rome adopted </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1309
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:31.550
<v Speaker 6>Is that from what you've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>would you say that that's about it,</v>

1310
01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:36.300
<v Speaker 6>that that's close to the way there </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's close to their strategy?</v>

1311
01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:39.933
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's hard to exactly understand the </v>

1312
01:15:42.311 --> 01:15:45.250
<v Speaker 7>strategy of an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1313
01:15:45.251 --> 01:15:48.850
<v Speaker 7>because all the people who were outside </v>
<v Speaker 7>were,</v>

1314
01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:52.330
<v Speaker 7>were united in some sense under the </v>
<v Speaker 7>umbrella of an idea.</v>

1315
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:56.340
<v Speaker 7>And on an idea is a living thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's,</v>

1316
01:15:56.341 --> 01:15:57.174
<v Speaker 7>it's embedded in living tissue and it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>distributed in the fragmentary manner </v>

1317
01:16:01.151 --> 01:16:02.710
<v Speaker 7>across the mob,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say.</v>

1318
01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:04.083
<v Speaker 7>And each person in the mob always only </v>
<v Speaker 7>only possess is a fragment of the </v>

1319
01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:09.964
<v Speaker 7>ideology because the full neo Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say the full neo Marxist </v>

1320
01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:16.700
<v Speaker 7>postmodernist doctrine is quite complex.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1321
01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.360
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when you get them all up together,</v>

1322
01:16:19.361 --> 01:16:22.300
<v Speaker 7>then it acts under the dictate of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>ideology.</v>

1323
01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.370
<v Speaker 7>And the question then is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1324
01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:27.220
<v Speaker 7>what does the ideology want?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I would say,</v>

1325
01:16:27.221 --> 01:16:28.054
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it wants what it's formulators says it </v>

1326
01:16:29.861 --> 01:16:31.780
<v Speaker 7>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And D Derrida,</v>

1327
01:16:31.781 --> 01:16:32.614
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who's head trickster of the </v>

1328
01:16:33.701 --> 01:16:38.650
<v Speaker 7>postmodernists regarded the western </v>
<v Speaker 7>society as fellow go centric,</v>

1329
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:41.290
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And North that meant was male dominant,</v>

1330
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:44.170
<v Speaker 7>male dominated.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the fellow tell us part.</v>

1331
01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.380
<v Speaker 7>And then logo centric.</v>
<v Speaker 7>While that refers to the word logos,</v>

1332
01:16:47.381 --> 01:16:50.110
<v Speaker 7>which means it's the root word of logic,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there's also the,</v>

1333
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:53.410
<v Speaker 7>it's also the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the person of Christ,</v>

1334
01:16:53.411 --> 01:16:54.244
<v Speaker 7>essentially the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so the purpose of the postmodern </v>

1335
01:16:58.121 --> 01:17:02.140
<v Speaker 7>critique was to demolish that wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fair enough.</v>

1336
01:17:02.141 --> 01:17:04.600
<v Speaker 7>My sense with people is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially if they're,</v>

1337
01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:05.493
<v Speaker 7>if they've written things down and </v>
<v Speaker 7>thought them through that they're </v>

1338
01:17:08.111 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 7>actually aiming what they say</v>

1339
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.350
<v Speaker 9>they're aiming for.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

1340
01:17:12.351 --> 01:17:13.184
<v Speaker 9>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you buy the idea that the west is a </v>

1341
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.420
<v Speaker 9>male dominated tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 9>essentially a patriarchal tyranny,</v>

1342
01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.330
<v Speaker 9>and that your moral duty is to tear it </v>
<v Speaker 9>down,</v>

1343
01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:27.110
<v Speaker 9>well then that's what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And then you might say,</v>

1344
01:17:27.111 --> 01:17:27.944
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what's going to,</v>

1345
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:30.410
<v Speaker 9>what is going to be erected on its </v>
<v Speaker 9>ashes?</v>

1346
01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.870
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's where things get complicated.</v>

1347
01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:36.020
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the first question might be,</v>

1348
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:39.110
<v Speaker 9>are the people who wish to tear it down </v>
<v Speaker 9>builders,</v>

1349
01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:39.953
<v Speaker 9>or are they just destroyers?</v>
<v Speaker 9>And my strong sentiment is that they're </v>

1350
01:17:43.581 --> 01:17:45.230
<v Speaker 9>primarily destroyers.</v>

1351
01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1352
01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:47.580
<v Speaker 9>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1353
01:17:47.581 --> 01:17:50.250
<v Speaker 9>why do people wish to destroy?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

1354
01:17:50.251 --> 01:17:52.770
<v Speaker 9>it's because they're hurt by life and </v>
<v Speaker 9>they're resentful.</v>

1355
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1356
01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:58.350
<v Speaker 9>And resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 9>People become vengeful and vengeful.</v>

1357
01:17:58.351 --> 01:18:02.610
<v Speaker 9>People become dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And there's no shortage of motivation to</v>

1358
01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:03.810
<v Speaker 9>make things worse.</v>

1359
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1360
01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:07.440
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the school shooters make things worse.</v>

1361
01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:11.100
<v Speaker 9>People make things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now,</v>

1362
01:18:11.101 --> 01:18:11.934
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>maybe lurking in the rhetoric is this </v>

1363
01:18:13.081 --> 01:18:13.914
<v Speaker 9>appeal to an egalitarian utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But we've tried you galitary Utopia's </v>

1364
01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:20.693
<v Speaker 9>already we sacrificed 100 million people</v>
<v Speaker 9>to he galitary and utopias and we have </v>

1365
01:18:26.311 --> 01:18:27.144
<v Speaker 9>yet to produce one.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And so my sense is the corpses stacked </v>

1366
01:18:30.751 --> 01:18:33.000
<v Speaker 9>up high enough to constitute proof.</v>

1367
01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:35.493
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1368
01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.153
<v Speaker 9>it's destruction mostly that motivates </v>
<v Speaker 9>it as far as I can tell masquerading as </v>

1369
01:18:40.641 --> 01:18:41.474
<v Speaker 9>compassion.</v>

1370
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1371
01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:54.910
<v Speaker 11>thank you for that question.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Next place.</v>

1372
01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:58.570
<v Speaker 11>Dr. Peterson was the party.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Thank you both for being here today.</v>

1373
01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:00.103
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm a political scientist and what I've </v>

1374
01:19:01.691 --> 01:19:03.600
<v Speaker 11>studied is totalitarian regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm sorry,</v>

1375
01:19:03.601 --> 01:19:04.990
<v Speaker 11>I'm gonna move this a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Just feel weird.</v>

1376
01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.910
<v Speaker 11>Totalitarian regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I've studied,</v>

1377
01:19:06.911 --> 01:19:10.530
<v Speaker 11>I've tried to look at the Iranian </v>
<v Speaker 11>revolution and the Islamic Republican,</v>

1378
01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:11.413
<v Speaker 11>Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and I've argued how the Shia Islam that </v>

1379
01:19:13.481 --> 01:19:17.050
<v Speaker 11>is teached in Islamic public is very </v>
<v Speaker 11>close to a totalitarian regime.</v>

1380
01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.220
<v Speaker 11>But now I live in a country where my </v>
<v Speaker 11>ideas are considered controversial.</v>

1381
01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:24.220
<v Speaker 11>If you believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 11>if you believe in family,</v>

1382
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:27.250
<v Speaker 11>if you believe in having responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 11>and traditional values,</v>

1383
01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:28.293
<v Speaker 11>I feel ostracized by the community here.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I came from UC University of Calgary </v>

1384
01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:32.770
<v Speaker 11>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I didn't feel this way.</v>

1385
01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:33.813
<v Speaker 11>There was more welcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Here I feel marginalized and I do feel </v>

1386
01:19:36.701 --> 01:19:38.440
<v Speaker 11>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And when I see this,</v>

1387
01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:40.540
<v Speaker 11>it disgusts me that here they can do </v>
<v Speaker 11>this.</v>

1388
01:19:40.570 --> 01:19:42.550
<v Speaker 11>But I couldn't go to their events and do</v>
<v Speaker 11>anything.</v>

1389
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:43.743
<v Speaker 11>I'd have to shut up,</v>
<v Speaker 11>there'd be a disciplinary committee for </v>

1390
01:19:44.951 --> 01:19:45.784
<v Speaker 11>me.</v>
<v Speaker 11>But for them they can break windows to </v>

1391
01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.350
<v Speaker 11>God knows how old this building is.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And it's okay for them to do that.</v>

1392
01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:53.920
<v Speaker 11>So my question to you is now being sheer</v>
<v Speaker 11>experiencing this,</v>

1393
01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:55.323
<v Speaker 11>I'm starting to second guess that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 11>the totalitarian Islamic regime that I </v>

1394
01:19:58.541 --> 01:19:59.550
<v Speaker 11>was so,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

1395
01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:00.453
<v Speaker 11>talking about I'm critical of back in </v>
<v Speaker 11>Iran isn't so bad when I have a choice </v>

1396
01:20:03.851 --> 01:20:04.684
<v Speaker 11>between having to be here and you press </v>
<v Speaker 11>and be there and least have my ideas be </v>

1397
01:20:08.131 --> 01:20:08.964
<v Speaker 11>okay with blue regime.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So my argument is if this free speech </v>

1398
01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:14.820
<v Speaker 11>and the arguments you guys are making </v>
<v Speaker 11>here,</v>

1399
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.823
<v Speaker 11>it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 11>would that not be the next step for </v>

1400
01:20:17.701 --> 01:20:18.534
<v Speaker 11>people to go towards totalitarianism?</v>
<v Speaker 11>If dialogue fails and isn't force of </v>

1401
01:20:21.781 --> 01:20:22.614
<v Speaker 11>arms the only thing left?</v>
<v Speaker 11>How can people compromise when they </v>

1402
01:20:24.781 --> 01:20:26.640
<v Speaker 11>don't want to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 11>when they want to yell?</v>

1403
01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:28.643
<v Speaker 11>Thank you.</v>

1404
01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:41.500
<v Speaker 8>I think you make it very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think we should fool ourselves.</v>

1405
01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:42.843
<v Speaker 8>This is about force and it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's almost a dare to suggest that that </v>

1406
01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:56.310
<v Speaker 8>certain elements are not allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 8>enforce their view of the world and that</v>

1407
01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:57.993
<v Speaker 8>speaking contrary to it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>isn't that a front to those values and </v>

1408
01:21:00.821 --> 01:21:02.180
<v Speaker 8>they won't shut you down.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean that,</v>

1409
01:21:02.181 --> 01:21:03.880
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that is what is at stake.</v>

1410
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:04.490
<v Speaker 8>We,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we,</v>

1411
01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:05.770
<v Speaker 8>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we are,</v>

1412
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:06.663
<v Speaker 8>we are no longer really in a situation </v>
<v Speaker 8>where this will all be resolved through </v>

1413
01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:16.510
<v Speaker 8>sort of gentle,</v>
<v Speaker 8>reasonable civil dialogue that,</v>

1414
01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:20.230
<v Speaker 8>that happens on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But it's not real anymore.</v>

1415
01:21:20.231 --> 01:21:21.910
<v Speaker 8>It's not really where the fight is </v>
<v Speaker 8>happening.</v>

1416
01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.043
<v Speaker 8>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>an imposition of the force of the state </v>

1417
01:21:25.810 --> 01:21:26.643
<v Speaker 8>and it is skewed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is skewed a certain way and we are </v>

1418
01:21:28.931 --> 01:21:32.860
<v Speaker 8>getting to the point where a certain </v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of language occur,</v>

1419
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:33.763
<v Speaker 8>certain kind of dialogue is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is approved and all right and a certain </v>

1420
01:21:36.761 --> 01:21:37.594
<v Speaker 8>kind of is not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that is the campaign that is going </v>

1421
01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:43.960
<v Speaker 8>on that this is all part of.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I have to say that,</v>

1422
01:21:43.961 --> 01:21:44.794
<v Speaker 8>that your presence here and,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and your endorsement of this kind of </v>

1423
01:21:48.131 --> 01:21:53.131
<v Speaker 8>event is the kind of thing that has the </v>
<v Speaker 8>major pushback to that trend,</v>

1424
01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:57.550
<v Speaker 8>but the trend is continuing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And is it very dangerous one.</v>

1425
01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.920
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is,</v>

1426
01:21:59.921 --> 01:22:00.754
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a difficult moment in the life of this </v>

1427
01:22:03.611 --> 01:22:04.444
<v Speaker 8>country.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Would you,</v>

1428
01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.313
<v Speaker 8>would you say</v>

1429
01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:07.020
<v Speaker 9>Jordan Peele?</v>
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>

1430
01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:09.200
<v Speaker 9>so some,</v>
<v Speaker 9>some comments about,</v>

1431
01:22:09.230 --> 01:22:10.610
<v Speaker 9>about your career,</v>
<v Speaker 9>let's say.</v>

1432
01:22:10.611 --> 01:22:11.444
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So you're a young mountain and you've </v>

1433
01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:13.094
<v Speaker 9>got lots of years ahead of you.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So you know you want to prepare for the </v>

1434
01:22:15.591 --> 01:22:17.900
<v Speaker 9>war and not for the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

1435
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:19.303
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Cause there's going to be many battles </v>

1436
01:22:20.301 --> 01:22:23.090
<v Speaker 9>for you personally and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 9>politically and all of that.</v>

1437
01:22:23.091 --> 01:22:23.924
<v Speaker 9>And so you want to make yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 9>articulate and educated as you can and </v>

1438
01:22:26.451 --> 01:22:27.284
<v Speaker 9>you want to have patients.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I would say that there's no cause for </v>

1439
01:22:29.601 --> 01:22:31.610
<v Speaker 9>despair.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1440
01:22:31.611 --> 01:22:32.750
<v Speaker 9>I believe that the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

1441
01:22:32.890 --> 01:22:33.723
<v Speaker 9>the people who are attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 9>radicalize our society and to transform </v>

1442
01:22:36.831 --> 01:22:40.580
<v Speaker 9>it into a battleground of identity </v>
<v Speaker 9>politics are in a distinct minority.</v>

1443
01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:45.140
<v Speaker 9>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that there's no reason to assume</v>

1444
01:22:45.141 --> 01:22:47.120
<v Speaker 9>that we can't push the devil back into </v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

1445
01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:49.130
<v Speaker 9>into the bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so to speak,</v>

1446
01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:51.170
<v Speaker 9>to push the genie back into the bottle.</v>

1447
01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:55.700
<v Speaker 9>And so don't despair.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now from a personal perspective,</v>

1448
01:22:55.701 --> 01:22:56.534
<v Speaker 9>it's like we've got lots of things to </v>
<v Speaker 9>learn and you've got lots of things to </v>

1449
01:22:59.571 --> 01:23:00.404
<v Speaker 9>say and to write and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 9>find now and then that you were imposed </v>

1450
01:23:03.711 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 9>upon in a manner that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 9>tolerable.</v>

1451
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.941
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You think,</v>

1452
01:23:06.941 --> 01:23:08.320
<v Speaker 9>I can't live like this,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

1453
01:23:08.321 --> 01:23:10.390
<v Speaker 9>It's going to distress you when,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well then,</v>

1454
01:23:10.630 --> 01:23:13.090
<v Speaker 9>then you've come across your moral </v>
<v Speaker 9>conundrum,</v>

1455
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:14.403
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's specific to you and then you have </v>

1456
01:23:16.031 --> 01:23:16.864
<v Speaker 9>to,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's when you have to grow up and </v>

1457
01:23:18.971 --> 01:23:19.804
<v Speaker 9>think strategically.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like you decide are you willing to </v>

1458
01:23:22.751 --> 01:23:25.120
<v Speaker 9>live under those conditions?</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you're not,</v>

1459
01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:27.850
<v Speaker 9>then you develop a strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>

1460
01:23:27.851 --> 01:23:29.230
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to,</v>

1461
01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:34.120
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to fight this.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to fight it carefully,</v>

1462
01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:35.373
<v Speaker 9>intelligently,</v>
<v Speaker 9>thoughtfully on multiple fronts and I'm </v>

1463
01:23:38.981 --> 01:23:42.280
<v Speaker 9>not going to back down like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 9>make that decision lightly.</v>

1464
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:43.143
<v Speaker 9>You know most things you should let blow</v>
<v Speaker 9>by you because there's not that much of </v>

1465
01:23:46.541 --> 01:23:49.990
<v Speaker 9>you and there's lots of things,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but now and then you'll find a stumbling</v>

1466
01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:52.360
<v Speaker 9>block that you can't get over it because</v>
<v Speaker 9>it hurts you.</v>

1467
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:55.900
<v Speaker 9>It damages your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's the right way to think about it.</v>

1468
01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:59.530
<v Speaker 9>Well then that's the time for you to put</v>
<v Speaker 9>your education to use.</v>

1469
01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:01.480
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and you'll be able to do that.</v>

1470
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:02.343
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you don't want to underestimate the </v>

1471
01:24:03.521 --> 01:24:07.300
<v Speaker 9>utility of of deep,</v>
<v Speaker 9>forthright speech.</v>

1472
01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.150
<v Speaker 9>I don't believe that anything can stand </v>
<v Speaker 9>in its way.</v>

1473
01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:12.010
<v Speaker 9>You have the courage of your </v>
<v Speaker 9>convictions,</v>

1474
01:24:12.011 --> 01:24:16.660
<v Speaker 9>but don't give way to despair.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like this battle is by no means over.</v>

1475
01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:20.740
<v Speaker 9>Well no I know meets and it isn't even </v>
<v Speaker 9>obvious that the bad guys are winning so</v>

1476
01:24:20.741 --> 01:24:22.210
<v Speaker 9>to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1477
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:23.980
<v Speaker 9>I mean here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yes,</v>

1478
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.903
<v Speaker 9>we're having this talk.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The university came out forthrightly in </v>

1479
01:24:27.881 --> 01:24:30.640
<v Speaker 9>favor of free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Hooray for that</v>

1480
01:24:30.710 --> 01:24:35.710
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1481
01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:46.953
<v Speaker 9>no one and so far all the questions </v>
<v Speaker 9>today have been thoughtful and </v>

1482
01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:52.330
<v Speaker 9>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You seem like informed people.</v>

1483
01:24:52.570 --> 01:24:54.700
<v Speaker 9>It's like don't underestimate your </v>
<v Speaker 9>strength.</v>

1484
01:24:55.210 --> 01:24:56.043
<v Speaker 9>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and mcmaster just published a set of </v>

1485
01:24:58.331 --> 01:24:59.164
<v Speaker 9>guidelines governing this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 9>behavior so that will no longer be </v>

1486
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:04.203
<v Speaker 9>acceptable to disrupt perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 9>reasonable proceedings on university </v>

1487
01:25:08.111 --> 01:25:12.700
<v Speaker 9>campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And so that,</v>

1488
01:25:12.710 --> 01:25:15.280
<v Speaker 9>so the discussions like this can </v>
<v Speaker 9>continue properly.</v>

1489
01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:16.323
<v Speaker 9>I mean there's definitely a place for </v>
<v Speaker 9>give and take and for informed </v>

1490
01:25:20.230 --> 01:25:21.520
<v Speaker 9>opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 9>let's say.</v>

1491
01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:22.653
<v Speaker 9>But there's a difference between </v>
<v Speaker 9>informed opposition and child childish </v>

1492
01:25:26.021 --> 01:25:26.854
<v Speaker 9>grand standing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I think people know the difference </v>

1493
01:25:28.391 --> 01:25:30.190
<v Speaker 9>between that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So don't,</v>

1494
01:25:30.370 --> 01:25:33.430
<v Speaker 9>don't be desperate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Why not pick your battles?</v>

1495
01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.150
<v Speaker 3>Courage goes a long way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1496
01:25:36.151 --> 01:25:38.560
<v Speaker 3>Because other people see it and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1497
01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:43.580
<v Speaker 3>there is I think a silent majority out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there that is silent and is scared.</v>

1498
01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:51.440
<v Speaker 3>But if they see courage from somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they responded to it.</v>

1499
01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:52.523
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you described lawyers in a way </v>

1500
01:25:54.571 --> 01:25:56.580
<v Speaker 3>that appealed to me once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1501
01:25:56.581 --> 01:25:58.380
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that's rare,</v>

1502
01:25:58.381 --> 01:26:01.980
<v Speaker 3>but</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said lawyers,</v>

1503
01:26:01.981 --> 01:26:04.520
<v Speaker 3>I think these are the words you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lawyers are</v>

1504
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:05.443
<v Speaker 8>difficult and emotionally stable.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And it was the combination of those two </v>

1505
01:26:10.101 --> 01:26:10.934
<v Speaker 8>things,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the willingness to be difficult but not </v>

1506
01:26:12.951 --> 01:26:15.230
<v Speaker 8>to be emotional about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So don't,</v>

1507
01:26:15.231 --> 01:26:16.011
<v Speaker 8>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>don't,</v>

1508
01:26:16.011 --> 01:26:19.310
<v Speaker 8>where'd your emotions to the fight?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Take a step back,</v>

1509
01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.500
<v Speaker 8>engage in it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Say what you think.</v>

1510
01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:24.170
<v Speaker 8>Be Courageous,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but don't get wrapped up in it.</v>

1511
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:26.870
<v Speaker 8>Don't be emotional about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But you know,</v>

1512
01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:30.350
<v Speaker 8>Rick Chain your strength for the long </v>
<v Speaker 8>haul.</v>

1513
01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:31.140
<v Speaker 8>Yup.</v>

1514
01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:31.871
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and you know,</v>

1515
01:26:31.871 --> 01:26:33.670
<v Speaker 9>one of the things I've learned </v>
<v Speaker 9>strategically,</v>

1516
01:26:33.671 --> 01:26:35.380
<v Speaker 9>and this is really worth thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 9>too,</v>

1517
01:26:35.381 --> 01:26:39.670
<v Speaker 9>is that when you're engaged in a public </v>
<v Speaker 9>dispute like this,</v>

1518
01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:42.400
<v Speaker 9>it's not obvious when things are going </v>
<v Speaker 9>your way.</v>

1519
01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:44.201
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you think,</v>

1520
01:26:44.201 --> 01:26:46.270
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this protest is not such a good thing.</v>

1521
01:26:46.271 --> 01:26:48.640
<v Speaker 9>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I wouldn't be so sure about that.</v>

1522
01:26:49.290 --> 01:26:50.123
<v Speaker 9>You know what's happened to me in the </v>
<v Speaker 9>last 18 months is that virtually every </v>

1523
01:26:53.561 --> 01:26:56.770
<v Speaker 9>time that I been attacked and some of </v>
<v Speaker 9>the attacks had been quite,</v>

1524
01:26:57.310 --> 01:27:00.370
<v Speaker 9>well I wouldn't say brutal because we </v>
<v Speaker 9>haven't got to that thank God,</v>

1525
01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:05.610
<v Speaker 9>but they've certainly been um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they've taken me aback.</v>

1526
01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:06.483
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's not,</v>

1527
01:27:06.970 --> 01:27:09.430
<v Speaker 9>it's not a straight forward thing to be </v>
<v Speaker 9>in a hall with.</v>

1528
01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.313
<v Speaker 9>And this happened at mcmaster with a </v>
<v Speaker 9>hundred people yelling at you and Larry </v>

1529
01:27:14.321 --> 01:27:19.321
<v Speaker 9>near horns and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But that wasn't a bad thing as it turned</v>

1530
01:27:19.481 --> 01:27:20.314
<v Speaker 9>out because it was filmed and it was put</v>
<v Speaker 9>on Youtube and it was terrible for the </v>

1531
01:27:25.001 --> 01:27:27.520
<v Speaker 9>people who protested,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1532
01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:28.690
<v Speaker 9>it wasn't good.</v>

1533
01:27:28.930 --> 01:27:32.290
<v Speaker 9>And so you got to detach yourself to,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1534
01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:33.173
<v Speaker 9>if,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you say what you think and you're </v>

1535
01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:34.714
<v Speaker 9>careful about it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's going to have some short term </v>

1536
01:27:36.221 --> 01:27:38.490
<v Speaker 9>effects and it's going to have some </v>
<v Speaker 9>medium term effects exit.</v>

1537
01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:39.940
<v Speaker 9>It's going to have some long term </v>
<v Speaker 9>effects.</v>

1538
01:27:39.941 --> 01:27:42.160
<v Speaker 9>And one of the things that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 9>do,</v>

1539
01:27:42.161 --> 01:27:44.050
<v Speaker 9>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and this is an element of courage,</v>

1540
01:27:44.051 --> 01:27:44.884
<v Speaker 9>is you have to have faith that the </v>
<v Speaker 9>medium to longterm consequences of you </v>

1541
01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:52.270
<v Speaker 9>saying what you have to say as clearly </v>
<v Speaker 9>as possible.</v>

1542
01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:56.440
<v Speaker 9>It's going to be positive and you have </v>
<v Speaker 9>to act on that supposition.</v>

1543
01:27:56.650 --> 01:27:57.700
<v Speaker 9>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

1544
01:27:57.730 --> 01:28:02.110
<v Speaker 9>You can't know that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 9>existential leap of faith is you.</v>

1545
01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:04.120
<v Speaker 9>You can't know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but you act anyway.</v>

1546
01:28:04.810 --> 01:28:08.290
<v Speaker 9>And my experience has been that you </v>
<v Speaker 9>don't want to,</v>

1547
01:28:08.710 --> 01:28:09.543
<v Speaker 9>you don't want to make judgment too </v>
<v Speaker 9>quickly because it's not always clear </v>

1548
01:28:11.621 --> 01:28:14.560
<v Speaker 9>when things are going your way.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So when you know,</v>

1549
01:28:14.710 --> 01:28:15.543
<v Speaker 9>you might stand up into class and say </v>
<v Speaker 9>something that people react negatively </v>

1550
01:28:18.191 --> 01:28:20.650
<v Speaker 9>to eat and you might get pilloried for </v>
<v Speaker 9>that by some people,</v>

1551
01:28:20.651 --> 01:28:21.484
<v Speaker 9>but you never know who you're touching </v>
<v Speaker 9>in the crowd and you don't know how </v>

1552
01:28:24.491 --> 01:28:26.780
<v Speaker 9>that's going to unfold across time.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now you,</v>

1553
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:27.663
<v Speaker 9>that might be a defining moment in </v>
<v Speaker 9>someone else's life to watch you stand </v>

1554
01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:30.904
<v Speaker 9>up and say what you have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So don't underestimate the power of </v>

1555
01:28:34.991 --> 01:28:37.640
<v Speaker 9>truth and courage really.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So</v>

1556
01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:43.380
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1557
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:48.350
<v Speaker 8>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they should be thankful.</v>

1558
01:28:48.351 --> 01:28:51.080
<v Speaker 8>And how civil and how peaceful you guys </v>
<v Speaker 8>are.</v>

1559
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:52.790
<v Speaker 8>They should be thankful.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They shouldn't be angry.</v>

1560
01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 8>I regret to say we probably have time </v>
<v Speaker 8>for probably</v>

1561
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.880
<v Speaker 3>just a couple of more questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's go to the back.</v>

1562
01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1563
01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:13.110
<v Speaker 3>so my question is directed at Dr. </v>
<v Speaker 3>Peterson.</v>

1564
01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.273
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been watching your lectures online </v>

1565
01:29:17.401 --> 01:29:20.540
<v Speaker 3>for a while and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talk a lot,</v>

1566
01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:21.953
<v Speaker 3>come a little closer to the mic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You speak a lot about that's better as </v>

1567
01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.240
<v Speaker 3>you speak a lot about character arc </v>
<v Speaker 3>types and a narrative and the importance</v>

1568
01:29:30.241 --> 01:29:35.241
<v Speaker 3>of the young Ian idea of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>personal narrative.</v>

1569
01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1570
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:44.520
<v Speaker 3>am having trouble formulating this into </v>
<v Speaker 3>a question,</v>

1571
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:49.320
<v Speaker 3>but I guess with the idea of archetypes </v>
<v Speaker 3>in mind,</v>

1572
01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you familiar with,</v>

1573
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:52.431
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ben,</v>

1574
01:29:52.431 --> 01:29:55.590
<v Speaker 3>we Mandel broads idea of fractal </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns?</v>

1575
01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if so,</v>

1576
01:29:58.081 --> 01:29:58.914
<v Speaker 3>what do you think and if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a connection there maybe to be </v>

1577
01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:01.854
<v Speaker 3>found?</v>

1578
01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.233
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there seems to be a metaphorical </v>

1579
01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:09.460
<v Speaker 9>connection in that the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the great is,</v>

1580
01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:10.503
<v Speaker 9>is reproduced in the small,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and that's certainly an idea that </v>

1581
01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:14.913
<v Speaker 9>permeates,</v>
<v Speaker 9>let's say religious and theological </v>

1582
01:30:17.351 --> 01:30:19.090
<v Speaker 9>speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1583
01:30:19.091 --> 01:30:24.091
<v Speaker 9>there's an idea that here's an idea that</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's like the idea of the genie,</v>

1584
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:30.180
<v Speaker 9>which is the same root word as genius.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1585
01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:34.690
<v Speaker 9>the genie is something of unimaginable </v>
<v Speaker 9>power that's constrained in a very small</v>

1586
01:30:34.691 --> 01:30:35.524
<v Speaker 9>space.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's kind of what a person is </v>

1587
01:30:37.301 --> 01:30:39.220
<v Speaker 9>like.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1588
01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:43.750
<v Speaker 9>we have this affinity,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we have this connection to the infinite,</v>

1589
01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:46.960
<v Speaker 9>we have this connection to the divine </v>
<v Speaker 9>but work,</v>

1590
01:30:46.990 --> 01:30:49.530
<v Speaker 9>but it's constrained within within our </v>
<v Speaker 9>frames,</v>

1591
01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:50.373
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>And we have to act out that the divine </v>

1592
01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.080
<v Speaker 9>narrative in the confines of our own </v>
<v Speaker 9>life.</v>

1593
01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.420
<v Speaker 9>And so there is this overarching </v>
<v Speaker 9>reality,</v>

1594
01:30:58.421 --> 01:30:59.254
<v Speaker 9>which is something like the fo the </v>
<v Speaker 9>forthright confrontation with the </v>

1595
01:31:03.341 --> 01:31:04.990
<v Speaker 9>catastrophe of life,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

1596
01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:07.420
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but that has to be made personal,</v>

1597
01:31:07.450 --> 01:31:08.221
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so that,</v>

1598
01:31:08.221 --> 01:31:11.980
<v Speaker 9>that's one of the things I would say </v>
<v Speaker 9>deepest ideas is that the archetipal has</v>

1599
01:31:11.981 --> 01:31:14.110
<v Speaker 9>to be be made personally in your own </v>
<v Speaker 9>life.</v>

1600
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:17.980
<v Speaker 9>And so you take the generic pattern and </v>
<v Speaker 9>you personalize it,</v>

1601
01:31:17.981 --> 01:31:20.410
<v Speaker 9>and then the infinite and the finite </v>
<v Speaker 9>meat.</v>

1602
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:24.190
<v Speaker 9>And that's the perfect combination.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And there's something about that that's,</v>

1603
01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:27.860
<v Speaker 9>well unalterably profiled I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>

1604
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:30.970
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and as true as anything can be,</v>

1605
01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:32.193
<v Speaker 9>and I think people know this at the very</v>
<v Speaker 9>deep level because you do know when </v>

1606
01:31:36.041 --> 01:31:36.874
<v Speaker 9>you're struggling to go to sleep at </v>
<v Speaker 9>night and your conscience is bothering </v>

1607
01:31:38.951 --> 01:31:41.800
<v Speaker 9>you and you think through the things </v>
<v Speaker 9>that you did in the day,</v>

1608
01:31:41.801 --> 01:31:42.634
<v Speaker 9>in the week,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you'll take solace in the things that </v>

1609
01:31:43.871 --> 01:31:46.360
<v Speaker 9>you did that were noble and true and </v>
<v Speaker 9>you,</v>

1610
01:31:46.361 --> 01:31:47.194
<v Speaker 9>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can breathe a sigh of relief that </v>

1611
01:31:49.241 --> 01:31:52.810
<v Speaker 9>you're not completely corrupt and lost </v>
<v Speaker 9>and then you can sleep.</v>

1612
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:55.480
<v Speaker 9>It's like everyone knows this.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

1613
01:31:55.481 --> 01:31:57.400
<v Speaker 9>we need to know it consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

1614
01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:01.900
<v Speaker 9>And that's part of the process of the </v>
<v Speaker 9>archetipal personal and that that's part</v>

1615
01:32:01.901 --> 01:32:04.420
<v Speaker 9>of what the religious process is </v>
<v Speaker 9>supposed to be about,</v>

1616
01:32:04.421 --> 01:32:08.140
<v Speaker 9>is to outline the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the archetipal pattern and then to say,</v>

1617
01:32:08.141 --> 01:32:09.670
<v Speaker 9>look,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you have to meditate on this.</v>

1618
01:32:09.671 --> 01:32:10.504
<v Speaker 9>And you have to figure out how to make </v>
<v Speaker 9>it true in the confines of your own </v>

1619
01:32:13.121 --> 01:32:15.230
<v Speaker 9>life.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that gives,</v>

1620
01:32:15.370 --> 01:32:18.760
<v Speaker 9>see the reason that works,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think is because there's no doubt that</v>

1621
01:32:18.761 --> 01:32:19.594
<v Speaker 9>your life is tragic and there's no doubt</v>
<v Speaker 9>that you have a bilevel and element and </v>

1622
01:32:22.961 --> 01:32:25.840
<v Speaker 9>that you'll be touched by betrayal and </v>
<v Speaker 9>all those terrible things.</v>

1623
01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.370
<v Speaker 9>But there's a nobility about youtue.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that nobility might be sufficient to</v>

1624
01:32:30.371 --> 01:32:31.204
<v Speaker 9>transcend your limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I would say that your life is a </v>

1625
01:32:33.941 --> 01:32:36.580
<v Speaker 9>struggle to determine if that might be </v>
<v Speaker 9>the case.</v>

1626
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:37.623
<v Speaker 9>And that's the act of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But I also do believe I was asked today </v>

1627
01:32:40.901 --> 01:32:41.734
<v Speaker 9>by South African journalist if I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 9>ultimate pessimist are the ultimate </v>

1628
01:32:45.221 --> 01:32:46.740
<v Speaker 9>optimist.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And No,</v>

1629
01:32:46.741 --> 01:32:49.330
<v Speaker 9>and I would say in some ways I am the </v>
<v Speaker 9>ultimate pessimist.</v>

1630
01:32:49.331 --> 01:32:54.130
<v Speaker 9>I know I think as much as I can tolerate</v>
<v Speaker 9>how terrible life can be,</v>

1631
01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:55.293
<v Speaker 9>but I do believe that the human spirit </v>
<v Speaker 9>can overcome that catastrophe and can </v>

1632
01:32:58.451 --> 01:32:59.284
<v Speaker 9>rise out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I think the universities are that </v>

1633
01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:10.200
<v Speaker 9>that idea expressed in stone and </v>
<v Speaker 9>tradition and it's a great idea.</v>

1634
01:33:10.301 --> 01:33:13.420
<v Speaker 9>Everyone needs the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 9>especially people who are young,</v>

1635
01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:14.254
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>your life is it know that your life is </v>

1636
01:33:15.521 --> 01:33:18.700
<v Speaker 9>going to be difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like no one can say,</v>

1637
01:33:18.701 --> 01:33:19.870
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's going to be easy.</v>

1638
01:33:19.871 --> 01:33:20.770
<v Speaker 9>But you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1639
01:33:20.771 --> 01:33:24.070
<v Speaker 9>do you want it to be easy?</v>
<v Speaker 9>What's in it for you?</v>

1640
01:33:24.071 --> 01:33:25.840
<v Speaker 9>If it's easy,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1641
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:26.703
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you want it to be difficult and </v>

1642
01:33:27.581 --> 01:33:31.780
<v Speaker 9>worthwhile and you want to be the sort </v>
<v Speaker 9>of person that can manage that.</v>

1643
01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:32.853
<v Speaker 9>And that's what you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's what you should be encouraged to </v>

1644
01:33:35.081 --> 01:33:37.300
<v Speaker 9>be at university.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>

1645
01:33:37.301 --> 01:33:39.790
<v Speaker 9>and that's what the universities are </v>
<v Speaker 9>for.</v>

1646
01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:42.430
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1647
01:33:42.431 --> 01:33:44.680
<v Speaker 9>that's the archetipal and the person who</v>
<v Speaker 9>I would say.</v>

1648
01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.630
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Thank you very much.</v>

1649
01:33:47.130 --> 01:33:52.130
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1650
01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.880
<v Speaker 10>we'll have to be our last question.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Go ahead,</v>

1651
01:33:55.881 --> 01:33:58.580
<v Speaker 10>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 10>In recent time,</v>

1652
01:33:58.880 --> 01:33:59.713
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I would probably identify the most </v>

1653
01:34:01.011 --> 01:34:03.590
<v Speaker 10>recent us election as the turning point </v>
<v Speaker 10>for this.</v>

1654
01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.080
<v Speaker 10>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I've seen that as an American citizen,</v>

1655
01:34:06.081 --> 01:34:08.180
<v Speaker 10>this is my first time living in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

1656
01:34:08.670 --> 01:34:13.640
<v Speaker 10>I've noticed that public discourse has </v>
<v Speaker 10>taken to elevate fascism as the ultimate</v>

1657
01:34:13.641 --> 01:34:15.650
<v Speaker 10>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and maybe rightfully so.</v>

1658
01:34:15.651 --> 01:34:16.484
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there were many horrific things commit </v>

1659
01:34:17.370 --> 01:34:20.630
<v Speaker 10>by fascist states in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and you see people,</v>

1660
01:34:20.631 --> 01:34:22.400
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like facebook cover photos,</v>

1661
01:34:22.401 --> 01:34:23.820
<v Speaker 10>like bash the fast,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you see,</v>

1662
01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.810
<v Speaker 10>let stickers on laptops.</v>
<v Speaker 10>This machine kills fascists.</v>

1663
01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:27.801
<v Speaker 10>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1664
01:34:27.801 --> 01:34:31.730
<v Speaker 10>there's this big backlash against </v>
<v Speaker 10>fascism and the horrors that it caused,</v>

1665
01:34:32.210 --> 01:34:33.043
<v Speaker 10>but in spite of that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you don't see the same reaction to the </v>

1666
01:34:36.141 --> 01:34:40.970
<v Speaker 10>horrors and the genocide that were </v>
<v Speaker 10>caused by socialist and Communist states</v>

1667
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:41.833
<v Speaker 10>in the 20th century.</v>

1668
01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:43.553
<v Speaker 1>Do not.</v>

1669
01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.313
<v Speaker 10>You see people who virtue signal </v>
<v Speaker 10>endlessly about how horrible the </v>

1670
01:34:53.161 --> 01:34:55.830
<v Speaker 10>Holocaust was,</v>
<v Speaker 10>about how awful these things were.</v>

1671
01:34:55.890 --> 01:34:59.240
<v Speaker 10>And then just hand away the famine,</v>
<v Speaker 10>genocide of the Ukraine,</v>

1672
01:34:59.270 --> 01:35:00.103
<v Speaker 10>the great leap forward.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They think these things are </v>

1673
01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:02.413
<v Speaker 10>inconsequential or even necessary </v>
<v Speaker 10>sacrifices for the rise of the greater </v>

1674
01:35:06.741 --> 01:35:07.574
<v Speaker 10>good of socialism or communism.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And I personally find that morally </v>

1675
01:35:11.601 --> 01:35:14.510
<v Speaker 10>reprehensible and I can't understand </v>
<v Speaker 10>where that,</v>

1676
01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:15.613
<v Speaker 10>where that comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 10>how you can stand there and be so </v>

1677
01:35:17.301 --> 01:35:18.134
<v Speaker 10>opposed to this genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What say that this genocide is somehow </v>

1678
01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:23.091
<v Speaker 10>just,</v>
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>

1679
01:35:23.091 --> 01:35:25.610
<v Speaker 10>it's not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And why do you think that?</v>

1680
01:35:25.611 --> 01:35:27.470
<v Speaker 10>How do you think that disconnect </v>
<v Speaker 10>happens?</v>

1681
01:35:27.471 --> 01:35:28.304
<v Speaker 10>How do you think people can convince </v>
<v Speaker 10>themselves of that and why do you think </v>

1682
01:35:31.611 --> 01:35:32.444
<v Speaker 10>that happens?</v>

1683
01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.310
<v Speaker 9>It's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's a great question.</v>

1684
01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:36.860
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1685
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:38.600
<v Speaker 9>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 9>my house is covered with,</v>

1686
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:44.110
<v Speaker 9>with art from the Soviet era,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I have a road of reasons for that.</v>

1687
01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:46.550
<v Speaker 9>Part of it is to remind me of what </v>
<v Speaker 9>happened.</v>

1688
01:35:46.551 --> 01:35:47.384
<v Speaker 9>Part of it is to watch the struggle </v>
<v Speaker 9>between the art and the propaganda on </v>

1689
01:35:50.271 --> 01:35:52.220
<v Speaker 9>the canvasses sort of in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1690
01:35:52.221 --> 01:35:56.150
<v Speaker 9>I'm very interested in that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I would never decorate my house with</v>

1691
01:35:56.151 --> 01:35:58.790
<v Speaker 9>Nazi Regalia,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1692
01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:00.770
<v Speaker 9>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1693
01:36:00.771 --> 01:36:02.450
<v Speaker 9>why is that exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's not like,</v>

1694
01:36:02.451 --> 01:36:03.284
<v Speaker 9>I don't know that that what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 9>the communist regimes was utterly </v>

1695
01:36:05.601 --> 01:36:06.860
<v Speaker 9>reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Why is it,</v>

1696
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:09.170
<v Speaker 9>and perhaps it's not acceptable to have,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1697
01:36:09.171 --> 01:36:11.180
<v Speaker 9>socialist realist paintings in your </v>
<v Speaker 9>house,</v>

1698
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:12.103
<v Speaker 9>but it's certainly more acceptable or it</v>
<v Speaker 9>seems that way than to have paintings </v>

1699
01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.760
<v Speaker 9>from the Nazi era,</v>
<v Speaker 9>let's say.</v>

1700
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:18.111
<v Speaker 9>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

1701
01:36:18.111 --> 01:36:19.340
<v Speaker 9>why is that exactly?</v>

1702
01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:21.890
<v Speaker 9>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1703
01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.830
<v Speaker 9>back in 1918 at the dawn of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 9>revolution,</v>

1704
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.903
<v Speaker 9>when Europe was inflamed and in ruins </v>
<v Speaker 9>and the monarchical societies were </v>

1705
01:36:28.731 --> 01:36:29.564
<v Speaker 9>collapsing and the industrial revolution</v>
<v Speaker 9>was in full force and there were </v>

1706
01:36:32.511 --> 01:36:33.344
<v Speaker 9>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there was terrible poverty and terrible </v>

1707
01:36:34.731 --> 01:36:38.270
<v Speaker 9>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The dream of Universal Brotherhood was a</v>

1708
01:36:38.271 --> 01:36:41.400
<v Speaker 9>compelling dream,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the dream of egalitarianism and,</v>

1709
01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:42.620
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>

1710
01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:43.753
<v Speaker 9>and maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 9>maybe who knows how much of it was </v>

1711
01:36:45.531 --> 01:36:48.590
<v Speaker 9>motivated by genuine benevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Some,</v>

1712
01:36:48.591 --> 01:36:51.800
<v Speaker 9>at least it's very difficult to see that</v>
<v Speaker 9>the Nazi,</v>

1713
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:56.570
<v Speaker 9>the Nazi phenomenon was ever generated </v>
<v Speaker 9>by any genuine benevolence.</v>

1714
01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.820
<v Speaker 9>That's very difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 9>to make a case for.</v>

1715
01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:01.960
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so maybe you can forgive the,</v>

1716
01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:03.053
<v Speaker 9>the socialists,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the communists utopians a hundred years </v>

1717
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:07.250
<v Speaker 9>ago because they didn't know what they </v>
<v Speaker 9>were getting in for.</v>

1718
01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.720
<v Speaker 9>People had warned them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Dostoyevsky warn the neat,</v>

1719
01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:10.760
<v Speaker 9>neat.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You warn them but,</v>

1720
01:37:11.150 --> 01:37:11.983
<v Speaker 9>but still,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and then the other thing too is the </v>

1721
01:37:13.551 --> 01:37:14.810
<v Speaker 9>problem of inequality.</v>

1722
01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:18.830
<v Speaker 9>It's like the problem of inequality is a</v>
<v Speaker 9>real problem and it doesn't go away.</v>

1723
01:37:18.831 --> 01:37:21.770
<v Speaker 9>Like it's very difficult when you walk </v>
<v Speaker 9>down bloor street for example,</v>

1724
01:37:21.771 --> 01:37:22.604
<v Speaker 9>in Toronto and you see homeless people,</v>
<v Speaker 9>alcoholics and drug addicts who are </v>

1725
01:37:25.191 --> 01:37:26.024
<v Speaker 9>struggling and the mentally ill who are </v>
<v Speaker 9>on the street and they're in their </v>

1726
01:37:28.431 --> 01:37:29.780
<v Speaker 9>little domain of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's,</v>

1727
01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:33.080
<v Speaker 9>it's really difficult for that to not </v>
<v Speaker 9>tear at your heart strings and say,</v>

1728
01:37:33.081 --> 01:37:33.914
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>isn't the world and unjust place or an </v>

1729
01:37:35.121 --> 01:37:36.320
<v Speaker 9>unfair place,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which it is.</v>

1730
01:37:36.321 --> 01:37:41.321
<v Speaker 9>And so you can see the never ending </v>
<v Speaker 9>wellsprings of motivation to support the</v>

1731
01:37:42.261 --> 01:37:46.610
<v Speaker 9>oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I think the fact that the communist,</v>

1732
01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:47.473
<v Speaker 9>the communist dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 9>at least had that as part of its </v>

1733
01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:54.860
<v Speaker 9>initiating ethos is partly what seems to</v>
<v Speaker 9>make it forgivable.</v>

1734
01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:56.550
<v Speaker 9>I also think it's easier</v>

1735
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:59.970
<v Speaker 7>for people to identify why fascism is </v>
<v Speaker 7>wrong.</v>

1736
01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:01.440
<v Speaker 7>We can say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

1737
01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:04.280
<v Speaker 7>racial superiority,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nope.</v>

1738
01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:05.790
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's pretty simple,</v>

1739
01:38:05.791 --> 01:38:07.020
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's three words.</v>

1740
01:38:07.021 --> 01:38:08.040
<v Speaker 7>You can really get it,</v>

1741
01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:12.740
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1742
01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:15.200
<v Speaker 1>but equality of outcome,</v>

1743
01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:19.620
<v Speaker 7>it's like that's really wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's really wrong.</v>

1744
01:38:19.770 --> 01:38:22.080
<v Speaker 7>But it's not so obvious why,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1745
01:38:22.081 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 7>It isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't just say quality of outcome,</v>

1746
01:38:24.901 --> 01:38:28.800
<v Speaker 7>know and have everyone clap because it </v>
<v Speaker 7>isn't as well.</v>

1747
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:30.990
<v Speaker 7>And that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's really difficult to,</v>

1748
01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:31.973
<v Speaker 7>it's difficult to isolate the </v>
<v Speaker 7>pathological elements in radical left </v>

1749
01:38:35.521 --> 01:38:38.940
<v Speaker 7>wing thought because they're not self </v>
<v Speaker 7>evidently pathological.</v>

1750
01:38:38.941 --> 01:38:41.630
<v Speaker 7>Like there's this old cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1751
01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:45.270
<v Speaker 7>from each according to his ability to </v>
<v Speaker 7>each according to his need.</v>

1752
01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:46.560
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1753
01:38:46.561 --> 01:38:48.390
<v Speaker 7>that sounds pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have needs.</v>

1754
01:38:48.391 --> 01:38:50.730
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's have them fulfilled and well,</v>

1755
01:38:50.731 --> 01:38:51.810
<v Speaker 7>you have an ability,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1756
01:38:51.811 --> 01:38:53.850
<v Speaker 7>like manifested.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1757
01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.100
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't work in practice.</v>

1758
01:38:56.210 --> 01:38:57.043
<v Speaker 7>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's murderous in practice and it's a </v>

1759
01:38:58.741 --> 01:39:01.830
<v Speaker 7>great catastrophe in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's murderous in practice.</v>

1760
01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:03.960
<v Speaker 7>So I just think it's maybe part of it </v>
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>

1761
01:39:03.961 --> 01:39:07.110
<v Speaker 7>it's just a hell of a lot harder to </v>
<v Speaker 7>learn why it's wrong.</v>

1762
01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:08.670
<v Speaker 7>That combined with,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1763
01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:11.910
<v Speaker 7>the genuine outpouring of compassion for</v>
<v Speaker 7>the oppressed and,</v>

1764
01:39:12.330 --> 01:39:16.830
<v Speaker 7>and which is like who's for poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no one.</v>

1765
01:39:16.831 --> 01:39:17.311
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1766
01:39:17.311 --> 01:39:21.210
<v Speaker 7>and inequality is a painful reality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's painful for everyone.</v>

1767
01:39:21.970 --> 01:39:24.120
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even people who are self righteous about</v>

1768
01:39:24.121 --> 01:39:25.290
<v Speaker 7>their,</v>
<v Speaker 7>their status,</v>

1769
01:39:25.291 --> 01:39:27.690
<v Speaker 7>let's say in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the depths of their soul,</v>

1770
01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:32.400
<v Speaker 7>the struggling of the fact of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>struggling still rips at them.</v>

1771
01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:34.590
<v Speaker 7>And so</v>

1772
01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:38.090
<v Speaker 7>it's a more difficult lesson for us to </v>
<v Speaker 7>learn.</v>

1773
01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:40.100
<v Speaker 7>So.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 3>had the time.</v>

1777
01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:02.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we must call this to a close.</v>

1778
01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:04.280
<v Speaker 3>I would like to</v>

<v Speaker 9>Hold on.</v>

1800
01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.193
<v Speaker 9>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I would very much like to stay and talk </v>

<v Speaker 9>with a bunch of you and I generally do </v>
<v Speaker 9>that,</v>

1802
01:41:46.161 --> 01:41:46.994
<v Speaker 9>but I can't do it today because I have </v>
<v Speaker 9>to go back to Toronto and I'm going to </v>

1803
01:41:50.181 --> 01:41:52.340
<v Speaker 9>Australia tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so I don't,</v>

1804
01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.500
<v Speaker 9>I can't do that even though I would like</v>
<v Speaker 9>to,</v>

1805
01:41:54.501 --> 01:41:58.130
<v Speaker 9>so I have to run off and then I have to </v>
<v Speaker 9>drive back to Toronto.</v>

<v Speaker 9>But despite that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>thank you very much for coming and for </v>

1807
01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:03.680
<v Speaker 9>being patient and all of that.</v>

1808
01:42:04.090 --> 01:42:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1809
01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:49.723
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

1810
01:43:53.670 --> 01:43:58.670
<v Speaker 12>Shame on Queens.</v>
<v Speaker 12>No freedom for hate speech.</v>

1811
01:43:59.570 --> 01:44:01.990
<v Speaker 12>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Really,</v>

1812
01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:06.633
<v Speaker 13>really chosen where I'm at with it.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And I've been looking at his voice and </v>

1813
01:44:08.431 --> 01:44:10.420
<v Speaker 13>we're looking at the protest points.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I'm not really sure.</v>

1814
01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:11.553
<v Speaker 13>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I just think it's interesting that he's </v>

1815
01:44:12.370 --> 01:44:14.370
<v Speaker 13>drawing the sort of crowd and that,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

1816
01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:17.020
<v Speaker 13>what's happening here is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 13>I think that really says something about</v>

1817
01:44:17.021 --> 01:44:19.780
<v Speaker 13>participation at Queens.</v>
<v Speaker 13>We're here to protest,</v>

1818
01:44:20.050 --> 01:44:20.980
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>Jordan Peterson,</v>

01:44:20.981 --> 01:44:23.260
<v Speaker 13>dean given,</v>
<v Speaker 13>given a platform at Cuny University,</v>

1820
01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:25.120
<v Speaker 13>um,</v>
<v Speaker 13>Jordan Peterson,</v>

1821
01:44:25.150 --> 01:44:27.280
<v Speaker 13>aside from not knowing what he's talking</v>
<v Speaker 13>about,</v>

1822
01:44:27.281 --> 01:44:28.114
<v Speaker 13>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 13>a la pierce intention type featured by </v>

1823
01:44:30.371 --> 01:44:33.640
<v Speaker 13>everything grow.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's not a discussion about which topics</v>

1824
01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:34.493
<v Speaker 13>do you like on pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 13>It's a discussion about which people </v>

1825
01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:37.503
<v Speaker 13>should be considered,</v>
<v Speaker 13>which you lose your respect and that's </v>

1826
01:44:39.551 --> 01:44:41.020
<v Speaker 13>not a debate,</v>
<v Speaker 13>but you happen anywhere.</v>

1827
01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:49.930
<v Speaker 13>I love that they are here.</v>
<v Speaker 13>How did this course,</v>

1828
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:51.910
<v Speaker 13>because Lillian,</v>
<v Speaker 13>they don't agree with what he has to say</v>

1829
01:44:51.911 --> 01:44:53.630
<v Speaker 13>so they're showing it.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But uh,</v>

1830
01:44:53.650 --> 01:44:57.520
<v Speaker 13>I have seen a lot of people call to </v>
<v Speaker 13>cancel.</v>

1831
01:44:57.850 --> 01:44:58.683
<v Speaker 13>They are showing the Daniel Walsh should</v>
<v Speaker 13>be ashamed of himself for allowing this </v>

1832
01:45:01.301 --> 01:45:03.460
<v Speaker 13>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And that I just think is wrong.</v>

1833
