1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.823
<v Speaker 1>So in the first lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already told you guys a little bit </v>

2
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:05.544
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

3
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.043
<v Speaker 1>about this figure and I mentioned that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of being swallowed up by a </v>

4
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:24.504
<v Speaker 1>beast of some sort and then cast back up</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very ancient and archetipal idea </v>

5
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>and an architectural idea you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of as an instinctive idea.</v>

6
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an idea of Carl Jung by the way,</v>

7
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:38.994
<v Speaker 1>although it had its precursor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is another intellectual systems of </v>

8
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.124
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think of an archetype as an </v>

9
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>idea that you can understand without </v>
<v Speaker 1>being predisposed to it.</v>

10
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.993
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now blank slate models of human </v>

11
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:56.604
<v Speaker 1>cognition assumed that all of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge comes from our sensory </v>

12
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But first of all,</v>

13
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>there are very many problems with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blank slate model.</v>

14
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blank slate models are just wrong.</v>

15
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were useful conceptual structures a</v>

17
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.993
<v Speaker 1>couple of hundred years ago and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were situations where they could be </v>

18
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 1>applied in part to</v>
<v Speaker 1>two systems of thought,</v>

19
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>behaviorism.</v>

21
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.983
<v Speaker 1>But fundamentally we know perfectly well</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the human being is not a blank </v>

22
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:31.104
<v Speaker 1>slate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we also know that you couldn't be a </v>

23
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>blank slate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that there is</v>

24
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:36.594
<v Speaker 1>so much information so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding you and making up your </v>

25
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:45.921
<v Speaker 1>experience that without some a priori </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures to handle that experience for</v>

26
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>you and present it to your consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

27
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.763
<v Speaker 1>in a pre structured manner and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not a chance that you could ever </v>

28
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 1>make sense out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So plus we also know,</v>

29
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.913
<v Speaker 1>you know that your biology and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurobiology is very much similar to </v>

30
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>that of all life on earth really for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that matter,</v>

31
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:11.130
<v Speaker 1>but extraordinarily similar to that of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammals.</v>

32
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>And we know things for example that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite interesting like</v>

33
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.073
<v Speaker 1>the systems that make up the deepest </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of your brains and partly the part </v>

34
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>say that keep track of things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>

35
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.613
<v Speaker 1>Hierarchies are hundreds of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old and you share structure and </v>

36
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:28.794
<v Speaker 1>function of those neurosis neuro </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological elements with animals as </v>

37
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 1>distinct from us crustaceans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

38
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:38.094
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crustaceans use the serotonin system to </v>

39
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>keep track of their dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>

40
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.243
<v Speaker 1>And you do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And drugs that work on people for </v>

41
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:47.694
<v Speaker 1>dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy related disorders like </v>

42
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:53.360
<v Speaker 1>depression also work on lobsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

43
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a lobster,</v>

44
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.863
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a friend of yours and it's </v>

45
00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:58.464
<v Speaker 1>feeling depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you could recommend that it uses </v>

46
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll make it,</v>

47
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy stretched out,</v>

48
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.520
<v Speaker 1>sort of confident lobster instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunched up and insecure lobster.</v>

50
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:13.970
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm telling you that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is pretty comical.</v>

51
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason I'm telling you that is </v>

52
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>because it indicates something of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous importance,</v>

53
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:19.564
<v Speaker 1>which is that you are one old thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are elements of your structure </v>

54
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>that are importantly hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years old.</v>

56
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And they structured the way that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world appears to you.</v>

57
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.343
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>
<v Speaker 1>an article tipple idea in some sense is </v>

58
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:37.204
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an idea that you can understand </v>

59
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>because you're a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

60
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>if you think about this even for a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments,</v>

61
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>you can understand how this might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>if someone comes up to you and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm angry today,</v>

63
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>especially if you've been conversing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them for some time,</v>

64
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>it isn't generally necessary for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>

65
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>well what do you mean angry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might ask,</v>

66
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:02.194
<v Speaker 1>well why are you angry or what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because the person who's making the </v>

67
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>statement has a nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your nervous system,</v>

68
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.013
<v Speaker 1>you can both mutually assume that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>understood and experienced the emotion </v>

69
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>of anger and stow instead of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe what that's like.</v>

70
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 1>You can just describe the particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations that elicited it.</v>

71
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.093
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of evidence for basic </v>

72
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the list of basic emotions varies</v>

73
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>from thinker to thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they congregate around a pretty</v>

74
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:32.704
<v Speaker 1>definable sat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that they differ </v>

75
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>at all is because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

76
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious how you distinguish an </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion from a motivational system.</v>

77
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's not even obvious that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>the class of emotion is a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

79
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 1>But there are certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

80
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>subjective phenomena that emerge as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the active activity,</v>

81
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>a fundamental brain systems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone shares.</v>

82
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.950
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 1>people understand what fear means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People understand what pain means,</v>

84
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration.</v>

85
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 1>People understand what surprise means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They understand joy.</v>

86
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they understand,</v>

87
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:11.854
<v Speaker 1>discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I hit most of the major ones </v>

88
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:14.890
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>

89
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other systems that don't look so</v>

90
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>emotion like that are maybe more </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>

91
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:21.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hunger and thirst and,</v>

92
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.133
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable hate and uncomfortable </v>

93
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>coldness that people also understand.</v>

94
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.693
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you understand that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are a certain way and you </v>

95
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>are a certain way because for the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason you have two legs,</v>

96
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.310
<v Speaker 1>most of you and two arms and two eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that,</v>

97
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:37.144
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

98
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 1>you don't just spring out of the void as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a completely unstructured organism.</v>

99
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.333
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to say exactly what </v>

100
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:45.904
<v Speaker 1>elements of human experience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and cognition and thought and </v>

101
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:50.704
<v Speaker 1>all that are inbuilt precisely because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're also quite modifiable from a </v>

102
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>cultural perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.273
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's structured plus the capacity for </v>

104
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>tremendous modification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

105
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard to exactly say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how much is structured and how much</v>

106
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.014
<v Speaker 1>is modification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly the reason it's hard to say </v>

107
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>that is because it depends on how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort you put into the modification,</v>

108
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more effort,</v>

109
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>the more modification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But having said all that,</v>

110
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.743
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we're similar in a priori </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure is actually one of the </v>

111
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>preconditions that allows us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with one another.</v>

112
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>So there was a thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Harvard thinker named Eel Wilson.</v>

113
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Some of you may be familiar with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

114
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a famous biologist and he basically</v>

115
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 1>studies ants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

116
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.031
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:06:34.031 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>ants answer very complicated and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>very successful.</v>

118
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>There are more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are more ants by weight than there</v>

119
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:41.084
<v Speaker 1>are people on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though they're not necessarily </v>

120
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 1>concerned with overpopulation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental degradation,</v>

121
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>there are in fact more ants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

122
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things he will Wilson </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out was that,</v>

123
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if we could talk to ants,</v>

124
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have anything to say to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

125
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.313
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because ants </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned themselves with things that </v>

126
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 1>human beings have no intrinsic interest </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

127
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>So their fundamental value structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

128
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.153
<v Speaker 1>is so different from our value structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there wouldn't be anything to talk </v>

129
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you talk about with your friends</v>

130
00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 1>and with your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk about shared human experiences,</v>

131
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 1>you talk about variation in shared human</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

132
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 1>and you just take for granted that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shared element of that exists.</v>

133
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.263
<v Speaker 1>And so you can think of the shared </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of human experiences </v>

134
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 1>architectural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might think,</v>

135
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:31.334
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the shared human experiences </v>

136
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:34.004
<v Speaker 1>architect will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we share an underlying biology </v>

137
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:40.190
<v Speaker 1>and also to some degree of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's this weird,</v>

138
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what no man's land in some sense between</v>

139
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:44.294
<v Speaker 1>the biological system per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the system of subjective experience </v>

140
00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:48.434
<v Speaker 1>and ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say that the biological </v>

141
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:56.471
<v Speaker 1>systems or ideational to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine if you get angry,</v>

142
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.883
<v Speaker 1>you think angry thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is the system </v>

143
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:03.890
<v Speaker 1>that mediates aggression is also capable</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking.</v>

144
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 1>It thinks in abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a,</v>

145
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.033
<v Speaker 1>there's some relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological function which prepares your </v>

146
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:15.281
<v Speaker 1>perception and your body for action and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your capacity for abstract thought.</v>

147
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.343
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system that produces anger in some </v>

148
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 1>sense thinks within you.</v>

149
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.133
<v Speaker 1>It's really more accurate way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it because as you all </v>

150
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've become particular angry during</v>

151
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:27.500
<v Speaker 1>an argument or a discussion with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

152
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>you may say things that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you are,</v>

153
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 1>comes to regret very soon after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

154
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>And so it's as if in some sense the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is speaking within you.</v>

155
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.503
<v Speaker 1>And if you start to think that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also develop much more </v>

156
00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:42.164
<v Speaker 1>understanding right away of what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts were about when they </v>

157
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 1>started to talk about unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>

158
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 1>So you could say [inaudible] this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>realistic way of thinking about it.</v>

159
00:08:50.751 --> 00:08:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Is that what the psychoanalysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

160
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 1>identified as unconscious process is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense where the thought patterns in</v>

161
00:08:58.950 --> 00:08:59.783
<v Speaker 1>word and image and sometimes in behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well of fundamental biological </v>

162
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:05.514
<v Speaker 1>systems working within you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even someone like Freud for </v>

163
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 1>example would say approximately look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.333
<v Speaker 1>you're a relatively loose collection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat integrated biological </v>

165
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:23.871
<v Speaker 1>subsistence and each of them posits a </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal that's worth attaining.</v>

166
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.133
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that many of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>goals exist in contradiction to one </v>

167
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:28.704
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your problem as an organism is to </v>

168
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.333
<v Speaker 1>unite those diverse biological goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the ID for example </v>

169
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:37.704
<v Speaker 1>from a [inaudible] perspective to unite </v>
<v Speaker 1>them into something that's relatively </v>

170
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:43.920
<v Speaker 1>coherent and non internally </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictory.</v>

171
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:44.993
<v Speaker 1>And then also to express that union in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the social sphere where hundreds of </v>

172
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.413
<v Speaker 1>thousands of other creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less like you are trying to do </v>

173
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:56.070
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tricky balancing act.</v>

174
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these,</v>

175
00:09:57.691 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 1>these systems inside of you so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are informing you constantly.</v>

176
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:02.933
<v Speaker 1>And some of that they do with direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological sensation because there </v>

177
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:07.344
<v Speaker 1>are generally sensations that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated say with motivational states </v>

178
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.660
<v Speaker 1>or with emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

179
00:10:12.661 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 1>and we kind of think of those as </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings,</v>

180
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

181
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are ideas that are associated with</v>

182
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 1>the two and some of those ideas are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're often fantasies.</v>

183
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.833
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out that the interest that </v>

184
00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:29.604
<v Speaker 1>women have in sexual behavior is </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent to some degree on their blood </v>

185
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:34.554
<v Speaker 1>levels of testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that varies across the menstrual </v>

186
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:37.614
<v Speaker 1>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so women tend to be most interested </v>

187
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:42.960
<v Speaker 1>in sexual activity when their fertility </v>
<v Speaker 1>is at a peak,</v>

188
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 1>which is just after they offer late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

189
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.223
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't look like testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces an increase in sexual behavior </v>

190
00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 1>in a causal sort of manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a drive.</v>

191
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.023
<v Speaker 1>What seems to happen is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone produces an increase in </v>

192
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.140
<v Speaker 1>sexual fantasy and the fantasy produces </v>
<v Speaker 1>the impetus for the action.</v>

193
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 1>So that's a very interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it,</v>

194
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:06.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what happens in some senses that</v>

195
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.253
<v Speaker 1>the biological system that's underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual desire sets up a world in </v>

196
00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:12.894
<v Speaker 1>imagination that is more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contain images of sexual gratification </v>

197
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.440
<v Speaker 1>and the organism so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follows in its wake.</v>

198
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.710
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see this.</v>

199
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.680
<v Speaker 1>If you pay attention to the structure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own imagination,</v>

200
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 1>you can see this sort of thing happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

201
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

202
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:29.663
<v Speaker 1>if you're in an argument with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example and they humiliate you or </v>

203
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:35.160
<v Speaker 1>put you down and that produces feelings </v>
<v Speaker 1>of resentment.</v>

204
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>If you watch your imagination like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be quite conscious and it might be</v>

205
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 1>quite fleeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that fantasies of revenge for</v>

206
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:43.554
<v Speaker 1>example in different scenarios of </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge play out in the landscape of </v>

207
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 1>your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

208
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:50.860
<v Speaker 1>and when you're hungry you're studying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way in me,</v>

209
00:11:50.861 --> 00:11:51.694
<v Speaker 1>you're concentrating on something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your blood sugar level falls </v>

210
00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:55.144
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your hypothalamus notes that maybe </v>

211
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 1>it's time for a few calories and so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to pop up,</v>

212
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an alternative sit,</v>

213
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.630
<v Speaker 1>a sequence of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.493
<v Speaker 1>it's like well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's time for a pizza and you </v>

215
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:06.754
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about a pizza and it's got </v>

216
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 1>some mushrooms on.</v>

217
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 1>It may be if you happen to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and you know,</v>

218
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:11.323
<v Speaker 1>sooner or later the fantasy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the hunger becomes </v>

219
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently demanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently likely to take up the space</v>

220
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:20.554
<v Speaker 1>inside your subjective experience that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll switch activities from what </v>

221
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 1>you're studying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're not that interested</v>

222
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

223
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.743
<v Speaker 1>you'll switch activities so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue the new goal that's been put </v>

224
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:32.800
<v Speaker 1>forth as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

225
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 1>as a possibility by the action of one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these underlying biological systems.</v>

226
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things that Freud </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposed,</v>

227
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.800
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting idea,</v>

228
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:46.801
<v Speaker 1>is that if you interfere with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity of one of these systems,</v>

229
00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:52.060
<v Speaker 1>especially the more troublesome systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>like sexual desire and aggression,</v>

230
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:52.894
<v Speaker 1>and those are troublesome because in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense they're the most social of </v>

231
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.310
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

232
00:12:57.311 --> 00:12:58.144
<v Speaker 1>Because generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least sometimes you need a partner </v>

233
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:02.140
<v Speaker 1>for sexual activity.</v>

234
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Although that seems to be less frequent </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it used to be in the past.</v>

235
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.160
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anger is something that also is very</v>

236
00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:12.520
<v Speaker 1>socially disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of Freud's claims was it's,</v>

237
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.513
<v Speaker 1>it's particularly difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals to integrate sexual desire </v>

238
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.873
<v Speaker 1>and aggression into their personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and into the social world because those </v>

239
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:24.723
<v Speaker 1>emotions are either socially disruptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>or require a tremendous degree of </v>

240
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.560
<v Speaker 1>cooperation from someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

241
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.403
<v Speaker 1>that was this best sexuality that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially true before there was a </v>

242
00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:35.374
<v Speaker 1>reliable birth control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also when there was a lot more </v>

243
00:13:37.451 --> 00:13:38.284
<v Speaker 1>stigma associated with sex outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage and also with child birth </v>

244
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:43.510
<v Speaker 1>outside of marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

245
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:45.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

246
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:45.903
<v Speaker 1>in my clinical practice for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I don't see that many people who </v>

247
00:13:48.031 --> 00:13:48.864
<v Speaker 1>have this sort of sexual repression </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that Freud found so common </v>

248
00:13:52.781 --> 00:13:56.890
<v Speaker 1>among his Victorian clients mean in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture it's more likely that people are</v>

249
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.890
<v Speaker 1>having a terrible battle with the demons</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

250
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.730
<v Speaker 1>of hunger.</v>

251
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:01.563
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have some sort of eating disorder </v>

252
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:03.543
<v Speaker 1>because they're starving themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then bingeing and starving themselves </v>

253
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:08.890
<v Speaker 1>and then bingeing or eating some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:09.724
<v Speaker 1>God awful combination of pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and sugars on a sort of a </v>

255
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:15.410
<v Speaker 1>random basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they dysregulate there,</v>

256
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.863
<v Speaker 1>their hypothalamic systems because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus controls hunger and then </v>

257
00:14:19.511 --> 00:14:21.970
<v Speaker 1>they get into a vicious battle with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd like,</v>

258
00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:25.780
<v Speaker 1>you don't win against your hypothalamus </v>
<v Speaker 1>because mostly as far as it's concerned,</v>

259
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:28.300
<v Speaker 1>you're just an appendage to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

260
00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:29.134
<v Speaker 1>and it's much more powerful than you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you'll find out if you ever have a </v>

261
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:32.674
<v Speaker 1>scrap with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know people who have eating </v>

262
00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:35.914
<v Speaker 1>disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gorge and binge complete against </v>

263
00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:40.870
<v Speaker 1>their will and they don't seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to control it.</v>

264
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:43.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's because your hypothalamus </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't let you starve.</v>

265
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not into that sort of thing.</v>

266
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.863
<v Speaker 1>So no matter how thin you want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would rather that you were alive and </v>

267
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.910
<v Speaker 1>it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

268
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.000
<v Speaker 1>it has the capacity to exert more </v>
<v Speaker 1>control over your behavior than you do.</v>

269
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.043
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing often happens to people </v>

270
00:14:58.971 --> 00:14:59.804
<v Speaker 1>who develop addictions and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>addictions and addictive substance in </v>

271
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:07.010
<v Speaker 1>some sense harnesses a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational system.</v>

272
00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:07.844
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you train that motivational system </v>

273
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:13.700
<v Speaker 1>over a long enough period of time to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to seek out,</v>

274
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.730
<v Speaker 1>to successfully seek out the addictive </v>
<v Speaker 1>substance and you train it and reward it</v>

275
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.510
<v Speaker 1>by using the addictive substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you are able to come across it,</v>

276
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.630
<v Speaker 1>you'll create this little biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster in your brain.</v>

277
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.123
<v Speaker 1>You turn on at the drop of a hat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have very little control over </v>

278
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.170
<v Speaker 1>when it's activated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

279
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.793
<v Speaker 1>and you'll see one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when people go into Rehab for </v>

280
00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:38.660
<v Speaker 1>drug addiction is that pretty easy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get them,</v>

281
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the withdrawal phase,</v>

282
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.810
<v Speaker 1>even if it's something like heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

283
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.860
<v Speaker 1>and heroin withdrawal.</v>

284
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Although people are always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

285
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 1>writing movies about how awful it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's public,</v>

286
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:51.920
<v Speaker 1>it's bad as a bad case of the flu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people,</v>

287
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:52.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very seldom died during heroin </v>

288
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.153
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They die during alcohol withdrawal all </v>

289
00:15:56.451 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

290
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 1>so you can get someone through </v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal.</v>

291
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:00.824
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as you put them back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their natural environment where their </v>

292
00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:03.314
<v Speaker 1>friends are and the cues that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the addiction are still </v>

293
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:08.450
<v Speaker 1>in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start taking the drug right away.</v>

294
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:09.530
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

295
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:11.690
<v Speaker 1>regardless of all their good intentions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

296
00:16:11.691 --> 00:16:13.760
<v Speaker 1>you can see that as well in your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

297
00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:14.594
<v Speaker 1>Because I mean I doubt if a day passes </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you don't do something that you </v>

298
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:18.614
<v Speaker 1>swore you wouldn't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you do it and then you </v>

299
00:16:20.571 --> 00:16:21.404
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

300
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 1>why did I do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

301
00:16:23.241 --> 00:16:24.920
<v Speaker 1>well what do you mean?</v>

302
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I precisely and that's the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic question cause I,</v>

303
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the way the word looks,</v>

304
00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:35.780
<v Speaker 1>it's one letter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

305
00:16:35.781 --> 00:16:39.860
<v Speaker 1>it's like a one I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like well is there an eye there?</v>

306
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.173
<v Speaker 1>Well not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what there is generally </v>

307
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:46.154
<v Speaker 1>speaking is a loose aggregation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that are more or less going in </v>

308
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:49.694
<v Speaker 1>the same direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's diluted into thinking that </v>

309
00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:53.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a unity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

310
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.930
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a prime psychoanalytic theory.</v>

311
00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.680
<v Speaker 1>And the part of the reason that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer is because those systems,</v>

312
00:17:00.681 --> 00:17:03.530
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily have your wellbeing in</v>

313
00:17:03.531 --> 00:17:04.281
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

314
00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

315
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.710
<v Speaker 1>your pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your freedom from anxiety,</v>

316
00:17:07.711 --> 00:17:11.090
<v Speaker 1>your freedom from pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the system that mediates individual</v>

317
00:17:11.091 --> 00:17:12.860
<v Speaker 1>rep production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sexual system.</v>

318
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't really care about you so</v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak.</v>

319
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.740
<v Speaker 1>It cares about whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduce.</v>

320
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:19.993
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you might think about </v>

321
00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:23.900
<v Speaker 1>if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is there so much conflict in human,</v>

322
00:17:23.901 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationships?</v>

323
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.843
<v Speaker 1>It's because the demands of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduction and the demands of </v>

324
00:17:28.011 --> 00:17:29.960
<v Speaker 1>individual happiness are not the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

325
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.480
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

326
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.820
<v Speaker 1>you have to try to integrate both of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

327
00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:35.654
<v Speaker 1>but there's no reason that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily find the partner who would </v>

328
00:17:39.171 --> 00:17:40.004
<v Speaker 1>make your life most fulfilling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also the one that you're sexually </v>

329
00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 1>attracted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

330
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:47.240
<v Speaker 1>you'd hope that would be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like good luck with that.</v>

331
00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 1>You'll end up with some jerky can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

332
00:17:50.131 --> 00:17:52.830
<v Speaker 1>you get so hot you can't stand it when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were anywhere near them.</v>

333
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:53.881
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

334
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:54.714
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well wouldn't it be nice if you could </v>

335
00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:57.600
<v Speaker 1>bring that under voluntary control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

336
00:17:57.601 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 1>well good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

337
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:01.284
<v Speaker 1>so these are the sorts of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to think about when you're </v>

338
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:04.764
<v Speaker 1>thinking about what the psychoanalytic </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers we're thinking about as the </v>

339
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:09.480
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

340
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious is the,</v>

341
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.093
<v Speaker 1>the ideational and motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities of all these underlying </v>

342
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:20.390
<v Speaker 1>biological subsystems that make up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>makeup,</v>

343
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.220
<v Speaker 1>your being that make up the substrata of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your psyche.</v>

344
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.143
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you tend to think of your yourself </v>

345
00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:29.850
<v Speaker 1>as I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be the Friday and ego,</v>

346
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:30.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the part of you that subjectively </v>

347
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:36.600
<v Speaker 1>experiences and maybe also the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that has continuity of memory across</v>

348
00:18:36.601 --> 00:18:37.434
<v Speaker 1>time and for one reason or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to experience that as something </v>

349
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:44.790
<v Speaker 1>of a unity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious why exactly.</v>

350
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.073
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it is that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate ourselves out as a unit from </v>

351
00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including other people,</v>

352
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:52.584
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're aware of our boundaries </v>

353
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:54.743
<v Speaker 1>physically and also temporarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also think it's because for one </v>

354
00:18:57.811 --> 00:18:58.644
<v Speaker 1>reason or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only seem to be able to do one thing </v>

355
00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:02.094
<v Speaker 1>at a time.</v>

356
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:03.323
<v Speaker 1>And so the limitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a motor output limitation </v>

357
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:11.730
<v Speaker 1>seems also to to imply to us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only one thing there.</v>

358
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.870
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that it's not that unreasonable</v>

359
00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:16.704
<v Speaker 1>to think about ourselves as something </v>
<v Speaker 1>more like an anthill than as something </v>

360
00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:20.470
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

361
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.640
<v Speaker 1>a completely unitary structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously our physical structure</v>

362
00:19:24.641 --> 00:19:26.160
<v Speaker 1>is far from homogenous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

363
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:26.994
<v Speaker 1>You're made up of all sorts of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>sub parts and they're qualitatively </v>

364
00:19:29.431 --> 00:19:32.730
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

365
00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:36.960
<v Speaker 1>what I want to talk to you about today </v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as as far as I can manage it,</v>

366
00:19:36.961 --> 00:19:39.600
<v Speaker 1>is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give you some insight,</v>

367
00:19:39.601 --> 00:19:40.434
<v Speaker 1>or at least the insights I've been able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to develop about how it is that your </v>

368
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:44.214
<v Speaker 1>physiology speaks to your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the way to conceptualize </v>

369
00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:49.344
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to give you some sense of </v>

370
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:52.560
<v Speaker 1>what symbols are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

371
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.990
<v Speaker 1>What Freud thought about symbols was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

372
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.943
<v Speaker 1>well let's say that you're in a society </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was very sexually repressive and </v>

373
00:19:59.221 --> 00:20:00.054
<v Speaker 1>you were still stuck with the problem of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fairly powerful sex drive and your </v>

374
00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:04.134
<v Speaker 1>culture had taught you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that needed to be suppressed and </v>

375
00:20:06.391 --> 00:20:07.800
<v Speaker 1>repressed and controlled.</v>

376
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:08.933
<v Speaker 1>And Freud's idea was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that thing like the monster in the </v>

377
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:12.264
<v Speaker 1>basement doesn't really like to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed around and controlled and it's </v>

378
00:20:14.911 --> 00:20:15.744
<v Speaker 1>going to manifest its desires and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its once and it's view of the world </v>

379
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.820
<v Speaker 1>in sub subversive form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

380
00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:27.240
<v Speaker 1>and for Freud this subversive forums </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be different sorts of symbols.</v>

381
00:20:27.241 --> 00:20:29.850
<v Speaker 1>So if you weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

382
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:35.180
<v Speaker 1>satisfying the system that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying sexual interest,</v>

383
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.940
<v Speaker 1>then it would start to insert itself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>random ways into your behavior.</v>

384
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.533
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps when you're interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone of the opposite sex or maybe </v>

385
00:20:45.481 --> 00:20:49.210
<v Speaker 1>into your dreams and your fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would do that in a disguised form</v>

386
00:20:49.211 --> 00:20:50.044
<v Speaker 1>because while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the part of you that was the </v>

387
00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:56.650
<v Speaker 1>integrated part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ego part in some sense wasn't really</v>

388
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:57.484
<v Speaker 1>willing to communicate with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it had to sort of sneak its message </v>

389
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:01.900
<v Speaker 1>up and through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

390
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.453
<v Speaker 1>the union take on that with site </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly different human was perfectly </v>

391
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:07.893
<v Speaker 1>willing to assume that Freud knew what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about in some some </v>

392
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:11.883
<v Speaker 1>domains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially those that were associated </v>

393
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:14.950
<v Speaker 1>with psychopathology.</v>

394
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 1>But for you in that realm of symbols </v>
<v Speaker 1>with something different and for young,</v>

395
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.690
<v Speaker 1>the realm of symbols was where knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>had its origin.</v>

396
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:23.883
<v Speaker 1>And so you can imagine that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you know absolutely nothing </v>

397
00:21:26.831 --> 00:21:27.664
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course you don't know what those </v>

398
00:21:29.261 --> 00:21:30.940
<v Speaker 1>things are because you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about them.</v>

399
00:21:30.941 --> 00:21:34.650
<v Speaker 1>But there's lots of them around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might imagine,</v>

400
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.523
<v Speaker 1>and there's also lots of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist that the people as a whole don't </v>

401
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:39.184
<v Speaker 1>know anything about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just you there beyond our </v>

402
00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:43.240
<v Speaker 1>comprehension as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For you,</v>

403
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.163
<v Speaker 1>the assemble was a mediator between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute unknown and the relatively </v>

404
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:52.270
<v Speaker 1>known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as the human imagination expanded</v>

405
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:54.610
<v Speaker 1>out and mastered more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>

406
00:21:54.611 --> 00:21:55.444
<v Speaker 1>there was like a periphery around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>island of knowledge and that periphery </v>

407
00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:02.890
<v Speaker 1>was made up of symbolic representations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were,</v>

408
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.170
<v Speaker 1>that were pre articulate knowledge.</v>

409
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.910
<v Speaker 1>So they were like things you might act </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

410
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.950
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the way to think about that.</v>

411
00:22:08.951 --> 00:22:12.010
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might watch a child who's engaged in</v>

412
00:22:12.011 --> 00:22:14.290
<v Speaker 1>pretend play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

413
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:18.400
<v Speaker 1>And often children will pretend to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother or a father for obvious reasons,</v>

414
00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:19.234
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they do is they observe their </v>

415
00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 1>mother or their father and then they act</v>
<v Speaker 1>them out.</v>

416
00:22:23.861 --> 00:22:27.850
<v Speaker 1>But it's very interesting form of acting</v>
<v Speaker 1>out because we think of it as imitation,</v>

417
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.310
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know she's imitating her mother,</v>

418
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.340
<v Speaker 1>but imitation means you move your arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this and I moved my arm like this.</v>

419
00:22:35.411 --> 00:22:37.750
<v Speaker 1>And that is not what children do when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're playing.</v>

420
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.123
<v Speaker 1>What they do instead is a very complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of generalizations and they've </v>

421
00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:47.161
<v Speaker 1>watched the mother and they extract out </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the pattern of the mother</v>

422
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.333
<v Speaker 1>and they don't really understand what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that pattern is because they don't have </v>

423
00:22:50.471 --> 00:22:55.471
<v Speaker 1>the articulation and the cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to generate a fully articulated</v>

424
00:22:55.671 --> 00:22:57.340
<v Speaker 1>and verbalized model of the mother.</v>

425
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.180
<v Speaker 1>But they acted out in behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a,</v>

426
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.063
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're incorporating the spirit of the </v>

427
00:23:03.431 --> 00:23:05.290
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

428
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.273
<v Speaker 1>Into their behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they can act out things they </v>

429
00:23:07.781 --> 00:23:08.614
<v Speaker 1>don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least they don't understand in </v>

430
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:13.390
<v Speaker 1>terms of being able to articulate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

431
00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:14.440
<v Speaker 1>lots of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

432
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:17.620
<v Speaker 1>you can't articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't articulate how to walk.</v>

433
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:18.873
<v Speaker 1>You can't articulate how to ride a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't articulate anything complex </v>

434
00:23:22.181 --> 00:23:24.790
<v Speaker 1>like how to engage in a successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

435
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.270
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that knowledge is embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming you have it at all.</v>

436
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dramatic action.</v>

437
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:31.973
<v Speaker 1>And you can also think about the symbol </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a mediator between dramatic action </v>

438
00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.980
<v Speaker 1>and full cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

439
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:40.983
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine a child is playing at being a </v>

440
00:23:43.361 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>mother and then you stopped them and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

441
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

442
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.700
<v Speaker 1>And the child might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

443
00:23:48.701 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

444
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.990
<v Speaker 1>we're playing house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretending to be mom.</v>

445
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:51.920
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

446
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:52.843
<v Speaker 1>how do you go about doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're going to try to </v>

447
00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:57.140
<v Speaker 1>articulate what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

448
00:23:57.141 --> 00:23:57.974
<v Speaker 1>And while they're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be using their </v>

449
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:02.690
<v Speaker 1>imagination and representing the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're trying to understand.</v>

450
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.100
<v Speaker 1>And then you can see how the symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be the visual representation</v>

451
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:07.934
<v Speaker 1>of the mother's action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little movie that you might run </v>

452
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:10.604
<v Speaker 1>in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see how it might lay itself on </v>

453
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:17.150
<v Speaker 1>top of the dramatic action as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>precursor to articulation.</v>

454
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:18.703
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way of thinking about it </v>

455
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:25.121
<v Speaker 1>is that the symbol is a precursor to </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulation and that you use symbols of</v>

456
00:24:25.941 --> 00:24:26.774
<v Speaker 1>one form or another whenever you use </v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginative representation as a </v>

457
00:24:30.561 --> 00:24:31.900
<v Speaker 1>precursor to understand.</v>

458
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.940
<v Speaker 1>And so that happens for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're fantasizing about something.</v>

459
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:40.540
<v Speaker 1>So now for the psychoanalysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly psychoanalysts like Yom,</v>

460
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.810
<v Speaker 1>the imagination was something that had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous operation.</v>

461
00:24:44.811 --> 00:24:47.810
<v Speaker 1>It would just go along on its own and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

462
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:50.480
<v Speaker 1>And of course you also experienced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

463
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.130
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you dream,</v>

464
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.400
<v Speaker 1>obviously because you're not in control </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your dreams,</v>

465
00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.460
<v Speaker 1>things in control of them and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

466
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's not you or it's not the you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you normally think of yourself as.</v>

467
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 1>And then if you're daydreaming that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something analogous happens,</v>

468
00:25:06.501 --> 00:25:07.334
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find that maybe you're trying to </v>

469
00:25:08.451 --> 00:25:13.451
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on something and something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's of interest to you.</v>

470
00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:14.324
<v Speaker 1>For one reason or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts to creep into the theater of </v>

471
00:25:16.971 --> 00:25:21.170
<v Speaker 1>your imagination and lay out different </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenarios of one form or another.</v>

472
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:22.363
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of like the natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>language of the psyche because it isn't </v>

473
00:25:24.831 --> 00:25:29.030
<v Speaker 1>obvious that the natural language of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche is in fact language,</v>

474
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:30.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

475
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.943
<v Speaker 1>Because we don't really know how long </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings have been using formal </v>

476
00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:34.990
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

477
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.810
<v Speaker 1>they estimates 150,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one estimate.</v>

478
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I doubt if it's more than 2 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

479
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.320
<v Speaker 1>2 million years seems to be about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>long we've been using fire.</v>

480
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's somewhere between 2 million and </v>
<v Speaker 1>150,000 years.</v>

481
00:25:48.891 --> 00:25:52.790
<v Speaker 1>But compared to the entire history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our cognitive development,</v>

482
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.410
<v Speaker 1>which you can stretch back well to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of life itself if you want,</v>

483
00:25:57.411 --> 00:26:00.560
<v Speaker 1>or at least to the point where things </v>
<v Speaker 1>have nervous systems,</v>

484
00:26:00.561 --> 00:26:01.394
<v Speaker 1>that's more like 500 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the psyche was operating without </v>

485
00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:06.494
<v Speaker 1>language for a much longer period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time that was operating with language </v>

486
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:10.453
<v Speaker 1>and it was doing something to organize </v>
<v Speaker 1>its conceptions of the world that were </v>

487
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.750
<v Speaker 1>pre linguistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we're going to talk about today,</v>

488
00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:18.584
<v Speaker 1>or what we're already talking about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the structure of those pre </v>

489
00:26:21.141 --> 00:26:23.960
<v Speaker 1>linguistic cognitive forms might be.</v>

490
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.793
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm offering that to you partly as an </v>

491
00:26:27.861 --> 00:26:28.694
<v Speaker 1>element of the integrating theory that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>told you I would try to deliver in the </v>

492
00:26:32.181 --> 00:26:36.920
<v Speaker 1>first lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also as a means of giving you a,</v>

493
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.903
<v Speaker 1>a Schema or a language to start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what symbolic representation </v>

494
00:26:42.651 --> 00:26:45.600
<v Speaker 1>means from a psychoanalytic perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all.</v>

495
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I hope that'll be very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

496
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:48.144
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been extraordinarily useful for me </v>

497
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:50.784
<v Speaker 1>because it offers a key to understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic literature and symbolic modes </v>

498
00:26:56.161 --> 00:26:57.630
<v Speaker 1>of cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

499
00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:00.750
<v Speaker 1>religious systems are symbolic modes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognition,</v>

500
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:03.000
<v Speaker 1>part excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they are.</v>

501
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.900
<v Speaker 1>And they're not objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not primitive theories about the</v>

502
00:27:06.901 --> 00:27:07.734
<v Speaker 1>nature of the objective world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a foolish way of looking at </v>

503
00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:11.664
<v Speaker 1>religious systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it sets up an artificial dichotomy </v>

504
00:27:13.651 --> 00:27:15.810
<v Speaker 1>between religious belief in scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

505
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.470
<v Speaker 1>And all that does is confuse people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So religion,</v>

506
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.423
<v Speaker 1>religious belief is primarily about </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality and morality is about how to </v>

507
00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:24.384
<v Speaker 1>act and religious symbolism is about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to construe the world as a forum to act </v>

508
00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:31.044
<v Speaker 1>Ian.</v>

509
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:32.543
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to solve that problem because </v>

510
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.063
<v Speaker 1>the big pro biggest problem you have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life and the biggest problem you </v>

511
00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Speaker 1>always will have is how the hell should </v>
<v Speaker 1>yakked.</v>

512
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.330
<v Speaker 1>And you know that actually might be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental question of existence to,</v>

513
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.830
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that action is the primary</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

514
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a materialist,</v>

515
00:27:48.871 --> 00:27:49.704
<v Speaker 1>you don't really think that way because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of the objective world </v>

516
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:56.460
<v Speaker 1>stripped of its subjective importance as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground of reality,</v>

517
00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.623
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the ground of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ground of reality is whether or not </v>

518
00:28:00.241 --> 00:28:03.780
<v Speaker 1>you survive and reproduce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least from a Darwinian perspective.</v>

519
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.770
<v Speaker 1>And that means that the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of reality is how you act.</v>

520
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 1>That determines whether or not you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be selected,</v>

521
00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:13.850
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reproduction.</v>

522
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:14.783
<v Speaker 1>People are like evaluating each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the basis of their fitness for </v>

523
00:28:18.511 --> 00:28:20.100
<v Speaker 1>reproduction nonstop.</v>

524
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like almost all of social congress </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to do with that.</v>

525
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men organize themselves into very strict</v>

526
00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:26.934
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies by competing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>one another and women peel the men off </v>

527
00:28:30.391 --> 00:28:31.224
<v Speaker 1>the tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And almost everything that you're doing </v>

528
00:28:33.241 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 1>in your day to day interactions with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other human beings is an element of that</v>

529
00:28:37.231 --> 00:28:41.310
<v Speaker 1>fundamental process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's all action oriented.</v>

530
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's very much important to get these</v>

531
00:28:44.881 --> 00:28:45.714
<v Speaker 1>things right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to tell you how I piece </v>

532
00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:48.804
<v Speaker 1>this together to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to start with a </v>

533
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.890
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll take a look at this.</v>

534
00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.143
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you might ask is </v>

535
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 1>what do our immediate mammalian </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatives,</v>

536
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.113
<v Speaker 1>how do they conceptualize the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to assume that those </v>

537
00:29:08.791 --> 00:29:11.370
<v Speaker 1>are higher order primates because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

538
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.413
<v Speaker 1>the evidence seems to suggest that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively genetically similar to </v>

539
00:29:15.841 --> 00:29:18.900
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees in particular and also to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bonobos,</v>

540
00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:20.820
<v Speaker 1>which are more or less a fordham of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee.</v>

541
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.653
<v Speaker 1>Although their behavior differs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it looks like we diverged from the </v>

542
00:29:25.411 --> 00:29:29.820
<v Speaker 1>precursor to chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bonobos and human beings about 7 million</v>

543
00:29:29.821 --> 00:29:32.280
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we didn't come from chimps,</v>

544
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:33.203
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bonobos and us came from something that </v>

545
00:29:35.341 --> 00:29:38.550
<v Speaker 1>was the precursor to all three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know,</v>

546
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.073
<v Speaker 1>you can calculate how similar you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a genetic perspective to another </v>

547
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:44.794
<v Speaker 1>organism by measuring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you split your DNA into its it into </v>

548
00:29:47.751 --> 00:29:48.584
<v Speaker 1>its halves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you mix those Dna halves with </v>

549
00:29:51.191 --> 00:29:53.080
<v Speaker 1>the DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's of another animal,</v>

550
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.033
<v Speaker 1>they'll join up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more related you are to that </v>

551
00:29:56.801 --> 00:29:57.634
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more energy it takes to pry them </v>

552
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 1>apart once they've joined up because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a tighter match.</v>

553
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:03.930
<v Speaker 1>And so it turns out that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

554
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.970
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily tightly matched with </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees.</v>

555
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.470
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

556
00:30:08.471 --> 00:30:10.740
<v Speaker 1>so when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wondering why you're so erratic,</v>

557
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 1>it's an uncontrollable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable.</v>

558
00:30:13.751 --> 00:30:14.584
<v Speaker 1>It's because you're basically a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee that's been driven insane by </v>

559
00:30:17.411 --> 00:30:18.490
<v Speaker 1>self awareness.</v>

560
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:19.481
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

561
00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you expect from </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that?</v>

562
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:23.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing that we can even all sit in</v>

563
00:30:23.441 --> 00:30:26.590
<v Speaker 1>this room together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

564
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might ask,</v>

565
00:30:27.981 --> 00:30:32.110
<v Speaker 1>well what it creatures like that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the,</v>

566
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.920
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we've been able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to determine our,</v>

567
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.850
<v Speaker 1>some of the precursors or associates of </v>
<v Speaker 1>of cortical development of rain size and</v>

568
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:40.983
<v Speaker 1>there's various things that seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>tightly associated with the development </v>

569
00:30:44.351 --> 00:30:45.184
<v Speaker 1>of larger brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them in primates in </v>

570
00:30:47.261 --> 00:30:51.340
<v Speaker 1>particular is size of group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the bigger your group,</v>

571
00:30:51.341 --> 00:30:52.174
<v Speaker 1>the more you have to keep track of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more social information you'll have to </v>

572
00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:55.714
<v Speaker 1>keep track of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that's driving brain development </v>

573
00:30:58.211 --> 00:30:59.044
<v Speaker 1>at least in part because it's certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the whole story if it's driving </v>

574
00:31:01.841 --> 00:31:02.674
<v Speaker 1>behavior in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that that implies is </v>

575
00:31:04.631 --> 00:31:05.464
<v Speaker 1>that one of the most important sources </v>
<v Speaker 1>of information that you have to contend </v>

576
00:31:09.611 --> 00:31:13.000
<v Speaker 1>with if you're a social pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nate is the social structure.</v>

577
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.373
<v Speaker 1>And so what you can infer from that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your brain is primarily set up to </v>

578
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.043
<v Speaker 1>assess social information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can take that a little bit </v>

579
00:31:23.591 --> 00:31:24.424
<v Speaker 1>farther and then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that means that may imply that the </v>

580
00:31:26.441 --> 00:31:29.950
<v Speaker 1>primary categories that you use </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally.</v>

581
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:30.963
<v Speaker 1>So to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand the world are in fact </v>

582
00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:35.710
<v Speaker 1>social categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you could think,</v>

583
00:31:35.711 --> 00:31:36.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

584
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:37.563
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've elaborated our cognitive systems </v>

585
00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:43.330
<v Speaker 1>up into the abstract far farther than </v>
<v Speaker 1>our primate relatives have.</v>

586
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.990
<v Speaker 1>But because evolution is a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

587
00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.020
<v Speaker 1>new structures have their roots in old </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>

588
00:31:50.021 --> 00:31:50.854
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a necessary part of evolution </v>

589
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:57.091
<v Speaker 1>because once an organism walks down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain psychophysiological road,</v>

590
00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:59.980
<v Speaker 1>in some sense it's destined by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>

591
00:31:59.981 --> 00:32:04.210
<v Speaker 1>which is why you have the same basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodily platform as virtually,</v>

592
00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only mammals,</v>

593
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.570
<v Speaker 1>vertebrates in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

594
00:32:07.571 --> 00:32:09.040
<v Speaker 1>four legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two eyes.</v>

595
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very standard form.</v>

596
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:13.660
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

597
00:32:13.661 --> 00:32:15.400
<v Speaker 1>once it's developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

598
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:19.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the platform upon which further </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation takes place.</v>

599
00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

600
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.440
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

601
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:27.160
<v Speaker 1>think of your own situation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the primates situation.</v>

602
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.353
<v Speaker 1>How much of your time during the day are</v>
<v Speaker 1>you spending interacting with other </v>

603
00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:32.824
<v Speaker 1>people in one form or another?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's assume that that also means </v>

604
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.470
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

605
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.090
<v Speaker 1>all the artificial representations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

606
00:32:41.091 --> 00:32:44.120
<v Speaker 1>We're going to consider those </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of people as well.</v>

607
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.040
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

608
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.053
<v Speaker 1>not when you're asleep except you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreaming and you're almost inevitably </v>

609
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 1>dreaming of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're away,</v>

610
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:54.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it said?</v>

611
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:59.290
<v Speaker 1>80% is 90% I mean it depends to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree on how extroverted you are.</v>

612
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:01.003
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're sufficiently extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try to drive it up to a </v>

613
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.870
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're really introverted,</v>

614
00:33:05.871 --> 00:33:06.591
<v Speaker 1>maybe you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

615
00:33:06.591 --> 00:33:07.424
<v Speaker 1>you'd go hide in the closet now and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he can't stand being around </v>

616
00:33:09.411 --> 00:33:09.800
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

617
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.633
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of your environment is a social </v>

618
00:33:14.421 --> 00:33:15.780
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

619
00:33:15.781 --> 00:33:19.550
<v Speaker 1>and like we like to think of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment has a forest or a landscape,</v>

620
00:33:19.551 --> 00:33:20.384
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the environment is actually the </v>

621
00:33:22.311 --> 00:33:25.490
<v Speaker 1>niche in which you live and the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>niche is highly social.</v>

622
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.930
<v Speaker 1>And then you add to that the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're pair bonding creatures and we have</v>

623
00:33:29.931 --> 00:33:30.764
<v Speaker 1>very long lasting relationships and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>familial relationships are </v>

624
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:34.574
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily long lasting as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus our period of dependency is </v>

625
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.830
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily long and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

626
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:42.290
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and serious.</v>

627
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

628
00:33:43.911 --> 00:33:48.530
<v Speaker 1>we're for all day for the all the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly western ideas about,</v>

629
00:33:48.531 --> 00:33:49.364
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radical individualism were unbelievably </v>

630
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:55.340
<v Speaker 1>social creatures and we can't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive outside of a social context.</v>

631
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:56.683
<v Speaker 1>And what that implies is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental categories of our </v>

632
00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:00.404
<v Speaker 1>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our likely social and that we've taken </v>

633
00:34:04.401 --> 00:34:07.400
<v Speaker 1>those fundamental categories and applied</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to other things.</v>

634
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:08.503
<v Speaker 1>So then imagine here's some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we know that that higher </v>

635
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:15.860
<v Speaker 1>order primates can track from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can track dominance.</v>

636
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primates live in hierarchies,</v>

637
00:34:19.761 --> 00:34:22.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a female hierarchy and a male </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in it,</v>

638
00:34:22.751 --> 00:34:23.584
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the nature of those hierarchies </v>

639
00:34:24.381 --> 00:34:25.214
<v Speaker 1>depends on the pricing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are hierarchies and the </v>

640
00:34:27.711 --> 00:34:28.544
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies are extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>important because if you're at the </v>

641
00:34:30.921 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 1>bottom of a hierarchy and you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>social primate,</v>

642
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.440
<v Speaker 1>like you're a whipping boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get kicked around,</v>

643
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.270
<v Speaker 1>your children are going to get kicked </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

644
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.210
<v Speaker 1>If an f a disease comes whipping through</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

645
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:42.283
<v Speaker 1>your tribe or your truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then if you're at the bottom of the </v>

646
00:34:45.261 --> 00:34:46.094
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the one that's going to die </v>

647
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:50.510
<v Speaker 1>because you're already stressed and full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of parasites and poorly nourished.</v>

648
00:34:50.511 --> 00:34:53.690
<v Speaker 1>And you don't have a good place to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're going to get wiped off the</v>

649
00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:54.200
<v Speaker 1>map.</v>

650
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.020
<v Speaker 1>And even if you don't get killed by some</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>

651
00:34:57.021 --> 00:34:59.660
<v Speaker 1>if we track your life expectancy across </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

652
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.400
<v Speaker 1>if you're at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

653
00:35:01.401 --> 00:35:04.820
<v Speaker 1>you're going to die way earlier and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be old,</v>

654
00:35:04.821 --> 00:35:05.654
<v Speaker 1>much younger than the people or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures that are at the top because </v>

655
00:35:08.691 --> 00:35:09.524
<v Speaker 1>the ones at the top get the best of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and the ones at the bottom </v>

656
00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:15.170
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it turns out that your,</v>

657
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.090
<v Speaker 1>your place of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

658
00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.013
<v Speaker 1>of position in the dominants heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an unbelievably important </v>

659
00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:24.300
<v Speaker 1>determinant of your probability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductions,</v>

660
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:25.143
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most females reproduce regardless of </v>

661
00:35:28.431 --> 00:35:32.630
<v Speaker 1>where they are in the dominant search.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't the case with males.</v>

662
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:33.464
<v Speaker 1>What happens in males as he gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>something more like a prieto </v>

663
00:35:35.001 --> 00:35:35.834
<v Speaker 1>distribution where there's a few males </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top are unbelievably successful </v>

664
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:43.140
<v Speaker 1>and then half the males at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are not successful at all.</v>

665
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.180
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

666
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:46.014
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the chronic stressors that</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized societies have to deal with </v>

667
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.930
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

668
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.950
<v Speaker 1>for obvious reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

669
00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:55.213
<v Speaker 1>so it turns out that primates are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sensitive to dominance hierarchy </v>

670
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.593
<v Speaker 1>structure and they know who's at their </v>
<v Speaker 1>level and they know who's below their </v>

671
00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:06.990
<v Speaker 1>level and they know who's above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they track that across time and they</v>

672
00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:11.220
<v Speaker 1>track it across families and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>they track it across generations because</v>

673
00:36:11.221 --> 00:36:13.680
<v Speaker 1>it can last generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozen human beings,</v>

674
00:36:13.681 --> 00:36:14.514
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our brains are pre wired for </v>

675
00:36:17.581 --> 00:36:18.630
<v Speaker 1>dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

676
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:22.110
<v Speaker 1>comprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and okay,</v>

677
00:36:22.111 --> 00:36:24.360
<v Speaker 1>so that's one domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy.</v>

678
00:36:24.361 --> 00:36:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Now you can think about that in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of different ways.</v>

679
00:36:26.671 --> 00:36:29.880
<v Speaker 1>You can think about that as the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

680
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.480
<v Speaker 1>You can think about that as the nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the tribe.</v>

681
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:37.200
<v Speaker 1>You can think about that as the state or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nation or the people.</v>

682
00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.810
<v Speaker 1>All of those things are dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy variants.</v>

683
00:36:39.811 --> 00:36:40.644
<v Speaker 1>In some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about that as the father </v>

684
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:45.443
<v Speaker 1>and or you could even think about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as God the father with God being the </v>

685
00:36:48.961 --> 00:36:50.790
<v Speaker 1>thing that's at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

686
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:51.624
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think part of what religious </v>

687
00:36:53.261 --> 00:36:54.094
<v Speaker 1>idiation actually does is take the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the thing that's at the top of the </v>

688
00:36:58.351 --> 00:36:59.184
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is and make it into a day </v>

689
00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Auntie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the rate,</v>

690
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.203
<v Speaker 1>we know that people are much more likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to imitate those who are close to the </v>

691
00:37:09.241 --> 00:37:10.074
<v Speaker 1>top of the hierarchy because they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull in the behaviors and the </v>

692
00:37:12.241 --> 00:37:13.074
<v Speaker 1>attitudes and the ideas that made those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people successful than you might think </v>

693
00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:17.094
<v Speaker 1>with regards to human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That because we're extraordinarily </v>

694
00:37:19.561 --> 00:37:21.900
<v Speaker 1>intelligent and very much able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract that,</v>

695
00:37:21.901 --> 00:37:22.734
<v Speaker 1>what we can do is we can look across </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies because there are </v>

696
00:37:26.131 --> 00:37:29.790
<v Speaker 1>multiple sorts of dominance hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 1>among human beings and we can say,</v>

697
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:30.624
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this person's at the top here and </v>

698
00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:33.564
<v Speaker 1>then this person's at the top here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this person's at the top here and all </v>

699
00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:37.953
<v Speaker 1>those talk people share things in common</v>
<v Speaker 1>that make them the top and then we can </v>

700
00:37:42.451 --> 00:37:47.190
<v Speaker 1>abstract out what the top means and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can say that's the top thing.</v>

701
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.713
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's partly what people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing in the multigenerational </v>

702
00:37:51.601 --> 00:37:52.434
<v Speaker 1>process that they use to extract out </v>
<v Speaker 1>religiously significant figures of </v>

703
00:37:57.001 --> 00:38:00.870
<v Speaker 1>adulation and admiration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're like the best of all possible</v>

704
00:38:00.871 --> 00:38:03.420
<v Speaker 1>people across all possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

705
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we'll leave that aside for a moment.</v>

706
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:06.743
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the fundamental symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that people use to represent </v>

707
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.230
<v Speaker 1>the structure of the dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>are paternal.</v>

708
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.500
<v Speaker 1>So the dominance hierarchy is like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great father.</v>

709
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.753
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that among human beings and among </v>

710
00:38:20.521 --> 00:38:23.130
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's not so true with Barnabas,</v>

711
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.160
<v Speaker 1>the male dominance hierarchy is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant hierarchy.</v>

712
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.653
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a claim even that feminists </v>

713
00:38:28.771 --> 00:38:29.281
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

714
00:38:29.281 --> 00:38:30.114
<v Speaker 1>Because the feminists say that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that our culture is basically a </v>

715
00:38:34.261 --> 00:38:37.540
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not very happy about that.</v>

716
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:42.400
<v Speaker 1>But that's a whole different issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

717
00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:44.620
<v Speaker 1>so one idea.</v>

718
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:49.383
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

719
00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing you can think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

720
00:38:54.261 --> 00:38:55.094
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

721
00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:58.643
<v Speaker 1>Your brain has got to be organized so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's capable of understanding the </v>

722
00:39:01.741 --> 00:39:05.160
<v Speaker 1>things that are most constant about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

723
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:06.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

724
00:39:06.871 --> 00:39:07.704
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that are the most constant </v>

725
00:39:08.551 --> 00:39:11.130
<v Speaker 1>are the most real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a way of defining real.</v>

726
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.400
<v Speaker 1>It lasts a long time and it's evident </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

727
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might think,</v>

728
00:39:16.081 --> 00:39:18.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the most real things that human</v>

729
00:39:18.421 --> 00:39:20.310
<v Speaker 1>beings have to deal with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

730
00:39:20.311 --> 00:39:21.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one,</v>

731
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:21.933
<v Speaker 1>one answer to that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are certain kinds of objective </v>

732
00:39:24.421 --> 00:39:27.090
<v Speaker 1>realities that are the most real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

733
00:39:27.091 --> 00:39:27.924
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like trees are extraordinarily </v>

734
00:39:29.521 --> 00:39:30.354
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things I'd like to point </v>

735
00:39:32.071 --> 00:39:35.430
<v Speaker 1>out to you is that despite the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>trees are quite real,</v>

736
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:36.503
<v Speaker 1>they're not as real as dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies because dominance </v>

737
00:39:38.941 --> 00:39:39.774
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies were around for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred million years before there </v>

738
00:39:41.671 --> 00:39:42.660
<v Speaker 1>were trees.</v>

739
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.063
<v Speaker 1>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been dominant turkeys around </v>

740
00:39:46.201 --> 00:39:50.190
<v Speaker 1>for 400 million years long before there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were vertebrates have are tight.</v>

741
00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:51.443
<v Speaker 1>And so the dominance hierarchy is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily constant feature of </v>

742
00:39:54.331 --> 00:39:55.164
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that we're wired </v>

743
00:39:56.941 --> 00:39:59.120
<v Speaker 1>up to be able to detect variations in </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance,</v>

744
00:39:59.121 --> 00:39:59.954
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy status is because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the fact of that structure is </v>

745
00:40:04.171 --> 00:40:06.480
<v Speaker 1>constant across all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In all places.</v>

746
00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:08.003
<v Speaker 1>And so it's built right into our nervous</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and the fact that we share the </v>

747
00:40:11.221 --> 00:40:12.054
<v Speaker 1>ability to assess our dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy position with crustaceans and </v>

748
00:40:17.041 --> 00:40:17.874
<v Speaker 1>that this and which have a very simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system and the fact that the </v>

749
00:40:20.161 --> 00:40:24.690
<v Speaker 1>same pharmacological substances work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>crustaceans that work on us for the same</v>

750
00:40:24.691 --> 00:40:26.760
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least with regards to dominance,</v>

751
00:40:26.761 --> 00:40:27.594
<v Speaker 1>archi indicates that the dominants </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy counter that you have </v>

752
00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:33.000
<v Speaker 1>functioning at the very base of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

753
00:40:33.001 --> 00:40:33.834
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an unbelievably potent mechanism and </v>

754
00:40:36.841 --> 00:40:38.010
<v Speaker 1>you're using it all the time.</v>

755
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.700
<v Speaker 1>One example is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you might ask yourself why</v>

756
00:40:41.701 --> 00:40:46.230
<v Speaker 1>people are so obsessed with fashion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why fashions have to change every year.</v>

757
00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:47.363
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>by attending to fashion and keeping up </v>

758
00:40:50.731 --> 00:40:51.564
<v Speaker 1>or being even on the event and guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you show that you're ahead of the curve </v>

759
00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.480
<v Speaker 1>and the curve is always changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

760
00:40:57.481 --> 00:41:01.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like a technological curve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to stay ahead of of the,</v>

761
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:04.290
<v Speaker 1>it isn't so much that you mastered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

762
00:41:04.291 --> 00:41:05.124
<v Speaker 1>it's that you stay ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and master the new and that </v>

763
00:41:07.831 --> 00:41:11.370
<v Speaker 1>indicates that your conscious and alive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and aware and capable of competing.</v>

764
00:41:11.371 --> 00:41:13.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you more attractive,</v>

765
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.573
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle as a mate or at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least more competitive with the other </v>

766
00:41:18.481 --> 00:41:22.380
<v Speaker 1>creatures with whom you're competing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attention of potential mates.</v>

767
00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:24.203
<v Speaker 1>So that's just another indication of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how possessed you are by the </v>

768
00:41:27.331 --> 00:41:29.970
<v Speaker 1>operation of these deep seated </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological systems.</v>

769
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:31.020
<v Speaker 1>And we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

770
00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:31.854
<v Speaker 1>that there's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very little difference between a severe </v>

771
00:41:34.581 --> 00:41:38.720
<v Speaker 1>clinical depression and a very severe </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance defeat.</v>

772
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.720
<v Speaker 1>It's the same biological process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

773
00:41:41.721 --> 00:41:42.554
<v Speaker 1>what happens often with people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinically depressed is that there's </v>

774
00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:47.643
<v Speaker 1>self assessed dominance is much lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>than their actual competence and it's </v>

775
00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:52.064
<v Speaker 1>actually the gap between their </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence and their and their self </v>

776
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:58.640
<v Speaker 1>worth assessment that constitutes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>

777
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

778
00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.210
<v Speaker 1>so you have someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I assess people for depression,</v>

779
00:42:02.211 --> 00:42:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I say well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

780
00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.710
<v Speaker 1>do you have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good job?</v>

781
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have,</v>

782
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.370
<v Speaker 1>you have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have an intimate partner?</v>

783
00:42:10.371 --> 00:42:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you have interests in various things </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life,</v>

784
00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:13.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of your work.</v>

785
00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

786
00:42:15.081 --> 00:42:16.850
<v Speaker 1>do you have the sort of education that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want?</v>

787
00:42:16.851 --> 00:42:19.610
<v Speaker 1>How's your physical health?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a drug and alcohol problem?</v>

788
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:24.620
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer to all those is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper answer and they still feel really</v>

789
00:42:24.621 --> 00:42:25.454
<v Speaker 1>terrible than you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well that person suffering from </v>

790
00:42:27.381 --> 00:42:28.214
<v Speaker 1>clinical depression because they're self</v>
<v Speaker 1>assessed dominant status is not in </v>

791
00:42:31.131 --> 00:42:33.830
<v Speaker 1>keeping with their actual social status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

792
00:42:33.831 --> 00:42:34.664
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to people who come in and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask them the same questions and it's </v>

793
00:42:36.831 --> 00:42:40.100
<v Speaker 1>like their families completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're alienated from them.</v>

794
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.143
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a brain injury when they were </v>

795
00:42:42.591 --> 00:42:44.930
<v Speaker 1>four because their father hit them </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the wall.</v>

796
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:48.230
<v Speaker 1>They've got no education at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got an alcohol problem.</v>

797
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:49.243
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd been unemployed for seven years </v>

798
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.120
<v Speaker 1>and they have a personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

799
00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel terrible,</v>

800
00:42:54.291 --> 00:42:57.920
<v Speaker 1>but they're not depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have terrible lives,</v>

801
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:59.503
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like you're not going to </v>

802
00:43:00.261 --> 00:43:01.094
<v Speaker 1>suffer if you have a terrible life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I give someone like that an </v>

803
00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:06.530
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant or suggest that they take</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

804
00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:07.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might stop them from cutting the </v>

805
00:43:08.601 --> 00:43:09.434
<v Speaker 1>risks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that it's really </v>

806
00:43:10.341 --> 00:43:11.174
<v Speaker 1>going to improve their situation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively low because like what the </v>

807
00:43:13.161 --> 00:43:16.280
<v Speaker 1>hell are you going to do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too overwhelming a problem.</v>

808
00:43:16.281 --> 00:43:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you even address?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

809
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:19.484
<v Speaker 1>so it looks like the dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>as such seems to be represented by </v>

810
00:43:23.631 --> 00:43:24.464
<v Speaker 1>masculine symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's something to keep in mind when </v>

811
00:43:26.361 --> 00:43:27.194
<v Speaker 1>you watch movies because symbols are </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken sessions especially that are </v>

812
00:43:29.301 --> 00:43:32.690
<v Speaker 1>associated with the father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the king for example,</v>

813
00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:33.973
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are representations of the dominant </v>

814
00:43:36.261 --> 00:43:38.030
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

815
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.270
<v Speaker 1>so that's one fundamental symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

816
00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:44.780
<v Speaker 1>let's look at another here.</v>

817
00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:54.290
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is a rather complicated shift in</v>

818
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:56.850
<v Speaker 1>argumentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

819
00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.720
<v Speaker 1>so perhaps you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for a minute,</v>

820
00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:06.500
<v Speaker 1>the association between the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and culture.</v>

821
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 1>You see how those are the same thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least that there are similar,</v>

822
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.530
<v Speaker 1>our cultures actually made up of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of overlapping,</v>

823
00:44:12.531 --> 00:44:13.250
<v Speaker 1>dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

824
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:14.083
<v Speaker 1>He's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because different professions and </v>

825
00:44:15.411 --> 00:44:16.244
<v Speaker 1>different specialties have their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies in their sort of </v>

826
00:44:18.261 --> 00:44:21.350
<v Speaker 1>integrated into a metta higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>

827
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.243
<v Speaker 1>but regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture is a dormant entire </v>

828
00:44:25.051 --> 00:44:26.750
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complex dominance,</v>

829
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Herc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might ask yourself,</v>

830
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly makes up the culture?</v>

831
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:33.143
<v Speaker 1>What is it that we're talking about when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about the culture and the </v>

832
00:44:35.311 --> 00:44:37.770
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>

833
00:44:37.771 --> 00:44:38.604
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that leads into questions like what </v>

834
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:43.260
<v Speaker 1>exactly constitutes a law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

835
00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:45.330
<v Speaker 1>so we have laws and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

836
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean that there's a law?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

837
00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:51.240
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can look at the obvious things.</v>

838
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a rule of some sort that's being</v>
<v Speaker 1>written down.</v>

839
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.790
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a rule of it's been written down</v>

840
00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:01.020
<v Speaker 1>that if you transgress against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be tracked down and punished.</v>

841
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.200
<v Speaker 1>That's another example of a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example is while it's a custom,</v>

842
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.780
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the things that we have is laws,</v>

843
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.290
<v Speaker 1>our customs that people have adopted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>

844
00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:14.124
<v Speaker 1>to regulate our interactions so that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of mutual cooperation is </v>

845
00:45:17.251 --> 00:45:20.310
<v Speaker 1>high and the probability of mutual </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression is low.</v>

846
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.690
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

847
00:45:21.691 --> 00:45:24.330
<v Speaker 1>why do we all go forward on a green </v>
<v Speaker 1>light?</v>

848
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.540
<v Speaker 1>That's arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that a law?</v>

849
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:28.583
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody decided that that </v>

850
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 1>would be a law and then they decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would act it out.</v>

851
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:34.343
<v Speaker 1>So it's a costume and you can see why </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an extraordinarily useful custom </v>

852
00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:39.510
<v Speaker 1>because if we didn't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'd be crashing into each other at</v>

853
00:45:39.511 --> 00:45:42.240
<v Speaker 1>every intersection and none of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicles would be good for anything.</v>

854
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:43.643
<v Speaker 1>So that's another example of a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you think about a law as a set </v>

855
00:45:47.521 --> 00:45:48.354
<v Speaker 1>of customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you start to see the law as as the </v>

856
00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:54.360
<v Speaker 1>codafide version of a behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract,</v>

857
00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.673
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's ways that we have all agreed to </v>

858
00:45:57.001 --> 00:45:57.834
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even if we have a degree act that </v>

859
00:45:59.491 --> 00:46:00.324
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've agreed that there should be a </v>

860
00:46:01.411 --> 00:46:04.050
<v Speaker 1>structure that describes how you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

861
00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:05.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the culture is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

862
00:46:05.761 --> 00:46:08.670
<v Speaker 1>unless you're a nihilist or an anarchist</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a criminal or,</v>

863
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:09.743
<v Speaker 1>or a terrorist or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically accept the fact that this </v>

864
00:46:12.961 --> 00:46:15.990
<v Speaker 1>structure has to exist and then you try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to position yourself within it.</v>

865
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you can think,</v>

866
00:46:18.241 --> 00:46:19.074
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture and the dominance hierarchy </v>

867
00:46:20.881 --> 00:46:22.800
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is two things at the same time,</v>

868
00:46:22.801 --> 00:46:26.070
<v Speaker 1>or maybe even three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is it's the way you act.</v>

869
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.640
<v Speaker 1>So when you say that you're a citizen of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a given country,</v>

870
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:31.103
<v Speaker 1>what that essentially means is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitate the body of laws that that </v>

871
00:46:34.051 --> 00:46:35.610
<v Speaker 1>country has erected.</v>

872
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.180
<v Speaker 1>You're a behavioral manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those rules,</v>

873
00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:40.163
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking or reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say the law is a codafide </v>

874
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:46.740
<v Speaker 1>representation of the way everybody in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture is behaving.</v>

875
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.230
<v Speaker 1>There's like a dyadic interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

876
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.453
<v Speaker 1>And so the law and the culture is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a pattern of behaviors and </v>

877
00:46:54.301 --> 00:46:57.060
<v Speaker 1>expectations around those behaviors that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone shares.</v>

878
00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:58.523
<v Speaker 1>And you could also say it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cumulative knowledge that the culture </v>

879
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:02.694
<v Speaker 1>shares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the culture as a whole has a body of </v>

880
00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:05.364
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of which is our objective and some </v>

881
00:47:06.841 --> 00:47:07.674
<v Speaker 1>of which is moral and behavioral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you as a fragment of that also have </v>

882
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.920
<v Speaker 1>have that at least in fragmentary form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

883
00:47:13.921 --> 00:47:16.500
<v Speaker 1>You're a partial representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire culture.</v>

884
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.830
<v Speaker 1>That would be something similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's idea of the Super Ego,</v>

885
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:21.683
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because for Freud there was an end and </v>

886
00:47:22.831 --> 00:47:25.800
<v Speaker 1>an ego and the superego and they had was</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

887
00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:29.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology and its ability to control you.</v>

888
00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:34.120
<v Speaker 1>And the ego was poor little you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Super Ego was the terrible force</v>

889
00:47:34.121 --> 00:47:34.954
<v Speaker 1>of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing the little ego between the </v>

890
00:47:37.511 --> 00:47:42.010
<v Speaker 1>terrible force of biology and itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Super Ego in some senses,</v>

891
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:42.873
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's represented by masculinity </v>

892
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:46.110
<v Speaker 1>now or by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

893
00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:48.160
<v Speaker 1>by the far to figured most generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>

894
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Now you could also imagine the culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the collection of all knowledge.</v>

895
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:55.773
<v Speaker 1>Now that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now then you got to think about what </v>

896
00:47:57.761 --> 00:48:00.610
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a tough thing to get a handle</v>

897
00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:03.310
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because there's different definitions</v>

898
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:04.144
<v Speaker 1>of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We in many technical situations in our </v>

899
00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:09.454
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we privilege factual knowledge and we </v>

900
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:14.080
<v Speaker 1>think of that as knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

901
00:48:14.081 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to be an engineer or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicist,</v>

902
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.040
<v Speaker 1>someone who's really dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

903
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.113
<v Speaker 1>there are certain rules that apply to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the operation of things and you have to </v>

904
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:23.020
<v Speaker 1>know what those are.</v>

905
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:27.130
<v Speaker 1>And those don't necessarily have much to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with how you behave.</v>

906
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.353
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're an engineer and you go to </v>

907
00:48:29.261 --> 00:48:30.094
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work with things and you have to </v>

908
00:48:31.211 --> 00:48:32.044
<v Speaker 1>know how the things work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you also have to be part of a </v>

909
00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:35.044
<v Speaker 1>culture because if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to not get along with the </v>

910
00:48:36.491 --> 00:48:38.620
<v Speaker 1>rest of the engineers and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to toss you out.</v>

911
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.320
<v Speaker 1>So you have to have both forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

912
00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:42.393
<v Speaker 1>But we're not interested in in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment precisely about the factual </v>

913
00:48:45.071 --> 00:48:45.904
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're more interested in the knowledge </v>

914
00:48:47.471 --> 00:48:49.720
<v Speaker 1>that makes you acceptable other human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

915
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:53.470
<v Speaker 1>And that enables you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're operating in your own life,</v>

916
00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:54.453
<v Speaker 1>to negotiate the social structure in </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a way that you can be successful </v>

917
00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:01.660
<v Speaker 1>and successful would mean well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to live.</v>

918
00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:02.943
<v Speaker 1>That would be one definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some probability that you might </v>

919
00:49:06.191 --> 00:49:07.570
<v Speaker 1>find an intimate partner.</v>

920
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:08.583
<v Speaker 1>That's another element of success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not suffering to the point where </v>

921
00:49:11.141 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 1>your own existence is intolerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

922
00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:14.554
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to survive for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>prolonged period of time with some </v>

923
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.930
<v Speaker 1>amount of security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you're,</v>

924
00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're trying to do.</v>

925
00:49:21.371 --> 00:49:24.400
<v Speaker 1>And I would say to the degree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're well inculturated,</v>

926
00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:25.653
<v Speaker 1>which is that you're a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of your culturals </v>

927
00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.353
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge in so far as it's irrelevant </v>

928
00:49:30.191 --> 00:49:31.024
<v Speaker 1>behaviorally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're much more likely to be </v>

929
00:49:32.171 --> 00:49:33.790
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

930
00:49:33.791 --> 00:49:34.624
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to equate that form of </v>

931
00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:41.140
<v Speaker 1>knowledge with the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>succeeding that makes you,</v>

932
00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:42.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could call,</v>

933
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:43.563
<v Speaker 1>you could call it a no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could call it emotional </v>

934
00:49:45.701 --> 00:49:46.534
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I never would call it that </v>

935
00:49:47.621 --> 00:49:51.790
<v Speaker 1>because there's actually no such thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's more,</v>

936
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:57.530
<v Speaker 1>it's knowledge about how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

937
00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

938
00:49:58.991 --> 00:50:00.190
<v Speaker 1>very important that knowledge.</v>

939
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:02.350
<v Speaker 1>So just think about what you're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing in this class,</v>

940
00:50:02.351 --> 00:50:04.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of you don't know each other.</v>

941
00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:09.640
<v Speaker 1>There's maybe 200 people in this class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three of you are pretty damn crazy,</v>

942
00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

943
00:50:11.651 --> 00:50:14.260
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and probably about 10 of you are like on</v>

944
00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 1>the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

945
00:50:15.611 --> 00:50:18.130
<v Speaker 1>but there you all are sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 1>peacefully,</v>

946
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:18.993
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're following a rule code and you're </v>

947
00:50:20.591 --> 00:50:22.510
<v Speaker 1>really following it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

948
00:50:22.511 --> 00:50:24.850
<v Speaker 1>you're all sitting in your own chair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

949
00:50:24.851 --> 00:50:26.620
<v Speaker 1>You're not sitting on the lap of someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>names,</v>

950
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes you laugh,</v>

951
00:50:28.551 --> 00:50:30.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what would happen if someone did</v>

952
00:50:30.321 --> 00:50:31.760
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen?</v>

953
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

954
00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:34.034
<v Speaker 1>a little flurry would break out because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all of a sudden the primate is </v>

955
00:50:36.051 --> 00:50:38.270
<v Speaker 1>doing something that a primates not </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do.</v>

956
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.650
<v Speaker 1>And that opens up an area of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

957
00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:44.300
<v Speaker 1>of the unexpected and the crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

958
00:50:44.301 --> 00:50:47.690
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen when a little spot opens up where</v>

959
00:50:47.691 --> 00:50:49.730
<v Speaker 1>the unexpected and crazy emerges.</v>

960
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:51.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't like those spots.</v>

961
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:54.430
<v Speaker 1>And you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see this in your own behavior.</v>

962
00:50:54.431 --> 00:50:55.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

963
00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:59.140
<v Speaker 1>if you're walking down bloor street and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you happen to come across someone who is</v>

964
00:50:59.141 --> 00:50:59.974
<v Speaker 1>self evidently homeless and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering down the street and they're </v>

965
00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:04.850
<v Speaker 1>gesturing and they're talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

966
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

967
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:07.873
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you're going to glance and look away </v>

968
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:11.023
<v Speaker 1>and then you're going to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively wide birth around the person </v>

969
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:16.610
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to try not to make eye </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact generally speaking.</v>

970
00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:18.980
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that.</v>

971
00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:24.220
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is the space that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person in habits is undetermined by</v>

972
00:51:24.591 --> 00:51:26.750
<v Speaker 1>cultural agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

973
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.733
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the person will do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all you do is walk around that </v>

974
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.990
<v Speaker 1>space because God only knows what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

975
00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.093
<v Speaker 1>What might happen if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably nothing because the person is </v>

976
00:51:36.621 --> 00:51:39.350
<v Speaker 1>preoccupied by whatever demons happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be chasing them,</v>

977
00:51:39.351 --> 00:51:41.660
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to take that </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

978
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:44.540
<v Speaker 1>And so you all come in here and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

979
00:51:44.541 --> 00:51:46.730
<v Speaker 1>look you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty much all dressed the same,</v>

980
00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:48.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

981
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:51.380
<v Speaker 1>acceptable variation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing outlandish.</v>

982
00:51:51.381 --> 00:51:54.290
<v Speaker 1>So you get to be individual but not </v>
<v Speaker 1>peculiar.</v>

983
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far it looks okay.</v>

984
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.133
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know where you're supposed to </v>

985
00:52:00.681 --> 00:52:02.720
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I bet you how many of you sat in the</v>

986
00:52:02.721 --> 00:52:05.960
<v Speaker 1>same seat you sat in the first day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

987
00:52:05.961 --> 00:52:07.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a good proportion of view.</v>

988
00:52:07.611 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 1>How many didn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

989
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Well you will assume cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you,</v>

990
00:52:11.961 --> 00:52:12.680
<v Speaker 1>you'll love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep,</v>

991
00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:14.540
<v Speaker 1>you'll have established your little </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>

992
00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:16.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it will be,</v>

993
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:20.420
<v Speaker 1>it will be familiar to you and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravitate towards it.</v>

994
00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:23.600
<v Speaker 1>And you'll be happy about that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll start to become familiarized with</v>

995
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:26.900
<v Speaker 1>the people in your immediate vicinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't kill you the first time.</v>

996
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:29.300
<v Speaker 1>So they might not kill you the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

997
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

998
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.090
<v Speaker 1>and you're all participating in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a kind of collective drama,</v>

999
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:38.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the nature of this room?</v>

1000
00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:42.470
<v Speaker 1>What does it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it called?</v>

1001
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a lecture theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1002
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a drama going on,</v>

1003
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:52.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're the audience.</v>

1004
00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:57.200
<v Speaker 1>And I'm hypothetically supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>providing the drama and we all know that</v>

1005
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:59.870
<v Speaker 1>because that's how the room is set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you come in here,</v>

1006
00:52:59.871 --> 00:53:01.730
<v Speaker 1>you will obey the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do what it tells you.</v>

1007
00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:05.090
<v Speaker 1>There's chairs and you sit in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I'm talking,</v>

1008
00:53:05.091 --> 00:53:06.590
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

1009
00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.013
<v Speaker 1>maybe you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully if I'm speaking properly then </v>

1010
00:53:11.751 --> 00:53:13.250
<v Speaker 1>you don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're happy,</v>

1011
00:53:13.251 --> 00:53:14.084
<v Speaker 1>listen and the rule is you're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at me and listen and you're all </v>

1012
00:53:16.491 --> 00:53:17.324
<v Speaker 1>following that rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know all of that is because </v>

1013
00:53:19.371 --> 00:53:24.371
<v Speaker 1>you're very much inculturated and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sane enough to follow the damn rules.</v>

1014
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.520
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you might think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

1015
00:53:26.521 --> 00:53:30.000
<v Speaker 1>and this is where I thought the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts kind of went astray,</v>

1016
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:31.223
<v Speaker 1>is that the psychoanalysts tended to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that you were saying if your </v>

1017
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:40.170
<v Speaker 1>interior psychological structures were </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated and well put together,</v>

1018
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:43.860
<v Speaker 1>so your psyche was sort of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside your head,</v>

1019
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:48.750
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and sanity was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was an individual issue.</v>

1020
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.750
<v Speaker 1>But I think you know another way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at that at that,</v>

1021
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's a more powerful way of looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it,</v>

1022
00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:56.850
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're hardly self regulatory at</v>

1023
00:53:56.851 --> 00:53:59.610
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is behave well enough</v>

1024
00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:04.200
<v Speaker 1>so other people can stand being around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you can outsource the problem of</v>

1025
00:54:04.201 --> 00:54:05.034
<v Speaker 1>your own sanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as you get a little </v>

1026
00:54:06.661 --> 00:54:08.040
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have people around you,</v>

1027
00:54:08.041 --> 00:54:08.874
<v Speaker 1>they'll just tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't have to remember how </v>

1028
00:54:10.471 --> 00:54:11.430
<v Speaker 1>not to be weird.</v>

1029
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:14.640
<v Speaker 1>You just have to pay enough attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people around you.</v>

1030
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:15.653
<v Speaker 1>So that when they indicate by not </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to you are by not laughing at </v>

1031
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:21.630
<v Speaker 1>your jokes are by raising an eyebrow or </v>
<v Speaker 1>by saying something smart about what you</v>

1032
00:54:21.631 --> 00:54:26.610
<v Speaker 1>just did that you stop and reconsider </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go on in your same manner.</v>

1033
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:30.420
<v Speaker 1>So it's also why people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously isolated often,</v>

1034
00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:32.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a loop there,</v>

1035
00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:34.290
<v Speaker 1>they're a little queer to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1036
00:54:34.291 --> 00:54:35.124
<v Speaker 1>because you know there's something wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their ability to behave and then </v>

1037
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:42.730
<v Speaker 1>they get isolated and things just go </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously astray as a,</v>

1038
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.340
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1039
00:54:44.341 --> 00:54:45.174
<v Speaker 1>the point I'm trying to make is that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of your knowledge is actually </v>

1040
00:54:47.641 --> 00:54:50.280
<v Speaker 1>knowledge about how to behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1041
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:51.114
<v Speaker 1>And that's the sort of knowledge that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really critical for psychological </v>

1042
00:54:53.461 --> 00:54:54.500
<v Speaker 1>stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1043
00:54:54.501 --> 00:54:57.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not related in any real sense to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

1044
00:54:57.961 --> 00:55:00.750
<v Speaker 1>to the knowledge you have about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the objective world.</v>

1045
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.823
<v Speaker 1>And you kind of know that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals are perfectly capable of </v>

1046
00:55:04.261 --> 00:55:07.350
<v Speaker 1>surviving even complex animals like </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees,</v>

1047
00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.393
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know a damn thing about the </v>

1048
00:55:09.301 --> 00:55:10.950
<v Speaker 1>objective world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1049
00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.430
<v Speaker 1>And their primary reality is social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1050
00:55:14.431 --> 00:55:19.020
<v Speaker 1>So one domain of symbolic representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the dominance hierarchy.</v>

1051
00:55:19.021 --> 00:55:22.200
<v Speaker 1>And culturally I said that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the maternal and there's</v>

1052
00:55:22.201 --> 00:55:24.150
<v Speaker 1>reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's,</v>

1053
00:55:24.151 --> 00:55:26.580
<v Speaker 1>here's another thing that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized.</v>

1054
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:33.583
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1055
00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:34.993
<v Speaker 1>When you're walking down bloor street </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you make a detour around the person </v>

1056
00:55:39.261 --> 00:55:42.530
<v Speaker 1>who happens to be talking to themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are they?</v>

1057
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1058
00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Because wherever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the same place you are.</v>

1059
00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:48.723
<v Speaker 1>If it was the same place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have any trouble walking </v>

1060
00:55:50.051 --> 00:55:53.860
<v Speaker 1>right by them wherever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's somewhere seriously different.</v>

1061
00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.473
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that we also have the </v>

1062
00:55:57.191 --> 00:55:58.024
<v Speaker 1>capacity to represent that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say an easy way to think </v>

1063
00:56:01.841 --> 00:56:02.674
<v Speaker 1>about that is that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two domains that are </v>

1064
00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:05.494
<v Speaker 1>characteristic to experience and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain is the domain of the known and </v>

1065
00:56:10.541 --> 00:56:13.390
<v Speaker 1>the domain of the known is where when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you act in a certain way,</v>

1066
00:56:13.391 --> 00:56:16.390
<v Speaker 1>what you want to happen happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

1067
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:17.673
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that's the known is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you act in a certain way and </v>

1068
00:56:20.381 --> 00:56:22.990
<v Speaker 1>you get what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that you know what you're,</v>

1069
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.440
<v Speaker 1>it's actually the definition of knowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>

1070
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1071
00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.213
<v Speaker 1>And that that's a different definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I know a fact about the object of </v>

1072
00:56:31.311 --> 00:56:32.360
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1073
00:56:32.361 --> 00:56:33.194
<v Speaker 1>so if you tell someone to joke or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell a group of people a joke and you </v>

1074
00:56:35.841 --> 00:56:36.674
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they laugh and maybe they want another </v>

1075
00:56:37.641 --> 00:56:38.241
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1076
00:56:38.241 --> 00:56:39.950
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're doing.</v>

1077
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:41.850
<v Speaker 1>But if you tell them a joke and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta,</v>

1078
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look on easy and glance at each other,</v>

1079
00:56:44.541 --> 00:56:45.374
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time to rethink your sense of </v>

1080
00:56:46.461 --> 00:56:47.294
<v Speaker 1>humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you just learned is that </v>

1081
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:50.323
<v Speaker 1>there's some mismatch between the manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which you can figure social reality </v>

1082
00:56:53.421 --> 00:56:54.254
<v Speaker 1>and the social reality itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine what happens if you do tell </v>

1083
00:56:57.531 --> 00:57:00.560
<v Speaker 1>a joke or maybe a couple of jokes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they flopped badly.</v>

1084
00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:05.000
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel when that happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have any sense?</v>

1085
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:10.030
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Embarrassed.</v>

1086
00:57:10.061 --> 00:57:10.701
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1087
00:57:10.701 --> 00:57:12.940
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you turned red for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

1088
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:14.590
<v Speaker 1>What might happen if you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed?</v>

1089
00:57:14.591 --> 00:57:15.161
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would,</v>

1090
00:57:15.161 --> 00:57:16.030
<v Speaker 1>what would you do?</v>

1091
00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1092
00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salesmen jokes.</v>

1093
00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Well hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1094
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:20.991
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1095
00:57:20.991 --> 00:57:23.270
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd reevaluate your knowledge and,</v>

1096
00:57:23.271 --> 00:57:25.340
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what the Hell is wrong with me?</v>

1097
00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Or You might think what the Hell is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with them?</v>

1098
00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Which I would say is not a good starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1099
00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously though.</v>

1100
00:57:32.031 --> 00:57:32.864
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you got to watch that because if </v>

1101
00:57:33.891 --> 00:57:36.560
<v Speaker 1>it's 10 people and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're right,</v>

1102
00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:38.143
<v Speaker 1>maybe you are funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if all 10 of them think you're not </v>

1103
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:44.180
<v Speaker 1>well either you're not funny or you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling your jokes to the wrong people.</v>

1104
00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:45.373
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it is the case that it's </v>

1105
00:57:46.671 --> 00:57:48.170
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got the problem,</v>

1106
00:57:48.171 --> 00:57:49.004
<v Speaker 1>but that's definitely not the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis that you might want to </v>

1107
00:57:51.351 --> 00:57:52.790
<v Speaker 1>generate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1108
00:57:52.791 --> 00:57:57.791
<v Speaker 1>So there's a place that as a place that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists that manifests itself when things</v>

1109
00:57:59.331 --> 00:58:00.164
<v Speaker 1>that you don't want or expect happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would consider that unknown and </v>

1110
00:58:05.561 --> 00:58:06.394
<v Speaker 1>not known as a complicated place because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a place where unexpected things </v>

1111
00:58:08.951 --> 00:58:09.784
<v Speaker 1>happen and that's also symbolically </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented and that's generally </v>

1112
00:58:13.181 --> 00:58:15.850
<v Speaker 1>symbolically represented by feminine </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures.</v>

1113
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:17.283
<v Speaker 1>Now the reasons for that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily complicated and it's </v>

1114
00:58:19.301 --> 00:58:21.610
<v Speaker 1>going to take a very long time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain it.</v>

1115
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Partly it's because of the masculine has</v>
<v Speaker 1>a symbolic realm is already used up.</v>

1116
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:26.223
<v Speaker 1>That's the dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because we're basically social </v>

1117
00:58:28.781 --> 00:58:32.080
<v Speaker 1>cognitive organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to use</v>

1118
00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:34.400
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

1119
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:38.150
<v Speaker 1>representations that are basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

1120
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1121
00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.410
<v Speaker 1>In order to start representing things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't precisely human.</v>

1122
00:58:42.411 --> 00:58:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Because we have to start somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to start with our basic primate,</v>

1123
00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:47.293
<v Speaker 1>primate cognitive system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like chimpanzees have </v>

1124
00:58:50.091 --> 00:58:51.590
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1125
00:58:51.591 --> 00:58:53.390
<v Speaker 1>they have dominance hierarchies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops.</v>

1126
00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.433
<v Speaker 1>We have dominance hierarchies and troops</v>
<v Speaker 1>and culture and we have to represent </v>

1127
00:58:57.621 --> 00:58:58.454
<v Speaker 1>that some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way we represent it is by using </v>

1128
00:59:00.441 --> 00:59:02.390
<v Speaker 1>the same systems that we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>representing,</v>

1129
00:59:02.391 --> 00:59:03.224
<v Speaker 1>the simple structures with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generalizing with them to encompass </v>

1130
00:59:07.551 --> 00:59:08.130
<v Speaker 1>broader.</v>

1131
00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:10.200
<v Speaker 2>So no woman them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1132
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:12.533
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1133
00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:15.360
<v Speaker 1>things that are permanent across time,</v>

1134
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.240
<v Speaker 1>things you know or the fact that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are things that you know,</v>

1135
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.453
<v Speaker 1>things that you don't know or the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are things that you don't </v>

1136
00:59:25.491 --> 00:59:26.324
<v Speaker 1>know that's permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's one other thing across </v>

1137
00:59:28.611 --> 00:59:30.590
<v Speaker 1>time that's permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1138
00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.140
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there's an I in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation,</v>

1139
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:34.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>

1140
00:59:34.461 --> 00:59:35.294
<v Speaker 1>well what are people's experiential </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields fundamentally composed of places </v>

1141
00:59:41.871 --> 00:59:44.180
<v Speaker 1>you're secure in and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1142
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.193
<v Speaker 1>So that's your territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your territory is a very complex </v>

1143
00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:48.254
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might even be an ideological </v>

1144
00:59:48.981 --> 00:59:50.840
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your territory,</v>

1145
00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:54.230
<v Speaker 1>things that you don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not your territory,</v>

1146
00:59:54.231 --> 00:59:55.064
<v Speaker 1>that's unexplored territory and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what the hell is going on </v>

1147
00:59:57.171 --> 00:59:58.520
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the unknown.</v>

1148
00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:03.880
<v Speaker 1>And then the last common element is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so basic symbolic structures tend to</v>

1149
01:00:06.361 --> 01:00:11.361
<v Speaker 1>represent those elements of reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>known and the unknown.</v>

1150
01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that mediates between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1151
01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:14.183
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that mediates between them</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you or more precisely the thing that </v>

1152
01:00:17.341 --> 01:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>mediates between them as your individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

1153
01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's like mediating between chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and order.</v>

1154
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>If you look up at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the screen there,</v>

1155
01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>look at the the Christian image,</v>

1156
01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.030
<v Speaker 2>John the left</v>

1157
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.983
<v Speaker 1>that's called the open virgin and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are quite a few statues of this </v>

1158
01:00:39.371 --> 01:00:43.690
<v Speaker 1>sort that were created in medieval </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe and the 13th 14th century.</v>

1159
01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:45.423
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanna Sorta tell you what that </v>

1160
01:00:47.681 --> 01:00:48.514
<v Speaker 1>sculpture means using the analytic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schema that I just laid out for you so </v>

1161
01:00:55.631 --> 01:00:58.660
<v Speaker 1>that you can get a sense of how this </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic representation works.</v>

1162
01:00:59.080 --> 01:00:59.913
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a strange representation </v>

1163
01:01:01.841 --> 01:01:02.674
<v Speaker 1>from a Christian perspective because </v>
<v Speaker 1>while the representation is the Virgin </v>

1164
01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:06.371
<v Speaker 1>Mary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1165
01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:07.204
<v Speaker 1>that's the superordinate figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the female and inside that is God the </v>

1166
01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:14.930
<v Speaker 1>father and inside that is Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

1167
01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:15.993
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason it's a strange Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation is that it's rare to see </v>

1168
01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:25.411
<v Speaker 1>Mary represented as a figure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>superordinate to God and well,</v>

1169
01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.913
<v Speaker 1>we'll just leave that aside for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the reason that that </v>

1170
01:01:29.321 --> 01:01:33.490
<v Speaker 1>happens at that happened for these </v>
<v Speaker 1>sculptors is because they were trying to</v>

1171
01:01:33.491 --> 01:01:37.690
<v Speaker 1>express the relationship between these </v>
<v Speaker 1>three fundamental elements in a way that</v>

1172
01:01:37.691 --> 01:01:40.540
<v Speaker 1>was slightly different than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>canonical Christian representation.</v>

1173
01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:43.450
<v Speaker 1>But here's how to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1174
01:01:43.451 --> 01:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the unknown.</v>

1175
01:01:46.781 --> 01:01:48.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the mother of all things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

1176
01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:49.804
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is the unknown the mother of all </v>

1177
01:01:50.741 --> 01:01:52.840
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1178
01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.213
<v Speaker 1>where does new information come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>New information comes from what you </v>

1179
01:01:58.031 --> 01:02:00.400
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You already know what you know.</v>

1180
01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Everything new comes from what you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1181
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:05.950
<v Speaker 1>And so what you don't know is </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying,</v>

1182
01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:09.610
<v Speaker 1>certainly because God only knows what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen when you encounter it,</v>

1183
01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's also unbelievably potentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>

1184
01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:13.323
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think of it as potential now </v>

1185
01:02:15.401 --> 01:02:16.234
<v Speaker 1>known his potential itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need to know how to deal </v>

1186
01:02:18.851 --> 01:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because potential manifest itself in all</v>

1187
01:02:21.391 --> 01:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>sorts of places that you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily,</v>

1188
01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically you wouldn't expect.</v>

1189
01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.633
<v Speaker 1>It's almost by definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have the unknown on the very </v>

1190
01:02:30.901 --> 01:02:33.870
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then inside that you have culture.</v>

1191
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:36.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's like nature and culture as</v>

1192
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:37.524
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like unknown territory and </v>

1193
01:02:38.931 --> 01:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>known territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then inside the culture holding,</v>

1194
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>holding you up so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the individual.</v>

1195
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1196
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>why in this representation is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual crucified?</v>

1197
01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is quite straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

1198
01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Life is mostly suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's more to it though than that.</v>

1199
01:02:58.800 --> 01:02:59.633
<v Speaker 1>The other element to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is part of this as part of the </v>

1200
01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:06.570
<v Speaker 1>complex representational system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlies the symbolic representation of</v>

1201
01:03:06.571 --> 01:03:07.404
<v Speaker 1>the individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual is also something that </v>

1202
01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:09.894
<v Speaker 1>can die and be reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's symbolic representation </v>

1203
01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>already showed you in the figure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah,</v>

1204
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.233
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the idea was there that some </v>

1205
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:18.720
<v Speaker 1>terrible things swallowed this creature </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1206
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 1>pulled it down into the depths and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>let it reemerge.</v>

1207
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:25.260
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's happened to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>people many times already,</v>

1208
01:03:25.261 --> 01:03:30.261
<v Speaker 1>even though you probably don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think back when your experience,</v>

1209
01:03:30.331 --> 01:03:30.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1210
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.540
<v Speaker 1>so let's lay out a couple of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows about.</v>

1211
01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.553
<v Speaker 1>Someone close to you died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone close to you got a serious </v>

1212
01:03:37.141 --> 01:03:39.600
<v Speaker 1>illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a serious illness,</v>

1213
01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:44.360
<v Speaker 1>you are completely heartbroken because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it relationship failed catastrophic.</v>

1214
01:03:44.361 --> 01:03:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were betrayed by a friend.</v>

1215
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that for most of you at least,</v>

1216
01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:54.410
<v Speaker 1>well let's find out how many people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this room have had at least one of those</v>

1217
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:56.010
<v Speaker 1>things happen to them.</v>

1218
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1219
01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1220
01:03:58.781 --> 01:03:59.614
<v Speaker 1>And are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anybody in here who's got off </v>

1221
01:04:01.661 --> 01:04:03.130
<v Speaker 1>free from that so far?</v>

1222
01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff's good.</v>

1223
01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:07.700
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can see how,</v>

1224
01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:09.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably rare that is,</v>

1225
01:04:09.441 --> 01:04:10.274
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you must have had some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing happened to you with any </v>

1226
01:04:11.961 --> 01:04:12.950
<v Speaker 1>luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1227
01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:15.080
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1228
01:04:15.081 --> 01:04:18.440
<v Speaker 1>so you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you perfectly well understand what those</v>

1229
01:04:18.441 --> 01:04:20.870
<v Speaker 1>experiences are like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is</v>

1230
01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:26.150
<v Speaker 1>where do you go with an experience like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that occurs?</v>

1231
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:27.800
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what do you mean?</v>

1232
01:04:27.801 --> 01:04:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Where do you go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in the same place.</v>

1233
01:04:29.511 --> 01:04:30.680
<v Speaker 1>And I would say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

1234
01:04:30.681 --> 01:04:34.130
<v Speaker 1>it depends pretty much on exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean by a place.</v>

1235
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.983
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1236
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:39.263
<v Speaker 1>places are times too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can be one person at one moment </v>

1237
01:04:41.731 --> 01:04:42.564
<v Speaker 1>in the same place and a completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different person in the next moment in </v>

1238
01:04:45.241 --> 01:04:46.074
<v Speaker 1>the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means you're really not in the </v>

1239
01:04:47.371 --> 01:04:50.550
<v Speaker 1>same place at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when something comes along and pulls</v>

1240
01:04:50.551 --> 01:04:52.830
<v Speaker 1>the rug out from underneath you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you fall,</v>

1241
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:57.330
<v Speaker 1>when you fall into is the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a completely different place.</v>

1242
01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's the underworld of classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>

1243
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:01.223
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that it's the </v>

1244
01:05:03.751 --> 01:05:04.584
<v Speaker 1>unconscious so complicated when the rug </v>
<v Speaker 1>is pulled out from underneath you and </v>

1245
01:05:09.361 --> 01:05:12.930
<v Speaker 1>you're somewhere you don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>and didn't expect and didn't like,</v>

1246
01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:14.243
<v Speaker 1>what starts to structure how you respond</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the fundamental biological systems </v>

1247
01:05:18.011 --> 01:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>that make up the substrata of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>

1248
01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that might vital curry's</v>

1249
01:05:23.531 --> 01:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>that you experience it as a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>shock.</v>

1250
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:27.183
<v Speaker 1>And that's a physiological response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe right afterwards you're </v>

1251
01:05:29.621 --> 01:05:30.454
<v Speaker 1>angry or you're afraid or you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>confused or you're depressed or you </v>

1252
01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:35.380
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's another emotional response.</v>

1253
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.393
<v Speaker 1>And then you start to imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative scenarios are reasons why </v>

1254
01:05:39.011 --> 01:05:39.844
<v Speaker 1>this thing might have occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole set of processes that </v>

1255
01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:43.893
<v Speaker 1>are automatically undertaken when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter something that's outside the </v>

1256
01:05:47.021 --> 01:05:49.150
<v Speaker 1>realm of your expectation and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire.</v>

1257
01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:51.280
<v Speaker 1>And if you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

1258
01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:52.114
<v Speaker 1>if you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I've told you all these </v>

1259
01:05:53.561 --> 01:05:54.394
<v Speaker 1>complicated things today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you understand that that's a </v>

1260
01:05:56.621 --> 01:05:57.454
<v Speaker 1>different place and that you cycle </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that place and then back up to </v>

1261
01:06:01.151 --> 01:06:01.984
<v Speaker 1>normal reality and through that place </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then back up to normal reality </v>

1262
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:09.400
<v Speaker 1>multiple times throughout your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that one,</v>

1263
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:10.743
<v Speaker 1>it's inevitable that the individual is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that suffers to the </v>

1264
01:06:14.621 --> 01:06:15.454
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that can suffer and then </v>

1265
01:06:16.601 --> 01:06:19.450
<v Speaker 1>reconstitute itself as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that suffering.</v>

1266
01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:23.500
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't necessarily happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know now and then something can come</v>

1267
01:06:23.501 --> 01:06:26.890
<v Speaker 1>along and take you off at the knees and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just never get back up.</v>

1268
01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:28.623
<v Speaker 1>But the general human experiences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn as a consequence of your </v>

1269
01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:32.374
<v Speaker 1>failures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that the </v>

1270
01:06:34.631 --> 01:06:38.290
<v Speaker 1>place that you go when you fail has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of information in it.</v>

1271
01:06:38.291 --> 01:06:39.041
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1272
01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:42.730
<v Speaker 1>it might be that if you were betrayed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a relationship that you're just too damn</v>

1273
01:06:42.731 --> 01:06:46.690
<v Speaker 1>naive and there's a lot of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have paid attention to in the</v>

1274
01:06:46.691 --> 01:06:49.090
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe even within the person,</v>

1275
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:50.463
<v Speaker 1>the person who you are attracted to with</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to their character or your own </v>

1276
01:06:53.411 --> 01:06:55.840
<v Speaker 1>character that you should have known </v>
<v Speaker 1>more about.</v>

1277
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:57.580
<v Speaker 1>And if you would have known more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1278
01:06:57.970 --> 01:07:00.250
<v Speaker 1>well that would have been a particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole you wouldn't have stepped in.</v>

1279
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:01.870
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

1280
01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:05.530
<v Speaker 1>so the appropriate reaction to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic failure,</v>

1281
01:07:05.531 --> 01:07:06.364
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't always possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to react as how you're going to </v>

1282
01:07:09.761 --> 01:07:10.594
<v Speaker 1>react,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is usually it was shock and </v>

1283
01:07:11.801 --> 01:07:12.634
<v Speaker 1>dismay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to learn from the experience </v>

1284
01:07:14.681 --> 01:07:15.514
<v Speaker 1>and to gather whatever information there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in the failures so that you can </v>

1285
01:07:18.731 --> 01:07:19.564
<v Speaker 1>extract out that information and rebuild</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself out of it and restructure your </v>

1286
01:07:23.381 --> 01:07:25.750
<v Speaker 1>conception of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's richer and more dynamic.</v>

1287
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:30.310
<v Speaker 1>Now let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just give you an example of that.</v>

1288
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Remember the Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1289
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:37.953
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He spent a couple of hundred million </v>

1290
01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:40.413
<v Speaker 1>dollars on that movie and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was written in the 1960s but it was </v>

1291
01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:44.464
<v Speaker 1>based on very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old stories including some of the </v>

1292
01:07:46.151 --> 01:07:50.080
<v Speaker 1>north sagginess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the Hobbit at the beginning?</v>

1293
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I think we established that that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bilbo,</v>

1294
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.823
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he lives in this little area called </v>

1295
01:07:55.451 --> 01:07:56.284
<v Speaker 1>the shier that's really protected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of a little guy and all the </v>

1296
01:07:59.381 --> 01:08:00.214
<v Speaker 1>people in the shire kind of naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out in the Lord of the rings </v>

1297
01:08:02.531 --> 01:08:03.364
<v Speaker 1>that they're actually protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's these people called striders </v>

1298
01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:10.300
<v Speaker 1>that walk around the border who happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the sons of ancient kings who keep</v>

1299
01:08:10.301 --> 01:08:13.510
<v Speaker 1>all the bad guys away and the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>hobbits don't even know it.</v>

1300
01:08:13.511 --> 01:08:15.710
<v Speaker 1>And they're even kind of contemptuous of</v>
<v Speaker 1>striders.</v>

1301
01:08:15.711 --> 01:08:16.544
<v Speaker 1>But they're keeping these hobbits so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can be naive and self </v>

1302
01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:21.530
<v Speaker 1>satisfied and somewhat ignorant and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1303
01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:25.520
<v Speaker 1>a bit on the arrogant side without even </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that they're being protected.</v>

1304
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's you.</v>

1305
01:08:27.230 --> 01:08:29.540
<v Speaker 1>That's why you were hooked into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story right off the bat.</v>

1306
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:33.290
<v Speaker 1>And then they extract out one guy from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole scenario who's,</v>

1307
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:34.124
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a little bit more going for them </v>

1308
01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:35.624
<v Speaker 1>than the typical hobbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he wants to go outside of this </v>

1309
01:08:37.791 --> 01:08:39.710
<v Speaker 1>paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1310
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:40.753
<v Speaker 1>to encounter the actual world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so interesting because what's </v>

1311
01:08:43.521 --> 01:08:45.290
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his role?</v>

1312
01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>What do they hire him as a thief?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1313
01:08:48.651 --> 01:08:49.251
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>

1314
01:08:49.251 --> 01:08:52.010
<v Speaker 1>this is pretty weird disguise going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this developmental quest,</v>

1315
01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:54.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's going to turn into a hero.</v>

1316
01:08:54.111 --> 01:08:58.040
<v Speaker 1>And what does he start by doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He starts by becoming a criminal.</v>

1317
01:08:58.730 --> 01:08:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

1318
01:08:59.690 --> 01:09:02.020
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be part of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually part of their,</v>

1319
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:04.070
<v Speaker 1>his heroic transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1320
01:09:04.071 --> 01:09:08.990
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you said about heroic </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations was that the first thing</v>

1321
01:09:08.991 --> 01:09:11.690
<v Speaker 1>that happens when you put your self out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of side,</v>

1322
01:09:11.691 --> 01:09:14.180
<v Speaker 1>your zone of comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do that voluntarily,</v>

1323
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.313
<v Speaker 1>is that you encounter your shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the part of you that is </v>

1324
01:09:17.781 --> 01:09:21.320
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antisocial and criminal.</v>

1325
01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:24.040
<v Speaker 1>And then you extract from that element </v>
<v Speaker 1>of yourself,</v>

1326
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:28.100
<v Speaker 1>those personality attributes you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive when you're outside,</v>

1327
01:09:28.101 --> 01:09:29.870
<v Speaker 1>where everything is comfortable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable.</v>

1328
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:34.550
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens with bill bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>while he encounters a dragon,</v>

1329
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:35.413
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the dragon we talked about </v>

1330
01:09:36.351 --> 01:09:37.184
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that swallows you up </v>

1331
01:09:38.391 --> 01:09:40.460
<v Speaker 1>when you don't know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had,</v>

1332
01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:42.620
<v Speaker 1>and he gets a treasure as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

1333
01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:44.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

1334
01:09:44.091 --> 01:09:47.270
<v Speaker 1>what the story means is that if you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside your zone of comfort,</v>

1335
01:09:47.271 --> 01:09:49.220
<v Speaker 1>if you go outside of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

1336
01:09:49.221 --> 01:09:50.054
<v Speaker 1>and you do that voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you develop the skills that you've </v>

1337
01:09:53.001 --> 01:09:53.834
<v Speaker 1>rejected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are necessary for your proper </v>

1338
01:09:56.031 --> 01:09:56.864
<v Speaker 1>survival as an integrated human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can encounter the thing that most </v>

1339
01:10:00.111 --> 01:10:00.944
<v Speaker 1>frightens you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can extract something of value </v>

1340
01:10:03.501 --> 01:10:06.170
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the human story.</v>

1341
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:11.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental story of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're always the thing that goes</v>

1342
01:10:11.571 --> 01:10:12.404
<v Speaker 1>outside of what we understand to </v>
<v Speaker 1>confront what we don't understand that </v>

1343
01:10:15.441 --> 01:10:18.980
<v Speaker 1>frightens us so that we can get whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing has.</v>

1344
01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:20.563
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations that you need to </v>

1345
01:10:22.671 --> 01:10:23.504
<v Speaker 1>understand in order for us to continue </v>
<v Speaker 1>to develop our investigation of </v>

1346
01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.660
<v Speaker 1>phenomena like unconscious symbolism.</v>

1347
01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:35.850
<v Speaker 2>So that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See you next [inaudible].</v>
