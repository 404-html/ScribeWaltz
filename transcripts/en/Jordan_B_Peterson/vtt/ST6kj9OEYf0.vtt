00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Put me into minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even mediocre minds operate better under</v>

2
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:27.354
<v Speaker 1>stimulus.</v>

3
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Cod Canadian is a Canadian and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>take away</v>

4
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.390
<v Speaker 2>someone got into.</v>

5
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.473
<v Speaker 3>Barack Obama has systematically rebuild </v>
<v Speaker 3>the trust of the world in our </v>

6
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:43.550
<v Speaker 3>willingness to work through the Security</v>
<v Speaker 3>Council and other institutions.</v>

7
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.400
<v Speaker 3>You must not talk to anybody in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

8
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.263
<v Speaker 3>any of our allies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if whatever you want to call this </v>

9
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:49.490
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mafia,</v>

10
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:53.660
<v Speaker 3>state of feudal empire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a disaster for ordinary Russians.</v>

11
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant minds getting mediocre minds </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate better under stimulus.</v>

12
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Cod Canadian is a Canadian and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>take away away,</v>

13
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.223
<v Speaker 3>has systematically rebuild the trust of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world in our willingness to work </v>

14
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:26.060
<v Speaker 3>through the Security Council and other </v>
<v Speaker 3>institution.</v>

15
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.880
<v Speaker 3>You must not talk to anybody in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

16
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.460
<v Speaker 3>any of our allies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call this system,</v>

17
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:33.770
<v Speaker 3>a mafia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>state of feudal empire.</v>

18
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.993
<v Speaker 3>It's a disaster for ordinary Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the kind of hypocritical </v>

19
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 3>argument that if I were tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find quite annoying.</v>

20
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 3>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in Belize you can beat it.</v>

21
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Described it's been bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

22
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.723
<v Speaker 3>management,</v>
<v Speaker 3>science and religion are not </v>

23
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:53.960
<v Speaker 3>incompatible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Religion Forces Nice people to do unkind</v>

24
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amen.</v>

25
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Obsolete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

26
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:57.770
<v Speaker 3>Mike conclusion to this question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

27
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.970
<v Speaker 3>I won't let you be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

28
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 3>show me yours pretext.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I quoted them saying,</v>

29
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 3>show me the free program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can keep screaming,</v>

30
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't change the points.</v>

31
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 3>We do not want sympathy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did not want pity.</v>

32
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 3>We want opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an appalling slander to me,</v>

33
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.250
<v Speaker 3>to the Muslim religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never said the word Muslim in my film,</v>

34
00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 3>the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a Muslim free form in nature.</v>

35
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 3>It is that kind of restraint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is that kind of sober minded,</v>

36
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.774
<v Speaker 3>sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent foreign policy that Obama </v>

37
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:31.354
<v Speaker 3>represents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess what I'm telling you is he </v>

38
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.400
<v Speaker 3>sort of a closet Canadian vote for him </v>
<v Speaker 3>for God.</v>

39
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.793
<v Speaker 4>Sorry</v>

<v Speaker 5>silence.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for those of you watching online right </v>

122
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:57.990

<v Speaker 5>we haven't running pole a ww munk,</v>

123
00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:01.770
<v Speaker 5>debates.com,</v>
<v Speaker 5>forward slash votes reflect input,</v>

124
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 5>react to this debate as it unfolds over </v>
<v Speaker 5>the next hour and a half.</v>

125
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my favorite part aspect of the show that</v>

126
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:13.410
<v Speaker 5>was Peter's a brilliance and creation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have our countdown clock.</v>

127
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.540
<v Speaker 5>What this does is it keeps our debaters </v>
<v Speaker 5>on their toes and our debate on time.</v>

128
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 5>So when you see these clocks on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>screen,</v>

129
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:21.414
<v Speaker 5>go down to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted you to join me in a warm round </v>

130
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:27.150
<v Speaker 5>of applause and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

131
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.980
<v Speaker 5>we'll have a debate that ends when it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to end.</v>

132
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.420
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

133
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.690
<v Speaker 5>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had our resolution tonight on the way</v>

134
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:37.524
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have this audience of roughly 3000 </v>

135
00:10:38.821 --> 00:10:39.654
<v Speaker 5>people here in downtown Toronto vote on </v>
<v Speaker 5>be it resolved what you call political </v>

136
00:10:43.651 --> 00:10:45.690
<v Speaker 5>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I call progress.</v>

137
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.170
<v Speaker 5>Let's see the agreed disagree on that </v>
<v Speaker 5>number.</v>

138
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 5>36% agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>64% disagree.</v>

139
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:53.724
<v Speaker 5>So a room and play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we asked you how many of you are </v>

140
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:01.290
<v Speaker 5>open to changing your vote over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>course of the debate?</v>

141
00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 5>Are you fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>agree,</v>

142
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:06.270
<v Speaker 5>disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or could you potentially be convinced by</v>

143
00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:11.271
<v Speaker 5>one or other of these two teams to move </v>
<v Speaker 5>your vote over the next hour and a half?</v>

144
00:11:11.461 --> 00:11:14.700
<v Speaker 5>Let's see those numbers now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

145
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.800
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A pretty open minded crowd.</v>

146
00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:21.801
<v Speaker 5>This debate is very much in play and as </v>
<v Speaker 5>per the agreed upon order of speakers,</v>

147
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:25.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to call him Michelle Goldberg </v>
<v Speaker 5>first.</v>

148
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.410
<v Speaker 5>Michelle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you like a sip of water?</v>

149
00:11:26.411 --> 00:11:27.280
<v Speaker 5>Are you gonna have a sip of water?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

150
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.510
<v Speaker 5>we're ready to start a column.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michelle Goldberg first for her.</v>

151
00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:32.770
<v Speaker 5>Six minutes of opening remarks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michelle,</v>

152
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Speaker 5>thank you for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as regular notice,</v>

153
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.673
<v Speaker 5>I initially balked a little bit at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>resolution that we're debating because </v>

154
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:42.324
<v Speaker 5>there are a lot of things that fall </v>
<v Speaker 5>under the rubric of political </v>

155
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:45.024
<v Speaker 5>correctness that I don't call progress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like no platforming or twitter </v>

156
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.360
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

157
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 5>trigger warnings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

158
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a lot of</v>

159
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.903
<v Speaker 6>middle age liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are many aspects of students' </v>

160
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:00.010
<v Speaker 6>social justice culture that I find off </v>
<v Speaker 6>putting,</v>

161
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 6>although I'm not sure that that </v>
<v Speaker 6>particular generation gap is anything,</v>

162
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.073
<v Speaker 6>is anything new.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm on the record about the toxicity of </v>

163
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:09.100
<v Speaker 6>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 6>call out culture.</v>

164
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 6>And I think it's good to debate people </v>
<v Speaker 6>whose ideas I don't like,</v>

165
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 6>which is why I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

166
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 6>so if there are social justice warriors </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the audience,</v>

167
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:20.530
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I should apologize to you </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I'm probably not,</v>

168
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:24.790
<v Speaker 6>you're probably gonna feel like I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 6>adequately defending your ideas.</v>

169
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.673
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the reason I'm on this side of the </v>

170
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:33.451
<v Speaker 6>stage is that political correctness </v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't just a term for left wing excesses</v>

171
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:34.323
<v Speaker 6>on college campuses or people being </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrible on twitter especially is </v>

172
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:41.920
<v Speaker 6>deployed by Mr. Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it can be a way to deal,</v>

173
00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 6>legitimize any attempt for women and </v>
<v Speaker 6>racial and sexual minorities to overcome</v>

174
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 6>discrimination or even to argue that </v>
<v Speaker 6>such discrimination is real.</v>

175
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.540
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the New York Times today,</v>

176
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.630
<v Speaker 6>Mr. Peterson says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

177
00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.070
<v Speaker 6>the people who hold that aisle that our </v>
<v Speaker 6>culture isn't an oppressive patriarchy.</v>

178
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 6>They don't want to admit that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>current hierarchy might be predicated on</v>

179
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:03.844
<v Speaker 6>competence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That sounds particularly in scene to me </v>

180
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:09.400
<v Speaker 6>because I'm an American and our </v>
<v Speaker 6>president is Donald Trump.</v>

181
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.263
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

182
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:12.483
<v Speaker 6>but it's an assumption that I think </v>
<v Speaker 6>underlies a worldview in which any </v>

183
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 6>challenges to the current hierarchy are </v>
<v Speaker 6>written off as political correctness.</v>

184
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.693
<v Speaker 6>I also think we should be clear that </v>
<v Speaker 6>this isn't really a debate about free </v>

185
00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:25.780
<v Speaker 6>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

186
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:26.883
<v Speaker 6>Mr. Peterson once referred to what he </v>
<v Speaker 6>called quote that evil trinity of </v>

187
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:33.130
<v Speaker 6>equity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>diversity and inclusivity and said those</v>

188
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:33.964
<v Speaker 6>three words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you hear people mouth those three </v>

189
00:13:35.561 --> 00:13:36.880
<v Speaker 6>words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>equity,</v>

190
00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:38.410
<v Speaker 6>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and inclusivity,</v>

191
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.350
<v Speaker 6>you know who you're dealing with and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>should step away from that because it is</v>

192
00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:43.070
<v Speaker 6>not acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

193
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.390
<v Speaker 6>he argues that the movie frozen is </v>
<v Speaker 6>politically correct propaganda.</v>

194
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:51.450
<v Speaker 6>And at one point he floated the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 6>creating a database of university course</v>

195
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:54.730
<v Speaker 6>content so students could avoid </v>
<v Speaker 6>postmodern critical theory.</v>

196
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.940
<v Speaker 6>So in the criticism of political </v>
<v Speaker 6>correctness,</v>

197
00:13:57.941 --> 00:13:58.774
<v Speaker 6>I sometimes hear an urge or an attempt </v>
<v Speaker 6>to purge our thought of certain </v>

198
00:14:03.281 --> 00:14:04.114
<v Speaker 6>analytical categories that viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the worst characatures of the </v>

199
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:09.334
<v Speaker 6>social justice left that want to get rid</v>
<v Speaker 6>of anything that smacks of colonialism </v>

200
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.040
<v Speaker 6>or patriarchy or white supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I also don't really think we're debating</v>

201
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 6>the value of the enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

202
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.630
<v Speaker 6>at least not in the way that somebody </v>
<v Speaker 6>like Mr. Frye.</v>

203
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.000
<v Speaker 6>I think as a champion of enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 6>values springs,</v>

204
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:25.834
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that Fritz to expand rights and </v>

205
00:14:27.371 --> 00:14:28.204
<v Speaker 6>privileges once granted just to land </v>
<v Speaker 6>owning white heterosexual men is the </v>

206
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:34.084
<v Speaker 6>enlightenment or it's very much in </v>
<v Speaker 6>keeping with the enlightenment to quote </v>

207
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.870
<v Speaker 6>a dead white man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>John Stuart Mill,</v>

208
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.793
<v Speaker 6>the despotism of custom is everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the standing hindrance to human </v>

209
00:14:45.431 --> 00:14:46.360
<v Speaker 6>advancement.</v>

210
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:47.703
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that some of our opponents by </v>

211
00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:55.591
<v Speaker 6>contrast challenges to the despotism of </v>
<v Speaker 6>custom as politically correct attacks on</v>

212
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:59.250
<v Speaker 6>a transcendent natural order.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

213
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.210
<v Speaker 6>to quote Mr. Peterson again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>each gender,</v>

214
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:04.670
<v Speaker 6>each sex has its own and fairness to </v>
<v Speaker 6>deal with.</v>

215
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.330
<v Speaker 6>But to think of it as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the shoulders of the social structure.</v>

216
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:09.200
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come on,</v>

217
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.270
<v Speaker 6>really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What about nature itself?</v>

218
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.330
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's an exception to this because</v>

219
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:18.830
<v Speaker 6>he does believe in social interventions </v>
<v Speaker 6>to remedy some kinds of unfairness,</v>

220
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.143
<v Speaker 6>which is why in the New York Times he </v>
<v Speaker 6>calls for quote enforced monogamy to </v>

221
00:15:23.241 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Speaker 6>remedy the woes of men who don't get </v>
<v Speaker 6>their equal distribution of sex.</v>

222
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.303
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when it comes to the political </v>

223
00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:30.464
<v Speaker 6>correctness debate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've been exactly here before the Alan </v>

224
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.233
<v Speaker 6>Blum,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the author of the closing of the </v>

225
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:40.691
<v Speaker 6>American mind compared the tyranny of </v>
<v Speaker 6>feminism in academia to the Khmer Rouge.</v>

226
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:46.210
<v Speaker 6>And he was writing at a time when women </v>
<v Speaker 6>accounted for 10% of all college tenured</v>

227
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:47.084
<v Speaker 6>faculty.</v>

228
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 6>It's worth looking back at what was </v>
<v Speaker 6>considered annoyingly,</v>

229
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:51.854
<v Speaker 6>outrageously,</v>
<v Speaker 6>politically correct in the 1980s the </v>

230
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:56.450
<v Speaker 6>last time we had this debate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

231
00:15:56.451 --> 00:16:00.020
<v Speaker 6>having to call or not being able to call</v>
<v Speaker 6>indigenous people,</v>

232
00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Speaker 6>quote Indians are having to use </v>
<v Speaker 6>hyphenated terms,</v>

233
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:06.200
<v Speaker 6>at least in the United States of terms </v>
<v Speaker 6>like African Americans,</v>

234
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.393
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>adding women or people of color to the </v>

235
00:16:08.331 --> 00:16:09.164
<v Speaker 6>western Civ curriculum,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not making gay jokes or using retard is </v>

236
00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:15.710
<v Speaker 6>an epithet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I kind of get it,</v>

237
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>new concepts,</v>

238
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.193
<v Speaker 6>new words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of sticking your throat the way </v>

239
00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:24.770
<v Speaker 6>we're used to talking and thinking seem </v>
<v Speaker 6>natural and normal,</v>

240
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by definition.</v>

241
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:32.380
<v Speaker 6>And then the new terms and new concepts </v>
<v Speaker 6>that have social utility stick and those</v>

242
00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:36.110
<v Speaker 6>that don't fall away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if you go back to the 1970s,</v>

243
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.251
<v Speaker 6>ms,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

244
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:42.251
<v Speaker 6>ms as an alternative to miss or Mrs </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuck around and women with a y didn't.</v>

245
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:43.993
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think that some day I hope that </v>

246
00:16:45.551 --> 00:16:46.384
<v Speaker 6>someday we'll look back and marvel at </v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea that gender neutral pronouns </v>

247
00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:52.940
<v Speaker 6>ever seen like an existential threat to </v>
<v Speaker 6>anyone.</v>

248
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.850
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I also don't think it's clear that,</v>

249
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:56.743
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that might not happen because if you </v>

250
00:16:58.791 --> 00:16:59.624
<v Speaker 6>look around the world right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are plenty of places that have </v>

251
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:03.314
<v Speaker 6>indeed dialed back cosmopolitanism and </v>
<v Speaker 6>reinstated patriarchy in the name of </v>

252
00:17:07.011 --> 00:17:11.840
<v Speaker 6>staving off chaos and they seem like </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrible places to live.</v>

253
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:12.920
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

254
00:17:12.921 --> 00:17:13.754
<v Speaker 6>I come to you from the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is currently undergoing a </v>

255
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:18.344
<v Speaker 6>monumental attempt to roll back social </v>
<v Speaker 6>progress in the name of overcoming </v>

256
00:17:21.711 --> 00:17:24.710
<v Speaker 6>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And as someone who lives there,</v>

257
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:27.560
<v Speaker 6>I assure you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it feels nothing like progress.</v>

258
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.453
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

259
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:34.910
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

260
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.670
<v Speaker 6>great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Start to the debate Michelle.</v>

261
00:17:39.671 --> 00:17:40.504
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm now going to ask Jordan Peterson to </v>

262
00:17:41.921 --> 00:17:43.260
<v Speaker 6>speak for the con team.</v>

263
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.943
<v Speaker 4>Hello.</v>

264
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.470
<v Speaker 7>So we should first decide what we're </v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about.</v>

265
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:57.683
<v Speaker 7>We're not talking about my views of </v>
<v Speaker 7>political correctness despite what you </v>

266
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:04.650
<v Speaker 7>might have inferred from the last </v>
<v Speaker 7>speaker's comments.</v>

267
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.203
<v Speaker 7>This is how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We essentially need something </v>

268
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:14.151
<v Speaker 7>approximating a low resolution grant </v>
<v Speaker 7>narrative to unitus and,</v>

269
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 7>and we did a narrative to is because </v>
<v Speaker 7>otherwise we don't have peace.</v>

270
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.873
<v Speaker 7>What's playing out in the universities </v>
<v Speaker 7>and in broader society right now is a </v>

271
00:18:23.551 --> 00:18:26.940
<v Speaker 7>debate between two fundamental low </v>
<v Speaker 7>resolution narratives.</v>

272
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.043
<v Speaker 7>Neither of which can be completely </v>
<v Speaker 7>accurate because they can't encompass </v>

273
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:31.074
<v Speaker 7>all the details.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Obviously human beings have an </v>

274
00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:34.800
<v Speaker 7>individual element and a collective </v>
<v Speaker 7>element,</v>

275
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.023
<v Speaker 7>a group element.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's say the question is what story </v>

276
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:39.324
<v Speaker 7>should be paramount?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And this is how it looks to me in the </v>

277
00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:46.680
<v Speaker 7>west,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have reasonably functional,</v>

278
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:49.500
<v Speaker 7>reasonably free,</v>
<v Speaker 7>remarkably productive,</v>

279
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:50.334
<v Speaker 7>stable hierarchies that are open to </v>
<v Speaker 7>consideration of the dispossessed that </v>

280
00:18:56.521 --> 00:18:58.860
<v Speaker 7>hierarchies generally create.</v>

281
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:04.490
<v Speaker 7>Our societies are freer and functioning </v>
<v Speaker 7>more effectively than any societies,</v>

282
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.660
<v Speaker 7>anywhere else in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that,</v>

283
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.870
<v Speaker 7>and then any societies ever have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And as far as I'm concerned,</v>

284
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.820
<v Speaker 7>and I think there's good reason to </v>
<v Speaker 7>assume this,</v>

285
00:19:11.821 --> 00:19:14.400
<v Speaker 7>it's because the fundamental low </v>
<v Speaker 7>resolution,</v>

286
00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.513
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>grant narrative that we've oriented </v>

287
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:20.370
<v Speaker 7>ourselves around in the West is one of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the sovereignty of the individual.</v>

288
00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:25.230
<v Speaker 7>And it's predicated on the idea that all</v>
<v Speaker 7>things considered the best way for me to</v>

289
00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:26.064
<v Speaker 7>interact with someone else's individual </v>
<v Speaker 7>to individual and to react to that </v>

290
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:33.630
<v Speaker 7>person as if they're both part of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>process.</v>

291
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.220
<v Speaker 7>Because that's the right way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 7>about it.</v>

292
00:19:35.221 --> 00:19:36.054
<v Speaker 7>The psychological process by which </v>
<v Speaker 7>things we don't understand can yet be </v>

293
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:43.410
<v Speaker 7>explored and buy things that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 7>properly organized in our society can be</v>

294
00:19:43.411 --> 00:19:44.244
<v Speaker 7>yet set.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

295
00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.770
<v Speaker 7>And the reason we're valuable as </v>
<v Speaker 7>individuals,</v>

296
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:47.813
<v Speaker 7>both with regards to our rights and </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsibilities is because that's our </v>

297
00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:51.390
<v Speaker 7>essential purpose.</v>

298
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 7>And that's our nobility and that's our </v>
<v Speaker 7>function.</v>

299
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:58.590
<v Speaker 7>What's happening as far as I'm concerned</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the universities in particular,</v>

300
00:19:58.591 --> 00:20:00.840
<v Speaker 7>and spreading very rapidly out into the </v>
<v Speaker 7>broader world,</v>

301
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 7>including the corporate world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>much to it's much to what should be,</v>

302
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:06.294
<v Speaker 7>its chagrin is a collectivist narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And of course there's some utility in a </v>

303
00:20:11.581 --> 00:20:14.520
<v Speaker 7>collectivist narrative cause we're all a</v>
<v Speaker 7>part of groups in different ways.</v>

304
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.623
<v Speaker 7>But the collectivist narrative that I </v>
<v Speaker 7>regard as politically correct as a </v>

305
00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:19.524
<v Speaker 7>pastiche of a strange pastiche of </v>
<v Speaker 7>postmodernism and neo Marxism and its </v>

306
00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:27.660
<v Speaker 7>fundamental claim is that no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're not essentially an individual.</v>

307
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.613
<v Speaker 7>You're essentially a member of a group.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that group might be your ethnicity </v>

308
00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:35.490
<v Speaker 7>and it might be your sex and it might be</v>
<v Speaker 7>a race.</v>

309
00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:36.324
<v Speaker 7>And it might be any of the endless </v>
<v Speaker 7>numbers of other potential groups that </v>

310
00:20:39.481 --> 00:20:40.314
<v Speaker 7>you belong to because you belong to many</v>
<v Speaker 7>of them and that you should be </v>

311
00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:44.184
<v Speaker 7>essentially categorized along with those</v>
<v Speaker 7>who are light cue on that dimension in </v>

312
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:47.590
<v Speaker 7>that group.</v>

313
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.423
<v Speaker 7>That's proposition number one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Proposition number two is that the </v>

314
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:51.724
<v Speaker 7>proper way to view the world is as a </v>
<v Speaker 7>battle ground between groups of </v>

315
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:59.650
<v Speaker 7>different power so you define the groups</v>
<v Speaker 7>first and then you assume that you,</v>

316
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.890
<v Speaker 7>you you view the individual from the </v>
<v Speaker 7>group context.</v>

317
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:03.724
<v Speaker 7>You viewed the battle between groups </v>
<v Speaker 7>from the group context and you view </v>

318
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:07.294
<v Speaker 7>history itself as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 7>nothing but the power maneuvers between </v>

319
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:14.020
<v Speaker 7>different groups.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That eliminates any consideration of the</v>

320
00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:14.854
<v Speaker 7>individual and at a very fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 7>level and also any idea for example of </v>

321
00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:23.650
<v Speaker 7>free speech because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>collectivist at heart in this manner,</v>

322
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.633
<v Speaker 7>there is no such thing as free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It isn't that it's debated by those on </v>

323
00:21:28.271 --> 00:21:31.690
<v Speaker 7>the radical left and let's say the rest </v>
<v Speaker 7>of us so to speak.</v>

324
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 7>It's that in that formulation there's no</v>
<v Speaker 7>such thing as free speech because for an</v>

325
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:37.870
<v Speaker 7>individualist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>free speech is how you make sense of the</v>

326
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 7>world and reorganize society in a proper</v>
<v Speaker 7>manner.</v>

327
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.300
<v Speaker 7>But for the radical left type </v>
<v Speaker 7>collectivist,</v>

328
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.910
<v Speaker 7>it's associated with this viewpoint of </v>
<v Speaker 7>political correctness.</v>

329
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.640
<v Speaker 7>When you speak,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all you're doing is playing a power game</v>

330
00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:49.474
<v Speaker 7>on behalf of your group and there's </v>
<v Speaker 7>nothing else that you can do because </v>

331
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:52.653
<v Speaker 7>that's all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And not only is that all there is in </v>

332
00:21:55.451 --> 00:21:58.990
<v Speaker 7>terms of who you are as an individual </v>
<v Speaker 7>now and how society should be viewed.</v>

333
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.360
<v Speaker 7>It's also the fundamental narrative of </v>
<v Speaker 7>history.</v>

334
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 7>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

335
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.153
<v Speaker 7>it's widely assumed in our universities </v>
<v Speaker 7>now that the best way to conceptualize </v>

336
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:08.703
<v Speaker 7>Western civilization is as an oppressive</v>
<v Speaker 7>male dominated patriarchy and that the </v>

337
00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:13.624
<v Speaker 7>best way to construe relationships </v>
<v Speaker 7>between men and women across the </v>

338
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:20.080
<v Speaker 7>centuries is one of oppression of women </v>
<v Speaker 7>by men as like,</v>

339
00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:21.370
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

340
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.550
<v Speaker 7>no hierarchy is without its tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a,</v>

341
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.633
<v Speaker 7>that's an axiomatic truth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People have recognized that literally </v>

342
00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:30.424
<v Speaker 7>for thousands of years and hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 7>do tend towards tyranny and they tend </v>

343
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Speaker 7>towards the usurpation by people with </v>
<v Speaker 7>power,</v>

344
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.403
<v Speaker 7>but that only happens when they become </v>
<v Speaker 7>corrupt and we have mechanisms in our </v>

345
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:44.650
<v Speaker 7>society to stop hierarchies from </v>
<v Speaker 7>becoming intolerable,</v>

346
00:22:44.651 --> 00:22:45.484
<v Speaker 7>be corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they actually work pretty well and </v>

347
00:22:47.171 --> 00:22:48.430
<v Speaker 7>so and so.</v>

348
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.170
<v Speaker 7>I would also,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would also,</v>

349
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.390
<v Speaker 7>I would also point this out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

350
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:53.703
<v Speaker 7>don't be thinking that this is a debate </v>
<v Speaker 7>about whether empathy is useful or not </v>

351
00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.130
<v Speaker 7>or that the people on the con side of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the argument are not empathetic.</v>

352
00:23:00.131 --> 00:23:03.070
<v Speaker 7>I know perfectly well as I'm as an sure </v>
<v Speaker 7>Mr. Fry does that.</v>

353
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.293
<v Speaker 7>Hierarchies tend to produce situations </v>
<v Speaker 7>where people stack up at the bottom and </v>

354
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:10.510
<v Speaker 7>that the dispossessed and hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 7>need a political voice,</v>

355
00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:12.390
<v Speaker 7>which is the proper voice of the left by</v>
<v Speaker 7>the way,</v>

356
00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:13.224
<v Speaker 7>and the necessary voice of the left.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But that is not the same as proclaiming </v>

357
00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:17.494
<v Speaker 7>that the right level of analysis for our</v>
<v Speaker 7>grand unifying narrative is that all of </v>

358
00:23:21.071 --> 00:23:21.904
<v Speaker 7>us are fundamentally to be identified by</v>
<v Speaker 7>the groups that we belong to and to </v>

359
00:23:25.961 --> 00:23:26.794
<v Speaker 7>construe the entire world as the </v>
<v Speaker 7>battleground between different forms of </v>

360
00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:33.550
<v Speaker 7>tyranny in consequence of that group </v>
<v Speaker 7>affiliation.</v>

361
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.940
<v Speaker 7>And to the degree that we play out that </v>
<v Speaker 7>narrative,</v>

362
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.800
<v Speaker 7>that won't be progress.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Believe me.</v>

363
00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.770
<v Speaker 7>And we certainly haven't seen that </v>
<v Speaker 7>progress in the universities.</v>

364
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:46.210
<v Speaker 7>We've seen situations like what happened</v>
<v Speaker 7>at Wilfrid laurier university had stead,</v>

365
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:47.083
<v Speaker 8>we won't see progress.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What will return to is exactly the same </v>

366
00:23:49.731 --> 00:23:51.840
<v Speaker 8>kind of tribalism to characterize the </v>
<v Speaker 8>lab.</v>

367
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.940
<v Speaker 4>Thank you Jordan.</v>

368
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.991
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Michael,</v>

369
00:24:02.991 --> 00:24:05.720
<v Speaker 8>Eric Dyson.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Your six minutes starts now.</v>

370
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:07.993
<v Speaker 8>Thank you very kindly.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wonderful opportunity to be here in </v>

371
00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:12.920
<v Speaker 8>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

372
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.400
<v Speaker 8>well thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to stand here at the podium.</v>

373
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:17.234
<v Speaker 8>I'm a preacher</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I will ask for an offering at the </v>

374
00:24:20.961 --> 00:24:21.794
<v Speaker 8>end of my presentation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is the swimsuit competition of the </v>

375
00:24:25.941 --> 00:24:26.774
<v Speaker 8>intellectual beauty pageant.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So let me show you the curves of my </v>

376
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:32.720
<v Speaker 8>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>

377
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:35.090
<v Speaker 8>Was that a politically incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 8>statement I just made?</v>

378
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.793
<v Speaker 8>How did we get to the point where the </v>
<v Speaker 8>hijacking of the discourse on political </v>

379
00:24:40.641 --> 00:24:45.641
<v Speaker 8>correctness has become a kind of magnet </v>
<v Speaker 8>keen distinction between us and them?</v>

380
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.353
<v Speaker 8>The abortive fantasy just presented is </v>
<v Speaker 8>remarkable for both its clarity and yet </v>

381
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.250
<v Speaker 8>the muddiness of the context from which </v>
<v Speaker 8>it has emerged.</v>

382
00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.500
<v Speaker 8>What's interesting to me is that when we</v>
<v Speaker 8>look at the radical left,</v>

383
00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:01.910
<v Speaker 8>I'm saying where he had,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I want to join them,</v>

384
00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:03.973
<v Speaker 8>they ain't run enough,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I'm from a country where a man </v>

385
00:25:05.301 --> 00:25:06.134
<v Speaker 8>stands up everyday to tweet the moral </v>
<v Speaker 8>mendacity of his viciousness into a </v>

386
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:13.670
<v Speaker 8>nation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He has turned into his psychic commode.</v>

387
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.870
<v Speaker 8>Y'All got justin,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we got Donald.</v>

388
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.610
<v Speaker 8>So what's interesting then is that </v>
<v Speaker 8>political correctness has transmogrified</v>

389
00:25:27.611 --> 00:25:31.180
<v Speaker 8>into a caricature of the left.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The left came up with the term political</v>

390
00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:33.070
<v Speaker 8>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Shell out reminds you,</v>

391
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:37.390
<v Speaker 8>we were tired of our excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In our excesses in are exaggerations.</v>

392
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.110
<v Speaker 8>We were willing to be self critical in a</v>
<v Speaker 8>way that I fear my call friends.</v>

393
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:45.730
<v Speaker 8>My compatriots are not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Don't take yourself too seriously.</v>

394
00:25:45.731 --> 00:25:49.690
<v Speaker 8>Smile.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Take yourself not seriously at all,</v>

395
00:25:49.691 --> 00:25:53.770
<v Speaker 8>but what you do with deadly seriousness.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now it is transmogrified into an attempt</v>

396
00:25:53.771 --> 00:25:54.604
<v Speaker 8>to characterize the radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The radical left is a metaphor as a </v>

397
00:25:58.721 --> 00:26:00.310
<v Speaker 8>symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as an articulation.</v>

398
00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.010
<v Speaker 8>They don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're numbers are too small.</v>

399
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.040
<v Speaker 8>I'm on college campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't see much of them coming.</v>

400
00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:08.980
<v Speaker 8>When I hear about identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that amazes me.</v>

401
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.610
<v Speaker 8>The collectivist identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

402
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.560
<v Speaker 8>last time I checked,</v>
<v Speaker 8>white folk invented race.</v>

403
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.030
<v Speaker 8>That was an invention from a dominant </v>
<v Speaker 8>culture that won't it groups to at their</v>

404
00:26:19.031 --> 00:26:19.864
<v Speaker 8>behest,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the invention of race was driven by the </v>

405
00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:26.380
<v Speaker 8>demand of a dominant culture to </v>
<v Speaker 8>subordinate others.</v>

406
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.060
<v Speaker 8>Patriot,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

407
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:33.220
<v Speaker 8>Patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Patriarchy was the demand of men to have</v>

408
00:26:33.221 --> 00:26:37.450
<v Speaker 8>their exclusive vision presented.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The beauty of feminism is it's not going</v>

409
00:26:37.451 --> 00:26:39.670
<v Speaker 8>to resolve differences between men and </v>
<v Speaker 8>women.</v>

410
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.833
<v Speaker 8>It just says me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't automatically get the last word </v>

411
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.260
<v Speaker 8>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of my career,</v>

412
00:26:45.261 --> 00:26:46.094
<v Speaker 8>but he never did.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so identity politics has been </v>

413
00:26:49.231 --> 00:26:51.810
<v Speaker 8>generated as a bit in the war of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>right,</v>

414
00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:52.644
<v Speaker 8>and yet the right doesn't understand the</v>
<v Speaker 8>degree to which identity has been </v>

415
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 8>foisted upon black people and Brown </v>
<v Speaker 8>people and people of color from the very</v>

416
00:26:59.161 --> 00:26:59.994
<v Speaker 8>beginning on women and Trans People.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You think that I want to be part of a </v>

417
00:27:02.881 --> 00:27:06.660
<v Speaker 8>group that is constantly at poured by </v>
<v Speaker 8>people at starbucks.</v>

418
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:13.680
<v Speaker 8>I'm minding my own black business</v>
<v Speaker 8>walking down the street.</v>

419
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.140
<v Speaker 8>I have group identity thrust upon me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They don't say,</v>

420
00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.870
<v Speaker 8>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there goes a Negro,</v>

421
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 8>highly intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 8>articulate,</v>

422
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:22.314
<v Speaker 8>verbose,</v>
<v Speaker 8>capable of rhetorical fury at the drop </v>

423
00:27:25.681 --> 00:27:26.514
<v Speaker 8>of a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We should not interrogate him as to the </v>

424
00:27:29.131 --> 00:27:32.250
<v Speaker 8>bone of the days of his legal status.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

425
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:33.084
<v Speaker 8>they treat me as part of a group and the</v>
<v Speaker 8>problem is that our friends don't want </v>

426
00:27:37.441 --> 00:27:42.441
<v Speaker 8>to acknowledge is that the had Gemini,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that dominance of that group has been so</v>

427
00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:46.650
<v Speaker 8>vicious that it is denied us the </v>
<v Speaker 8>opportunity to exist as individuals.</v>

428
00:27:46.651 --> 00:27:50.250
<v Speaker 8>Individualism is the characteristic </v>
<v Speaker 8>moment in modernity.</v>

429
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.880
<v Speaker 8>Mr. Peterson is right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the development of the individual.</v>

430
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:54.714
<v Speaker 8>However,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's predicated upon notions of </v>

431
00:27:55.621 --> 00:27:57.750
<v Speaker 8>intelligence in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You will content David,</v>

432
00:27:57.751 --> 00:27:58.584
<v Speaker 8>human,</v>
<v Speaker 8>others philosophically cart descartes </v>

433
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:03.480
<v Speaker 8>comes along introducing knowledge into </v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

434
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:04.620
<v Speaker 8>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to the,</v>

435
00:28:04.621 --> 00:28:05.454
<v Speaker 8>to the phrase saying that knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 8>based upon a kind of reference to the </v>

436
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:12.660
<v Speaker 8>golden intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the reflective glass at one possesses.</v>

437
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.900
<v Speaker 8>And yet he got rooted in the very ground</v>
<v Speaker 8>of our existence.</v>

438
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.080
<v Speaker 8>So now it's has fleshly basis.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And what I'm saying to you,</v>

439
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 8>the knowledge that I bring as a person </v>
<v Speaker 8>of color makes a difference in my body.</v>

440
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.850
<v Speaker 8>Because I know what people think of me </v>
<v Speaker 8>and I know how they respond to me.</v>

441
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.660
<v Speaker 8>And that ain't no theory am I.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Am I mad at trigger warnings?</v>

442
00:28:30.661 --> 00:28:32.520
<v Speaker 8>Only trigger warning.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Got One is from a cop.</v>

443
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 8>Are you about to shoot me?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Not Funny.</v>

444
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.930
<v Speaker 8>In America where young black people die </v>
<v Speaker 8>repeatedly,</v>

445
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:43.680
<v Speaker 8>unarmed without provocation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so for me,</v>

446
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.960
<v Speaker 8>identity politics is something very </v>
<v Speaker 8>serious.</v>

447
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.030
<v Speaker 8>And what's interesting about safe </v>
<v Speaker 8>spaces,</v>

448
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.180
<v Speaker 8>I hear about the university,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I teach there.</v>

449
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.420
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you in a safe space in your body,</v>

450
00:28:54.421 --> 00:28:57.480
<v Speaker 8>you don't need a safe space.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Some of that is overblown,</v>

451
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.190
<v Speaker 8>some of it is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I understand.</v>

452
00:28:59.191 --> 00:29:02.430
<v Speaker 8>I believe that the classroom was a </v>
<v Speaker 8>robust place for serious learning.</v>

453
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.650
<v Speaker 8>I believe in the interrogation of </v>
<v Speaker 8>knowledge,</v>

454
00:29:04.651 --> 00:29:09.000
<v Speaker 8>based upon our understanding of mutually</v>
<v Speaker 8>of the edifying proposition of enlighten</v>

455
00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:10.920
<v Speaker 8>met.</v>
<v Speaker 8>At the same time,</v>

456
00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:11.754
<v Speaker 8>some people ain't as equal as others.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So we have to understand the conditions </v>

457
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:17.070
<v Speaker 8>under which they have emerged and in </v>
<v Speaker 8>which they have been benighted.</v>

458
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:22.310
<v Speaker 8>And attacked by their own culture and I </v>
<v Speaker 8>ain't seen nobody be a biggest snowflake</v>

459
00:29:22.821 --> 00:29:26.100
<v Speaker 8>in and white man who complained,</v>
<v Speaker 8>mommy,</v>

460
00:29:26.101 --> 00:29:26.934
<v Speaker 8>mommy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they won't let us play and have </v>

461
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:32.220
<v Speaker 8>everything we used to have under the old</v>
<v Speaker 8>regime where we were right.</v>

462
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:33.203
<v Speaker 8>Racist and some premises and dominate </v>
<v Speaker 8>and patriarchs and hated gays and </v>

463
00:29:36.391 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 8>lesbians and transsexuals that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.030
<v Speaker 8>There's everybody's world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And let me end by saying this.</v>

466
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.270
<v Speaker 8>You remember that story from David </v>
<v Speaker 8>Foster Wallace?</v>

467
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:47.303
<v Speaker 8>Fish are going down to fish are gone and</v>
<v Speaker 8>the older fish comes in the opposite </v>

468
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 8>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He said,</v>

469
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:53.780
<v Speaker 8>hello boys.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How's the water they swim on?</v>

470
00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.420
<v Speaker 8>They turn each other.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What the Hell is water?</v>

471
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.850
<v Speaker 8>Because when you entered,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't know it.</v>

472
00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.650
<v Speaker 8>When you're dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't know it.</v>

473
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:00.963
<v Speaker 8>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Keyser soze he said it's more </v>

474
00:30:02.081 --> 00:30:03.460
<v Speaker 8>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the devil did.</v>

475
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:04.940
<v Speaker 8>And to make people believe he did</v>

476
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:10.020
<v Speaker 4>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you [inaudible].</v>

477
00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.710
<v Speaker 9>Thank you Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Steven Europe.</v>

478
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:21.603
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we're going to put six minutes on the </v>

479
00:30:22.131 --> 00:30:22.964
<v Speaker 9>clock and please start out trying to be </v>
<v Speaker 9>as quick as possible because if I miss </v>

480
00:30:27.771 --> 00:30:29.710
<v Speaker 9>that plane to London,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I went half here,</v>

481
00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 9>the end of it from the bridegroom's </v>
<v Speaker 9>mother.</v>

482
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.830
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>now in,</v>

483
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.440
<v Speaker 9>in agreeing to,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

484
00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:41.810
<v Speaker 9>participate in this debate and stand on </v>
<v Speaker 9>this side of the argument,</v>

485
00:30:41.811 --> 00:30:46.010
<v Speaker 9>I'm fairly aware that many people who </v>
<v Speaker 9>choose incorrectly in my view to,</v>

486
00:30:46.011 --> 00:30:49.280
<v Speaker 9>to see this issue in terms of left and </v>
<v Speaker 9>right,</v>

487
00:30:49.281 --> 00:30:51.670
<v Speaker 9>devalued and exploded terms as I think </v>
<v Speaker 9>they are,</v>

488
00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.813
<v Speaker 9>will believe that I am betraying myself </v>
<v Speaker 9>in such causes and values that I have </v>

489
00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:00.600
<v Speaker 9>espoused over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've been given a huge grief or red.</v>

490
00:31:00.601 --> 00:31:04.310
<v Speaker 9>It seemed to because I'm standing here </v>
<v Speaker 9>next to Professor Peterson,</v>

491
00:31:04.311 --> 00:31:08.300
<v Speaker 9>which is the very reason that I am </v>
<v Speaker 9>standing here in the first place.</v>

492
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:13.660
<v Speaker 9>I'm standing next to someone with whom I</v>
<v Speaker 9>have no differences,</v>

493
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.110
<v Speaker 9>shall we say in terms of politics and </v>
<v Speaker 9>all kinds of other things.</v>

494
00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:19.123
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>precisely because I think all this has </v>

495
00:31:21.051 --> 00:31:23.900
<v Speaker 9>got to stop this rage,</v>
<v Speaker 9>resentment,</v>

496
00:31:23.901 --> 00:31:24.734
<v Speaker 9>hostility,</v>
<v Speaker 9>hostility in tolerance above all this </v>

497
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.520
<v Speaker 9>with us or against us.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Certainty.</v>

498
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.150
<v Speaker 9>A Grand Canyon has opened up in our </v>
<v Speaker 9>world.</v>

499
00:31:35.151 --> 00:31:37.610
<v Speaker 9>The fist year,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the crack grows wider.</v>

500
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.493
<v Speaker 9>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Neither on each side can hear a word </v>

501
00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.780
<v Speaker 9>that the other shrieks and nor do they </v>
<v Speaker 9>want to.</v>

502
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.880
<v Speaker 9>One of these arm isn't propagandist in </v>
<v Speaker 9>the culture wars clash down below in the</v>

503
00:31:51.021 --> 00:31:51.854
<v Speaker 9>enormous space between the two sides.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The people of the world tried to get on </v>

504
00:31:55.581 --> 00:31:56.414
<v Speaker 9>with their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Alternative baffled board and betrayed </v>

505
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:03.350
<v Speaker 9>by the horrible noises and explosions </v>
<v Speaker 9>that echo all around.</v>

506
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:07.040
<v Speaker 9>I think it's time for this toxic binary.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Zero.</v>

507
00:32:07.041 --> 00:32:11.210
<v Speaker 9>Some madness to stop before we destroy </v>
<v Speaker 9>ourselves.</v>

508
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:16.063
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

509
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.550
<v Speaker 9>The nail my colors to the mast,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

510
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:19.623
<v Speaker 9>before I go any further than this,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's only polite to give you a sense of </v>

511
00:32:21.071 --> 00:32:23.200
<v Speaker 9>where I come from.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I all my adult life,</v>

512
00:32:23.201 --> 00:32:25.420
<v Speaker 9>I have been what you might call the left</v>
<v Speaker 9>here,</v>

513
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:29.680
<v Speaker 9>a soft lefty liberal of the most </v>
<v Speaker 9>handwringing milk shop,</v>

514
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:30.640
<v Speaker 9>milk,</v>
<v Speaker 9>toast,</v>

515
00:32:30.641 --> 00:32:33.640
<v Speaker 9>variety,</v>
<v Speaker 9>not to burning man.</v>

516
00:32:33.641 --> 00:32:34.474
<v Speaker 9>The barricades socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 9>not even really a progressive with the </v>

517
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:39.160
<v Speaker 9>name.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've been on marches,</v>

518
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.140
<v Speaker 9>I've never quite dead.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We've clicked cards or banners.</v>

519
00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:46.220
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>am I alluded member of that band,</v>

520
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.940
<v Speaker 9>an Sjw,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a social justice warrior.</v>

521
00:32:49.941 --> 00:32:52.970
<v Speaker 9>I don't think highly of social </v>
<v Speaker 9>injustice,</v>

522
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:53.893
<v Speaker 9>I have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I character myself mostly as a </v>

523
00:32:57.081 --> 00:32:57.914
<v Speaker 9>social justice warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 9>My intellectual heroes growing up were </v>

524
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:05.360
<v Speaker 9>Bertrand Russell and g more liberal </v>
<v Speaker 9>thinkers,</v>

525
00:33:05.361 --> 00:33:07.490
<v Speaker 9>people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Writers like m forced to,</v>

526
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:08.324
<v Speaker 9>I believed in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think I still do believe in the </v>

527
00:33:09.981 --> 00:33:10.814
<v Speaker 9>sanctity of human relations,</v>
<v Speaker 9>of the primacy of the heart and </v>

528
00:33:13.731 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 9>friendship and love and common interest.</v>

529
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:17.563
<v Speaker 9>These are more personal interior beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 9>than they are political exterior </v>

530
00:33:22.731 --> 00:33:23.564
<v Speaker 9>convictions,</v>
<v Speaker 9>more humanistic version of a religious </v>

531
00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:28.040
<v Speaker 9>implants.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I suppose.</v>

532
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.530
<v Speaker 9>I trust in humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I believe in humanity.</v>

533
00:33:30.531 --> 00:33:31.364
<v Speaker 9>I think I do.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Despite all that has happened in the 40 </v>

534
00:33:33.861 --> 00:33:37.370
<v Speaker 9>years of my adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I am soft and I can easily be swept away</v>

535
00:33:37.371 --> 00:33:38.204
<v Speaker 9>by harder hearts and harder intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm sometimes surprised to be described </v>

536
00:33:42.171 --> 00:33:43.004
<v Speaker 9>as an activist,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but overtime I have energetically </v>

537
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.780
<v Speaker 9>involved myself with what you might call</v>
<v Speaker 9>causes.</v>

538
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 9>I grew up knowing that I was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

539
00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:51.590
<v Speaker 9>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 9>from the very first I knew I was gay.</v>

540
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:54.140
<v Speaker 9>I remember when I was born looking up </v>
<v Speaker 9>and saying,</v>

541
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.360
<v Speaker 9>that's the last time I'm going up.</v>
<v Speaker 9>One of those.</v>

542
00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.430
<v Speaker 10>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm</v>

543
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.080
<v Speaker 9>Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm Jewish,</v>

544
00:34:04.081 --> 00:34:06.150
<v Speaker 9>so I have a natural,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was horror of racism.</v>

545
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.880
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I naturally,</v>

546
00:34:08.881 --> 00:34:10.650
<v Speaker 9>I want racism,</v>
<v Speaker 9>misogyny,</v>

547
00:34:10.651 --> 00:34:12.300
<v Speaker 9>homophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 9>transphobia,</v>

548
00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:13.980
<v Speaker 9>xenophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 9>bullying,</v>

549
00:34:13.981 --> 00:34:14.814
<v Speaker 9>bigotry,</v>
<v Speaker 9>intolerance of all humankind's to end </v>

550
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.530
<v Speaker 9>that surely a given amongst all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The question is how such a golden aim is</v>

551
00:34:22.531 --> 00:34:23.364
<v Speaker 9>to be achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 9>My ultimate objection to political </v>

552
00:34:25.411 --> 00:34:26.244
<v Speaker 9>correctness is not that it combines so </v>
<v Speaker 9>much of what I've spent a lifetime </v>

553
00:34:30.181 --> 00:34:33.750
<v Speaker 9>losing and opposing preachiness with </v>
<v Speaker 9>great respect.</v>

554
00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:37.470
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>piety,</v>

555
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:38.843
<v Speaker 9>self-righteousness Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he hunting denunciation shaming session </v>

556
00:34:42.901 --> 00:34:44.760
<v Speaker 9>without evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 9>accusation,</v>

557
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:45.623
<v Speaker 9>inquisition censoring.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's not why I'm incurring the wrath </v>

558
00:34:49.291 --> 00:34:52.350
<v Speaker 9>of my fellow liberals by standing on </v>
<v Speaker 9>this side of the house.</v>

559
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.990
<v Speaker 9>My real objection is that I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 9>political correctness works.</v>

560
00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.960
<v Speaker 9>I want to achieve,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I want to get to the Golden Hill,</v>

561
00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.660
<v Speaker 9>but I don't think that's the way to get </v>
<v Speaker 9>there.</v>

562
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.353
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I believe one of the greatest human </v>

563
00:35:07.951 --> 00:35:12.860
<v Speaker 9>failings is to prefer to be right,</v>
<v Speaker 9>than to be effective.</v>

564
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:14.563
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

565
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:17.990
<v Speaker 10>political correctness.</v>

566
00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.433
<v Speaker 9>He's always obsessed with how right it </v>
<v Speaker 9>is without thinking of how effective it </v>

567
00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:23.774
<v Speaker 9>might be.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I wouldn't trust myself as a classical </v>

568
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:27.170
<v Speaker 9>libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

569
00:35:27.171 --> 00:35:28.004
<v Speaker 9>but I do relish transgression and I </v>
<v Speaker 9>deeply and instinctively distrust </v>

570
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.433
<v Speaker 9>conformity and orthodoxy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Progress is not by preachers and </v>

571
00:35:38.461 --> 00:35:41.370
<v Speaker 9>guardians of morality bumped to </v>
<v Speaker 9>paraphrase,</v>

572
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:45.690
<v Speaker 9>you have [inaudible] by madmen hermits,</v>
<v Speaker 9>heretics,</v>

573
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.450
<v Speaker 9>dreamers,</v>
<v Speaker 9>rebels and skeptics.</v>

574
00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.113
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

575
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:56.130
<v Speaker 9>I may be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I hope to learn this evening.</v>

576
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.023
<v Speaker 9>I really do think I may be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I am prepared to entertain the </v>

577
00:36:00.781 --> 00:36:01.614
<v Speaker 9>possibility that political correctness </v>
<v Speaker 9>will bring us more tolerance and a </v>

578
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:07.670
<v Speaker 9>better world.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

579
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.250
<v Speaker 9>but I'm not sure and I would like this </v>
<v Speaker 9>quotation from my hair,</v>

580
00:36:11.251 --> 00:36:13.560
<v Speaker 9>a Bertrand Russell to hover over the </v>
<v Speaker 9>evening.</v>

581
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.113
<v Speaker 9>One of the painful things about our time</v>
<v Speaker 9>is that those who feel certainty are </v>

582
00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:20.244
<v Speaker 9>stupid and those with any imagination </v>
<v Speaker 9>and understanding are filled with doubt </v>

583
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:25.680
<v Speaker 9>and indecision.</v>

584
00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:31.440
<v Speaker 4>Doc [inaudible],</v>

585
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.460
<v Speaker 9>great set of,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

586
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:40.303
<v Speaker 9>opening statements to set the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We're now going to go into a round of </v>

587
00:36:42.681 --> 00:36:43.514
<v Speaker 9>rebuttals to allow each of our </v>
<v Speaker 9>presenters three minutes to reflect on </v>

588
00:36:47.751 --> 00:36:50.600
<v Speaker 9>what they've heard and to make some </v>
<v Speaker 9>additional points.</v>

589
00:36:50.601 --> 00:36:52.520
<v Speaker 9>And we're going to do that in the same </v>
<v Speaker 9>order that we had.</v>

590
00:36:52.521 --> 00:36:54.080
<v Speaker 9>The opening statement.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So Michelle,</v>

591
00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:56.510
<v Speaker 9>you're up first.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We'll put three minutes on the clock for</v>

592
00:36:56.511 --> 00:36:57.344
<v Speaker 9>you.</v>

593
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:59.063
<v Speaker 6>So first I would say that I think that </v>
<v Speaker 6>the attempt to draw a dichotomy between </v>

594
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.330
<v Speaker 6>individual rights and group rights is a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit misleading.</v>

595
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.193
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>traditionally there has been large </v>

596
00:37:14.441 --> 00:37:19.441
<v Speaker 6>groups of people who have not been able </v>
<v Speaker 6>to exercise their individual rights.</v>

597
00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:25.080
<v Speaker 6>And I think that a lot of the claims </v>
<v Speaker 6>that are being made on behalf of what we</v>

598
00:37:26.321 --> 00:37:27.154
<v Speaker 6>politically correct types call </v>
<v Speaker 6>marginalized groups are claims that </v>

599
00:37:31.241 --> 00:37:32.074
<v Speaker 6>people who have identities that have not</v>
<v Speaker 6>traditionally been at the center of our </v>

600
00:37:38.351 --> 00:37:39.184
<v Speaker 6>culture or been at the top of our </v>
<v Speaker 6>hierarchies have as much right to </v>

601
00:37:42.821 --> 00:37:47.821
<v Speaker 6>exercise their individual talents and </v>
<v Speaker 6>realize their individual ambitions.</v>

602
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.533
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When we say that we want more women in </v>

603
00:37:51.311 --> 00:37:56.311
<v Speaker 6>power or more people of color's voices </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the Canon or in the curriculum,</v>

604
00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.290
<v Speaker 6>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pete directing movies,</v>

605
00:37:59.291 --> 00:38:02.470
<v Speaker 6>all of these things or not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because at least on my part,</v>

606
00:38:02.471 --> 00:38:05.530
<v Speaker 6>I'm interested in some sort of very </v>
<v Speaker 6>crude equity,</v>

607
00:38:05.531 --> 00:38:06.364
<v Speaker 6>but because there are a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 6>who have not traditionally been able to </v>

608
00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.220
<v Speaker 6>realize themselves as individuals.</v>

609
00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:16.083
<v Speaker 6>That's what the women's movement was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what the civil rights movement </v>

610
00:38:18.851 --> 00:38:20.890
<v Speaker 6>was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what the gay rights movement was.</v>

611
00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.590
<v Speaker 6>That's in some ways what the Trans </v>
<v Speaker 6>Rights movement was.</v>

612
00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:25.930
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>far from a collectivist movement.</v>

613
00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.793
<v Speaker 6>This is kind of liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>classical liberalism pushed to its </v>

614
00:38:31.271 --> 00:38:32.410
<v Speaker 6>extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

615
00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.273
<v Speaker 6>These are people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have the right to define my identity </v>

616
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 6>against the one that was collectively </v>
<v Speaker 6>assigned to me.</v>

617
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.700
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>finally I would say,</v>

618
00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:43.534
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of the things that Stephen Fry </v>

619
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:45.311
<v Speaker 6>said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

620
00:38:45.311 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 6>in particularly his temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're probably in agreement,</v>

621
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.440
<v Speaker 6>but this inquisition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this censorious snus.</v>

622
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.810
<v Speaker 6>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sort of,</v>

623
00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.790
<v Speaker 6>I see where he's coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's a little bit virtual,</v>

624
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.750
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

625
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.890
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but who's,</v>

626
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:05.450
<v Speaker 6>who's really censoring you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

627
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.750
<v Speaker 6>I understand what it feels like to feel </v>
<v Speaker 6>censored.</v>

628
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.520
<v Speaker 6>I understand what it feels like to be on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the wrong side of a twitter mob or get a</v>

629
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:14.950
<v Speaker 6>lot of nasty comments,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

630
00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.620
<v Speaker 6>and that's a bad feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

631
00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:21.220
<v Speaker 6>and it's a counterproductive tactic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's not censorship.</v>

632
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.061
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

633
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:23.440
<v Speaker 6>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a little,</v>

634
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:28.450
<v Speaker 6>it's especially strange coming from a </v>
<v Speaker 6>country where,</v>

635
00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:29.603
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the president of the United States is </v>

636
00:39:31.211 --> 00:39:36.211
<v Speaker 6>trying to levy additional postal rates </v>
<v Speaker 6>on the owner of the Washington Post,</v>

637
00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:38.440
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in revenge for its reporting.</v>

638
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:39.603
<v Speaker 6>And people who have kneeled to protest </v>
<v Speaker 6>police brutality at football games have </v>

639
00:39:44.561 --> 00:39:47.710
<v Speaker 6>seen their careers explode.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

640
00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:49.210
<v Speaker 6>or people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

641
00:39:49.211 --> 00:39:50.044
<v Speaker 6>women who have challenged Mr. Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 6>has been hounded by threats and trolls </v>

642
00:39:55.361 --> 00:39:57.110
<v Speaker 6>and misogynist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

643
00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:58.570
<v Speaker 6>invective so</v>

644
00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:05.410
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] Jordan,</v>

645
00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.810
<v Speaker 7>three minutes up on the screen there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Please respond to what you've heard.</v>

646
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:13.623
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess I would like to set out a </v>

647
00:40:16.211 --> 00:40:17.044
<v Speaker 7>challenge in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in somewhat the same format as Mr. Fry </v>

648
00:40:19.001 --> 00:40:22.000
<v Speaker 7>did two people on the moderate left.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

649
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:25.600
<v Speaker 7>I've studied totalitarianism for a very </v>
<v Speaker 7>long time.</v>

650
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:29.090
<v Speaker 7>Both on the left and on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have various forms and</v>

651
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:32.343
<v Speaker 7>I think we've done a pretty decent job </v>
<v Speaker 7>of determining when right wing beliefs </v>

652
00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:36.124
<v Speaker 7>become dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that they become dangerous when </v>

653
00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:40.083
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the people who stand on the right evoke </v>

654
00:40:41.561 --> 00:40:45.700
<v Speaker 7>notions of racial superior superiority </v>
<v Speaker 7>or ethnic superiority,</v>

655
00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:46.534
<v Speaker 7>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's fairly easy to draw a box around </v>

656
00:40:48.371 --> 00:40:51.190
<v Speaker 7>them and place them to one side and </v>
<v Speaker 7>necessary.</v>

657
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:52.900
<v Speaker 7>And I think we've done a pretty good job</v>
<v Speaker 7>of that.</v>

658
00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.300
<v Speaker 7>What I failed to see happening on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>left,</v>

659
00:40:55.301 --> 00:40:58.750
<v Speaker 7>and this is with regards to the sensible</v>
<v Speaker 7>left because such a thing exists,</v>

660
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.380
<v Speaker 7>is for the same thing to happen with </v>
<v Speaker 7>regards to the radical leftists.</v>

661
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so here's an open question.</v>

662
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.513
<v Speaker 7>If it's not diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>inclusivity and equity as a triumvirate </v>

663
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:16.510
<v Speaker 7>that mark out the two excessive left and</v>
<v Speaker 7>with equity defined by the way,</v>

664
00:41:16.511 --> 00:41:19.780
<v Speaker 7>not as equality of opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is an absolutely laudable goal,</v>

665
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.793
<v Speaker 7>but as equality of outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is how it's defined then exactly </v>

666
00:41:24.491 --> 00:41:27.130
<v Speaker 7>how do we demarcate the two extreme </v>
<v Speaker 7>left?</v>

667
00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:28.630
<v Speaker 7>What did we do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And we say,</v>

668
00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:31.090
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's no such thing as the two extreme</v>

669
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:32.290
<v Speaker 7>left.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

670
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.153
<v Speaker 7>that's certainly that characterize much </v>
<v Speaker 7>of intellectual thinking for the 20th </v>

671
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:36.854
<v Speaker 7>century as our high order intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially in place like places like </v>

672
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:41.114
<v Speaker 7>France did,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everything they could to bend over </v>

673
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:43.214
<v Speaker 7>backwards to ignore absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything that was happening in the </v>

674
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:49.790
<v Speaker 7>catastrophic left world in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 7>Union and in Maoist China not least.</v>

675
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:50.833
<v Speaker 7>We've done a terrible job of determining</v>
<v Speaker 7>how to demarcate what's useful from the </v>

676
00:41:54.051 --> 00:41:55.730
<v Speaker 7>left,</v>
<v Speaker 7>from what's pathological.</v>

677
00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.013
<v Speaker 7>And so it's perfectly okay for someone </v>
<v Speaker 7>to criticize my attempts to identify </v>

678
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.850
<v Speaker 7>something like a boundary.</v>

679
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.310
<v Speaker 7>We could say diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>inclusivity and equity,</v>

680
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:07.640
<v Speaker 7>especially equity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is in fact equality of outcome,</v>

681
00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:11.420
<v Speaker 7>which is an absolutely a boring notion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you know anything about history,</v>

682
00:42:11.421 --> 00:42:15.620
<v Speaker 7>you know that and I'm perfectly willing </v>
<v Speaker 7>to hear some reasonable alternatives.</v>

683
00:42:15.621 --> 00:42:18.380
<v Speaker 7>But what I hear continually from people </v>
<v Speaker 7>on the left,</v>

684
00:42:18.381 --> 00:42:19.214
<v Speaker 7>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as my opponent's did to construe every </v>

685
00:42:21.231 --> 00:42:22.064
<v Speaker 7>argument that is possibly able to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>construed on the axis of group </v>

686
00:42:25.131 --> 00:42:27.660
<v Speaker 7>identification and to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to defer,</v>

687
00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 7>to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to fail,</v>

688
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:32.330
<v Speaker 7>to help the rest of us differentiate the</v>
<v Speaker 7>reasonable left,</v>

689
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.080
<v Speaker 7>which stands for the oppressed </v>
<v Speaker 7>necessarily from the pathological left.</v>

690
00:42:38.081 --> 00:42:39.980
<v Speaker 7>It's capable of unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 7>destruction.</v>

691
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.233
<v Speaker 7>And what I see happening in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>university campuses in particular where </v>

692
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.050
<v Speaker 7>the left is absolutely predominate and </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's certainly not my imagination.</v>

693
00:42:48.051 --> 00:42:48.884
<v Speaker 7>That's that's well documented by </v>
<v Speaker 7>perfectly reasonable people like </v>

694
00:42:51.231 --> 00:42:52.064
<v Speaker 7>Jonathan.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Height is an absolute failure to make </v>

695
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:56.600
<v Speaker 7>precisely that distinction and I see the</v>
<v Speaker 7>same thing tonight.</v>

696
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:58.363
<v Speaker 7>Thank you.</v>

697
00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:04.050
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

698
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.823
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>give us a,</v>

699
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:10.410
<v Speaker 8>your rebuttal.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let me step out here and Peterson land.</v>

700
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.411
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I feel free.</v>

701
00:43:15.411 --> 00:43:16.244
<v Speaker 8>You're already,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what mythological </v>

702
00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:27.740
<v Speaker 8>collective Mr. Peterson refers to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm part of the left there.</v>

703
00:43:27.741 --> 00:43:32.741
<v Speaker 8>Can tankers when they have a firing </v>
<v Speaker 8>squad is usually in a semi circle.</v>

704
00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:36.913
<v Speaker 8>Part of the skepticism of rationality </v>
<v Speaker 8>was predicated upon the enlightenment </v>

705
00:43:40.011 --> 00:43:40.844
<v Speaker 8>project,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which says we're no longer going to be </v>

706
00:43:41.871 --> 00:43:45.080
<v Speaker 8>subordinate to skepticism to </v>
<v Speaker 8>superstition.</v>

707
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:47.090
<v Speaker 8>We're going to think and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 8>think,</v>

708
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.983
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thomas Jefferson was one of the great </v>

709
00:43:49.971 --> 00:43:50.804
<v Speaker 8>arbiters of rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he was also a man who was a slave </v>

710
00:43:53.781 --> 00:43:55.880
<v Speaker 8>owner.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How do you reconcile that?</v>

711
00:43:55.881 --> 00:43:57.680
<v Speaker 8>That's the complication I'm speaking </v>
<v Speaker 8>about.</v>

712
00:43:57.681 --> 00:44:00.320
<v Speaker 8>That's not either or.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's not a collective identity.</v>

713
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.930
<v Speaker 8>Thomas Jefferson believed in a </v>
<v Speaker 8>collective identity.</v>

714
00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.220
<v Speaker 8>That is during the day at night,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he got some luther vandross songs,</v>

715
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:14.050
<v Speaker 8>went out to the slave quarter and </v>
<v Speaker 8>engaged in sexual relations and had many</v>

716
00:44:14.571 --> 00:44:15.404
<v Speaker 8>children with sally hemings.</v>
<v Speaker 8>His loins trumped his logic and when he </v>

717
00:44:20.301 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 8>hit talks about postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know who he's talking about.</v>

718
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:26.360
<v Speaker 8>I teach postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's kind of fun.</v>

719
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:29.600
<v Speaker 8>Jacques Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just to say his name is beautiful.</v>

720
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:31.363
<v Speaker 8>Michelle Michel Foucault talks about the</v>
<v Speaker 8>insurrection of subjugated knowledge as </v>

721
00:44:34.771 --> 00:44:36.060
<v Speaker 8>people who had been marginalized.</v>

722
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.820
<v Speaker 8>Now begin to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The subaltern has gaietry.</v>

723
00:44:38.821 --> 00:44:40.860
<v Speaker 8>Speeback talks about it and post </v>
<v Speaker 8>postcolonial theory.</v>

724
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:41.963
<v Speaker 8>The reason these people grew up and grew</v>
<v Speaker 8>into existence and had a voice is </v>

725
00:44:44.911 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 8>because they were denied.</v>
<v Speaker 8>As Ms Goldberg said,</v>

726
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.480
<v Speaker 8>our group identity was foisted upon us.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We were not seen as individuals.</v>

727
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:52.733
<v Speaker 8>Babe Ruth,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when he broke the home row home run </v>

728
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:55.164
<v Speaker 8>record,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he didn't bat against all best </v>

729
00:44:56.551 --> 00:44:57.384
<v Speaker 8>ballplayers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He batted against the best white </v>

730
00:44:58.351 --> 00:45:01.230
<v Speaker 8>ballplayers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When it's been rigged in your favor from</v>

731
00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:03.180
<v Speaker 8>the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's hard for you to understand how much</v>

732
00:45:03.181 --> 00:45:04.680
<v Speaker 8>you've been rick.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're born on third base.</v>

733
00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:09.590
<v Speaker 8>Think you hit a triple</v>
<v Speaker 8>at the Toronto Blue Jays game.</v>

734
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:12.463
<v Speaker 8>And here we are deriving our sense of </v>
<v Speaker 8>identity from the very culture that we </v>

735
00:45:15.441 --> 00:45:16.274
<v Speaker 8>ignore.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look at the indigenous names and the </v>

736
00:45:17.811 --> 00:45:19.430
<v Speaker 8>first nation names,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Toronto,</v>

737
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.730
<v Speaker 8>Saskatchewan,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when a peg Tim Horton's.</v>

738
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:26.023
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

739
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:27.783
<v Speaker 8>But I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's an envy of the kind of freedom </v>

740
00:45:31.241 --> 00:45:32.074
<v Speaker 8>and liberty that people of color and </v>
<v Speaker 8>other minorities bring because we bring </v>

741
00:45:35.231 --> 00:45:36.064
<v Speaker 8>the depth of knowledge in our body.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's a kind of jealousy event as the </v>

742
00:45:39.401 --> 00:45:42.820
<v Speaker 8>greatest living Canadian philosopher </v>
<v Speaker 8>Aubrey Drake Graham says,</v>

743
00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.030
<v Speaker 8>jealousy is just love and hate at the </v>
<v Speaker 8>same time.</v>

744
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.540
<v Speaker 8>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it's necessary.</v>

745
00:45:49.541 --> 00:45:50.374
<v Speaker 8>I agree with Mr. Fry.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We shouldn't be nasty and combative and </v>

746
00:45:52.901 --> 00:45:55.420
<v Speaker 8>yet I don't see nastiness and </v>
<v Speaker 8>combativeness from people.</v>

747
00:45:55.421 --> 00:45:56.254
<v Speaker 8>I see them making a desire to have their</v>
<v Speaker 8>individual identities respected when I </v>

748
00:46:01.421 --> 00:46:03.760
<v Speaker 8>get shot down for no other reason that </v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm black,</v>

749
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:06.670
<v Speaker 8>when I get categorized for no other </v>
<v Speaker 8>reason than my color,</v>

750
00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:10.360
<v Speaker 8>I am living in a culture that refuses to</v>
<v Speaker 8>see me as a great individual.</v>

751
00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:22.923
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

752
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:30.190
<v Speaker 9>It's interesting to hear that there </v>
<v Speaker 9>doesn't seem to be a problem,</v>

753
00:46:30.191 --> 00:46:34.510
<v Speaker 9>but yet I think we all instinctively </v>
<v Speaker 9>know that there is some kind of problem.</v>

754
00:46:34.511 --> 00:46:36.520
<v Speaker 9>There isn't censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 9>of course.</v>

755
00:46:36.521 --> 00:46:39.720
<v Speaker 9>Not In the way that there is in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've been to Russia,</v>

756
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:42.060
<v Speaker 9>faced off with the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

757
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:43.940
<v Speaker 9>a deeply homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 9>done pleasant man.</v>

758
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:45.670
<v Speaker 9>And there's political correctness in </v>
<v Speaker 9>Russia.</v>

759
00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:48.160
<v Speaker 9>It's just political correctness on the </v>
<v Speaker 9>right.</v>

760
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:50.350
<v Speaker 9>And that's what I grew up with.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Political correctness,</v>

761
00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.380
<v Speaker 9>which meant that you couldn't say </v>
<v Speaker 9>certain things on television.</v>

762
00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:54.403
<v Speaker 9>You couldn't say fuck for example,</v>
<v Speaker 9>on television because it was incorrect </v>

763
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:58.623
<v Speaker 9>to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And there's always the same reason was </v>

764
00:47:01.241 --> 00:47:03.550
<v Speaker 9>that someone would appear and say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not shocked.</v>

765
00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.151
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>of course.</v>

766
00:47:04.151 --> 00:47:04.990
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not shocked.</v>

767
00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:08.230
<v Speaker 9>I'm not offended.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm offended on behalf of others.</v>

768
00:47:08.231 --> 00:47:10.960
<v Speaker 9>Young,</v>
<v Speaker 9>impressionable plastic mines,</v>

769
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.660
<v Speaker 9>the vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's not good enough.</v>

770
00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:14.523
<v Speaker 9>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's,</v>

771
00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:16.570
<v Speaker 9>so often people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 9>see,</v>

772
00:47:16.571 --> 00:47:19.020
<v Speaker 9>I don't mind being called a faggot or a </v>
<v Speaker 9>cake or whatever,</v>

773
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.610
<v Speaker 9>or a mad person cause I've got mental </v>
<v Speaker 9>health issues.</v>

774
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.630
<v Speaker 9>I don't mind people insulting me and </v>
<v Speaker 9>people say,</v>

775
00:47:23.631 --> 00:47:24.640
<v Speaker 9>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 9>So right for you,</v>

776
00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.620
<v Speaker 9>Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 9>because you're new,</v>

777
00:47:26.621 --> 00:47:27.454
<v Speaker 9>you're strong.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't feel particularly strong and I </v>

778
00:47:29.621 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 9>don't know that I like being called a </v>
<v Speaker 9>faggot and a cake particularly,</v>

779
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:38.130
<v Speaker 9>but I don't believe that the advances in</v>
<v Speaker 9>my culture that have allowed me to marry</v>

780
00:47:38.261 --> 00:47:42.160
<v Speaker 9>as I have now been for three years to </v>
<v Speaker 9>someone of my gender,</v>

781
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:43.653
<v Speaker 9>I don't believe they are a result of </v>
<v Speaker 9>political correctness and maybe </v>

782
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:47.104
<v Speaker 9>political correctness is actually does </v>
<v Speaker 9>some sort of live trout that the harder </v>

783
00:47:50.051 --> 00:47:52.520
<v Speaker 9>we squeeze it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the further it goes away and,</v>

784
00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:55.330
<v Speaker 9>and you will be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not talking about the redness,</v>

785
00:47:55.331 --> 00:47:56.164
<v Speaker 9>you're talking about social justice with</v>
<v Speaker 9>which I agree with where they want to </v>

786
00:47:58.811 --> 00:48:00.970
<v Speaker 9>call it identity politics or the history</v>
<v Speaker 9>of your people.</v>

787
00:48:00.971 --> 00:48:03.430
<v Speaker 9>In the history of my people,</v>
<v Speaker 9>my people were slaves as well.</v>

788
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:04.383
<v Speaker 9>Both the British were slaves and Romans </v>
<v Speaker 9>and the Jews were slaves to the </v>

789
00:48:06.311 --> 00:48:07.144
<v Speaker 9>Egyptians.</v>
<v Speaker 9>All human beings have been slaves at </v>

790
00:48:08.891 --> 00:48:13.870
<v Speaker 9>some point and we all in that sense </v>
<v Speaker 9>share that knowledge of how important it</v>

791
00:48:13.871 --> 00:48:16.930
<v Speaker 9>is to speak up.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But Russell means,</v>

792
00:48:16.931 --> 00:48:19.060
<v Speaker 9>who was a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who was the end who founded the American</v>

793
00:48:19.061 --> 00:48:20.320
<v Speaker 9>Indian movement.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He said,</v>

794
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.393
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I forgot to call me an Indian or a </v>

795
00:48:22.241 --> 00:48:25.180
<v Speaker 9>Lakota Sioux or Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't care what you call me.</v>

796
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:26.133
<v Speaker 9>It's how we treated that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And so I'm really addressing a more </v>

797
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:30.190
<v Speaker 9>popular idea.</v>

798
00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:31.663
<v Speaker 4>MMM.</v>

799
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:36.270
<v Speaker 9>Also actually in Barrow,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Alaska and the new Piet said,</v>

800
00:48:36.271 --> 00:48:37.104
<v Speaker 9>call me an Eskimo.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's obviously easier for you cause you </v>

801
00:48:39.391 --> 00:48:41.670
<v Speaker 9>keep mispronouncing Inupiaq.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

802
00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:46.680
<v Speaker 9>in a words do matter.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'll just end with a quick story.</v>

803
00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:47.813
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>gay rights came back to the England </v>

804
00:48:49.861 --> 00:48:53.340
<v Speaker 9>because we just slowly in persistently </v>
<v Speaker 9>knocked on the door of people in power.</v>

805
00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.020
<v Speaker 9>We didn't shout,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we didn't scream.</v>

806
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:57.960
<v Speaker 9>People like Ian mckellen eventually got </v>
<v Speaker 9>to see the prime minister.</v>

807
00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.033
<v Speaker 9>And when the Queen signed in the royal </v>
<v Speaker 9>assent to she has to foot the bill </v>

808
00:49:02.281 --> 00:49:05.370
<v Speaker 9>allowing equality of marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 9>She said,</v>

809
00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.420
<v Speaker 9>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

810
00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:12.620
<v Speaker 9>I couldn't imagine this in 1953 really </v>
<v Speaker 9>is extraordinary.</v>

811
00:49:13.411 --> 00:49:16.830
<v Speaker 9>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Just wonderful and handed it over.</v>

812
00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:19.200
<v Speaker 9>Now it's a nice story and I hope it's </v>
<v Speaker 9>true,</v>

813
00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:21.660
<v Speaker 9>but it's nothing to do with political </v>
<v Speaker 9>correctness.</v>

814
00:49:21.661 --> 00:49:24.180
<v Speaker 9>It's to do with human decency.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's that simple.</v>

815
00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:29.540
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] great rebuttals.</v>

816
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:37.770
<v Speaker 5>They're strong opening statements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's move now into the,</v>

817
00:49:37.771 --> 00:49:38.604
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the moderated a cross examination </v>

818
00:49:40.561 --> 00:49:44.280
<v Speaker 5>portion of this debate and get both </v>
<v Speaker 5>sides engaging on,</v>

819
00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:47.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the key issues here.</v>

820
00:49:47.041 --> 00:49:49.740
<v Speaker 5>And I think what we've heard here is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit of a attention.</v>

821
00:49:49.741 --> 00:49:54.741
<v Speaker 5>Let's draw it out a bit more between uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rights of groups to feel included,</v>

822
00:49:55.111 --> 00:49:56.430
<v Speaker 5>to have in your words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michelle,</v>

823
00:49:56.431 --> 00:50:01.431
<v Speaker 5>the opportunity for individuality and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>belief on the other side that uh,</v>

824
00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:02.453
<v Speaker 5>there's something that's threat here </v>
<v Speaker 5>when these groups are overly privileged </v>

825
00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:10.260
<v Speaker 5>through affirmative action or other </v>
<v Speaker 5>outcome oriented processes.</v>

826
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.300
<v Speaker 5>So Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to start with you,</v>

827
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:17.670
<v Speaker 5>why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why isn't there just harm that's done to</v>

828
00:50:17.671 --> 00:50:21.300
<v Speaker 5>groups by privileging their group </v>
<v Speaker 5>identity,</v>

829
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.823
<v Speaker 5>whether it be a group identity of race </v>
<v Speaker 5>or of gender and not immediately </v>

830
00:50:26.131 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 5>treating them as and the way that</v>

831
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:31.430
<v Speaker 8>Jordan and Steven would like to see you </v>
<v Speaker 8>see them first?</v>

832
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.630
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a couple of things.</v>

833
00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:33.464
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there was no arbitrary and random </v>

834
00:50:35.841 --> 00:50:39.260
<v Speaker 8>distinction that people of color and </v>
<v Speaker 8>other minority groups made.</v>

835
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.870
<v Speaker 8>When I talked about the invention of </v>
<v Speaker 8>race,</v>

836
00:50:41.871 --> 00:50:42.704
<v Speaker 8>the invention of gender,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the invention of group think that was </v>

837
00:50:45.291 --> 00:50:46.124
<v Speaker 8>not done at the by.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those groups that have been so named as </v>

838
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:50.840
<v Speaker 8>Miss Goldberg said.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So first of all,</v>

839
00:50:50.841 --> 00:50:51.674
<v Speaker 8>you've got to acknowledge the historical</v>
<v Speaker 8>evolution of that reality and the </v>

840
00:50:54.771 --> 00:50:57.890
<v Speaker 8>concept of group identity did not begin </v>
<v Speaker 8>with them.</v>

841
00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:01.040
<v Speaker 8>It began with a group that didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 8>to announce its identity.</v>

842
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:02.203
<v Speaker 8>When you are in control,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't have to announce who you are </v>

843
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:05.413
<v Speaker 8>so that many white brothers and sisters </v>
<v Speaker 8>don't see themselves as one among many </v>

844
00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:10.550
<v Speaker 8>other ethnicities or groups.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What they see themselves as,</v>

845
00:51:10.551 --> 00:51:12.050
<v Speaker 8>I'm just American,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm Canadian,</v>

846
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 8>can't you be like us?</v>

847
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.173
<v Speaker 8>Can't you transcend those narrow group </v>
<v Speaker 8>identifications and yet those group </v>

848
00:51:17.511 --> 00:51:18.344
<v Speaker 8>identifications have been imprinted upon</v>
<v Speaker 8>them by the very people who now because </v>

849
00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.010
<v Speaker 8>their,</v>
<v Speaker 8>their group power has been challenged.</v>

850
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.140
<v Speaker 8>Let's make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There is a challenge.</v>

851
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.333
<v Speaker 8>I agree with Mr. Fry in a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>Netherland of how sweet it would be to </v>

852
00:51:32.841 --> 00:51:36.860
<v Speaker 8>have a kingly and queen cleanly a </v>
<v Speaker 8>metaphor about how it got resolved.</v>

853
00:51:36.861 --> 00:51:38.120
<v Speaker 8>That ain't the real deal,</v>
<v Speaker 8>homie.</v>

854
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:41.960
<v Speaker 8>And in the real world and in the real </v>
<v Speaker 8>world,</v>

855
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.380
<v Speaker 8>there's stuff at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's at stake?</v>

856
00:51:44.381 --> 00:51:46.490
<v Speaker 8>Our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's at stake or people's lives,</v>

857
00:51:46.491 --> 00:51:48.020
<v Speaker 8>what's at stake?</v>
<v Speaker 8>People are still being lynched,</v>

858
00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:48.854
<v Speaker 8>killed what's at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People because of their sexuality and </v>

859
00:51:50.871 --> 00:51:52.780
<v Speaker 8>their racial identity are still being </v>
<v Speaker 8>harmed.</v>

860
00:51:52.781 --> 00:51:53.614
<v Speaker 8>So I'm suggesting to you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not that we are against being </v>

861
00:51:56.181 --> 00:51:59.060
<v Speaker 8>treated as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what we're crying for.</v>

862
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:02.690
<v Speaker 8>Please don't see me as a member of a </v>
<v Speaker 8>group that you think is a thug,</v>

863
00:52:02.691 --> 00:52:03.590
<v Speaker 8>a nigger,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

864
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:05.990
<v Speaker 8>a nihilist,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a pathological person.</v>

865
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:09.800
<v Speaker 8>See me as an individual who embodies the</v>
<v Speaker 8>realities were on.</v>

866
00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:10.653
<v Speaker 8>But I'll end by saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What Michelle said is extremely </v>

867
00:52:12.591 --> 00:52:16.370
<v Speaker 8>important.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The people who have individual rights,</v>

868
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:17.223
<v Speaker 8>it didn't have to fight for them in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>same manner that people of color and </v>

869
00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:24.610
<v Speaker 8>others have had to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When Mr Fried talked about getting slave</v>

870
00:52:24.611 --> 00:52:25.444
<v Speaker 8>man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he named them read Orlando Patterson's </v>

871
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:31.400
<v Speaker 8>comparative history of Race and slavery </v>
<v Speaker 8>over 28 civilizations.</v>

872
00:52:31.401 --> 00:52:33.830
<v Speaker 8>The Greeks did not have the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 8>slavery,</v>

873
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.890
<v Speaker 8>not American said it was chattel slavery</v>
<v Speaker 8>in Greece.</v>

874
00:52:36.891 --> 00:52:38.840
<v Speaker 8>You could buy back your,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your your freedom.</v>

875
00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:39.913
<v Speaker 8>You could teach the children of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>people who are enslaved you and because </v>

876
00:52:43.341 --> 00:52:47.060
<v Speaker 8>of your display of prodigious intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you could secure your freedom.</v>

877
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:47.953
<v Speaker 8>That was not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You were punished and killed for </v>

878
00:52:50.391 --> 00:52:53.360
<v Speaker 8>literacy in America.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So my point simply is this,</v>

879
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:54.523
<v Speaker 8>is that I am all for the celebration of </v>
<v Speaker 8>broader identities and I think that </v>

880
00:52:59.151 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 8>often those who are minorities and </v>
<v Speaker 8>others are not celebrated for the degree</v>

881
00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:03.860
<v Speaker 8>that we are.</v>

882
00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:08.030
<v Speaker 8>I'll end by saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In America we have the confederate flag.</v>

883
00:53:08.031 --> 00:53:09.410
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if y'all are familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>

884
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:14.690
<v Speaker 8>We have a confederate flag.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We have white guys mostly in the south,</v>

885
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:15.524
<v Speaker 8>but others as well flying those </v>
<v Speaker 8>confederate flags that are part of the </v>

886
00:53:19.071 --> 00:53:22.400
<v Speaker 8>south that refuse to seed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's legitimate.</v>

887
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:27.240
<v Speaker 8>A conquest at the hands of the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there has been a politics of resentment.</v>

888
00:53:27.241 --> 00:53:30.390
<v Speaker 8>Every you talking about politics of </v>
<v Speaker 8>identity wearing that flag,</v>

889
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.640
<v Speaker 8>not the American flag.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They are not American.</v>

890
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.900
<v Speaker 8>They are celebrating us.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The session a move away from America and</v>

891
00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:37.734
<v Speaker 8>a man named Colin Kaepernick who was a </v>
<v Speaker 8>football player saying I want to bring </v>

892
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.140
<v Speaker 8>beauty to that flag has been denied </v>
<v Speaker 8>opportunities.</v>

893
00:53:45.141 --> 00:53:49.490
<v Speaker 8>So we have to really set the terms of </v>
<v Speaker 8>debate in order before we,</v>

894
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:50.920
<v Speaker 8>we proceed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you man.</v>

895
00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.350
<v Speaker 10>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 10>let's have you jumped in on this idea of</v>

896
00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 7>what you see as the pernicious danger of</v>
<v Speaker 7>group think when it comes to ethnicity,</v>

897
00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:04.560
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when it comes to gender.</v>

898
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.950
<v Speaker 7>Why do you think that that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>primal sins in your view of,</v>

899
00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.380
<v Speaker 7>of quote political correctness?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

900
00:54:10.381 --> 00:54:11.214
<v Speaker 7>I think it's one of the primal sense of </v>
<v Speaker 7>identity politics players on the left </v>

901
00:54:14.311 --> 00:54:17.520
<v Speaker 7>and the right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just to be clear about that personally,</v>

902
00:54:17.521 --> 00:54:21.330
<v Speaker 7>since this has got personal at times,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm no fan of the identitarian right.</v>

903
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.150
<v Speaker 7>I think that anybody who plays a game,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

904
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.073
<v Speaker 7>conceptual game where group identity </v>
<v Speaker 7>comes first and foremost risks and </v>

905
00:54:28.831 --> 00:54:29.664
<v Speaker 7>exacerbation of tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't matter whether it's on the </v>

906
00:54:31.381 --> 00:54:32.800
<v Speaker 7>left to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

907
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.820
<v Speaker 7>with regards to the idea of group </v>
<v Speaker 7>rights?</v>

908
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:37.410
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a fundamental,</v>

909
00:54:37.411 --> 00:54:39.630
<v Speaker 7>and this is something we fall into </v>
<v Speaker 7>terribly in Canada,</v>

910
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:43.290
<v Speaker 7>not least because we had to contend with</v>
<v Speaker 7>the threat of Quebec separatism,</v>

911
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.513
<v Speaker 7>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the idea of group writes is </v>

912
00:54:45.601 --> 00:54:48.860
<v Speaker 7>extraordinarily problematic because the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

913
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:49.933
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the OBC verse of the coin of individual </v>

914
00:54:51.751 --> 00:54:54.020
<v Speaker 7>rights is individual responsibilities </v>
<v Speaker 7>can,</v>

915
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:58.440
<v Speaker 7>you can hold an individual responsible </v>
<v Speaker 7>and an individual can be responsible.</v>

916
00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:01.260
<v Speaker 7>And so that's partly why individuals </v>
<v Speaker 7>have rights,</v>

917
00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:05.010
<v Speaker 7>but groups,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how do you hold a group responsible?</v>

918
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.260
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the whole idea is not,</v>

919
00:55:07.261 --> 00:55:10.380
<v Speaker 7>it's not a good idea to hold a group </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsible if,</v>

920
00:55:10.381 --> 00:55:11.214
<v Speaker 7>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it flies in the face of the idea of the </v>

921
00:55:12.841 --> 00:55:13.674
<v Speaker 7>sort of justice systems that we've laid </v>
<v Speaker 7>out in the West that are essentially </v>

922
00:55:15.901 --> 00:55:18.780
<v Speaker 7>predicated first on the assumption of </v>
<v Speaker 7>individual innocence,</v>

923
00:55:18.781 --> 00:55:21.240
<v Speaker 7>but also on the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 7>individual guilt,</v>

924
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:24.810
<v Speaker 7>not group guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We saw what happened in the 20th century</v>

925
00:55:24.811 --> 00:55:25.644
<v Speaker 7>many,</v>
<v Speaker 7>many times when the idea of group guilt </v>

926
00:55:27.661 --> 00:55:30.540
<v Speaker 7>was he was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was enabled to get a foothold,</v>

927
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:32.610
<v Speaker 7>let's say in the polity and in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>justice system.</v>

928
00:55:32.611 --> 00:55:34.680
<v Speaker 7>It was absolutely catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so,</v>

929
00:55:34.681 --> 00:55:36.480
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fine group rights.</v>

930
00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:37.523
<v Speaker 7>Well what are you going,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how are you going to contend with the </v>

931
00:55:38.731 --> 00:55:39.564
<v Speaker 7>alternative to that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The opposite of that or where's the </v>

932
00:55:42.211 --> 00:55:44.520
<v Speaker 7>group responsibility?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How are we going to keep,</v>

933
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.710
<v Speaker 7>how are we going to hold your group's </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsible?</v>

934
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:48.570
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we don't have to talk about that because</v>

935
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.553
<v Speaker 7>we're too concerned with rectifying </v>
<v Speaker 7>hypothetical rec rectifying historical </v>

936
00:55:53.671 --> 00:55:55.830
<v Speaker 7>injustices,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hypothetical and otherwise.</v>

937
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:59.460
<v Speaker 7>And that's certainly not to say that </v>
<v Speaker 7>there weren't any shortage of absolutely</v>

938
00:55:59.461 --> 00:56:03.150
<v Speaker 7>catastrophic historical injustices.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not the point.</v>

939
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:04.583
<v Speaker 7>The point is how you view the situation </v>
<v Speaker 7>at the most fundamental level and group </v>

940
00:56:08.701 --> 00:56:11.220
<v Speaker 7>rights are absolute catastrophe in my </v>
<v Speaker 7>opinion.</v>

941
00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:12.750
<v Speaker 7>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's let Michelle come in on that.</v>

942
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:15.710
<v Speaker 10>Is this something you've written about?</v>

943
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:20.890
<v Speaker 7>The idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in identity politics,</v>

944
00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:21.910
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

945
00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:26.860
<v Speaker 7>the identity of the group is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 7>a valid part of the discourse and,</v>

946
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:27.694
<v Speaker 7>and individuals could and should be seen</v>
<v Speaker 7>and participate in groups as they enter </v>

947
00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:34.110
<v Speaker 7>into the civic space.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not sure sure</v>

948
00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:38.540
<v Speaker 6>that we necessarily have to analogize </v>
<v Speaker 6>from individual.</v>

949
00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:38.971
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

950
00:56:38.971 --> 00:56:41.970
<v Speaker 6>the opposite of individual rights is </v>
<v Speaker 6>individual responsibility.</v>

951
00:56:41.971 --> 00:56:45.810
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure that that analogy </v>
<v Speaker 6>necessarily holds for the groups,</v>

952
00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.770
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

953
00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:47.753
<v Speaker 6>in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And one of the things that I think is </v>

954
00:56:48.691 --> 00:56:49.524
<v Speaker 6>complicated about this discussion is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that we're talking about three very </v>

955
00:56:51.601 --> 00:56:54.630
<v Speaker 6>different cultural context,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three different histories,</v>

956
00:56:54.631 --> 00:56:59.280
<v Speaker 6>three different kind of legal regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But in the United States,</v>

957
00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:01.380
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a great,</v>

958
00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:02.843
<v Speaker 6>a huge part of our politics has been </v>
<v Speaker 6>groups struggling for rights for their </v>

959
00:57:09.151 --> 00:57:10.650
<v Speaker 6>individual members.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

960
00:57:10.651 --> 00:57:13.290
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so women in the United States,</v>

961
00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.153
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>seeking the right to reproductive </v>

962
00:57:16.651 --> 00:57:18.660
<v Speaker 6>control of their body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

963
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.553
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>African Americans in the United States </v>

964
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:22.703
<v Speaker 6>seeking redress from police brutality or</v>
<v Speaker 6>discrimination or simply the kind of </v>

965
00:57:28.741 --> 00:57:29.574
<v Speaker 6>tendency in America of white people to </v>
<v Speaker 6>call the police whenever they see an </v>

966
00:57:34.081 --> 00:57:37.230
<v Speaker 6>African American in a place where they </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't think that they're supposed to be.</v>

967
00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:41.160
<v Speaker 6>And you simply,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't see how you can contend with any</v>

968
00:57:41.161 --> 00:57:41.994
<v Speaker 6>of those social problems if you see </v>
<v Speaker 6>society as just an ocean of atomized </v>

969
00:57:46.561 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 6>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

970
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I just,</v>

971
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:50.170
<v Speaker 6>I again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

972
00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:52.410
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

973
00:57:52.411 --> 00:57:57.411
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 6>pernicious about people banding together</v>

974
00:57:58.530 --> 00:57:59.363
<v Speaker 6>on the basis of their common identity to</v>
<v Speaker 6>seek redress for discrimination and </v>

975
00:58:05.161 --> 00:58:05.971
<v Speaker 6>exclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

976
00:58:05.971 --> 00:58:10.440
<v Speaker 6>I think that that is everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>best about our democracy.</v>

977
00:58:10.441 --> 00:58:15.060
<v Speaker 6>That is the definition of progress.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so again,</v>

978
00:58:15.061 --> 00:58:17.640
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I keep stumbling with the idea that this</v>

979
00:58:17.641 --> 00:58:22.500
<v Speaker 6>is somehow tyrannical or that way lies </v>
<v Speaker 6>stolen ism.</v>

980
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:24.870
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

981
00:58:24.871 --> 00:58:25.704
<v Speaker 6>a lot of times people who are opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 6>political correctness talk about the </v>

982
00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:31.770
<v Speaker 6>concept of category creep or is it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

983
00:58:31.771 --> 00:58:32.604
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

984
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.140
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>category creek,</v>

985
00:58:34.141 --> 00:58:37.480
<v Speaker 6>which is a concept that was originated </v>
<v Speaker 6>by,</v>

986
00:58:37.481 --> 00:58:38.314
<v Speaker 6>I believe in Australian academic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's basically kind of a failure to </v>

987
00:58:41.041 --> 00:58:42.660
<v Speaker 6>draw distinctions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

988
00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:43.493
<v Speaker 6>So that you kind of can't see the </v>
<v Speaker 6>difference between say a KKK grand </v>

989
00:58:48.601 --> 00:58:52.770
<v Speaker 6>wizard and a conservative like say Ben </v>
<v Speaker 6>Shapiro or you know,</v>

990
00:58:52.771 --> 00:58:55.410
<v Speaker 6>that you kind of see everybody to your </v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

991
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.230
<v Speaker 6>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fascist,</v>

992
00:58:58.231 --> 00:58:59.064
<v Speaker 6>sexist to tall rotarian and tolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that that is a real thing </v>

993
00:59:03.781 --> 00:59:05.760
<v Speaker 6>that happens in part because,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

994
00:59:05.761 --> 00:59:10.761
<v Speaker 6>undergraduates often thinking broad and </v>
<v Speaker 6>slightly overwrought categories.</v>

995
00:59:11.941 --> 00:59:14.190
<v Speaker 6>I know I did when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I was a kid.</v>

996
00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:15.180
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

997
00:59:15.181 --> 00:59:16.200
<v Speaker 6>maybe still do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

998
00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:21.380
<v Speaker 6>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hear a lot of category creep in again,</v>

999
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:22.214
<v Speaker 6>the argument against political </v>
<v Speaker 6>correctness or against seeking group </v>

1000
00:59:24.801 --> 00:59:28.940
<v Speaker 6>readdress the idea that kind of that way</v>
<v Speaker 6>lies to humanization or you know,</v>

1001
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:30.480
<v Speaker 6>that you're kind of one minute</v>

1002
00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:31.773
<v Speaker 9>what's up steven,</v>
<v Speaker 9>come in on this part of your opening </v>

1003
00:59:33.191 --> 00:59:33.841
<v Speaker 9>remarks.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Your,</v>

1004
00:59:33.841 --> 00:59:36.850
<v Speaker 9>you're a category creeps.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Steven didn't respond to that.</v>

1005
00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:37.803
<v Speaker 9>It's a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm,</v>

1006
00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:41.410
<v Speaker 9>I'm still very lost about why we aren't </v>
<v Speaker 9>talking about political correctness.</v>

1007
00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:43.230
<v Speaker 9>We're talking about politics and uh,</v>

1008
00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.490
<v Speaker 10>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that's fine.</v>

1009
00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:48.320
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

1010
00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:49.613
<v Speaker 9>share exactly what you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not an enemy of identity politics </v>

1011
00:59:53.191 --> 00:59:54.024
<v Speaker 9>per se.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I can obviously see where it goes wrong </v>

1012
00:59:55.621 --> 00:59:58.500
<v Speaker 9>and where it's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let's be empirical about this.</v>

1013
00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:01.320
<v Speaker 9>How well is it working for you in </v>
<v Speaker 9>America at the moment?</v>

1014
01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:02.760
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>not well at all.</v>

1015
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.170
<v Speaker 10>Really isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you can ask me in a moment.</v>

1016
01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.830
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the reason,</v>

1017
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:09.263
<v Speaker 9>the reason that trump and brexit in </v>
<v Speaker 9>Britain and all kinds of nativist all </v>

1018
01:00:12.151 --> 01:00:14.910
<v Speaker 9>over Europe and succeeding is not the </v>
<v Speaker 9>time for the right.</v>

1019
01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.610
<v Speaker 9>It's the catastrophic failure of the </v>
<v Speaker 9>left.</v>

1020
01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.800
<v Speaker 10>It's our fault.</v>
<v Speaker 10>My point is not</v>

1021
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:27.380
<v Speaker 9>did I've turned to the right or anything</v>
<v Speaker 9>like that.</v>

1022
01:00:27.381 --> 01:00:29.900
<v Speaker 9>All that I'm nice and fluffy and want </v>
<v Speaker 9>everybody to be decent.</v>

1023
01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.420
<v Speaker 9>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 9>fuck political correctness,</v>

1024
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:36.200
<v Speaker 9>resist fight.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you have a point of view,</v>

1025
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.460
<v Speaker 9>fight it in the proper manner using </v>
<v Speaker 9>democracy as it should be.</v>

1026
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.380
<v Speaker 9>Not Channel</v>

1027
01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.213
<v Speaker 10>Love,</v>
<v Speaker 10>education,</v>

1028
01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.750
<v Speaker 10>not language.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

1029
01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.760
<v Speaker 10>it's so silly,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but</v>

1030
01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:47.650
<v Speaker 9>you think that there's a chess rule.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1031
01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.513
<v Speaker 9>in chess,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the best move to playing chess is not </v>

1032
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:51.303
<v Speaker 9>the best chess move.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's the move your opponent least wants </v>

1033
01:00:53.891 --> 01:00:54.724
<v Speaker 9>you to play.</v>
<v Speaker 9>At the moment you're being recruiting </v>

1034
01:00:56.711 --> 01:00:58.010
<v Speaker 9>sergeants for the right,</v>

1035
01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:02.180
<v Speaker 8>knowing an upsetting,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and instead of fighting,</v>

1036
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:03.103
<v Speaker 8>either fighting or persuading.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But political correctness is a middle </v>

1037
01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:08.410
<v Speaker 8>course that simply doesn't work well.</v>
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>

1038
01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.710
<v Speaker 8>please,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you said be empirical.</v>

1039
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.360
<v Speaker 8>Empirical,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as far as I know,</v>

1040
01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.373
<v Speaker 8>the word means that which can be </v>
<v Speaker 8>verified if falsify through the </v>

1041
01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:14.774
<v Speaker 8>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Exactly.</v>

1042
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:18.190
<v Speaker 8>So if we look at it in an objective a </v>
<v Speaker 8>way,</v>

1043
01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:18.880
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

1044
01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.713
<v Speaker 8>the reality is that people don't have </v>
<v Speaker 8>equal access to the means to articulate </v>

1045
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:24.553
<v Speaker 8>the very moment you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm talking about the empirical results </v>

1046
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:28.850
<v Speaker 8>of this political attitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I understand that,</v>

1047
01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:29.684
<v Speaker 8>but my point is simply this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm suggesting to you that people use </v>

1048
01:01:32.811 --> 01:01:36.560
<v Speaker 8>the weapons at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now it was Abraham Joshua Heschel,</v>

1049
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:38.540
<v Speaker 8>rabbi who said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>everybody's not guilty,</v>

1050
01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:41.060
<v Speaker 8>but everybody's responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1051
01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:43.760
<v Speaker 8>That's a distinction there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Everybody clearly is not guilty.</v>

1052
01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:45.410
<v Speaker 8>But what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and look at the flip side,</v>

1053
01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:46.423
<v Speaker 8>if you have benefited from 300 years of </v>
<v Speaker 8>holding people in servitude thinking </v>

1054
01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:53.550
<v Speaker 8>that you did it all on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why can't these people work harder?</v>

1055
01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:56.060
<v Speaker 8>And let me see you for 300 years you </v>
<v Speaker 8>ain't had no job.</v>

1056
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.420
<v Speaker 8>So the reality is for 300 years,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you old people in the bands,</v>

1057
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.690
<v Speaker 8>you hold them in subordination,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you refuse to give them rights.</v>

1058
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:03.583
<v Speaker 8>Then all of a sudden you free them and </v>
<v Speaker 8>say you're now individuals not having </v>

1059
01:02:07.011 --> 01:02:12.011
<v Speaker 8>the skills,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the skills optimized America.</v>

1060
01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.360
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm talking of the American society.</v>

1061
01:02:14.361 --> 01:02:15.194
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm talking about the northern </v>

1062
01:02:15.861 --> 01:02:16.694
<v Speaker 8>hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm talking about every society where </v>

1063
01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:19.163
<v Speaker 8>enslavement has existed,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I'm speaking specifically of the </v>

1064
01:02:21.601 --> 01:02:22.434
<v Speaker 8>repudiation of individual rights among </v>
<v Speaker 8>people of Color in America who were </v>

1065
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:28.920
<v Speaker 8>denied the opportunity to be </v>
<v Speaker 8>individuals.</v>

1066
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.440
<v Speaker 8>So I see,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I obviously an ideal we'd,</v>

1067
01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:35.370
<v Speaker 8>I think Michelle Goldberg does to agree </v>
<v Speaker 8>with the emphasis on individuals.</v>

1068
01:02:35.371 --> 01:02:39.450
<v Speaker 8>What we're saying to you is that we have</v>
<v Speaker 8>not been permitted to be individuals.</v>

1069
01:02:39.451 --> 01:02:40.284
<v Speaker 8>We have not been permitted to exercise </v>
<v Speaker 8>our individual autonomy and authority </v>

1070
01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:45.450
<v Speaker 8>and the refusal to do so.</v>

1071
01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:49.170
<v Speaker 8>To recognize me as an individual means </v>
<v Speaker 8>when you roll up on me and I'm a 12 year</v>

1072
01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:50.004
<v Speaker 8>old boy in a park and you shoot first in</v>
<v Speaker 8>ways you do the black kids that you </v>

1073
01:02:53.731 --> 01:02:54.564
<v Speaker 8>don't do the white kids,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you are not treating that person as an </v>

1074
01:02:57.151 --> 01:03:00.030
<v Speaker 8>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If we're living in a society where women</v>

1075
01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:05.180
<v Speaker 8>are subject to aberrant forms of horrid </v>
<v Speaker 8>to patriarchal,</v>

1076
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:09.480
<v Speaker 8>sexist and misogynist behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you are not acknowledging the centrality</v>

1077
01:03:09.481 --> 01:03:13.850
<v Speaker 8>of the individuality of women.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You are treating them according to eight</v>

1078
01:03:13.851 --> 01:03:15.510
<v Speaker 8>group dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And if we,</v>

1079
01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:20.570
<v Speaker 8>if we get beyond the ability of people </v>
<v Speaker 8>on the right to understand the degree to</v>

1080
01:03:20.821 --> 01:03:25.580
<v Speaker 8>which they have operated from the basis </v>
<v Speaker 8>of benefit from group identity,</v>

1081
01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.030
<v Speaker 8>without having to say like by saying </v>
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>

1082
01:03:27.031 --> 01:03:29.550
<v Speaker 8>the great American philosopher beyond </v>
<v Speaker 8>say nose</v>

1083
01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:31.943
<v Speaker 8>say it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that it has been said that racism is so </v>

1084
01:03:34.021 --> 01:03:34.854
<v Speaker 8>American that if you challenge racism,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you look like you're challenging </v>

1085
01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:41.610
<v Speaker 8>America.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We are challenging inequality.</v>

1086
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:42.713
<v Speaker 8>We are challenging the refusal to see me</v>
<v Speaker 8>as an individual when we overcome that </v>

1087
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.420
<v Speaker 8>have added,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're all on here.</v>

1088
01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:52.970
<v Speaker 7>Three items getting stirred here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A couple of questions.</v>

1089
01:03:52.971 --> 01:03:56.120
<v Speaker 7>So let's let your sites folks are going </v>
<v Speaker 7>to go to Jordan then to you.</v>

1090
01:03:56.121 --> 01:03:59.870
<v Speaker 7>Let's just assume for a moment that I've</v>
<v Speaker 7>benefited from my white privilege.</v>

1091
01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.600
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So let's assume that that's fine.</v>

1092
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:04.610
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well that's what you would say.</v>

1093
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.863
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1094
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:06.950
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so let</v>

1095
01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:09.600
<v Speaker 8>here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let's get precise this,</v>

1096
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:11.990
<v Speaker 8>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Was that in the very individual of you?</v>

1097
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:14.810
<v Speaker 8>Let's get precise about this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1098
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:15.683
<v Speaker 8>He's good.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Precise</v>

1099
01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:16.573
<v Speaker 7>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is My preference present level of </v>

1100
01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:22.190
<v Speaker 7>attainment or achievement?</v>
<v Speaker 7>A consequence of my white privilege.</v>

1101
01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:27.191
<v Speaker 7>And I don't mean sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean do you mean 5% do you mean 15% do</v>

1102
01:04:27.531 --> 01:04:32.270
<v Speaker 7>you mean 25% do you mean 75% and what do</v>
<v Speaker 7>you propose I do about it?</v>

1103
01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.373
<v Speaker 7>How about a tax?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How about a tax that's like specialized </v>

1104
01:04:36.651 --> 01:04:39.050
<v Speaker 7>for me so that I can account for my damn</v>
<v Speaker 7>privilege.</v>

1105
01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:40.810
<v Speaker 7>You,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you read about it?</v>

1106
01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:44.350
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>
<v Speaker 11>let's get precise about one other thing.</v>

1107
01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:46.240
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We'll get precise</v>

1108
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:49.010
<v Speaker 7>about one other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's sites.</v>

1109
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:50.310
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>precise.</v>

1110
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:52.960
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so if,</v>

1111
01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:57.830
<v Speaker 7>if we can agree and we haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that the left can go too far,</v>

1112
01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:58.693
<v Speaker 7>which it clearly camp,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then how would my worthy opponents </v>

1113
01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:06.080
<v Speaker 7>precisely defined when the left that </v>
<v Speaker 7>they stand for has gone too far?</v>

1114
01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:08.570
<v Speaker 7>You didn't like equity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>equality of outcome.</v>

1115
01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:09.404
<v Speaker 7>I think that's a great marker.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But if you have a better suggestion and </v>

1116
01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:12.883
<v Speaker 7>won't sidestep the question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So let's figure out how I can dispense </v>

1117
01:05:15.381 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 7>with my white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so that you can tell me</v>

1118
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.680
<v Speaker 6>when the left has gone too far since </v>
<v Speaker 6>they clearly can.</v>

1119
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.530
<v Speaker 6>And that's what this debate is about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>about political correctness.</v>

1120
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.753
<v Speaker 6>It's about the left going too far.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think it's gone too far in many </v>

1121
01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:28.234
<v Speaker 6>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'd like to figure out exactly how </v>

1122
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 6>and when.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the reasonable left could make it's a</v>

1123
01:05:31.991 --> 01:05:34.390
<v Speaker 6>sentence again and we could quit all </v>
<v Speaker 6>this nonsense.</v>

1124
01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:36.373
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1125
01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:42.953
<v Speaker 6>I will answer you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I just want to answer Steven Fry </v>

1126
01:05:44.131 --> 01:05:45.660
<v Speaker 6>first because you talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1127
01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:48.990
<v Speaker 6>this is how we got trump and this is the</v>
<v Speaker 6>failure of the left.</v>

1128
01:05:48.991 --> 01:05:50.530
<v Speaker 6>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1129
01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:51.383
<v Speaker 6>I'm a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went to a ton of trump rallies during </v>

1130
01:05:53.641 --> 01:05:56.040
<v Speaker 6>the campaign in different parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>country.</v>

1131
01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:58.050
<v Speaker 6>And you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everywhere I went,</v>

1132
01:05:58.051 --> 01:06:00.630
<v Speaker 6>I heard complaints about political </v>
<v Speaker 6>correctness,</v>

1133
01:06:00.631 --> 01:06:01.464
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>far more than I heard complaints about </v>

1134
01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:04.630
<v Speaker 6>say Nafta.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1135
01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:09.840
<v Speaker 6>but when you asked people what they </v>
<v Speaker 6>meant by political correctness,</v>

1136
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:11.400
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they call it a woman.</v>

1137
01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:14.850
<v Speaker 6>They worked with girl and she got mad at</v>
<v Speaker 6>them and you know,</v>

1138
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:15.661
<v Speaker 6>they could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1139
01:06:15.661 --> 01:06:16.494
<v Speaker 6>you couldn't in public wonder aloud </v>
<v Speaker 6>whether the president of the United </v>

1140
01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.240
<v Speaker 6>States was really a Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1141
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:22.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they didn't like that they couldn't make</v>

1142
01:06:22.861 --> 01:06:25.230
<v Speaker 6>gay jokes anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so on the one hand,</v>

1143
01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:26.550
<v Speaker 6>you're right and I've written about </v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

1144
01:06:26.551 --> 01:06:29.460
<v Speaker 6>I think that when you try to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1145
01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:30.413
<v Speaker 6>support,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know that when people have these </v>

1146
01:06:32.551 --> 01:06:33.384
<v Speaker 6>prejudices and you try to suppress them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it can create a kind of dangerous </v>

1147
01:06:39.001 --> 01:06:40.020
<v Speaker 6>counter reaction.</v>

1148
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:42.400
<v Speaker 6>But I also think that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1149
01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:44.970
<v Speaker 6>what they were reacting to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>again to go,</v>

1150
01:06:44.971 --> 01:06:47.760
<v Speaker 6>to go back to the title of this debate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what they called political correctness.</v>

1151
01:06:47.761 --> 01:06:48.594
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fact that they had to have this </v>

1152
01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.240
<v Speaker 6>urbain black president who they felt </v>
<v Speaker 6>talked down to that which is really what</v>

1153
01:06:54.241 --> 01:06:55.150
<v Speaker 6>they meant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1154
01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.590
<v Speaker 6>I don't see a way around that because </v>
<v Speaker 6>that is,</v>

1155
01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.240
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's progress.</v>

1156
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:03.060
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so to go to the,</v>

1157
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:05.130
<v Speaker 6>to the question of when the left goes </v>
<v Speaker 6>too far,</v>

1158
01:07:05.131 --> 01:07:05.964
<v Speaker 6>I mean to me it's pretty easy violence </v>
<v Speaker 6>and censorship against violence and I'm </v>

1159
01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:13.613
<v Speaker 6>against censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I also looking around the world </v>

1160
01:07:18.211 --> 01:07:22.350
<v Speaker 6>right now when the idea that there is </v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

1161
01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.233
<v Speaker 6>I understand again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is like a problem of kind of left </v>

1162
01:07:27.151 --> 01:07:29.190
<v Speaker 6>wing annoyance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1163
01:07:29.191 --> 01:07:32.190
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of things that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

1164
01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:37.220
<v Speaker 6>random people on the internet in </v>
<v Speaker 6>particular are able to swarm individuals</v>

1165
01:07:39.421 --> 01:07:43.350
<v Speaker 6>and turn kind of stray remarks and just </v>
<v Speaker 6>social media campaigns.</v>

1166
01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:44.243
<v Speaker 6>And this is often conflated with </v>
<v Speaker 6>political correctness and it's a bad </v>

1167
01:07:47.161 --> 01:07:47.994
<v Speaker 6>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wish there was a way to put an end to </v>

1168
01:07:49.591 --> 01:07:50.430
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think there,</v>

1169
01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.293
<v Speaker 6>there is no way to put an end to it </v>
<v Speaker 6>simply by having kind of reasonable </v>

1170
01:07:54.631 --> 01:07:58.290
<v Speaker 6>liberals are reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Socialists denounce it because it's just</v>

1171
01:07:58.291 --> 01:08:01.470
<v Speaker 6>a kind of awful phenomenon of modern </v>
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>

1172
01:08:01.471 --> 01:08:02.304
<v Speaker 6>And if you want to have a debate about </v>
<v Speaker 6>whether social media is terrible for </v>

1173
01:08:04.891 --> 01:08:07.740
<v Speaker 6>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I will be on the gay side.</v>

1174
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but right now where I really disagree.</v>

1175
01:08:13.891 --> 01:08:14.990
<v Speaker 6>Well a couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a couple of,</v>

1176
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:17.060
<v Speaker 6>I really disagree but I'm going to go to</v>
<v Speaker 6>Michael,</v>

1177
01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:22.270
<v Speaker 6>but the idea that the radical left poses</v>
<v Speaker 6>a greater threat than the radical right.</v>

1178
01:08:22.611 --> 01:08:23.444
<v Speaker 6>When you see fat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like actual fascism ascendant all over </v>

1179
01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:27.374
<v Speaker 6>the world strikes me as something that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you can literally only believe if you </v>

1180
01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:32.300
<v Speaker 6>spend your life on college campuses.</v>

1181
01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:35.340
<v Speaker 8>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I want to come to you on those.</v>

1182
01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:36.503
<v Speaker 8>Pregnant Shaw on Jordan's point about </v>
<v Speaker 8>how does he in a sense get an equal </v>

1183
01:08:41.161 --> 01:08:41.994
<v Speaker 8>voice in this debate back if it is </v>
<v Speaker 8>implied that his participation brings </v>

1184
01:08:46.501 --> 01:08:47.334
<v Speaker 8>with it this baggage of white privilege </v>
<v Speaker 8>that doesn't allow him to see clearly </v>

1185
01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.213
<v Speaker 8>the issues that are before us.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But that is to be complicit in the very </v>

1186
01:08:55.651 --> 01:08:56.484
<v Speaker 8>problem that self terminal.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Logically you're beginning at a point </v>

1187
01:08:58.381 --> 01:08:59.214
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's already a productive and </v>

1188
01:09:00.931 --> 01:09:01.764
<v Speaker 8>controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're saying how can he get his </v>

1189
01:09:03.331 --> 01:09:05.310
<v Speaker 8>equality?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Beck who you talking about?</v>

1190
01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:08.640
<v Speaker 8>Jordan Peterson trending number one on </v>
<v Speaker 8>twitter.</v>

1191
01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.330
<v Speaker 8>Jordan Peterson international </v>
<v Speaker 8>bestseller.</v>

1192
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:18.060
<v Speaker 8>I want him to tweet something out about </v>
<v Speaker 8>me and my book Jordan Peterson,</v>

1193
01:09:18.570 --> 01:09:20.670
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is what I'm saying to you,</v>

1194
01:09:20.671 --> 01:09:22.380
<v Speaker 8>why the rage,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bruh?</v>

1195
01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:23.553
<v Speaker 8>You you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're doing well but your amine mad </v>

1196
01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:30.230
<v Speaker 8>white man and you're going to get us </v>
<v Speaker 8>right and</v>

1197
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:35.220
<v Speaker 8>I have never seen so much line and snow </v>
<v Speaker 8>flaking.</v>

1198
01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.830
<v Speaker 8>There's enough light in here to start a </v>
<v Speaker 8>vineyard.</v>

1199
01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:39.803
<v Speaker 8>And what I'm saying to you empirically </v>
<v Speaker 8>and precisely when you asked the </v>

1200
01:09:42.901 --> 01:09:46.530
<v Speaker 8>question about white privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the fact that you ask it and the way you</v>

1201
01:09:46.531 --> 01:09:47.364
<v Speaker 8>did dismissive pseudoscientific,</v>
<v Speaker 8>non empirical and without justification </v>

1202
01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:52.613
<v Speaker 8>a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the truth is that white privilege </v>

1203
01:09:54.511 --> 01:09:57.810
<v Speaker 8>doesn't act according to a quantifiable </v>
<v Speaker 8>segments.</v>

1204
01:09:57.930 --> 01:10:02.130
<v Speaker 8>It's about the degree to which we are </v>
<v Speaker 8>willing as a society to grapple with the</v>

1205
01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:02.964
<v Speaker 8>ideals of treat them justice and </v>
<v Speaker 8>equality upon which is base number two </v>

1206
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:08.303
<v Speaker 8>was interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're talking about not having a </v>

1207
01:10:10.021 --> 01:10:11.700
<v Speaker 8>collective identity.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What do you call a nation?</v>

1208
01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.970
<v Speaker 8>Are you Canadian?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Are you Canadian by yourself?</v>

1209
01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:17.910
<v Speaker 8>Are you an individual or are you part of</v>
<v Speaker 8>a group?</v>

1210
01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:18.983
<v Speaker 8>When America have formed it's union,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it did so in opposition to another </v>

1211
01:10:24.361 --> 01:10:25.194
<v Speaker 8>group,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so the reality is is that those who are </v>

1212
01:10:27.151 --> 01:10:27.984
<v Speaker 8>part of group identities and politics </v>
<v Speaker 8>denied the legitimacy and validity of </v>

1213
01:10:31.921 --> 01:10:32.754
<v Speaker 8>those groups and the fact that they have</v>
<v Speaker 8>been created thusly and ben have </v>

1214
01:10:36.961 --> 01:10:38.910
<v Speaker 8>resentment against others.</v>

1215
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:39.893
<v Speaker 8>All I'm asking for is the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 8>that this the quotation you talk about </v>

1216
01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:47.760
<v Speaker 8>the difference between quality of </v>
<v Speaker 8>outcome and equality of opportunity.</v>

1217
01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:48.683
<v Speaker 8>That's a state and retried argument.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hackneyed phrase derived from the </v>

1218
01:10:52.321 --> 01:10:54.510
<v Speaker 8>halcyon days of the debate over </v>
<v Speaker 8>affirmative action.</v>

1219
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:55.583
<v Speaker 8>Are you looking for outcomes that can be</v>
<v Speaker 8>determined equally or are you looking </v>

1220
01:10:59.071 --> 01:10:59.904
<v Speaker 8>for opportunity?</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you free a person after a whole long </v>

1221
01:11:03.121 --> 01:11:03.954
<v Speaker 8>time of oppression and say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>now you are free to survive if you have </v>

1222
01:11:07.261 --> 01:11:08.094
<v Speaker 8>no skills,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you have no quantifiable means of </v>

1223
01:11:09.901 --> 01:11:10.734
<v Speaker 8>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what you have done is liberated them </v>

1224
01:11:12.571 --> 01:11:15.120
<v Speaker 8>into,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and all I'm suggesting to you,</v>

1225
01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.970
<v Speaker 8>Lyndon Baines Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of our great presidents said,</v>

1226
01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:21.870
<v Speaker 8>if you start a man in a race a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 8>years behind,</v>

1227
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:22.883
<v Speaker 8>it is awfully difficult to catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I don't think Jordan Peterson is </v>

1228
01:11:26.071 --> 01:11:26.904
<v Speaker 8>suffering from anything except an </v>
<v Speaker 8>exaggerated sense of entitlement and </v>

1229
01:11:30.841 --> 01:11:31.674
<v Speaker 8>resentment and his own privilege is </v>
<v Speaker 8>invisible to him and it's manifest with </v>

1230
01:11:35.521 --> 01:11:37.860
<v Speaker 8>lethal intensity and ferocity right </v>
<v Speaker 8>here.</v>

1231
01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:38.694
<v Speaker 8>All state</v>

1232
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.390
<v Speaker 4>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you respond to that?</v>

1233
01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.033
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what I derived from that series of </v>

1234
01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:53.630
<v Speaker 7>rebuttals,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say is two fold.</v>

1235
01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:54.793
<v Speaker 7>The first is that saying that the </v>
<v Speaker 7>radical left goes too far when they </v>

1236
01:11:58.551 --> 01:11:59.384
<v Speaker 7>engage in violence is not a sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 7>response by any stretch of the </v>

1237
01:12:02.991 --> 01:12:03.824
<v Speaker 7>imagination because there are sets of </v>
<v Speaker 7>ideas in radical leftist thinking that </v>

1238
01:12:07.191 --> 01:12:09.860
<v Speaker 7>led to the catastrophes of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 7>century,</v>

1239
01:12:09.861 --> 01:12:13.520
<v Speaker 7>and that was at the level of idea,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not at the level of violent action.</v>

1240
01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.250
<v Speaker 7>It's a very straightforward thing to say</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're against the violence.</v>

1241
01:12:16.251 --> 01:12:18.080
<v Speaker 7>It's like being against poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1242
01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:19.220
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>gender,</v>

1243
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:20.083
<v Speaker 7>generically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>decent people are against poverty and </v>

1244
01:12:23.511 --> 01:12:24.344
<v Speaker 7>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't address the issue in the </v>

1245
01:12:25.521 --> 01:12:26.480
<v Speaker 7>least.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1246
01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:29.720
<v Speaker 7>and with regards to my privilege or lack</v>
<v Speaker 7>thereof,</v>

1247
01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:31.083
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not making the case that I haven't </v>

1248
01:12:32.931 --> 01:12:36.080
<v Speaker 7>had advantages in my life and </v>
<v Speaker 7>disadvantages in my life.</v>

1249
01:12:36.081 --> 01:12:36.914
<v Speaker 7>Like most people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't know anything about my </v>

1250
01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:39.360
<v Speaker 7>background and where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It,</v>

1251
01:12:39.361 --> 01:12:42.980
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't matter to you because </v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamentally I'm a mean white man.</v>

1252
01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.480
<v Speaker 7>That's a hell of a thing to say</v>

1253
01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:49.840
<v Speaker 4>eight [inaudible].</v>

1254
01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.133
<v Speaker 8>Let me just say very,</v>
<v Speaker 8>very brief because I want to move on to </v>

1255
01:12:59.181 --> 01:13:00.014
<v Speaker 8>men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The main man white comment was not </v>

1256
01:13:03.171 --> 01:13:08.120
<v Speaker 8>predicated upon my historical excavation</v>
<v Speaker 8>of your pants is based upon the evidence</v>

1257
01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:08.983
<v Speaker 8>Vitreo with which you speak and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>denial of a sense of equanimity among </v>

1258
01:13:12.771 --> 01:13:15.950
<v Speaker 8>the combatants in an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I'm saying again,</v>

1259
01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.620
<v Speaker 8>you're a mean man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>white man and the viciousness,</v>

1260
01:13:18.621 --> 01:13:19.454
<v Speaker 8>is that right?</v>

1261
01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:20.543
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1262
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:28.020
<v Speaker 8>We recently changed the decks here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's talk about that.</v>

1263
01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:28.973
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>another big factor of the so called </v>

1264
01:13:30.991 --> 01:13:32.520
<v Speaker 7>politically correct movement right now,</v>

1265
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:33.623
<v Speaker 5>which is the me too movement and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>extent to which we've seen this a </v>

1266
01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:39.000
<v Speaker 5>resurgence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this awakening around,</v>

1267
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:40.223
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what have been a horrible series of </v>

1268
01:13:42.421 --> 01:13:45.210
<v Speaker 5>systemic abuses and injustices towards </v>
<v Speaker 5>women.</v>

1269
01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.553
<v Speaker 5>Some people though Michelle would say </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we're in a cultural panic now that </v>

1270
01:13:49.581 --> 01:13:50.414
<v Speaker 5>the pendulum has swung too far and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there isn't a dangerous overreaction </v>

1271
01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:55.973
<v Speaker 5>going on where people's rights </v>
<v Speaker 5>reputations due process has been thrown </v>

1272
01:14:00.331 --> 01:14:02.340
<v Speaker 5>to the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you respond to that?</v>

1273
01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:03.573
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first people started seeing that within </v>

1274
01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:05.964
<v Speaker 5>like two weeks of the first Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 5>Weinstein stories breaking right at the </v>

1275
01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 5>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Harvey Weinsteins and,</v>

1276
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:16.420
<v Speaker 6>and people actually men act started </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually losing their jobs over this.</v>

1277
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:17.254
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which was something quite new that men </v>

1278
01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:22.870
<v Speaker 6>with histories of really serious </v>
<v Speaker 6>predatory behavior where suddenly losing</v>

1279
01:14:22.871 --> 01:14:23.860
<v Speaker 6>their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1280
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:24.783
<v Speaker 6>everybody had known about it for a long </v>
<v Speaker 6>time and there had been a sort of </v>

1281
01:14:27.161 --> 01:14:27.994
<v Speaker 6>implicit impunity and suddenly that was </v>
<v Speaker 6>taken away and it created this cultural </v>

1282
01:14:31.661 --> 01:14:33.130
<v Speaker 6>earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And as soon as it did,</v>

1283
01:14:33.131 --> 01:14:37.540
<v Speaker 6>it created a lot of anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what if this goes too far?</v>

1284
01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:38.620
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1285
01:14:38.621 --> 01:14:39.454
<v Speaker 6>I mean the me too movement was only a </v>
<v Speaker 6>couple of months old when my newspaper </v>

1286
01:14:42.781 --> 01:14:45.550
<v Speaker 6>started running columns from people </v>
<v Speaker 6>saying,</v>

1287
01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:50.800
<v Speaker 6>why can't I criticize me to which they </v>
<v Speaker 6>were doing in my newspaper?</v>

1288
01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so on the one hand,</v>

1289
01:14:53.471 --> 01:14:56.050
<v Speaker 6>guests of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is due process important.</v>

1290
01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.033
<v Speaker 6>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that when you look at who has </v>

1291
01:14:59.861 --> 01:15:03.400
<v Speaker 6>actually lost their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's actually lost their livelihoods,</v>

1292
01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.200
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look round,</v>

1293
01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:05.890
<v Speaker 6>it's people.</v>

1294
01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:09.400
<v Speaker 6>It's not people in general on a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1295
01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:10.493
<v Speaker 6>mccarthyism rumor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's people who took their dicks out at </v>

1296
01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:14.050
<v Speaker 6>work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's people who,</v>

1297
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:15.183
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>

1298
01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:18.480
<v Speaker 6>it's people who there was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1299
01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.713
<v Speaker 6>10,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tens of millions of dollars of </v>

1300
01:15:20.771 --> 01:15:21.604
<v Speaker 6>settlements and they lost their job for </v>
<v Speaker 6>four months and now they're staging </v>

1301
01:15:23.591 --> 01:15:24.880
<v Speaker 6>comebacks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1302
01:15:24.881 --> 01:15:28.090
<v Speaker 6>Bill O'reilly is about to get a TV show </v>
<v Speaker 6>on a new network.</v>

1303
01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:29.043
<v Speaker 6>So the idea that again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this idea that kind of like men </v>

1304
01:15:33.251 --> 01:15:34.084
<v Speaker 6>everywhere feel like they can't talk </v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore and everybody's walking on </v>

1305
01:15:36.791 --> 01:15:37.840
<v Speaker 6>eggshells.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I don't know,</v>

1306
01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:40.540
<v Speaker 6>maybe that's true in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in your offices.</v>

1307
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:41.420
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1308
01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:43.330
<v Speaker 6>it's not true where,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where I live,</v>

1309
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.193
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the me too movement has been </v>

1310
01:15:46.451 --> 01:15:50.290
<v Speaker 6>particularly active in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in media.</v>

1311
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.440
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was this,</v>

1312
01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:52.473
<v Speaker 6>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how many do you guys read </v>

1313
01:15:53.621 --> 01:15:55.710
<v Speaker 6>about the shitty media medalist?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1314
01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:56.973
<v Speaker 6>a woman wrote about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she started this sort of open source </v>

1315
01:15:59.651 --> 01:16:04.570
<v Speaker 6>document where women could list men and </v>
<v Speaker 6>media that everybody knew about,</v>

1316
01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.610
<v Speaker 6>but nobody had ever done anything about.</v>

1317
01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:07.773
<v Speaker 6>And it very quickly went public and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there was something sort of disturbing </v>

1318
01:16:10.781 --> 01:16:11.321
<v Speaker 6>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1319
01:16:11.321 --> 01:16:14.620
<v Speaker 6>You don't like these anonymous </v>
<v Speaker 6>accusations floating around.</v>

1320
01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.600
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most feminists I know,</v>

1321
01:16:16.601 --> 01:16:20.350
<v Speaker 6>including myself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>were kind of freaked out by it.</v>

1322
01:16:20.351 --> 01:16:25.351
<v Speaker 6>And thought it was unfair to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>people's reputations held up like this.</v>

1323
01:16:25.601 --> 01:16:28.900
<v Speaker 6>But if you look at what happened to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>men on the list,</v>

1324
01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:30.460
<v Speaker 6>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1325
01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:32.740
<v Speaker 6>they still have their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know men on that list.</v>

1326
01:16:32.741 --> 01:16:37.420
<v Speaker 6>I work with men on that list.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The people who actually people have only</v>

1327
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:38.423
<v Speaker 6>buy in as far as I can think in media,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the people who have lost their jobs and </v>

1328
01:16:41.591 --> 01:16:42.424
<v Speaker 6>lost their careers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's been four extremely serious </v>

1329
01:16:45.551 --> 01:16:50.551
<v Speaker 6>misbehavior documented by multiple women</v>
<v Speaker 6>who had corroborating witnesses.</v>

1330
01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:55.660
<v Speaker 6>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I understand this anxiety that relations</v>

1331
01:16:55.661 --> 01:16:56.494
<v Speaker 6>between men and women are changing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course that causes a lot of cultural </v>

1332
01:16:58.871 --> 01:16:59.704
<v Speaker 6>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I don't know that it's rooted in </v>

1333
01:17:01.601 --> 01:17:04.720
<v Speaker 6>anything real in his view on this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are we in a cultural panic?</v>

1334
01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:09.721
<v Speaker 6>Is the response to Michelle says </v>
<v Speaker 6>commensurate with the very confused</v>

1335
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:11.083
<v Speaker 9>by this?</v>
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>

1336
01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:12.620
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>of course I,</v>

1337
01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.640
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I recognize the best,</v>

1338
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:18.740
<v Speaker 9>the attitude Weinstein and the </v>
<v Speaker 9>monstrosity of his behavior.</v>

1339
01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.360
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and it was shocking to me.</v>

1340
01:17:20.361 --> 01:17:22.040
<v Speaker 9>I actually worked for him,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

1341
01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:26.320
<v Speaker 9>script doctoring cause it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I never had the bathroom toe.</v>

1342
01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:28.010
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1343
01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.020
<v Speaker 9>but I'm pretty obvious reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's,</v>

1344
01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:33.213
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>grotesque and I can't imagine how vile </v>

1345
01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.280
<v Speaker 9>it must be for such a powerful now then </v>
<v Speaker 9>he was,</v>

1346
01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:40.690
<v Speaker 9>I used to play a game at the Cannes film</v>
<v Speaker 9>festival where,</v>

1347
01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.160
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>years of power,</v>

1348
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:46.040
<v Speaker 9>we're walking from one hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the uh,</v>

1349
01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.390
<v Speaker 9>at the end that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1350
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:49.430
<v Speaker 9>all the way up to the palliative </v>
<v Speaker 9>festival.</v>

1351
01:17:49.710 --> 01:17:50.543
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you would get 10 points every time you </v>

1352
01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:53.900
<v Speaker 9>heard the word harvey.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

1353
01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:54.813
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>usually a 10 minute walk you'd have a </v>

1354
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:59.870
<v Speaker 9>300 points because it was Yo homies got </v>
<v Speaker 9>the script.</v>

1355
01:17:59.871 --> 01:18:00.770
<v Speaker 9>Harvey's got it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

1356
01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:03.710
<v Speaker 9>I've got a meeting with harvey at the </v>
<v Speaker 9>majestic in the afternoon.</v>

1357
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:04.663
<v Speaker 9>He was immensely powerful and I think </v>
<v Speaker 9>that's obvious that someone in that </v>

1358
01:18:08.151 --> 01:18:09.770
<v Speaker 9>position,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1359
01:18:09.771 --> 01:18:12.640
<v Speaker 9>abusing him threatening and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1360
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:16.580
<v Speaker 9>hindering the livelihood of women is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is good test skin in the extreme.</v>

1361
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:21.470
<v Speaker 9>But I have to tell you that there is </v>
<v Speaker 9>genuine feeling amongst many people.</v>

1362
01:18:21.471 --> 01:18:25.130
<v Speaker 9>I know</v>
<v Speaker 9>that we come speak our minds.</v>

1363
01:18:25.131 --> 01:18:28.490
<v Speaker 9>We can't actually speak to the true </v>
<v Speaker 9>nuance,</v>

1364
01:18:28.730 --> 01:18:33.650
<v Speaker 9>the true depth of sexual romantic </v>
<v Speaker 9>feeling between men and women.</v>

1365
01:18:33.651 --> 01:18:36.110
<v Speaker 9>It's not a subject don't absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 9>expert on,</v>

1366
01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:38.660
<v Speaker 9>but it comes between men and men as </v>
<v Speaker 9>well.</v>

1367
01:18:38.661 --> 01:18:40.130
<v Speaker 9>Though I know when it's men,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a men,</v>

1368
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:41.203
<v Speaker 9>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well that's different because they're </v>

1369
01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.393
<v Speaker 9>women have had a different experience in</v>
<v Speaker 9>history and I don't want to enter that </v>

1370
01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:47.443
<v Speaker 9>particular field.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But I would say that there is real fear </v>

1371
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:54.410
<v Speaker 9>in my business,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is where this all started.</v>

1372
01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.540
<v Speaker 9>Showbiz does acting and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

1373
01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:57.493
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>people are rather afraid to speak about </v>

1374
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.333
<v Speaker 9>a piece of Vino,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a publicity that's come out or a </v>

1375
01:19:03.801 --> 01:19:05.060
<v Speaker 9>statement that's been made.</v>

1376
01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.230
<v Speaker 9>You just go,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yup,</v>

1377
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:07.223
<v Speaker 9>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And wait for the people to leave the </v>

1378
01:19:08.631 --> 01:19:12.050
<v Speaker 9>room before you can speak honestly with </v>
<v Speaker 9>your friends.</v>

1379
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:13.400
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and that's,</v>

1380
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:16.760
<v Speaker 9>I've never experienced that in my entire</v>
<v Speaker 9>60 years on this planet.</v>

1381
01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:19.640
<v Speaker 9>There's this feeling that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1382
01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:23.210
<v Speaker 9>and I'd not characterizing feminists as </v>
<v Speaker 9>an east German,</v>

1383
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:24.650
<v Speaker 9>but it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The stars,</v>

1384
01:19:24.651 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 9>you're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you better be careful that listening.</v>

1385
01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:29.240
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and that's a genuine feeling.</v>

1386
01:19:29.241 --> 01:19:30.074
<v Speaker 9>I'm saying that my hand on my heart,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not saying it to make a point other </v>

1387
01:19:32.841 --> 01:19:35.600
<v Speaker 9>than the fact that it's true and it's </v>
<v Speaker 9>worrying,</v>

1388
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:40.430
<v Speaker 9>but the sexual misadventures and horror </v>
<v Speaker 9>experiences worrying too.</v>

1389
01:19:40.431 --> 01:19:41.264
<v Speaker 9>So the two words they're not solved.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Let's bring Jordan in on this because </v>

1390
01:19:43.911 --> 01:19:45.620
<v Speaker 9>you've written and commented about a </v>
<v Speaker 9>lot.</v>

1391
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.843
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1392
01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:51.793
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think I'm going to point out two </v>

1393
01:19:53.271 --> 01:19:56.930
<v Speaker 9>things again.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The first is that my question about when</v>

1394
01:19:56.931 --> 01:19:58.520
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when the left goes too far,</v>

1395
01:19:58.521 --> 01:19:59.354
<v Speaker 9>still hasn't been answered.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And then the second thing I'm going to </v>

1396
01:20:01.611 --> 01:20:03.410
<v Speaker 9>point out is that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

1397
01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:07.680
<v Speaker 9>it's conceivable that I am a mean man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1398
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:08.550
<v Speaker 9>I mean</v>

1399
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:11.130
<v Speaker 7>maybe I'm meaner than some people are </v>
<v Speaker 7>not as mean as others.</v>

1400
01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:11.964
<v Speaker 7>I think that's probably more the case.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I would say the fact that race got </v>

1401
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:16.254
<v Speaker 7>dragged into that particular comment is </v>
<v Speaker 7>a better example of what the hell I </v>

1402
01:20:19.561 --> 01:20:20.394
<v Speaker 7>think is wrong with the politically </v>
<v Speaker 7>correct left and anything else that </v>

1403
01:20:22.291 --> 01:20:23.250
<v Speaker 7>could have possibly happened.</v>

1404
01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.730
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>imagine the hurt,</v>

1405
01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:39.300
<v Speaker 8>the anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1406
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:44.250
<v Speaker 8>the insult that you might genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 8>feel,</v>

1407
01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:45.503
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>according to what I felt was an </v>

1408
01:20:47.491 --> 01:20:51.750
<v Speaker 8>appropriate comment of description at </v>
<v Speaker 8>the moment of its expression.</v>

1409
01:20:51.751 --> 01:20:56.751
<v Speaker 8>But imagine now those hurt feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 8>got her w w w okay.</v>

1410
01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:02.253
<v Speaker 8>You feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You feel great about it is really </v>

1411
01:21:03.911 --> 01:21:04.990
<v Speaker 8>different.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not a victim.</v>

1412
01:21:05.050 --> 01:21:06.650
<v Speaker 8>I'm not hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're hurt.</v>

1413
01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:07.900
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You wouldn't be a victim.</v>

1414
01:21:07.901 --> 01:21:08.734
<v Speaker 8>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's interesting is that whatever a </v>

1415
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:15.160
<v Speaker 8>non traditional feelings of empathy you </v>
<v Speaker 8>endure at this particular point,</v>

1416
01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:17.270
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

1417
01:21:17.271 --> 01:21:18.104
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the point is imagine then the horrors </v>

1418
01:21:22.570 --> 01:21:23.403
<v Speaker 8>that so many other others I've had to </v>
<v Speaker 8>put up with for so long when they are </v>

1419
01:21:28.271 --> 01:21:32.860
<v Speaker 8>refused to acknowledge their humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now I take your point seriously.</v>

1420
01:21:32.861 --> 01:21:33.880
<v Speaker 8>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let me,</v>

1421
01:21:33.881 --> 01:21:34.800
<v Speaker 8>let me finish.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let me finish.</v>

1422
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:36.400
<v Speaker 8>Let me just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let me put it to me.</v>

1423
01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:38.740
<v Speaker 8>Let me finish my acquisition there.</v>

1424
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.633
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What I'm saying to you is that when you </v>

1425
01:21:42.191 --> 01:21:45.220
<v Speaker 8>said you were upset that I added the </v>
<v Speaker 8>element of race there,</v>

1426
01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:47.800
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When I said mean Matt White Man.</v>

1427
01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.173
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's interesting is that you may have </v>

1428
01:21:52.301 --> 01:21:53.134
<v Speaker 8>felt that you were being ascribed the </v>
<v Speaker 8>group identity to which you do not </v>

1429
01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:56.613
<v Speaker 8>subscribe.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You may have felt that you were being </v>

1430
01:21:57.851 --> 01:21:58.840
<v Speaker 8>unfairly,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1431
01:21:59.030 --> 01:22:01.090
<v Speaker 8>judged according to your particular </v>
<v Speaker 8>raise.</v>

1432
01:22:01.091 --> 01:22:05.110
<v Speaker 8>You may have felt that your individual </v>
<v Speaker 8>identity was being a smirch by my rather</v>

1433
01:22:05.111 --> 01:22:09.220
<v Speaker 8>careless characterization of you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all of which qualifies for,</v>

1434
01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.660
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a legitimate,</v>

1435
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:11.740
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1436
01:22:11.741 --> 01:22:12.574
<v Speaker 8>response to me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But also the point we've been trying to </v>

1437
01:22:15.311 --> 01:22:19.540
<v Speaker 8>make about the refusal to see our </v>
<v Speaker 8>individual existence as women,</v>

1438
01:22:19.541 --> 01:22:21.760
<v Speaker 8>as people of Color,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as first nation people in the light.</v>

1439
01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.073
<v Speaker 8>My point simply has been the reason I </v>
<v Speaker 8>talked about race and that particular </v>

1440
01:22:26.981 --> 01:22:31.360
<v Speaker 8>characterization because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 8>particular way in which I have come to a</v>

1441
01:22:31.361 --> 01:22:32.194
<v Speaker 8>city.</v>

1442
01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.510
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if there are a lot of black</v>
<v Speaker 8>people out here,</v>

1443
01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:35.893
<v Speaker 8>not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I constantly come to places and </v>

1444
01:22:38.861 --> 01:22:41.740
<v Speaker 8>spaces that are not my natural habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1445
01:22:41.741 --> 01:22:42.574
<v Speaker 8>other than intellectual engagement and </v>
<v Speaker 8>the love and the fury of rhetorical </v>

1446
01:22:46.691 --> 01:22:47.710
<v Speaker 8>engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

1447
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.903
<v Speaker 8>But I often go into hostile spaces where</v>
<v Speaker 8>people will not vote in favor for my </v>

1448
01:22:52.511 --> 01:22:53.344
<v Speaker 8>particular viewpoint because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 8>interested as an individual of breaking </v>

1449
01:22:56.891 --> 01:23:01.120
<v Speaker 8>down barriers so that people can </v>
<v Speaker 8>understand just how complicated it is.</v>

1450
01:23:01.330 --> 01:23:02.163
<v Speaker 8>So what I'm saying to you is that I </v>
<v Speaker 8>would invite you in of the surrender of </v>

1451
01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:08.740
<v Speaker 8>your privilege to give you a specific,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a specific response.</v>

1452
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:09.783
<v Speaker 8>Come with me to a black Baptist church.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Come with me to a historically black </v>

1453
01:23:13.271 --> 01:23:14.880
<v Speaker 8>college,</v>
<v Speaker 8>come to me to an,</v>

1454
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.903
<v Speaker 8>to an indigenous or first nations </v>
<v Speaker 8>community where we're able to engage in </v>

1455
01:23:19.811 --> 01:23:24.811
<v Speaker 8>some of the lovely conversation but also</v>
<v Speaker 8>to listen and hear.</v>

1456
01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.513
<v Speaker 8>And when I added race to that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was talking about the historically </v>

1457
01:23:30.011 --> 01:23:30.844
<v Speaker 8>events,</v>
<v Speaker 8>inability to acknowledge others pains </v>

1458
01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.720
<v Speaker 8>equally to the one that they are </v>
<v Speaker 8>presently enduring.</v>

1459
01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:36.603
<v Speaker 8>So</v>

1460
01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:41.230
<v Speaker 10>the human being,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I stand by my comment,</v>

1461
01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.530
<v Speaker 8>seeing the sorts of things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 8>talking about.</v>

1462
01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:47.680
<v Speaker 8>I happened to be an honorary member of </v>
<v Speaker 8>an indigenous family.</v>

1463
01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:51.140
<v Speaker 8>So don't tell me about what I should go </v>
<v Speaker 8>see with regards to oppression.</v>

1464
01:23:51.210 --> 01:23:52.870
<v Speaker 8>You and you don't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 8>me.</v>

1465
01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:54.670
<v Speaker 8>You have to make words.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I gave you a response,</v>

1466
01:23:56.020 --> 01:24:00.010
<v Speaker 8>you gave me a generic response and </v>
<v Speaker 8>generic race pace or scones,</v>

1467
01:24:00.011 --> 01:24:02.200
<v Speaker 8>Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would like for you to come with me,</v>

1468
01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:04.660
<v Speaker 8>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Eric Dyson to a black Baptist church.</v>

1469
01:24:04.661 --> 01:24:06.920
<v Speaker 8>You've been one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would be happy to do that by.</v>

1470
01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:07.571
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>All right.</v>

1471
01:24:07.571 --> 01:24:08.404
<v Speaker 8>I'm gonna Hook you up.</v>

1472
01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:13.220
<v Speaker 10>It makes sure that</v>
<v Speaker 10>one more quick,</v>

1473
01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:14.133
<v Speaker 5>brandon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to go to closing statements </v>

1474
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:18.130
<v Speaker 5>and for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to get your response to why,</v>

1475
01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.053
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a generation from now looking back on </v>

1476
01:24:20.291 --> 01:24:21.124
<v Speaker 5>this debate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to see this quote </v>

1477
01:24:23.621 --> 01:24:25.840
<v Speaker 5>so-called politically correct movement </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the same way.</v>

1478
01:24:25.841 --> 01:24:26.674
<v Speaker 5>Let's say that we now understand the </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive contributions of the civil </v>

1479
01:24:28.961 --> 01:24:32.170
<v Speaker 5>rights movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That that was a movement that advanced,</v>

1480
01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:35.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a series of,</v>

1481
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:38.860
<v Speaker 5>of ideas about human dignity to people </v>
<v Speaker 5>who previously didn't have that dignity.</v>

1482
01:24:38.890 --> 01:24:43.090
<v Speaker 5>We're now having another debate and </v>
<v Speaker 5>other social data about different groups</v>

1483
01:24:43.091 --> 01:24:44.750
<v Speaker 5>and communities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1484
01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:47.740
<v Speaker 5>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're trying to convey a sense of,</v>

1485
01:24:47.741 --> 01:24:49.420
<v Speaker 5>of new dignity to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why,</v>

1486
01:24:49.421 --> 01:24:53.740
<v Speaker 5>why won't this be in a sense looked back</v>
<v Speaker 5>upon as something positive,</v>

1487
01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:55.090
<v Speaker 5>a generation from now.</v>

1488
01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:57.460
<v Speaker 9>I think people will look back on this </v>
<v Speaker 9>debate and,</v>

1489
01:24:57.550 --> 01:25:00.610
<v Speaker 9>and wonder why political correctness </v>
<v Speaker 9>wasn't discussed.</v>

1490
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:06.070
<v Speaker 10>[inaudible] I said,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if it's slippery,</v>

1491
01:25:11.301 --> 01:25:12.134
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I</v>

1492
01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:16.390
<v Speaker 9>interesting to hear talk about race and </v>
<v Speaker 9>about gender and about to be quality.</v>

1493
01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:21.450
<v Speaker 9>And it's something that I've thought </v>
<v Speaker 9>about a lot and I can learn a great deal</v>

1494
01:25:21.791 --> 01:25:22.624
<v Speaker 9>about,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but that's not why I came to this </v>

1495
01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.510
<v Speaker 9>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was interested in.</v>

1496
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:26.703
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what I've always been interested in the </v>

1497
01:25:27.791 --> 01:25:28.624
<v Speaker 9>suppression of language and thought the </v>
<v Speaker 9>closing down the rationalist idea that </v>

1498
01:25:32.531 --> 01:25:34.480
<v Speaker 9>seems beguiling that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1499
01:25:34.770 --> 01:25:36.400
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>limit people's language,</v>

1500
01:25:36.401 --> 01:25:39.310
<v Speaker 9>it may somehow teach them a different </v>
<v Speaker 9>way of thinking.</v>

1501
01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:40.403
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>something that would have delighted the </v>

1502
01:25:41.411 --> 01:25:44.710
<v Speaker 9>inventors of George Orwell's newspeak </v>
<v Speaker 9>for example.</v>

1503
01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:45.713
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and it seems to me it's just </v>

1504
01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:48.760
<v Speaker 9>implausible.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't,</v>

1505
01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:51.330
<v Speaker 9>it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

1506
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:55.300
<v Speaker 9>and that's what I mean by empirical.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't stand an empirical test,</v>

1507
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:58.330
<v Speaker 9>doesn't experientially validated.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

1508
01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.270
<v Speaker 9>as we see from the political landscape </v>
<v Speaker 9>now,</v>

1509
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:03.950
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I worry that we may in the future.</v>

1510
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.023
<v Speaker 9>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm so disappointed that the subject is </v>

1511
01:26:08.621 --> 01:26:11.750
<v Speaker 9>just revolved around academia,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which was predictable because that's the</v>

1512
01:26:11.751 --> 01:26:14.540
<v Speaker 9>sort of crucible in which these elements</v>
<v Speaker 9>are mixed.</v>

1513
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:17.780
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but even more disappointed that really I</v>

1514
01:26:17.781 --> 01:26:18.614
<v Speaker 9>haven't heard from Michelle or from </v>
<v Speaker 9>Professor Dawson as to what they think </v>

1515
01:26:22.221 --> 01:26:23.054
<v Speaker 9>political correctness is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Because what they've talked about is </v>

1516
01:26:24.531 --> 01:26:26.660
<v Speaker 9>basically second progress in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in our view,</v>

1517
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:27.950
<v Speaker 9>is progress.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

1518
01:26:27.951 --> 01:26:29.270
<v Speaker 9>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's,</v>

1519
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:30.170
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yeah.</v>

1520
01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.930
<v Speaker 9>So it is too good on progress,</v>

1521
01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:35.800
<v Speaker 4>but</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is it</v>

1522
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.500
<v Speaker 9>you saying political,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

1523
01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.510
<v Speaker 9>what we call buddies is the greatness </v>
<v Speaker 9>you called progress.</v>

1524
01:26:40.511 --> 01:26:42.520
<v Speaker 9>That's what you're supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 9>arguing.</v>

1525
01:26:42.521 --> 01:26:45.220
<v Speaker 9>I want to know what you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 9>political correctness.</v>

1526
01:26:45.630 --> 01:26:46.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>

1527
01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:47.213
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1528
01:26:51.650 --> 01:26:53.090
<v Speaker 6>the reason a few months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

1529
01:26:53.091 --> 01:26:54.020
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you contacted me,</v>

1530
01:26:54.021 --> 01:26:57.410
<v Speaker 6>asked if I wanted to do a debate about </v>
<v Speaker 6>identity politics and then you presented</v>

1531
01:26:57.411 --> 01:26:58.910
<v Speaker 6>me with this resolution and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I said,</v>

1532
01:26:58.911 --> 01:27:00.350
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of things that people call</v>

1533
01:27:00.351 --> 01:27:02.720
<v Speaker 6>political correctness that I'm not going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to defend.</v>

1534
01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:07.040
<v Speaker 6>But then I realized who I was debating </v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1535
01:27:07.930 --> 01:27:08.763
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and saw that there was a lot of things </v>

1536
01:27:09.921 --> 01:27:10.754
<v Speaker 6>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jordan Peterson called political </v>

1537
01:27:12.321 --> 01:27:14.300
<v Speaker 6>correctness that I call progress.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1538
01:27:14.301 --> 01:27:17.180
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and to some extent you to Stephen Fry.</v>

1539
01:27:17.181 --> 01:27:18.014
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you talk about it being outrageous </v>

1540
01:27:19.821 --> 01:27:21.320
<v Speaker 6>to tear it out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're not outrageous.</v>

1541
01:27:21.321 --> 01:27:22.154
<v Speaker 6>I won't put words in your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that we shouldn't be tearing down </v>

1542
01:27:23.901 --> 01:27:24.734
<v Speaker 6>statues of kind of notorious racist that</v>
<v Speaker 6>we should just instead be throwing exit </v>

1543
01:27:28.670 --> 01:27:29.790
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1544
01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:33.140
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so those sorts of things,</v>

1545
01:27:33.141 --> 01:27:36.200
<v Speaker 6>if you call them political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like call them progress.</v>

1546
01:27:36.201 --> 01:27:40.010
<v Speaker 6>Now this feeling of being silenced,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I understand,</v>

1547
01:27:40.011 --> 01:27:41.630
<v Speaker 6>although it seems very vague,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1548
01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:45.140
<v Speaker 6>You kind of are not quite putting your </v>
<v Speaker 6>finger on who is silencing you,</v>

1549
01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:49.190
<v Speaker 6>except for a vague fear that if you say </v>
<v Speaker 6>something on toward,</v>

1550
01:27:49.191 --> 01:27:53.640
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be the subject of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure shaming the pipe.</v>

1551
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:55.161
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but by,</v>

1552
01:27:55.161 --> 01:27:56.300
<v Speaker 6>by what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>By the Internet.</v>

1553
01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.040
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean</v>

1554
01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:06.220
<v Speaker 4>there's that element of it</v>

1555
01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:08.950
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I'm seeing is that it's,</v>

1556
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.903
<v Speaker 6>it's a feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a feeling that is this sort of </v>

1557
01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:17.080
<v Speaker 6>intangible result of on right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Narrowly Goldstein,</v>

1558
01:28:17.150 --> 01:28:20.760
<v Speaker 9>the sort of show trial thing where the </v>
<v Speaker 9>person then apologizes.</v>

1559
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:23.250
<v Speaker 9>I have so much to learn about sexual </v>
<v Speaker 9>politics.</v>

1560
01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:26.750
<v Speaker 9>I am really sorry that signed a lawyer </v>
<v Speaker 9>crossed out the name of the,</v>

1561
01:28:26.751 --> 01:28:26.870
<v Speaker 9>yeah.</v>

1562
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:30.240
<v Speaker 4>Personally it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think</v>

1563
01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.320
<v Speaker 9>the real mistake of our left is that we </v>
<v Speaker 9>underestimate the right,</v>

1564
01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:36.893
<v Speaker 9>the right isn't as stupid as we'd like </v>
<v Speaker 9>them to be if only they were only there </v>

1565
01:28:40.801 --> 01:28:41.634
<v Speaker 9>once.</v>
<v Speaker 9>A cunning,</v>

1566
01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:43.320
<v Speaker 9>so sly,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so smart,</v>

1567
01:28:43.321 --> 01:28:44.154
<v Speaker 9>so aware of our shortcomings and I just </v>
<v Speaker 9>fear that political correctness is a </v>

1568
01:28:50.401 --> 01:28:53.190
<v Speaker 9>weapon that they value.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The more,</v>

1569
01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:57.360
<v Speaker 9>the more we tell the world how people </v>
<v Speaker 9>should be treated,</v>

1570
01:28:57.361 --> 01:29:00.030
<v Speaker 9>how language should be treated,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what words are acceptable,</v>

1571
01:29:00.031 --> 01:29:00.864
<v Speaker 9>what attitudes are,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what hr meeting is going to tell you in </v>

1572
01:29:03.721 --> 01:29:07.170
<v Speaker 9>a long bullet pointed list about how you</v>
<v Speaker 9>look at people.</v>

1573
01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.273
<v Speaker 9>All of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is me to drink too bad people jump </v>

1574
01:29:11.701 --> 01:29:12.534
<v Speaker 9>malefactors.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The bad actors are not counting myself </v>

1575
01:29:15.211 --> 01:29:15.690
<v Speaker 9>as well.</v>

1576
01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:18.920
<v Speaker 4>Bad actors in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean bad actors in the other centers.</v>

1577
01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.600
<v Speaker 6>So there are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

1578
01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:33.030
<v Speaker 6>there were a lot of ways in which I </v>
<v Speaker 6>agree with you,</v>

1579
01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:34.380
<v Speaker 6>although I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1580
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:36.630
<v Speaker 6>I would like to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I need to turn it back on you.</v>

1581
01:29:36.631 --> 01:29:40.020
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to hear you say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1582
01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:40.883
<v Speaker 6>what are the words that have fallen into</v>
<v Speaker 6>disrepute that we think that you think </v>

1583
01:29:43.501 --> 01:29:44.820
<v Speaker 6>we should be resurrecting?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1584
01:29:44.821 --> 01:29:45.654
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to me this is this area of like hotly </v>

1585
01:29:48.511 --> 01:29:51.760
<v Speaker 6>contested social change right now where </v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people feel</v>

1586
01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:55.160
<v Speaker 9>wounds that have gone into disuse.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's very often freezes,</v>

1587
01:29:55.161 --> 01:29:56.730
<v Speaker 9>jargonistic,</v>
<v Speaker 9>slew goodness,</v>

1588
01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:59.280
<v Speaker 9>heteronormative,</v>
<v Speaker 9>CIS gendered,</v>

1589
01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:00.453
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>those kinds of things that they're just </v>

1590
01:30:01.551 --> 01:30:02.690
<v Speaker 9>an insult.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

1591
01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:03.673
<v Speaker 9>imagine you're a young student arriving </v>
<v Speaker 9>university and someone's bombarding it </v>

1592
01:30:05.871 --> 01:30:09.290
<v Speaker 9>with this preposterous hermeneutical </v>
<v Speaker 9>nonsense from,</v>

1593
01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:10.310
<v Speaker 9>from,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1594
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:13.890
<v Speaker 9>from misread textbooks.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So misread food cove and they say,</v>

1595
01:30:14.650 --> 01:30:16.790
<v Speaker 9>daddy died and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Because,</v>

1596
01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:20.000
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was at Cambridge in them doing it.</v>

1597
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:23.020
<v Speaker 9>We had a French phase and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and does</v>

1598
01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:24.043
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] with that.</v>

1599
01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:26.930
<v Speaker 9>It's an interesting game.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And it is,</v>

1600
01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:28.900
<v Speaker 9>it's a place to,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1601
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:33.630
<v Speaker 9>I think I would just really say that the</v>
<v Speaker 9>ghost hovering over me is,</v>

1602
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:36.090
<v Speaker 9>it's a lesser Oscar Wilde Rosen.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

1603
01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:36.943
<v Speaker 9>he,</v>
<v Speaker 9>he said to buzzies love you said the </v>

1604
01:30:38.041 --> 01:30:40.350
<v Speaker 9>fact that you didn't get the degree is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is nothing,</v>

1605
01:30:40.351 --> 01:30:44.100
<v Speaker 9>but you never acquired what is sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 9>called the Oxford Manor.</v>

1606
01:30:44.101 --> 01:30:46.320
<v Speaker 9>And I'll say for that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the university manner.</v>

1607
01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:47.880
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you said,</v>

1608
01:30:48.630 --> 01:30:49.463
<v Speaker 9>Oscar said,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I take that to mean the ability to play </v>

1609
01:30:51.841 --> 01:30:52.674
<v Speaker 9>gracefully with ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that's disappearing from our </v>

1610
01:30:55.681 --> 01:30:56.710
<v Speaker 9>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I think it's</v>

1611
01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:02.160
<v Speaker 4>Gerald [inaudible].</v>

1612
01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:10.100
<v Speaker 8>It's hard to beat a self deprecating </v>
<v Speaker 8>Englishman is,</v>

1613
01:31:11.650 --> 01:31:15.390
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1614
01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:17.880
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a pretty good idea here today.</v>

1615
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.160
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1616
01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:22.240
<v Speaker 8>But what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't recall in all of you,</v>

1617
01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:23.133
<v Speaker 8>all of us have studied history.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't recall these debates about </v>

1618
01:31:26.321 --> 01:31:27.154
<v Speaker 8>political correctness happening when </v>
<v Speaker 8>people who were in power in absolute </v>

1619
01:31:30.731 --> 01:31:32.530
<v Speaker 8>power,</v>
<v Speaker 8>unquestioned power,</v>

1620
01:31:33.010 --> 01:31:38.010
<v Speaker 8>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 8>political correctness becomes an issue.</v>

1621
01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:42.250
<v Speaker 8>And what I mean by that is people who </v>
<v Speaker 8>used to have power,</v>

1622
01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:43.563
<v Speaker 8>who,</v>
<v Speaker 8>who still have power but think they </v>

1623
01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:45.874
<v Speaker 8>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>who get challenged on just a little bit </v>

1624
01:31:47.891 --> 01:31:51.070
<v Speaker 8>of what they have and don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 8>share toys in the sand lot of life.</v>

1625
01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:55.270
<v Speaker 8>So all of a sudden it becomes a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>exaggerated grievance.</v>

1626
01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:59.260
<v Speaker 8>Now the things you named the bullet </v>
<v Speaker 8>points and the CIS gender,</v>

1627
01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:04.030
<v Speaker 8>the Hetero normativity and the Hetero </v>
<v Speaker 8>Patriarchy and the capitalist resurgence</v>

1628
01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:07.810
<v Speaker 8>and the insurrection of subjugated </v>
<v Speaker 8>knowledge as to give Fuko some more love</v>

1629
01:32:07.811 --> 01:32:10.660
<v Speaker 8>or the Derridean deconstruction,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all that stuff.</v>

1630
01:32:11.290 --> 01:32:14.650
<v Speaker 8>The French phase is still going on with </v>
<v Speaker 8>the French fries in America.</v>

1631
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:20.070
<v Speaker 8>What's interesting is that I didn't hear</v>
<v Speaker 8>many complaints of political correctness</v>

1632
01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:26.320
<v Speaker 8>at the height of the dominance of one </v>
<v Speaker 8>group or another,</v>

1633
01:32:26.321 --> 01:32:27.154
<v Speaker 8>but when Martin Luther King Jr who </v>
<v Speaker 8>argued for group identity as a black </v>

1634
01:32:32.711 --> 01:32:33.544
<v Speaker 8>person to provide an opportunity for </v>
<v Speaker 8>individual black people to come to the </v>

1635
01:32:37.901 --> 01:32:40.330
<v Speaker 8>fore,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they began to make that claim.</v>

1636
01:32:40.810 --> 01:32:41.643
<v Speaker 8>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they didn't call it political </v>

1637
01:32:42.341 --> 01:32:43.510
<v Speaker 8>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1638
01:32:43.570 --> 01:32:46.660
<v Speaker 8>you're siding with those who are against</v>
<v Speaker 8>free speech.</v>

1639
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:51.490
<v Speaker 8>You're siding with those who don't want </v>
<v Speaker 8>me as a white person to be recognized in</v>

1640
01:32:51.491 --> 01:32:52.324
<v Speaker 8>my humanity and what I mean by political</v>
<v Speaker 8>correctness is the kind of politics of </v>

1641
01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:57.053
<v Speaker 8>resentment that are articulated by </v>
<v Speaker 8>various holders of power at certain </v>

1642
01:33:01.211 --> 01:33:02.800
<v Speaker 8>levels,</v>
<v Speaker 8>at various levels.</v>

1643
01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:04.083
<v Speaker 8>That one of the beautiful things about </v>
<v Speaker 8>Fulco that I take as opposed to Max </v>

1644
01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:10.780
<v Speaker 8>Faber is that for Co said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>power breaks out everywhere.</v>

1645
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:11.703
<v Speaker 8>I would think a person who's critical </v>
<v Speaker 8>political correctness like you would </v>

1646
01:33:13.871 --> 01:33:14.704
<v Speaker 8>appreciate this as opposed to Max Vapor </v>
<v Speaker 8>who said power is over there in a </v>

1647
01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:20.620
<v Speaker 8>hierarchical structure where </v>
<v Speaker 8>subordination is the demand.</v>

1648
01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:21.573
<v Speaker 8>Full coast had no power brakes out,</v>
<v Speaker 8>even among people who are in </v>

1649
01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:27.160
<v Speaker 8>disempowered so you can hurt somebody in</v>
<v Speaker 8>your own community.</v>

1650
01:33:27.370 --> 01:33:28.203
<v Speaker 8>What's more politically incorrect than a</v>
<v Speaker 8>black baptist preacher identifying with </v>

1651
01:33:31.641 --> 01:33:34.990
<v Speaker 8>the first century Palestinian Jew and </v>
<v Speaker 8>this still loving atheists?</v>

1652
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:35.943
<v Speaker 8>What's more politically incorrect and a </v>
<v Speaker 8>black intellectual going on Bill Maher </v>

1653
01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:44.310
<v Speaker 8>and defending his ability to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 8>have this show despite using the n word.</v>

1654
01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:49.330
<v Speaker 8>I serve believe in a politically </v>
<v Speaker 8>incorrect version.</v>

1655
01:33:49.331 --> 01:33:50.164
<v Speaker 8>When I go as a black man to his preacher</v>
<v Speaker 8>to chastise my fellow believers about </v>

1656
01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:56.680
<v Speaker 8>their homophobia that goes over like a </v>
<v Speaker 8>brick cloud.</v>

1657
01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.753
<v Speaker 8>When I come into arenas like this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I understand that my back is up against </v>

1658
01:34:01.271 --> 01:34:02.140
<v Speaker 8>the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I think</v>

1659
01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:07.450
<v Speaker 10>sit over here,</v>
<v Speaker 10>let's say I want to sit on your lap.</v>

1660
01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:12.860
<v Speaker 10>But what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't get excited.</v>

1661
01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:18.040
<v Speaker 10>But what I'm saying is that he goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 10>[inaudible] been looking at me.</v>

1662
01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:25.520
<v Speaker 10>So what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 10>This</v>

1663
01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:30.520
<v Speaker 8>thing is that when we look at the way in</v>
<v Speaker 8>which we have societies in a free,</v>

1664
01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:32.533
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Canadian society and the Free American </v>

1665
01:34:33.681 --> 01:34:36.350
<v Speaker 8>society,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when I look at what is seen as political</v>

1666
01:34:36.351 --> 01:34:37.184
<v Speaker 8>correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it to me has been a mass of jumble that </v>

1667
01:34:40.851 --> 01:34:41.684
<v Speaker 8>has been carved together out of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>politics of resentment that powers once </v>

1668
01:34:45.321 --> 01:34:47.000
<v Speaker 8>held,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no longer are held.</v>

1669
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:51.050
<v Speaker 8>Freedom's once exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 8>absolutely must now be shared.</v>

1670
01:34:51.170 --> 01:34:52.003
<v Speaker 8>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I am an agreements with both of my </v>

1671
01:34:54.010 --> 01:34:54.843
<v Speaker 8>gentlemen to my right who believe Vat,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a political correctness has been a </v>

1672
01:34:59.061 --> 01:35:01.340
<v Speaker 8>scourge,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but not necessarily the way you think.</v>

1673
01:35:01.341 --> 01:35:02.174
<v Speaker 8>So I think it's been a scourge because </v>
<v Speaker 8>those who have been the deployers of </v>

1674
01:35:04.791 --> 01:35:05.624
<v Speaker 8>power and the beneficiaries of privilege</v>
<v Speaker 8>have failed to recognize their </v>

1675
01:35:09.411 --> 01:35:11.630
<v Speaker 8>particular weight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And at the end of the day,</v>

1676
01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:12.673
<v Speaker 8>I think that those of us who are free </v>
<v Speaker 8>citizens of this country and of America </v>

1677
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:21.320
<v Speaker 8>should figure out ways to respect the </v>
<v Speaker 8>humanity of the other,</v>

1678
01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:24.110
<v Speaker 8>to respect the individual existence of </v>
<v Speaker 8>the other,</v>

1679
01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:25.033
<v Speaker 8>but also respect the fact that there </v>
<v Speaker 8>have been barriers placed upon </v>

1680
01:35:27.651 --> 01:35:30.590
<v Speaker 8>particular groups that have prevented </v>
<v Speaker 8>them from flourishing.</v>

1681
01:35:30.650 --> 01:35:32.450
<v Speaker 8>That's all I mean by political.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Correct.</v>

1682
01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:34.623
<v Speaker 8>Well said.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got to give before we get to closing </v>

1683
01:35:36.771 --> 01:35:39.710
<v Speaker 8>statements and final words on this topic</v>
<v Speaker 8>to Michelle and then,</v>

1684
01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:40.161
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>

1685
01:35:40.161 --> 01:35:40.870
<v Speaker 8>Jordan.</v>

1686
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:41.703
<v Speaker 6>So I think part of the frustration here </v>
<v Speaker 6>is that I think that both of you have </v>

1687
01:35:44.890 --> 01:35:45.723
<v Speaker 6>radically different ideas of what we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking about when we talk about </v>

1688
01:35:47.621 --> 01:35:50.530
<v Speaker 6>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems to me that you're talking about</v>

1689
01:35:50.531 --> 01:35:53.830
<v Speaker 6>politically correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You mean this kind of feeling of anxiety</v>

1690
01:35:53.831 --> 01:35:54.664
<v Speaker 6>that a lot of people feel because we all</v>
<v Speaker 6>live now in this terrible crowdsource </v>

1691
01:35:58.271 --> 01:36:03.271
<v Speaker 6>panopticon when you worry that any stray</v>
<v Speaker 6>freeze that you use will be any straight</v>

1692
01:36:03.301 --> 01:36:05.440
<v Speaker 6>phrase you utter might be used to defame</v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

1693
01:36:05.650 --> 01:36:06.483
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that a lot of people feel </v>

1694
01:36:07.841 --> 01:36:09.070
<v Speaker 6>that anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1695
01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:09.963
<v Speaker 6>I disagree that that is something that </v>
<v Speaker 6>is being solely kind of perpetrated </v>

1696
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:15.160
<v Speaker 6>against,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1697
01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:20.710
<v Speaker 6>institution to kind of Oscar Wilde and </v>
<v Speaker 6>figures by a since story and you know,</v>

1698
01:36:20.711 --> 01:36:24.700
<v Speaker 6>since stories left wing chord because </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's coming from all directions,</v>

1699
01:36:24.701 --> 01:36:25.534
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This phenomenon which sucks is all over </v>

1700
01:36:28.631 --> 01:36:29.110
<v Speaker 6>the place.</v>

1701
01:36:29.110 --> 01:36:32.410
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get it when I write something critical</v>

1702
01:36:32.411 --> 01:36:37.411
<v Speaker 6>of the way that the IDF behaved in Gaza,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1703
01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:41.440
<v Speaker 6>it's coming at everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that there is,</v>

1704
01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:43.353
<v Speaker 6>there's a way in which when it comes at </v>
<v Speaker 6>a certain sort of figure and there's a </v>

1705
01:36:47.381 --> 01:36:52.381
<v Speaker 6>certain set of complaints and you feel </v>
<v Speaker 6>unjustly criticized and feel silenced,</v>

1706
01:36:54.191 --> 01:36:56.980
<v Speaker 6>which again I think is really different </v>
<v Speaker 6>than being silenced.</v>

1707
01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:58.233
<v Speaker 6>You call it political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I would like the culture also to be </v>

1708
01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:03.550
<v Speaker 6>more,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1709
01:37:03.570 --> 01:37:06.100
<v Speaker 6>free freewheeling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think one solution,</v>

1710
01:37:06.101 --> 01:37:08.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to kind of get the left</v>

1711
01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:09.820
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1712
01:37:10.930 --> 01:37:11.763
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can't kind of put an end to this </v>

1713
01:37:12.851 --> 01:37:17.620
<v Speaker 6>because it is much more of a mob social </v>
<v Speaker 6>media phenomenon then it is kind of some</v>

1714
01:37:17.621 --> 01:37:18.454
<v Speaker 6>diktat coming up from on high.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so one really the only way to break </v>

1715
01:37:22.181 --> 01:37:26.800
<v Speaker 6>through it is to say what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you say that you're afraid to say.</v>

1716
01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:27.663
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean that's the only way to sort of </v>

1717
01:37:29.170 --> 01:37:34.170
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pop this bubble or kind of end this end,</v>

1718
01:37:34.871 --> 01:37:37.450
<v Speaker 6>this anxiety or at least diffuse it a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit.</v>

1719
01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.313
<v Speaker 6>Whereas again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I hear Mr. Peterson talking about </v>

1720
01:37:41.921 --> 01:37:46.921
<v Speaker 6>as political correctness is something </v>
<v Speaker 6>much more broad and much more,</v>

1721
01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:50.620
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of funded,</v>

1722
01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:53.890
<v Speaker 6>much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>much more fundamental to social change.</v>

1723
01:37:53.891 --> 01:37:55.500
<v Speaker 6>And you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1724
01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:56.280
<v Speaker 6>you want</v>

1725
01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:00.450
<v Speaker 7>me to define or one of us to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 7>when the left goes too far and if I'm,</v>

1726
01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:01.313
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I certainly don't want to be a woman </v>

1727
01:38:01.951 --> 01:38:03.720
<v Speaker 7>putting words in your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if,</v>

1728
01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:06.210
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I hear you correctly,</v>

1729
01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:07.463
<v Speaker 7>what you're saying is that you want me </v>
<v Speaker 7>to kind of renounce Marxist categories </v>

1730
01:38:11.610 --> 01:38:13.920
<v Speaker 7>or to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1731
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:17.010
<v Speaker 7>I want you to define with the left goes </v>
<v Speaker 7>too far.</v>

1732
01:38:17.011 --> 01:38:18.630
<v Speaker 7>You can do it any way you want.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1733
01:38:18.690 --> 01:38:19.523
<v Speaker 7>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that the left goes too far into </v>

1734
01:38:21.721 --> 01:38:26.721
<v Speaker 7>when it is violent or censorious when it</v>
<v Speaker 7>tries to shut people down or no platform</v>

1735
01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.020
<v Speaker 7>then or when it acts violently,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1736
01:38:31.290 --> 01:38:34.860
<v Speaker 7>I'm not sure what you expect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So beyond that,</v>

1737
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:35.903
<v Speaker 7>something deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how hard like you to contend with the </v>

1738
01:38:39.090 --> 01:38:39.923
<v Speaker 7>set of left wing ideas that produced all</v>
<v Speaker 7>the left wing pathologies of the 20th </v>

1739
01:38:44.281 --> 01:38:48.420
<v Speaker 7>century and to define how you think </v>
<v Speaker 7>standard left wing thinking,</v>

1740
01:38:48.421 --> 01:38:53.421
<v Speaker 7>which has as bell goes too far since it </v>
<v Speaker 7>obviously does on too far.</v>

1741
01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:59.220
<v Speaker 7>Of course the right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well how about Auschwitz?</v>

1742
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:06.490
<v Speaker 7>While I was talking about 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 7>Poland more recently,</v>

1743
01:39:06.541 --> 01:39:10.100
<v Speaker 7>what has gone wrong with the right</v>
<v Speaker 7>shots?</v>

1744
01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:13.980
<v Speaker 7>I don't like identity politics players </v>
<v Speaker 7>at all.</v>

1745
01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:15.810
<v Speaker 7>I don't care whether they're on the left</v>
<v Speaker 7>of the right.</v>

1746
01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:18.930
<v Speaker 7>I'd be lecturing about right wing </v>
<v Speaker 7>extremism for 30 years.</v>

1747
01:39:19.050 --> 01:39:19.883
<v Speaker 7>I'm no fan of the right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>despite the fact that the left would </v>

1748
01:39:21.901 --> 01:39:25.740
<v Speaker 7>like to paint me that way because it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>more convenient for it to far reasonably</v>

1749
01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.720
<v Speaker 7>well where it's threatening to go to far</v>
<v Speaker 7>identitarian Europe,</v>

1750
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:34.080
<v Speaker 7>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's gone too far in Charlottesville.</v>

1751
01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:35.003
<v Speaker 7>It went too far in Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like how long the list do you want and </v>

1752
01:39:37.231 --> 01:39:41.060
<v Speaker 7>why am I required to produce that to </v>
<v Speaker 7>show you that I don't like I to Terry,</v>

1753
01:39:45.250 --> 01:39:47.860
<v Speaker 10>so your assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 10>your assumption is something</v>

1754
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:50.720
<v Speaker 7>how that I must be on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

1755
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:51.583
<v Speaker 7>It's like look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the right has occupied the humanities </v>

1756
01:39:54.891 --> 01:39:57.650
<v Speaker 7>and the social sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's as simple as that.</v>

1757
01:39:57.651 --> 01:39:59.390
<v Speaker 7>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if they had,</v>

1758
01:39:59.391 --> 01:40:01.460
<v Speaker 7>I'd be objecting to them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Say that again.</v>

1759
01:40:01.461 --> 01:40:02.294
<v Speaker 7>That I didn't have the right has not </v>
<v Speaker 7>occupied the social sciences and the </v>

1760
01:40:06.771 --> 01:40:09.440
<v Speaker 7>humanities.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the left clearly has the statistical</v>

1761
01:40:09.441 --> 01:40:11.270
<v Speaker 7>evidence for that is overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sir.</v>

1762
01:40:11.271 --> 01:40:14.600
<v Speaker 7>What about Iq testing in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 7>genetic inheritance?</v>

1763
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:18.950
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] here to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 7>political,</v>

1764
01:40:18.951 --> 01:40:19.220
<v Speaker 7>correct?</v>

1765
01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:20.270
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And we've done a damn,</v>

1766
01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:22.840
<v Speaker 9>I gave you an example,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Carolyn,</v>

1767
01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.060
<v Speaker 9>redeem ourselves with our closing </v>
<v Speaker 9>statements.</v>

1768
01:40:26.061 --> 01:40:27.770
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to put three minutes on the </v>
<v Speaker 9>clock,</v>

1769
01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:29.720
<v Speaker 9>ready to go in the reverse order of the </v>
<v Speaker 9>opening.</v>

1770
01:40:29.721 --> 01:40:32.690
<v Speaker 9>So Steven Europe First,</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh Lordy,</v>

1771
01:40:32.690 --> 01:40:36.800
<v Speaker 9>Lordy</v>
<v Speaker 9>hide behind the lectured in that case.</v>

1772
01:40:37.190 --> 01:40:38.023
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've been fascinated by this </v>

1773
01:40:38.991 --> 01:40:39.824
<v Speaker 9>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's been an enormous clash of </v>

1774
01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:43.250
<v Speaker 9>cultures in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in the conversation we've had,</v>

1775
01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.240
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>classic,</v>

1776
01:40:44.241 --> 01:40:47.660
<v Speaker 9>if I can call it huckstering snake coil </v>
<v Speaker 9>pulpit talk.</v>

1777
01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 10>It's up.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's a motive</v>

1778
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:54.843
<v Speaker 9>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's a rhetorical style that I'd find </v>

1779
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:58.880
<v Speaker 9>industry refreshing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Vivifying um,</v>

1780
01:40:59.050 --> 01:40:59.883
<v Speaker 9>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not sure that we actually focused </v>

1781
01:41:01.151 --> 01:41:01.960
<v Speaker 9>on,</v>
<v Speaker 9>on,</v>

1782
01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.610
<v Speaker 9>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the point in question then.</v>

1783
01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.740
<v Speaker 9>My objection has always been towards </v>
<v Speaker 9>orthodoxies.</v>

1784
01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.190
<v Speaker 9>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm a heterodox and,</v>

1785
01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:09.790
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>an a contrarian,</v>

1786
01:41:09.791 --> 01:41:10.624
<v Speaker 9>then I can't help myself.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I think there's been an </v>

1787
01:41:11.921 --> 01:41:16.921
<v Speaker 9>underestimation of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 9>language does affect people.</v>

1788
01:41:17.141 --> 01:41:17.974
<v Speaker 9>It does make the young in particular is </v>
<v Speaker 9>they're starting out on their </v>

1789
01:41:20.861 --> 01:41:23.770
<v Speaker 9>educational or their work careers.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It makes them,</v>

1790
01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:25.960
<v Speaker 9>it makes them very anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It makes them very angry,</v>

1791
01:41:25.961 --> 01:41:27.790
<v Speaker 9>very upset,</v>
<v Speaker 9>very alienated,</v>

1792
01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:32.440
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>to feel that they don't know anymore how</v>

1793
01:41:32.441 --> 01:41:36.220
<v Speaker 9>to operate in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how to engage in relationships,</v>

1794
01:41:36.221 --> 01:41:38.230
<v Speaker 9>how to think honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So they,</v>

1795
01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:41.680
<v Speaker 9>they accrete more and more to their own </v>
<v Speaker 9>mini groups.</v>

1796
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:42.860
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>

1797
01:41:42.861 --> 01:41:45.550
<v Speaker 9>and I think that's dangerous and unhappy</v>
<v Speaker 9>for society.</v>

1798
01:41:45.551 --> 01:41:46.384
<v Speaker 9>I think it's reflected in,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in the paucity of cinema and literature </v>

1799
01:41:50.891 --> 01:41:55.360
<v Speaker 9>and arts and the culture generally is </v>
<v Speaker 9>that there's a fear that's pervading it.</v>

1800
01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:59.440
<v Speaker 9>And while people can talk to academia,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and so you should come see our lessons.</v>

1801
01:41:59.441 --> 01:42:02.410
<v Speaker 9>Our lectures are open and free and ideas</v>
<v Speaker 9>are exchanged.</v>

1802
01:42:02.411 --> 01:42:04.630
<v Speaker 9>I'm sure that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm sure it's true.</v>

1803
01:42:04.631 --> 01:42:05.464
<v Speaker 9>But I don't think we should </v>
<v Speaker 9>underestimate how much this feeling is </v>

1804
01:42:11.441 --> 01:42:12.274
<v Speaker 9>prevalent in the culture of</v>
<v Speaker 9>this strange paradox that the liberals </v>

1805
01:42:18.251 --> 01:42:21.700
<v Speaker 9>are in liberal in the demand for </v>
<v Speaker 9>liberality.</v>

1806
01:42:22.090 --> 01:42:25.390
<v Speaker 9>They are exclusive in their demand for </v>
<v Speaker 9>inclusivity.</v>

1807
01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:26.643
<v Speaker 9>They are</v>
<v Speaker 9>homogenous in their demand for </v>

1808
01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:34.951
<v Speaker 9>heterogeneity.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They are somehow and diverse in the call</v>

1809
01:42:35.981 --> 01:42:36.814
<v Speaker 9>for diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You can be diverse but not diverse in </v>

1810
01:42:39.671 --> 01:42:43.390
<v Speaker 9>your opinions and in your language and </v>
<v Speaker 9>then your behavior and that's it.</v>

1811
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:44.263
<v Speaker 4>Terrible pitching.</v>

1812
01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:49.980
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I would,</v>

1813
01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:52.780
<v Speaker 9>I would say that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm sorry that it got a bit heated,</v>

1814
01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:53.770
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in,</v>

1815
01:42:53.771 --> 01:42:56.090
<v Speaker 9>in places because I was hoping it </v>
<v Speaker 9>wouldn't die.</v>

1816
01:42:56.091 --> 01:42:56.924
<v Speaker 9>I was hoping would be a shining example </v>
<v Speaker 9>of people of all different kinds of </v>

1817
01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:02.450
<v Speaker 9>political outlooks can,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

1818
01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:06.430
<v Speaker 9>speak with humor and wit and a lightness</v>
<v Speaker 9>of touch.</v>

1819
01:43:06.431 --> 01:43:07.264
<v Speaker 9>As gk Chesterton said,</v>
<v Speaker 9>angels can fly because they take </v>

1820
01:43:09.971 --> 01:43:10.804
<v Speaker 9>themselves lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I think it's very important for us </v>

1821
01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:16.240
<v Speaker 9>who are privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 9>All four of us previous to be here,</v>

1822
01:43:16.241 --> 01:43:17.074
<v Speaker 9>to be asked to be here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>to take ourselves a little bit more </v>

1823
01:43:18.701 --> 01:43:19.534
<v Speaker 9>likely not to be too earnest,</v>
<v Speaker 9>too pompous to serious a and not to be </v>

1824
01:43:23.681 --> 01:43:25.660
<v Speaker 9>too certain.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

1825
01:43:25.890 --> 01:43:26.723
<v Speaker 9>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's a,</v>

1826
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:29.800
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a time I think for really engaging,</v>

1827
01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:34.210
<v Speaker 9>emotionally fulfilling,</v>
<v Speaker 9>passionate and positive doubt.</v>

1828
01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:35.373
<v Speaker 9>That's what I would</v>

1829
01:43:36.230 --> 01:43:41.230
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] we're going to put minutes </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the clock for</v>

1830
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:52.950
<v Speaker 8>you please.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1831
01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:53.803
<v Speaker 8>your closing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you so much for that compliment </v>

1832
01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:56.673
<v Speaker 8>fry.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm used to not exclusively white men </v>

1833
01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:01.933
<v Speaker 8>who see black intelligence articulated </v>
<v Speaker 8>at a certain level of feeling a kind of </v>

1834
01:44:05.091 --> 01:44:07.770
<v Speaker 8>condescension.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If I came up here at Miss,</v>

1835
01:44:07.771 --> 01:44:10.250
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was saying the other day,</v>

1836
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:11.743
<v Speaker 8>but but a kind of verbal facility </v>
<v Speaker 8>automatically assumed to be a kind of </v>

1837
01:44:15.291 --> 01:44:17.750
<v Speaker 8>hucksterism and snake oil salesmen.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've seen that.</v>

1838
01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:18.584
<v Speaker 8>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I get hate letters every day from white </v>

1839
01:44:20.571 --> 01:44:22.670
<v Speaker 8>brothers and sisters who were mad.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm teaching their children.</v>

1840
01:44:22.671 --> 01:44:24.950
<v Speaker 8>You're just trying to coopt our </v>
<v Speaker 8>children.</v>

1841
01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:27.140
<v Speaker 8>You're trying to corrupt them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>

1842
01:44:27.141 --> 01:44:27.974
<v Speaker 8>I'm trying to corrupt them so they will </v>
<v Speaker 8>be uncorrupted by the corruptibility </v>

1843
01:44:31.131 --> 01:44:31.964
<v Speaker 8>that they've inherited from a society </v>
<v Speaker 8>that refuses to see all people as human </v>

1844
01:44:36.291 --> 01:44:37.124
<v Speaker 8>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The death threats I've received </v>

1845
01:44:39.141 --> 01:44:41.600
<v Speaker 8>constantly for simply trying to speak my</v>
<v Speaker 8>mind.</v>

1846
01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:42.613
<v Speaker 8>It's not about a politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 8>society that is open minded and bet has </v>

1847
01:44:47.301 --> 01:44:49.760
<v Speaker 8>some consternation about my ability to </v>
<v Speaker 8>speak.</v>

1848
01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:50.893
<v Speaker 8>I'm getting real live.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You want empirical death threats that </v>

1849
01:44:53.841 --> 01:44:58.280
<v Speaker 8>talk about killing me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>setting up to hurt me and harm me simply</v>

1850
01:44:58.281 --> 01:44:59.114
<v Speaker 8>because I choose to speak my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I agree with my [inaudible] and my </v>

1851
01:45:02.211 --> 01:45:03.044
<v Speaker 8>compatriots that we should argue against</v>
<v Speaker 8>the vicious limitation and recursions </v>

1852
01:45:06.471 --> 01:45:07.304
<v Speaker 8>against speech.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I believe that everybody has the right </v>

1853
01:45:09.561 --> 01:45:10.394
<v Speaker 8>to be able to articulate themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 8>the enormous privilege we have to come </v>

1854
01:45:13.371 --> 01:45:14.204
<v Speaker 8>to a spot in the space like this means </v>
<v Speaker 8>that we have that privilege and we </v>

1855
01:45:17.361 --> 01:45:18.194
<v Speaker 8>should be responsible for it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No matter where we go from here and me </v>

1856
01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:23.090
<v Speaker 8>and brother Peterson would go to a black</v>
<v Speaker 8>Baptist church.</v>

1857
01:45:24.170 --> 01:45:26.600
<v Speaker 8>I'm a hold him to that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He said it on national TV.</v>

1858
01:45:26.601 --> 01:45:27.434
<v Speaker 8>We're going to go to a black Baptist </v>
<v Speaker 8>church and have an enlightening </v>

1859
01:45:30.771 --> 01:45:35.771
<v Speaker 8>conversation about the need for us to </v>
<v Speaker 8>engage in not only reciprocal and mutual</v>

1860
01:45:36.321 --> 01:45:38.210
<v Speaker 8>edification,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but criticism.</v>

1861
01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:39.133
<v Speaker 8>Even hard and tough criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but in a way that speaks to the needs </v>

1862
01:45:44.121 --> 01:45:46.940
<v Speaker 8>and interests of those who don't usually</v>
<v Speaker 8>get on TV,</v>

1863
01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:47.893
<v Speaker 8>who's voices are not usually amplified,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whose ideas are not usually taken </v>

1864
01:45:51.501 --> 01:45:52.334
<v Speaker 8>seriously and when they get to the upper</v>
<v Speaker 8>echelons of the ability of a society to </v>

1865
01:45:56.811 --> 01:45:57.644
<v Speaker 8>express themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they are equally subject too vicious </v>

1866
01:46:00.981 --> 01:46:01.814
<v Speaker 8>recrimination and hurtful resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's an old story about the pig and </v>

1867
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:08.240
<v Speaker 8>the pig and the chicken going down the </v>
<v Speaker 8>street and said,</v>

1868
01:46:08.241 --> 01:46:09.200
<v Speaker 8>let's have breakfast.</v>

1869
01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:12.253
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1870
01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:14.893
<v Speaker 8>the chicken just has to give up an egg.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The pig has to give up his ass in order </v>

1871
01:46:19.461 --> 01:46:20.294
<v Speaker 8>to make breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We have often been the pigs giving up </v>

1872
01:46:22.101 --> 01:46:25.400
<v Speaker 8>our asses to make breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's start sharing them.</v>

1873
01:46:25.401 --> 01:46:27.230
<v Speaker 8>Asses what everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you.</v>

1874
01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:32.480
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

1875
01:46:38.190 --> 01:46:43.190
<v Speaker 8>so I'm not here to claim that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 8>such thing as oppression,</v>

1876
01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:48.120
<v Speaker 8>unfairness,</v>
<v Speaker 8>brutality,</v>

1877
01:46:48.330 --> 01:46:50.370
<v Speaker 8>discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 8>unfair</v>

1878
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:52.410
<v Speaker 7>use of power.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All of those,</v>

1879
01:46:52.411 --> 01:46:53.244
<v Speaker 7>anyone with any sense knows that </v>
<v Speaker 7>hierarchical structures tilt towards </v>

1880
01:46:57.271 --> 01:47:02.271
<v Speaker 7>tyranny and that we have to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>constantly for to ensure that</v>

1881
01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:05.213
<v Speaker 7>all they are isn't powering tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting to hear Fuko referred </v>

1882
01:47:09.211 --> 01:47:10.560
<v Speaker 7>to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's unfortunate,</v>

1883
01:47:10.561 --> 01:47:12.630
<v Speaker 7>but it's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1884
01:47:13.050 --> 01:47:13.883
<v Speaker 7>because of coal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like his French intellectual conference </v>

1885
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:20.790
<v Speaker 7>essentially believed that the only basis</v>
<v Speaker 7>upon which hierarchies were established,</v>

1886
01:47:20.791 --> 01:47:21.624
<v Speaker 7>his power,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's part of this pernicious </v>

1887
01:47:23.281 --> 01:47:26.670
<v Speaker 7>politically correct doctrine that I've </v>
<v Speaker 7>been speaking about.</v>

1888
01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:27.993
<v Speaker 7>When a hierarchy becomes corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then the only way to ascend it is to </v>

1889
01:47:31.051 --> 01:47:31.884
<v Speaker 7>exercise power.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's essentially the definition of a </v>

1890
01:47:33.511 --> 01:47:36.330
<v Speaker 7>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that doesn't mean that the imperfect</v>

1891
01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:39.900
<v Speaker 7>hierarchies that we have constructed in </v>
<v Speaker 7>our relatively free countries,</v>

1892
01:47:40.170 --> 01:47:41.003
<v Speaker 7>which at least tilt somewhat towards </v>
<v Speaker 7>competence and ability as evidenced by </v>

1893
01:47:45.691 --> 01:47:46.524
<v Speaker 7>the staggering achievements of </v>
<v Speaker 7>civilization that we've managed to </v>

1894
01:47:49.381 --> 01:47:51.720
<v Speaker 7>produce.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean that the hip appropriate</v>

1895
01:47:51.721 --> 01:47:52.554
<v Speaker 7>way of diagnosing them is to assume </v>
<v Speaker 7>without reservation unit dimensionally </v>

1896
01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:58.200
<v Speaker 7>that they're all about power and as a </v>
<v Speaker 7>consequence,</v>

1897
01:47:58.201 --> 01:47:59.034
<v Speaker 7>everyone who occupies any position </v>
<v Speaker 7>within them is a tyrant or a tyrant in </v>

1898
01:48:02.941 --> 01:48:03.720
<v Speaker 7>the making.</v>

1899
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.100
<v Speaker 7>And that is certainly the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 7>claim of someone like Fuko and it's part</v>

1900
01:48:08.101 --> 01:48:10.500
<v Speaker 7>and parcel of this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what would you call it?</v>

1901
01:48:10.501 --> 01:48:14.640
<v Speaker 7>This ideological catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's political correctness.</v>

1902
01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:15.653
<v Speaker 7>I'm not here to argue against progress.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not here to argue against equality </v>

1903
01:48:19.261 --> 01:48:20.094
<v Speaker 7>of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anyone with any sense understands that </v>

1904
01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:23.333
<v Speaker 7>even if you're selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're best served by allowing yourself </v>

1905
01:48:26.881 --> 01:48:27.714
<v Speaker 7>access to the multiplicitous talents of </v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone and to discriminate against </v>

1906
01:48:31.261 --> 01:48:32.094
<v Speaker 7>them for arbitrary reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 7>unrelated to their competence is it's a </v>

1907
01:48:34.771 --> 01:48:37.650
<v Speaker 7>Borat that has nothing to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 7>issue at hand.</v>

1908
01:48:38.010 --> 01:48:40.140
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it isn't that good.</v>

1909
01:48:40.141 --> 01:48:43.590
<v Speaker 7>Things haven't happened in the past and </v>
<v Speaker 7>should continue to happen.</v>

1910
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:44.633
<v Speaker 7>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The point is the point my compatriot </v>

1911
01:48:46.921 --> 01:48:47.754
<v Speaker 7>fried made,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is what we can agree on the </v>

1912
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:53.790
<v Speaker 7>catastrophe and we can agree on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>historic inequity,</v>

1913
01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:59.060
<v Speaker 7>but there's no way I'm going to agree </v>
<v Speaker 7>that political correctness is the way to</v>

1914
01:48:59.401 --> 01:49:00.234
<v Speaker 7>address any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And there's plenty of evidence to the </v>

1915
01:49:02.191 --> 01:49:03.024
<v Speaker 7>contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some of which I would say was displayed </v>

1916
01:49:04.531 --> 01:49:05.640
<v Speaker 7>quite clearly tonight.</v>

1917
01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:11.410
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

1918
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:18.623
<v Speaker 6>so I think one of the irresolvable </v>
<v Speaker 6>issues that we're all coming up against </v>

1919
01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:26.400
<v Speaker 6>is the role of feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1920
01:49:26.401 --> 01:49:27.234
<v Speaker 6>Stephen Fry has kind of asked us to </v>
<v Speaker 6>recognize and empathize with this </v>

1921
01:49:31.951 --> 01:49:35.190
<v Speaker 6>feeling of being silenced if being </v>
<v Speaker 6>threatened.</v>

1922
01:49:35.250 --> 01:49:36.760
<v Speaker 6>And I do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>

1923
01:49:36.761 --> 01:49:38.090
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1924
01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:39.750
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel it sometimes too,</v>

1925
01:49:39.751 --> 01:49:40.584
<v Speaker 6>and my columns,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hate it when I write something that </v>

1926
01:49:43.711 --> 01:49:44.550
<v Speaker 6>then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1927
01:49:44.551 --> 01:49:47.500
<v Speaker 6>gets a kind of irate twitter mob after </v>
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>

1928
01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:52.990
<v Speaker 6>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say I stood up here and said,</v>

1929
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:53.853
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>recognize how threatened so many women </v>

1930
01:49:57.881 --> 01:49:59.530
<v Speaker 6>feel when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

1931
01:49:59.531 --> 01:50:00.364
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the kindness,</v>

1932
01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:01.513
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the best selling and most </v>

1933
01:50:02.501 --> 01:50:03.334
<v Speaker 6>prominent intellectuals in the world </v>
<v Speaker 6>right now it's t says in an interview </v>

1934
01:50:06.791 --> 01:50:07.624
<v Speaker 6>that maybe the me too movement has shown</v>
<v Speaker 6>that this whole experiment of men and </v>

1935
01:50:10.931 --> 01:50:13.630
<v Speaker 6>women working together,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just not working.</v>

1936
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:14.703
<v Speaker 6>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe if women don't want to be s don't </v>

1937
01:50:17.351 --> 01:50:18.184
<v Speaker 6>want the workplace to be sexualized,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they shouldn't be allowed to wear </v>

1938
01:50:20.411 --> 01:50:21.060
<v Speaker 6>makeup.</v>

1939
01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:21.893
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1940
01:50:22.150 --> 01:50:23.230
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Google it.</v>

1941
01:50:23.231 --> 01:50:24.670
<v Speaker 6>See if it's vice interview,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Google it.</v>

1942
01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.660
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1943
01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:27.250
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

1944
01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:28.720
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I say like,</v>

1945
01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:31.990
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel threatened right,</v>

1946
01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:35.080
<v Speaker 6>then I'm being kind of politically </v>
<v Speaker 6>correct and hysterical.</v>

1947
01:50:35.081 --> 01:50:38.440
<v Speaker 6>So much of the debate about political </v>
<v Speaker 6>correct,</v>

1948
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:40.583
<v Speaker 6>but there's one group that really does </v>
<v Speaker 6>think it's feeling should be </v>

1949
01:50:44.071 --> 01:50:44.904
<v Speaker 6>accommodated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that is what we keep coming up </v>

1950
01:50:46.921 --> 01:50:49.290
<v Speaker 6>against is that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1951
01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:50.153
<v Speaker 6>there's a group of people and that to </v>
<v Speaker 6>some extent on part of it that feels </v>

1952
01:50:54.211 --> 01:50:58.890
<v Speaker 6>uniquely that our feelings of being </v>
<v Speaker 6>silenced,</v>

1953
01:50:58.891 --> 01:51:01.020
<v Speaker 6>marginalized,</v>
<v Speaker 6>censored,</v>

1954
01:51:01.170 --> 01:51:04.680
<v Speaker 6>that those feelings need to take </v>
<v Speaker 6>primacy,</v>

1955
01:51:04.681 --> 01:51:06.360
<v Speaker 6>that we can kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1956
01:51:07.010 --> 01:51:08.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sneer,</v>

1957
01:51:08.221 --> 01:51:09.054
<v Speaker 6>when these other groups ask for us to </v>
<v Speaker 6>take seriously their feelings of being </v>

1958
01:51:15.181 --> 01:51:18.960
<v Speaker 6>threatened or their feelings of being </v>
<v Speaker 6>marginalized,</v>

1959
01:51:18.990 --> 01:51:19.823
<v Speaker 6>then we call it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we call that we call those demands </v>

1960
01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:23.513
<v Speaker 6>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I would finally say that I think </v>

1961
01:51:26.491 --> 01:51:31.200
<v Speaker 6>there is a fair amount of research that </v>
<v Speaker 6>people become more closed minded,</v>

1962
01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:36.560
<v Speaker 6>more tribal when they feel threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they feel that their group identity</v>

1963
01:51:37.170 --> 01:51:41.340
<v Speaker 6>is at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so as much as you know,</v>

1964
01:51:41.610 --> 01:51:45.330
<v Speaker 6>you want to blame the left for the rise </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the right.</v>

1965
01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:49.500
<v Speaker 6>I think that when you kind of vet the </v>
<v Speaker 6>rise of the right,</v>

1966
01:51:49.530 --> 01:51:50.363
<v Speaker 6>the rise of people who are questioning </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fundamental ideals of pluralistic </v>

1967
01:51:55.591 --> 01:51:59.580
<v Speaker 6>liberal democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more those views are mainstreamed,</v>

1968
01:51:59.730 --> 01:52:03.990
<v Speaker 6>the more people I think are going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>shut down in response because people are</v>

1969
01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:05.220
<v Speaker 6>really scared.</v>

1970
01:52:13.070 --> 01:52:14.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1971
01:52:14.571 --> 01:52:15.350
<v Speaker 4>I think on behalf</v>

1972
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:17.690
<v Speaker 5>all the debaters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we want to thank the audience.</v>

1973
01:52:17.691 --> 01:52:21.940
<v Speaker 5>You were engaged a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were mostly civil and uh,</v>

1974
01:52:22.010 --> 01:52:24.080
<v Speaker 5>lots of civil in ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that we enjoy it.</v>

1975
01:52:24.081 --> 01:52:26.030
<v Speaker 5>So I think on behalf of the debaters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody,</v>

1976
01:52:26.031 --> 01:52:28.970
<v Speaker 5>thank you audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was a challenging topic and you did</v>

1977
01:52:28.971 --> 01:52:29.200
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1978

<v Speaker 4>Great job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You too.</v>

1980
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:36.300
<v Speaker 5>Our debaters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1981
01:52:36.301 --> 01:52:37.650
<v Speaker 5>it's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of these,</v>

1982
01:52:37.690 --> 01:52:39.930

<v Speaker 5>four give regular speeches,</v>

1983
01:52:39.931 --> 01:52:41.970
<v Speaker 5>but it's a very different thing to come </v>
<v Speaker 5>on in front,</v>

1984
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:44.940
<v Speaker 5>in a stage in front of a live audience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a large television,</v>

<v Speaker 5>terms of their opening statements that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are rebuttals,</v>

2018

<v Speaker 9>watching right now just to get your </v>
<v Speaker 9>reactions to the debate and maybe just </v>

2026
01:56:05.971 --> 01:56:06.840
<v Speaker 9>start with you.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

2027
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:08.340
<v Speaker 9>Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There were some heated moments here.</v>

2028
01:56:08.341 --> 01:56:11.310
<v Speaker 9>Did that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>did that surprise you that uh,</v>

2029
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:14.130
<v Speaker 9>the exchanges that you had with Michael </v>
<v Speaker 9>Eric Dyson?</v>

2030
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:16.470
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I wouldn't say it surprised me.</v>

2031
01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:17.333
<v Speaker 9>Well I suppose it probably did.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It just team didn't seem like a very </v>

2032
01:56:19.651 --> 01:56:21.630
<v Speaker 9>good tactical move,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2033
01:56:21.631 --> 01:56:23.430
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I stand by what I said.</v>

2034
01:56:23.431 --> 01:56:26.470
<v Speaker 9>I don't see any reason at all that my </v>
<v Speaker 9>racial identity,</v>

2035
01:56:26.471 --> 01:56:29.970
<v Speaker 9>he needed to be dragged into the </v>
<v Speaker 9>discussion independent of my personality</v>

2036
01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:31.013
<v Speaker 9>proclivity.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I would say what I just said to Mr. Fry </v>

2037
01:56:33.151 --> 01:56:35.370
<v Speaker 9>here is that it was a pleasure sharing </v>
<v Speaker 9>the stage with him.</v>

2038
01:56:35.370 --> 01:56:40.370
<v Speaker 9>I've rarely heard anyone ever deliver </v>
<v Speaker 9>their convictions with such a remarkable</v>

2039
01:56:41.581 --> 01:56:42.414
<v Speaker 9>sense of passion.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And we have 10 forbearance and </v>

2040
01:56:45.421 --> 01:56:46.440
<v Speaker 9>erudition.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was,</v>

2041
01:56:46.770 --> 01:56:48.060
<v Speaker 9>it was really something.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2042
01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:49.253
<v Speaker 9>and Stephen challenging debate because </v>
<v Speaker 9>in a sense we're trying to mesh two </v>

2043
01:56:51.631 --> 01:56:53.600
<v Speaker 9>different views here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>two different worldviews.</v>

2044
01:56:53.610 --> 01:56:55.920
<v Speaker 9>One very focused more on identity </v>
<v Speaker 9>politics,</v>

2045
01:56:55.921 --> 01:56:58.830
<v Speaker 9>group identity.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You in a sense having an argument really</v>

2046
01:56:58.831 --> 01:56:59.664
<v Speaker 9>more about the larger culture itself and</v>
<v Speaker 9>the tenor and tone of the conversation </v>

2047
01:57:03.361 --> 01:57:05.720
<v Speaker 9>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was being a little kind of scatter gun</v>

2048
01:57:05.730 --> 01:57:06.563
<v Speaker 9>really,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's got the gun and two specific </v>

2049
01:57:08.941 --> 01:57:09.774
<v Speaker 9>that I had just taken.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Very literally the popular idea that </v>

2050
01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:16.260
<v Speaker 9>correctness is being a kind of control </v>
<v Speaker 9>of language and the uh,</v>

2051
01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:20.040
<v Speaker 9>shutting done certain phrases or an </v>
<v Speaker 9>introduction of others and,</v>

2052
01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:21.650
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and the,</v>

2053
01:57:21.850 --> 01:57:22.683
<v Speaker 9>the kind of day to day as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>human resource departments of </v>

2054
01:57:24.721 --> 01:57:27.280
<v Speaker 9>corporations and that sort of thing.</v>

2055
01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:28.113
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and uh,</v>

2056
01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:29.273
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so I was slightly disappointed that it </v>

2057
01:57:31.141 --> 01:57:34.580
<v Speaker 9>just became a debate about race and </v>
<v Speaker 9>about gender and so on.</v>

2058
01:57:34.581 --> 01:57:35.250
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2059
01:57:35.250 --> 01:57:39.000
<v Speaker 9>but that was I guess not true.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I still think know the fact is I,</v>

2060
01:57:39.570 --> 01:57:41.460
<v Speaker 9>I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm still a lefty,</v>

2061
01:57:41.461 --> 01:57:44.720
<v Speaker 9>but a software I'm just don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not too soft</v>

2062
01:57:46.730 --> 01:57:49.070
<v Speaker 9>squishy in every sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

2063
01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:50.213
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I realized that that's not a </v>

2064
01:57:50.941 --> 01:57:53.230
<v Speaker 9>political point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It is a personal way.</v>

2065
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:54.690
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and the,</v>

2066
01:57:55.170 --> 01:57:57.780
<v Speaker 9>the gap between the personal and the </v>
<v Speaker 9>political,</v>

2067
01:57:57.781 --> 01:57:58.614
<v Speaker 9>which is a space you want,</v>
<v Speaker 9>obviously very interested in is this </v>

2068
01:57:59.690 --> 01:58:01.090
<v Speaker 9>like psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2069
01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:04.380
<v Speaker 9>is one that is rarely explored.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

2070
01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:05.273
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>people that are either so personal that </v>

2071
01:58:06.991 --> 01:58:07.824
<v Speaker 9>it has no application in the outside </v>
<v Speaker 9>world and the Organization of Human </v>

2072
01:58:10.830 --> 01:58:11.663
<v Speaker 9>Affairs or the soap and the article and </v>
<v Speaker 9>so much to do with structure and </v>

2073
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:16.920
<v Speaker 9>distinction between hierarchies and </v>
<v Speaker 9>networks and so on,</v>

2074
01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:17.993
<v Speaker 9>that they forget the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And that's the space in which the </v>

2075
01:58:22.351 --> 01:58:23.184
<v Speaker 9>impassioned liberal lives.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And it's not easy to do it because you </v>

2076
01:58:26.371 --> 01:58:28.700
<v Speaker 9>often do son rather wet.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I'm aware that I,</v>

2077
01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:30.143
<v Speaker 9>I enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

2078
01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:31.470
<v Speaker 9>thank you for coming.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He just finally,</v>

2079
01:58:31.471 --> 01:58:34.460
<v Speaker 9>before I free you to both to a well </v>
<v Speaker 9>earned drank,</v>

2080
01:58:35.130 --> 01:58:36.480
<v Speaker 9>anything left unsaid,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Jordan,</v>

2081
01:58:36.481 --> 01:58:37.410
<v Speaker 9>any,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2082
01:58:37.470 --> 01:58:39.840
<v Speaker 9>any point that you wanted to make that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2083
01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:41.830
<v Speaker 9>you didn't feel you had the time or the </v>
<v Speaker 9>opportunity?</v>

2084
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:43.480
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

2085
01:58:43.481 --> 01:58:44.500
<v Speaker 5>I said my piece.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2086
01:58:44.530 --> 01:58:46.000
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same question to you is you,</v>

2087
01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:47.730
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I goes across her,</v>

2088
01:58:47.731 --> 01:58:48.564
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so much you can talk about it </v>

2089
01:58:49.621 --> 01:58:49.970
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2090
01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:53.170
<v Speaker 5>in that field and I just wanted to leave</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the point that I do want,</v>

2091
01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:54.580
<v Speaker 5>like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2092
01:58:54.581 --> 01:58:55.630
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a no brainer.</v>

2093
01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:58.560
<v Speaker 5>We want the world to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a Sweden kind of,</v>

2094
01:58:58.770 --> 01:59:00.790
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's how you get there.</v>

2095
01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:02.320
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>

2096
01:59:02.590 --> 01:59:04.710
<v Speaker 5>and I felt that wasn't really addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2097
01:59:04.810 --> 01:59:06.550
<v Speaker 5>Well gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank you both very much.</v>

2098
01:59:06.551 --> 01:59:08.970
<v Speaker 5>A from our online audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A big thank you all.</v>

2099
01:59:08.971 --> 01:59:12.450
<v Speaker 5>So I know to Jordan Peterson and Stephen</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fry for participating in a,</v>

2100
01:59:12.451 --> 01:59:13.284
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a debate with some steaks on the </v>

2101
01:59:14.351 --> 01:59:16.060
<v Speaker 5>table for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you gentlemen.</v>

2102
01:59:16.061 --> 01:59:17.070
<v Speaker 5>I'll see you in the reception.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yep,</v>

2103
01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:17.890
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2104
01:59:17.890 --> 01:59:18.760
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>online,</v>

2105
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:20.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>viewers,</v>

2106
01:59:20.771 --> 01:59:24.970
<v Speaker 5>we've now have a Michael Eric dyson </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming into the camera range here with,</v>

2107
01:59:24.971 --> 01:59:27.730
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michelle Goldberg to get their reactions</v>

2108
01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:29.380
<v Speaker 5>to the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So guys,</v>

2109
01:59:29.381 --> 01:59:31.810
<v Speaker 5>thank you for being part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2110
01:59:31.811 --> 01:59:34.270
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a complicated subject.</v>

2111
01:59:34.271 --> 01:59:36.700
<v Speaker 5>It's got a lot of different moving </v>
<v Speaker 5>pieces and elements.</v>

2112
01:59:36.701 --> 01:59:39.430
<v Speaker 5>I think we addressed some of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>constituent parts.</v>

2113
01:59:39.670 --> 01:59:41.140
<v Speaker 5>Maybe start with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michelle.</v>

2114
01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:42.333
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was there something on stage that you </v>

2115
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.823
<v Speaker 5>wanted to say that maybe we didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>the time or he didn't have the </v>

2116
01:59:47.351 --> 01:59:48.790
<v Speaker 5>opportunity?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2117
01:59:48.791 --> 01:59:49.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now's your chance.</v>

2118
01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:51.090
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2119
01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:51.933
<v Speaker 6>I guess I w if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the only thing I can think of is that </v>

2120
01:59:53.291 --> 01:59:54.124
<v Speaker 6>maybe I wish that we could have drilled </v>
<v Speaker 6>down a little bit more into the gender </v>

2121
01:59:57.071 --> 02:00:00.130
<v Speaker 6>piece of this again to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2122
02:00:00.131 --> 02:00:02.490
<v Speaker 6>what we're really arguing about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2123
02:00:02.590 --> 02:00:07.590
<v Speaker 6>particularly with Mr. Peterson and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of range of progress,</v>

2124
02:00:07.730 --> 02:00:11.230
<v Speaker 6>the range of feminist progress that he </v>
<v Speaker 6>considers,</v>

2125
02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:13.300
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>political correctness.</v>

2126
02:00:13.301 --> 02:00:18.280
<v Speaker 6>I think part of the frustration is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>him and Steven Fry are talking about and</v>

2127
02:00:18.281 --> 02:00:19.114
<v Speaker 6>defending,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a fairly discrete set of ideas </v>

2128
02:00:21.491 --> 02:00:23.100
<v Speaker 6>with some overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2129
02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:24.213
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and one of the difficult things about </v>

2130
02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:25.984
<v Speaker 6>political correctness is it's a slippery</v>
<v Speaker 6>term that's deployed to talk about a </v>

2131
02:00:30.461 --> 02:00:31.910
<v Speaker 6>whole range of phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2132
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.900
<v Speaker 6>And</v>

2133
02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:35.150
<v Speaker 5>closed down conversation and open up </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>

2134
02:00:35.151 --> 02:00:36.590
<v Speaker 5>Don't ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did you feel?</v>

2135
02:00:36.591 --> 02:00:37.640
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michael?</v>

2136
02:00:37.641 --> 02:00:38.900
<v Speaker 5>There were some points there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

2137
02:00:38.901 --> 02:00:39.420
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2138
02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:42.080
<v Speaker 5>points of sharp exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We appreciate that at the munk debates.</v>

2139
02:00:42.081 --> 02:00:43.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not a place for,</v>

2140
02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:44.790
<v Speaker 5>for a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2141
02:00:44.810 --> 02:00:46.420
<v Speaker 5>shrinking wallflowers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2142
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:47.383
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2143
02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:49.370
<v Speaker 5>any unsaid thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>

2144
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:52.670
<v Speaker 5>anything that you want to put a point on</v>
<v Speaker 5>now?</v>

2145
02:00:52.730 --> 02:00:53.720
<v Speaker 5>I think you have to hold people</v>

2146
02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:54.813
<v Speaker 8>intellectually accountable and to deny </v>
<v Speaker 8>some of the things to Michelle that he </v>

2147
02:00:58.961 --> 02:00:59.794
<v Speaker 8>said and to present himself Mr. Peterson</v>
<v Speaker 8>in a certain way without seeing some of </v>

2148
02:01:03.731 --> 02:01:07.870
<v Speaker 8>the important things he said about women</v>
<v Speaker 8>and other minorities.</v>

2149
02:01:07.871 --> 02:01:11.830
<v Speaker 8>I think demands and engaged response to </v>
<v Speaker 8>him.</v>

2150
02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:13.053
<v Speaker 8>And I think that the idea itself,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as Michelle stated repeatedly and Mr. </v>

2151
02:01:17.890 --> 02:01:19.030
<v Speaker 8>Fry talking about his frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he said,</v>

2152
02:01:19.031 --> 02:01:21.130
<v Speaker 8>we've talked about everything but </v>
<v Speaker 8>political correctness.</v>

2153
02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:22.413
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the reality is political correctness </v>

2154
02:01:23.651 --> 02:01:27.310
<v Speaker 8>resides,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean rests upon some serious political</v>

2155
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:31.420
<v Speaker 8>work in this culture in Canada and in </v>
<v Speaker 8>America that needs to be done.</v>

2156
02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:34.510
<v Speaker 8>And what I tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in terms of giving a brief genealogy,</v>

2157
02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:35.493
<v Speaker 8>we didn't have political correctness as </v>
<v Speaker 8>long as white straight men were in </v>

2158
02:01:37.451 --> 02:01:38.284
<v Speaker 8>charge.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was no argument about let's get </v>

2159
02:01:40.791 --> 02:01:44.540
<v Speaker 8>this right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But when people who exercise power,</v>

2160
02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:47.150
<v Speaker 8>no longer exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 8>absolute power,</v>

2161
02:01:47.151 --> 02:01:49.910
<v Speaker 8>still predominant power,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then there's an argument.</v>

2162
02:01:49.911 --> 02:01:53.060
<v Speaker 8>And I think Michelle's point about </v>
<v Speaker 8>gender,</v>

2163
02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:55.520
<v Speaker 8>about the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 8>about race,</v>

2164
02:01:55.521 --> 02:01:57.200
<v Speaker 8>about sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and the link.</v>

2165
02:01:57.530 --> 02:01:58.363
<v Speaker 8>I just think that it was a necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 8>vigorous and sometimes sharply worded a </v>

2166
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:04.310
<v Speaker 8>debate between us shall final word to </v>
<v Speaker 8>you.</v>

2167
02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:07.093
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you are curious about the quote that </v>

2168
02:02:12.590 --> 02:02:13.730
<v Speaker 6>I mentioned about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2169
02:02:13.731 --> 02:02:16.430
<v Speaker 6>maybe this experiment with women and men</v>
<v Speaker 6>working together,</v>

2170
02:02:16.431 --> 02:02:17.390
<v Speaker 6>maybe it's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2171
02:02:17.391 --> 02:02:19.500
<v Speaker 6>please do Google it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's an interview with Vice.</v>

2172
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:21.910
<v Speaker 6>Did you know your columns for north one </v>
<v Speaker 6>of your columns?</v>

2173
02:02:23.690 --> 02:02:26.100
<v Speaker 6>Again?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

2174
02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:27.013
<v Speaker 6>Me and Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 6>me and Stephen Fry probably could have </v>

2175
02:02:29.210 --> 02:02:33.650
<v Speaker 6>sat on the same side of another debate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But again,</v>

2176
02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:34.513
<v Speaker 6>I feel like the phrase political </v>
<v Speaker 6>correctness has expanded to cover a </v>

2177
02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:39.613
<v Speaker 6>whole range of challenges too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was really interesting how </v>

2178
02:02:43.251 --> 02:02:46.160
