1
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>We've discussed the big five traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

2
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.563
<v Speaker 1>that's sensitivity to positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism had sensitivity to negative </v>

3
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all negative emotions,</v>

4
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:27.410
<v Speaker 1>mostly fear anxiety and emotional pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to load on neuroticism,</v>

5
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.920
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another negative emotion.</v>

6
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be more associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with conscientiousness,</v>

7
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>particularly its orderliness aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

8
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.943
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about agreeableness </v>

9
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:45.434
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness is a very difficult </v>

10
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.650
<v Speaker 1>personality dimension to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think partly because it's difficult to</v>

11
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:52.484
<v Speaker 1>dissociate from neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy and as well from extroversion </v>

12
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.213
<v Speaker 1>because agreeable people like you and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of sounds like extroversion </v>

13
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.683
<v Speaker 1>and disagreeable people sound like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hard to get along with and they </v>

14
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:06.764
<v Speaker 1>sort of are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people who were high in neuroticism </v>

15
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:09.704
<v Speaker 1>or hard to get along with too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they tend to be volatile and </v>

16
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:12.464
<v Speaker 1>irritable and so most of the time if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're engaged in a contentious issue </v>

17
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:17.294
<v Speaker 1>with someone and emotions flare it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it usually has more to do with trait </v>

18
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:23.570
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism then with disagreeableness </v>
<v Speaker 1>per se.</v>

19
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.380
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm going to do is try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe to you what the agreeable trait</v>

20
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:28.214
<v Speaker 1>is on both of its dimensions and also to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay out the pros and cons of existence </v>

21
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.383
<v Speaker 1>on that normal distribution trait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal distribution at more or less </v>

22
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 1>every point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think my,</v>

23
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>the way I look at it anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of all of the traits.</v>

24
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:44.743
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness is the one that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come with the most market positive and </v>

25
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>negative aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Features let's say.</v>

26
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.123
<v Speaker 1>So we don't confuse it with aspects the </v>
<v Speaker 1>both positive and negative features at </v>

27
00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:57.260
<v Speaker 1>each point on the distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complex,</v>

28
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex dimension.</v>

29
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:00.014
<v Speaker 1>So I'll read you some of the questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the big five aspect scale and </v>

30
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:03.974
<v Speaker 1>that'll give you kind of a initial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rule of thumb estimate about whether </v>

31
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:09.170
<v Speaker 1>or not you're agreeable or disagreeable.</v>

32
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.270
<v Speaker 1>And so here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here are some of the questions,</v>

33
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.223
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're answering these for </v>

34
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:19.250
<v Speaker 1>yourself on a scale from one to five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly disagree to strongly agree.</v>

35
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.353
<v Speaker 1>So the first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in other people's </v>

36
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:25.274
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you are interested in other </v>

37
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:30.380
<v Speaker 1>people's problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tilts you towards agreeableness and</v>

38
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's a agreeableness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>divided into compassion and politeness,</v>

39
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.900
<v Speaker 1>which also sounded like very positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

40
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:36.734
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everyone wants to be </v>

41
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>compassionate to everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be polite and so you might say,</v>

42
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:43.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is is that a virtue?</v>

43
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.533
<v Speaker 1>Are those virtues and with the other Ed </v>
<v Speaker 1>being actually negative to be not </v>

44
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.190
<v Speaker 1>compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not polite,</v>

45
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.203
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly worded that way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually a mistake because we </v>

46
00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>know that these traits are normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed roughly speaking,</v>

47
00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that means that there has to be</v>

48
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:00.094
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative features at every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single position on the distribution and </v>

49
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>sort of make the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the presupposition,</v>

50
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:07.534
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that being extroverted as being better </v>

51
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>than it being introverted or that being </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally stable is necessarily better</v>

52
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>than being neurotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to make a kind of a kind of confusion</v>

53
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:22.051
<v Speaker 1>of of moral are what obligation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>trait which trait position.</v>

54
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>You have to assume that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages and disadvantage also all the</v>

55
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>way along or or the distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have set itself up that way.</v>

56
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Especially because these seams seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be biologically instantiated traits.</v>

57
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in other people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

59
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>they like to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ember unburden themselves to you,</v>

60
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>you care about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a mark of compassion.</v>

61
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:44.884
<v Speaker 1>If you're more or less indifferent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people's stupid problems and you </v>

62
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>wish they just get on with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're less compassionate,</v>

63
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:54.810
<v Speaker 1>you're harsher and more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

64
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the extreme,</v>

65
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>more Kelis ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

66
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Authority.</v>

67
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>That's politeness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of agreeableness.</v>

68
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see,</v>

69
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.050
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel others' emotions.</v>

70
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inquire about others' wellbeing.</v>

71
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.713
<v Speaker 1>Compassion</v>

72
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.973
<v Speaker 1>can't be bothered with others' needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take advantage of others that's </v>

73
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

74
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Sympathize with others' feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avoid imposing my will on others.</v>

75
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Wait for others to lead the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

76
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.224
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all of those were associated </v>

77
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>with trait agreeableness or </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeableness.</v>

78
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think about this for a minute.</v>

79
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to tell you how I </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize agreeableness.</v>

80
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you want to know is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are more agreeable than men,</v>

81
00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.883
<v Speaker 1>about half a standard deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's approximately enough so that </v>

82
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.933
<v Speaker 1>if you took a random mail in a random </v>
<v Speaker 1>female out of the population and you </v>

83
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 1>tried to guess who was more agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guessed the female,</v>

84
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 1>you'd be right about 60 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

85
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 1>So and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

86
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting about that,</v>

87
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 1>and this is something also to keep in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

88
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 1>is about normal distributions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

89
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:19.564
<v Speaker 1>so imagine you have normal distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that most people are in the middle </v>

90
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 1>and then you have another normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

91
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 1>male and female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mostly they overlap,</v>

92
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>but you see out here and out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't overlap at all.</v>

93
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 1>And so even though on average men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women don't just don't,</v>

94
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.433
<v Speaker 1>aren't that much different in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their levels of agreeableness by the </v>

95
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:41.374
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go out and you look at the </v>

96
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>extremes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very different.</v>

97
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.043
<v Speaker 1>So all of the most agreeable people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>women and all of the most disagreeable </v>

98
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:49.220
<v Speaker 1>people are men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>

99
00:05:49.221 --> 00:05:52.250
<v Speaker 1>the extremes are often what matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than what's in the middle.</v>

100
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.280
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the ways that's reflected </v>
<v Speaker 1>in society by the way,</v>

101
00:05:55.281 --> 00:05:56.114
<v Speaker 1>is there's way more men in prison and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best personality predictor of being </v>

102
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>in prison is to be low in agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you Kelis.</v>

103
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.631
<v Speaker 1>Now you may think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

104
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>what's the opposite of compassion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>politeness?</v>

105
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's best sort of conceptualized</v>

106
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a trading game.</v>

107
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.703
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that we're going to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeated trading games and if you're a </v>

108
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:20.294
<v Speaker 1>very agreeable then you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bargain harder on my behalf than you're </v>

109
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 1>going to bargain on your own behalf.</v>

110
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're very disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do the reverse.</v>

111
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:28.484
<v Speaker 1>You're going to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this trading game for me and you </v>

112
00:06:31.261 --> 00:06:32.780
<v Speaker 1>are going to take care of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>

113
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Were an agreeable person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to say no,</v>

114
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:35.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at best,</v>

115
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 1>at worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has to be 50 slash 50.</v>

116
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 1>But I'd like to help you every way I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

117
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the credit.</v>

118
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.883
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you Kinda,</v>

119
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.723
<v Speaker 1>you kind of understand that now the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage to being agreeable then is </v>

120
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:46.664
<v Speaker 1>that you're good in teams and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>very much likely to give other people </v>

121
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.574
<v Speaker 1>credit that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The downside of being agreeable is that </v>

122
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:52.454
<v Speaker 1>you're not very good at putting forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own interests and so one of the </v>

123
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:55.964
<v Speaker 1>things that predicts salary across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example is agreeableness and it </v>

124
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:00.284
<v Speaker 1>predicts it negatively and so it's part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reason why women get paid less </v>

125
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:03.884
<v Speaker 1>than men and this is something for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>women in the class who really listened </v>

126
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:07.574
<v Speaker 1>to because you how you get paid across </v>
<v Speaker 1>time depends on a very large number of </v>

127
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

128
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.853
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on your skills and your </v>

129
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 1>abilities and your position and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>social network and all of that.</v>

130
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:17.744
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing it depends on is </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you actually go ask for </v>

131
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:20.804
<v Speaker 1>money or maybe that you don't even ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>because actually you don't ask for </v>

132
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell people that you need to be paid</v>

133
00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 1>more or something they don't like will </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and I don't mean as a threat.</v>

134
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.733
<v Speaker 1>I mean that you have to be willing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're negotiating to have an </v>

135
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 1>alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go talk to your boss who isn't going</v>

136
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 1>to give you money because everyone wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

137
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a competitive game.</v>

138
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.873
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to go there and </v>

139
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

140
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.590
<v Speaker 1>here's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's why it's useful.</v>

141
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Here's why you have to give me more </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and this is my opportunities.</v>

142
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.323
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're not taking your boss's </v>

143
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:53.234
<v Speaker 1>money anyways because it's very seldom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very frequently the case that he's </v>

144
00:07:55.791 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 1>working for a whopping big company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he needs an excuse to give you money</v>

145
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.603
<v Speaker 1>because everyone's asking for money all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time and so you have to put your </v>

146
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:08.560
<v Speaker 1>case forward powerfully and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable.</v>

147
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do it to disagree,</v>

148
00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:11.204
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then he's going to think that </v>

149
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Speaker 1>you're a son of a bitch and maybe he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to give you anything and maybe</v>

150
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>you'll get fired for being mouthy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

151
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 1>and that certainly happens to people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are too disagreeable.</v>

152
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:20.523
<v Speaker 1>You got to get the balance right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely the case and the </v>

153
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:25.160
<v Speaker 1>other thing that happens to women that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>also worth noting,</v>

154
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.010
<v Speaker 1>and this is probably because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher negative emotion,</v>

155
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>is they tend to underestimate their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility in business settings,</v>

156
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:32.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

157
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.103
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're trying to evaluate </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're like and you're more tilted </v>

158
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 1>towards negative emotion than the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do that are wrong,</v>

159
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:40.334
<v Speaker 1>are going to stand out more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more on the foreground and the things </v>

160
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:43.244
<v Speaker 1>that you do that are right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you go into a negotiation and </v>

161
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:46.244
<v Speaker 1>you're uncertain already because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have self doubts and then you're </v>

162
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:50.114
<v Speaker 1>agreeable in the negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen is that you're </v>

163
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:53.744
<v Speaker 1>not going to win as often and winning in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a business setting or in their career </v>

164
00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:58.374
<v Speaker 1>development setting means more </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for promotion and more </v>

165
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>revenue generated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the downside of that of course,</v>

166
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:05.124
<v Speaker 1>is as you climb the business hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you also have to take on more </v>

167
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and that responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>is sometimes unpleasant as well.</v>

168
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:13.104
<v Speaker 1>Especially to people who are agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not necessarily liked if </v>

169
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:18.630
<v Speaker 1>you're in a position of authority and </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people.</v>

170
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.463
<v Speaker 1>Really liked to be liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's their primary motive motivator </v>

171
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>because they're concerned about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintenance,</v>

172
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

173
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.550
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

174
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.633
<v Speaker 1>of intimate positive relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that also makes them conflict </v>

175
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>avoidant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

176
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 1>so now you guys can think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

177
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 1>But I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why.</v>

178
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I think the personality differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>between men and women exist now.</v>

179
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:40.763
<v Speaker 1>These are speculative hypotheses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're reasonably well documented </v>

180
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the relevant literature.</v>

181
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:47.400
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think about it.</v>

182
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:48.234
<v Speaker 1>The first thing we might think about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between men and </v>

183
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:51.420
<v Speaker 1>women?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

184
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.250
<v Speaker 1>how do they differ?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

185
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:54.084
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we might observe is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at personality differences </v>

186
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 1>be between pre pubescent boys and girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not very large.</v>

187
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Boys and girls don't differ in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their trait.</v>

188
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

189
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.640
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that when puberty kicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

190
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:09.474
<v Speaker 1>women's trait neuroticism rises and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>stays higher than men for the rest of </v>

191
00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:13.920
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>

192
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.753
<v Speaker 1>And this is why you see this reflected </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the different kinds of </v>

193
00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:19.170
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology that be set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two sexes,</v>

194
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:21.810
<v Speaker 1>so men are overrepresented in </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism,</v>

195
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 1>drug abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antisocial personality,</v>

196
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.803
<v Speaker 1>and a host of learning disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As well as that attention deficit </v>

197
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:27.834
<v Speaker 1>disorder and women are overrepresented </v>
<v Speaker 1>in depression and anxiety primarily now </v>

198
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.443
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be tightly associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher levels of trait neuroticism </v>

199
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:38.610
<v Speaker 1>because maybe it's if you're at the 95th</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile or higher,</v>

200
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:39.444
<v Speaker 1>let's say in trait neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't much different than </v>

201
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.510
<v Speaker 1>difference between that and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat prone to depression and anxiety</v>

202
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.620
<v Speaker 1>and because the curves overlap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>

203
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

204
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.733
<v Speaker 1>the curves are identical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The normal distributions are identical </v>

205
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:54.930
<v Speaker 1>for men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tilt the one to the,</v>

206
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.490
<v Speaker 1>to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the women's,</v>

207
00:10:56.491 --> 00:10:59.190
<v Speaker 1>curved to the right towards higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of the rotor system.</v>

208
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.263
<v Speaker 1>You go out and you look for the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 20 who has the highest levels of </v>

209
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:04.080
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>

210
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.480
<v Speaker 1>It's much more likely to be female than </v>
<v Speaker 1>male.</v>

211
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's see if we can figure out why.</v>

212
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.210
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to tell you some things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic differences between men and women.</v>

213
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell me what you think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it if you are,</v>

214
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.080
<v Speaker 1>if you agree or disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

215
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.093
<v Speaker 1>First size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>differential emergence between men and </v>

216
00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:21.000
<v Speaker 1>women at puberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

217
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Because boys and girls are roughly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same size.</v>

218
00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:23.874
<v Speaker 1>And roughly the same strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but men get bigger at puberty when the </v>

219
00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:29.040
<v Speaker 1>testosterone kicks in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more importantly,</v>

220
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.113
<v Speaker 1>not only do they get taller and heavier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their upper body strength is much </v>

221
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:33.923
<v Speaker 1>higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a real issue for for combat </v>

222
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.870
<v Speaker 1>because human beings punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's other animals that do that.</v>

223
00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Kangaroos do that two ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're not the.</v>

224
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:42.803
<v Speaker 1>We're not the only people that punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have clubs on the ends of our </v>

225
00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 1>arms and so that's how we defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

226
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.590
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have a lot of upper body </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>

227
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:53.320
<v Speaker 1>especially short across the shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're heavier than you can step the</v>

228
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:54.154
<v Speaker 1>punch and it's a lot more devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it is the case that if you look at </v>

229
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:01.120
<v Speaker 1>the statistics for physical altercations</v>
<v Speaker 1>in marriage,</v>

230
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 1>women attack their husbands more often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The husbands attack their wives.</v>

231
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.520
<v Speaker 1>While you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

232
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's assume that there isn't any reason</v>

233
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:10.354
<v Speaker 1>other than both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People in a relationship can get upset </v>

234
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 1>and the women know that if they hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>their husbands,</v>

235
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 1>nothing's really going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

236
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.680
<v Speaker 1>if you're a woman about that high and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your husband is say,</v>

238
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 1>my height,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

239
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.330
<v Speaker 1>unless you hit me with an object or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's sharp,</v>

240
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:28.240
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>by any serious damage is pretty low.</v>

241
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.223
<v Speaker 1>You might hurt me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I do the reverse and hit you and </v>

242
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I really hit you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I might kill you.</v>

243
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason at least one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why women can be more physically</v>

244
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:39.634
<v Speaker 1>aggressive in minor ways in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship is because everyone knows </v>

245
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.143
<v Speaker 1>the wife and the husband equally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the consequence of the physical </v>

246
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:50.440
<v Speaker 1>aggression is much more limited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So men do more serious damage to women,</v>

247
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.930
<v Speaker 1>but women are more aggressive in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

248
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 1>So That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

249
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:55.534
<v Speaker 1>so there's a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a body size difference that's </v>

250
00:12:57.431 --> 00:12:59.620
<v Speaker 1>important to strength differential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>

251
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:00.723
<v Speaker 1>Next thing I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume that the reason that </v>

252
00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:07.150
<v Speaker 1>women are higher in sensitivity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion is because the world is</v>

253
00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:09.490
<v Speaker 1>actually more dangerous to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

254
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:10.324
<v Speaker 1>Because that would be the most logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why there would be a sex </v>

255
00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:14.494
<v Speaker 1>difference in a sex difference in it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like fear or sensitivity to </v>

256
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:17.794
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well first there's the danger of </v>

257
00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 1>physical altercation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

258
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.080
<v Speaker 1>there's the sexual danger.</v>

259
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.110
<v Speaker 1>So women become sexually vulnerable at </v>
<v Speaker 1>puberty.</v>

260
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.070
<v Speaker 1>And why do I say vulnerable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it's straightforward,</v>

261
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.913
<v Speaker 1>it's because the cost of sex for women </v>
<v Speaker 1>is way higher than it is for men are </v>

262
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.033
<v Speaker 1>certainly has been throughout our </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history because if a man </v>

263
00:13:36.821 --> 00:13:37.654
<v Speaker 1>has an unwanted sexual encounter while </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he walks away and maybe he's </v>

264
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.930
<v Speaker 1>persecuted by the state or prosecuted by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state for it.</v>

265
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.003
<v Speaker 1>But if a woman has an unwanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unwarranted or incautious sexual </v>

266
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:51.130
<v Speaker 1>encounter and she ends up pregnant then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

267
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:53.800
<v Speaker 1>in traditional societies that's you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just done.</v>

268
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.170
<v Speaker 1>And even in modern societies that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>

269
00:13:56.171 --> 00:13:57.490
<v Speaker 1>like ours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

270
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.421
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

271
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to go into that.</v>

272
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 1>It's big trouble no matter what you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

273
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:05.410
<v Speaker 1>It's big trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So being,</v>

274
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.260
<v Speaker 1>being more nervous about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes perfect sense.</v>

275
00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:13.030
<v Speaker 1>But then here's the last thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that women's nervous systems</v>

276
00:14:13.031 --> 00:14:14.860
<v Speaker 1>are not adapted to women.</v>

277
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.103
<v Speaker 1>I think women's nervous systems are </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapted to the mother infant dyad and </v>

278
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.830
<v Speaker 1>because you are not the same creature </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have an infant,</v>

279
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:24.873
<v Speaker 1>not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're way more vulnerable and it's </v>

280
00:14:26.621 --> 00:14:30.670
<v Speaker 1>partly because you have to express their</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability of the infant and you also</v>

281
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:32.410
<v Speaker 1>have to care for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

282
00:14:32.411 --> 00:14:35.740
<v Speaker 1>So you think about an infant especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>under nine months,</v>

283
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.693
<v Speaker 1>so let's say how are you going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>wired up if you're going to optimally </v>

284
00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:43.120
<v Speaker 1>care for an infant under nine months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm saying under nine months because</v>

285
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:44.283
<v Speaker 1>women generally do the bulk of childcare</v>
<v Speaker 1>for infants who are under nine months </v>

286
00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:50.140
<v Speaker 1>old and part of the reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole host of reasons,</v>

287
00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:52.760
<v Speaker 1>but part of the reasons for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously is that they breastfeed,</v>

288
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.133
<v Speaker 1>but imagine what you need to be wired up</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically in order to care for an </v>

289
00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:57.080
<v Speaker 1>infant.</v>

290
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.840
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very demanding,</v>

291
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.333
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're completely helpless and </v>

292
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:06.050
<v Speaker 1>they're demanding 24 hours a day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite.</v>

293
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:07.603
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite an emotional load and an </v>

294
00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 1>infant under nine months is never wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

295
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.790
<v Speaker 1>What you do to an infant under nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>months is when they're in distress,</v>

296
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.330
<v Speaker 1>you always respond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never tell the infant,</v>

297
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 1>get your act together and stop whining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

298
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.103
<v Speaker 1>Which you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say to an end to a child that's 18 </v>

299
00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:26.864
<v Speaker 1>months old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can start having that sort of </v>

300
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:28.754
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but under nine months it's like nothing </v>

301
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:31.544
<v Speaker 1>is the infant's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's surrounded in an extraordinarily </v>

302
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:35.624
<v Speaker 1>threatening world and you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsive to what it needs regardless </v>

303
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:39.584
<v Speaker 1>of what you want and you have to be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive to the threats that emerge in </v>

304
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:43.094
<v Speaker 1>the environment and so I think the price</v>
<v Speaker 1>that women pay for that ability to have </v>

305
00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:47.894
<v Speaker 1>an intimate relationship with infants in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very earliest stages of development </v>

306
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.034
<v Speaker 1>is that their nervous systems are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually wired so that they can perform </v>

307
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 1>that role optimally.</v>

308
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.793
<v Speaker 1>And the disadvantage to that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a temperament like that doesn't </v>

309
00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:03.500
<v Speaker 1>work that well when you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult men,</v>

310
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.663
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're dealing with them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in a business environment because </v>

311
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:08.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

312
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a competitive environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

313
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:11.624
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so agreeable people are compassionate </v>

314
00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:15.110
<v Speaker 1>and polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are disagreeable people like?</v>

315
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.900
<v Speaker 1>They're tough minded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're blunt,</v>

316
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.943
<v Speaker 1>they're competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they won't do a damn thing they </v>

317
00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:23.630
<v Speaker 1>don't want to do so it isn't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're aggressive,</v>

318
00:16:23.631 --> 00:16:24.464
<v Speaker 1>although they will push you the hell out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their way if you're in the way </v>

319
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:27.644
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not like volatile like you are </v>

320
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:33.440
<v Speaker 1>if you're high in neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't defensive aggression.</v>

321
00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:36.860
<v Speaker 1>It's more like predatory aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dominance behavior.</v>

322
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.320
<v Speaker 1>And so for someone who's high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's high,</v>

323
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.453
<v Speaker 1>highly disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at the world as a place in </v>

324
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:45.170
<v Speaker 1>which they can compete and win.</v>

325
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.480
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend.</v>

326
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I gave him my personality test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Big Five aspects scale that Colin de</v>

327
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:57.220
<v Speaker 1>young developed in my lab and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew he was a disagreeable guy.</v>

328
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.000
<v Speaker 1>And by interacting with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

329
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's even rude to people sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously on the street.</v>

330
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I actually liked them quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very,</v>

331
00:17:05.011 --> 00:17:05.844
<v Speaker 1>very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also very conscientious so you can </v>

332
00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 1>trust it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's disagreeable as hell.</v>

333
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:10.663
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I gave him this test because I </v>

334
00:17:12.291 --> 00:17:13.124
<v Speaker 1>thought it would be funny and he came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out as the most disagreeable person in </v>

335
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:16.784
<v Speaker 1>10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so reasonably reasonable and </v>

336
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.840
<v Speaker 1>compassionate 30th percentile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like point zero,</v>

337
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:25.190
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in politeness,</v>

338
00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:28.610
<v Speaker 1>so he's extraordinarily blunt and he'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>just say absolutely anything,</v>

339
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:29.444
<v Speaker 1>no matter how horrible it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was often brought into </v>

340
00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:32.654
<v Speaker 1>corporations to sort of clean them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if a corporation was tilting and not </v>

341
00:17:35.841 --> 00:17:36.674
<v Speaker 1>doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bring him into find out how the </v>

342
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:39.950
<v Speaker 1>useless people were in fire them.</v>

343
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.083
<v Speaker 1>And I talked to them about that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had the opportunity to have to not </v>

344
00:17:44.811 --> 00:17:46.790
<v Speaker 1>have graduate students in my lab for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

345
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:48.440
<v Speaker 1>that weren't performing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I find it very,</v>

346
00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 1>very difficult dress someone down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly difficult to fire them.</v>

347
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:54.750
<v Speaker 1>I just hate it because I'm actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite agreeable person,</v>

348
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:58.080
<v Speaker 1>much to my chagrin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I asked him about that and I said,</v>

349
00:17:58.081 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

350
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.530
<v Speaker 1>You have to fire people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you handle that?</v>

351
00:18:01.531 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handle it.</v>

352
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

353
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so interesting that someone would</v>

354
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:07.890
<v Speaker 1>have that response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

355
00:18:07.891 --> 00:18:09.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean you enjoy it?</v>

356
00:18:09.181 --> 00:18:09.751
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

357
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I go into these companies and I analyze </v>
<v Speaker 1>the performance of groups of people.</v>

358
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:14.933
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's in those groups or people </v>

359
00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:16.794
<v Speaker 1>who are really striving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really trying hard and working </v>

360
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.910
<v Speaker 1>themselves really hard and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>

361
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.460
<v Speaker 1>And then there's these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just doing nothing.</v>

362
00:18:23.461 --> 00:18:25.800
<v Speaker 1>They're completely in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't carry their weight at all.</v>

363
00:18:25.801 --> 00:18:27.720
<v Speaker 1>They take advantage every chance they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

364
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.000
<v Speaker 1>And they're always whining about why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't work.</v>

365
00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:30.834
<v Speaker 1>It's like I find out who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called them into my office and I tell </v>

366
00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:36.000
<v Speaker 1>them exactly what they've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like hit the road buddy.</v>

367
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.970
<v Speaker 1>You've had your had your run of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

368
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

369
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.450
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

370
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you,</v>

371
00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:43.674
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had situations in my lab where I </v>

372
00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:45.744
<v Speaker 1>had underperforming graduate students </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that was really </v>

373
00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:49.674
<v Speaker 1>awful about that was that it was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard on the high performing graduate </v>

374
00:18:52.321 --> 00:18:53.240
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

375
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.293
<v Speaker 1>because they felt that even being in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same category as the people who weren't </v>

376
00:18:57.871 --> 00:19:01.260
<v Speaker 1>working hard and pulling their weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>devalued what they were doing,</v>

377
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:01.950
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

378
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is also why there's,</v>

379
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:08.550
<v Speaker 1>there's a conscientiousness trait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness trait.</v>

380
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Conscientious people judge you on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments,</v>

381
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.223
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a damn about your </v>

382
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:15.270
<v Speaker 1>feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a bit.</v>

383
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like are you doing the work or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas agreeable people think,</v>

384
00:19:18.931 --> 00:19:19.764
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

385
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.480
<v Speaker 1>your mother is sick and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

386
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.460
<v Speaker 1>you've got a bunch of family problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

387
00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:24.443
<v Speaker 1>and we all have to take care of each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and it's no wonder that you're </v>

388
00:19:26.761 --> 00:19:27.594
<v Speaker 1>having a rough time and like you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that one of those attitudes is </v>

389
00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:31.434
<v Speaker 1>correct and the other isn't correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that there wouldn't be </v>

390
00:19:34.351 --> 00:19:37.530
<v Speaker 1>those two dimensions if there wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>something correct about both of them,</v>

391
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.770
<v Speaker 1>but you can certainly point out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>often they conflict,</v>

392
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the demand for for inclusiveness </v>

393
00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:48.270
<v Speaker 1>and unity and care and the demand for </v>
<v Speaker 1>high level performance in a hierarchical</v>

394
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.090
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

395
00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:49.923
<v Speaker 1>They're very different orientations in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and so it's complicated for </v>

396
00:19:53.971 --> 00:19:58.950
<v Speaker 1>people who are agreeable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious and actually I think often</v>

397
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.113
<v Speaker 1>that large corporations and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large institutions of any sort run on </v>

398
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:05.754
<v Speaker 1>the unheralded labor of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>high in agreeableness and high in </v>

399
00:20:09.091 --> 00:20:09.924
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're disproportionately women and my </v>

400
00:20:12.151 --> 00:20:15.840
<v Speaker 1>experience in large institutions has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been that if you want to hire someone to</v>

401
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:18.510
<v Speaker 1>exploit appropriately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

402
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.403
<v Speaker 1>not appropriately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to hire someone to exploit </v>

403
00:20:21.301 --> 00:20:22.134
<v Speaker 1>productively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you higher middle aged women who are </v>

404
00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 1>hyper conscientious and who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable because they'll do everything.</v>

405
00:20:28.021 --> 00:20:28.854
<v Speaker 1>They won't take credit for it and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't complain and that's nasty and I </v>

406
00:20:32.221 --> 00:20:33.054
<v Speaker 1>think that happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you have to be </v>

407
00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:35.664
<v Speaker 1>careful of if you're agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not to be exploited because you'll </v>

408
00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:39.834
<v Speaker 1>lie not to be exploited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is </v>

409
00:20:41.971 --> 00:20:44.550
<v Speaker 1>because you're wired to be exploited by </v>
<v Speaker 1>infants.</v>

410
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.970
<v Speaker 1>And so that just doesn't work so well in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual world.</v>

411
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:49.804
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens very </v>

412
00:20:51.191 --> 00:20:52.540
<v Speaker 1>often in psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

413
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:54.730
<v Speaker 1>people come to psychotherapy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple reasons,</v>

414
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.640
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is they often come </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're too agreeable.</v>

415
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.820
<v Speaker 1>And so what they get is so called </v>
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness training.</v>

416
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Although it's not exactly assertiveness </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's being trained.</v>

417
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.940
<v Speaker 1>What it is is the ability to learn how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to negotiate on your own behalf.</v>

418
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.250
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I tell agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

419
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is</v>

420
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.173
<v Speaker 1>say what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth about what you think </v>

421
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.400
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be things you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you think are nasty and harsh,</v>

422
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 1>and they probably are nasty and harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also probably true.</v>

423
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.140
<v Speaker 1>And you need to bring those up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forefront and deliver the message.</v>

424
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:26.974
<v Speaker 1>And it's not straightforward at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>because agreeable people do not like </v>

425
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.230
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

426
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.840
<v Speaker 1>They smoothed the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you can see,</v>

427
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:35.703
<v Speaker 1>you can see why that is in accordance </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the hypothesis that I'd been </v>

428
00:21:38.321 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Speaker 1>putting forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want conflict around infants.</v>

429
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.200
<v Speaker 1>It's too damn dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want fights to break out.</v>

430
00:21:44.201 --> 00:21:48.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't want anything to disturb the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relative peace you know,</v>

431
00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:52.840
<v Speaker 1>and if you're also more prone to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt physically and perhaps emotionally,</v>

432
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:53.883
<v Speaker 1>you also may be loath to engage in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of high intensity conflict that </v>

433
00:21:56.861 --> 00:22:00.160
<v Speaker 1>will solve problems in the short term </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the law to conflict,</v>

434
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:01.503
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is solve problems in the short term and </v>

435
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.460
<v Speaker 1>you know if that can spiral up to where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous,</v>

436
00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:08.350
<v Speaker 1>which it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it gets uncontrolled,</v>

437
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.393
<v Speaker 1>it might be safer in the short term to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the waters smooth and to not delve </v>

438
00:22:13.871 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 1>into those situations where conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges.</v>

439
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.120
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is it's not a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>good medium to longterm strategy,</v>

440
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:19.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

441
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.553
<v Speaker 1>Because lots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of times there are things you have </v>

442
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:22.803
<v Speaker 1>to talk about because they're not gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>go away and so partly what you do with </v>

443
00:22:27.221 --> 00:22:28.054
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people as you get them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out and they have a hard time </v>

444
00:22:30.221 --> 00:22:31.054
<v Speaker 1>with this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ask a disagreeable person what </v>

445
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.440
<v Speaker 1>what he wants say or she wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you right away,</v>

446
00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:36.493
<v Speaker 1>they know it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I want and this is how I'm </v>

447
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.730
<v Speaker 1>to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an agreeable people,</v>

448
00:22:39.731 --> 00:22:40.564
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're really agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so agreeable that they often don't </v>

449
00:22:42.911 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 1>even know what they want because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>so accustomed to living for other people</v>

450
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.333
<v Speaker 1>and to finding out what other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>want and to try and make them </v>

451
00:22:50.141 --> 00:22:50.974
<v Speaker 1>comfortable and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it's harder for them to find a </v>

452
00:22:53.321 --> 00:22:56.410
<v Speaker 1>sense of their own desires as they move </v>
<v Speaker 1>through life.</v>

453
00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.573
<v Speaker 1>And that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's situations where that's </v>

454
00:23:00.251 --> 00:23:01.084
<v Speaker 1>advantageous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly not advantageous if </v>

455
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:03.934
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forged yourself a career that just </v>

456
00:23:07.121 --> 00:23:09.040
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

457
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.433
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else do I want to tell you about </v>

458
00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:16.360
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

459
00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I could tell you a little bit about the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The regulation of aggression when one of</v>

460
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:23.380
<v Speaker 1>the things I studied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when I was in Montreal,</v>

461
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:28.381
<v Speaker 1>was the development of antisocial </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior in children and in and in a and</v>

462
00:23:28.871 --> 00:23:32.740
<v Speaker 1>in adolescence and antisocial children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they tend to be aggressive,</v>

463
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>antisocial children tend to turn into </v>
<v Speaker 1>antisocial conduct disorder.</v>

464
00:23:37.721 --> 00:23:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct disordered children tend to turn</v>

465
00:23:40.331 --> 00:23:41.164
<v Speaker 1>into conduct disordered adolescents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they tend to turn into antisocial </v>

466
00:23:43.811 --> 00:23:47.090
<v Speaker 1>and criminal adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I can tell you a little bit about</v>

467
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:47.924
<v Speaker 1>how that progresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because it's quite interesting </v>

468
00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:50.990
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't what people generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

469
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing is if you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal,</v>

470
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:55.364
<v Speaker 1>the best way to do it is to be really </v>
<v Speaker 1>low in agreeableness and really low in </v>

471
00:23:57.351 --> 00:23:58.220
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

472
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Low in agreeableness means things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me and not for you,</v>

473
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:03.703
<v Speaker 1>and you're not going to get me to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn thing that I don't want to do and </v>

474
00:24:05.721 --> 00:24:06.554
<v Speaker 1>I'll stand my ground and low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness means you can do all </v>

475
00:24:09.471 --> 00:24:11.660
<v Speaker 1>the work and all sit back and take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits.</v>

476
00:24:11.661 --> 00:24:16.640
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have someone who's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable and really unconscientious,</v>

477
00:24:16.641 --> 00:24:19.100
<v Speaker 1>you have someone who's starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>border on psychopath,</v>

478
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.760
<v Speaker 1>and if you add high intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>high emotional stability to that,</v>

479
00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 1>then you have someone who won't work but</v>
<v Speaker 1>will reap the benefits.</v>

480
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:26.744
<v Speaker 1>Who doesn't give a damn about you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is assertive as Helen who's smart </v>

481
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:30.763
<v Speaker 1>and a person like that's also going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be charismatic because extroverted </v>

482
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.980
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable people are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic but there.</v>

483
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.053
<v Speaker 1>But they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll put themselves forward strongly </v>

484
00:24:39.531 --> 00:24:41.180
<v Speaker 1>and if they don't show any signs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>

485
00:24:41.181 --> 00:24:42.014
<v Speaker 1>that also indicates that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>confident and it's easy for people to </v>

486
00:24:44.211 --> 00:24:45.680
<v Speaker 1>confuse that with competence.</v>

487
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's how psychopaths get away with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing.</v>

488
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Although they have to move from person </v>
<v Speaker 1>to person because their religion,</v>

489
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:54.740
<v Speaker 1>their reputation will track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

490
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:55.813
<v Speaker 1>back to the development of aggression in</v>
<v Speaker 1>children in the development of </v>

491
00:24:58.221 --> 00:25:00.320
<v Speaker 1>criminality and adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's how it seems to work,</v>

492
00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more complicated than this,</v>

493
00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:04.970
<v Speaker 1>but I'll put in some of the sociological</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements as well.</v>

494
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.660
<v Speaker 1>So if you take children and you group </v>
<v Speaker 1>them together in age,</v>

495
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:17.830
<v Speaker 1>age eight in groups defined by age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say a 32 year olds,</v>

496
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.450
<v Speaker 1>33 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>34 year olds,</v>

497
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.770
<v Speaker 1>all the way up to 18th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you watch them interact and you</v>

498
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.550
<v Speaker 1>cold their behavior for kicking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biting,</v>

499
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.550
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and property theft.</v>

500
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Then what you'll find is that the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>year olds are by far the most aggressive</v>

501
00:25:35.391 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 1>of the lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty interesting.</v>

502
00:25:37.701 --> 00:25:38.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think,</v>

503
00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:39.434
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children are naturally peaceful and if </v>

504
00:25:41.151 --> 00:25:42.830
<v Speaker 1>they are aggressive it's because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn it.</v>

505
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

506
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:47.330
<v Speaker 1>that's true for a small minority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

507
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:48.523
<v Speaker 1>But there's a substantial number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>children who are aggressive at two by </v>

508
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are male.</v>

509
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean most children are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that because they're not.</v>

510
00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Even if you look at two year olds who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the most aggressive human beings,</v>

511
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:02.203
<v Speaker 1>most two year olds aren't aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of them are and most of those </v>

512
00:26:05.391 --> 00:26:06.500
<v Speaker 1>are male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

513
00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:07.334
<v Speaker 1>So then let's say you identify this </v>
<v Speaker 1>cohort of aggressive two year olds and </v>

514
00:26:10.701 --> 00:26:11.534
<v Speaker 1>you track them across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>track them for the next two to four </v>

515
00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:17.240
<v Speaker 1>years or the next track them until </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're four years old.</v>

516
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:22.810
<v Speaker 1>What you find is the vast majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hyper aggressive male till year olds</v>

517
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.770
<v Speaker 1>get socialized perfectly well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the time they're four,</v>

518
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.630
<v Speaker 1>they're temperamentally probably still </v>
<v Speaker 1>more aggressive,</v>

519
00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:30.464
<v Speaker 1>but they've become civilized little </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters so other people can tolerate </v>

520
00:26:32.721 --> 00:26:33.554
<v Speaker 1>them and that means that they've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents or peers or educational </v>

521
00:26:37.191 --> 00:26:38.024
<v Speaker 1>experiences that enabled them to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to interact productively with other </v>

522
00:26:41.121 --> 00:26:43.680
<v Speaker 1>kids and to bring their aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature under control.</v>

523
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.753
<v Speaker 1>Some of that seems to be mediated by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to engage in rough and </v>

524
00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:51.870
<v Speaker 1>tumble play and that's one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we know that that helps socialize.</v>

525
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

526
00:26:52.891 --> 00:26:53.724
<v Speaker 1>It's vital to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also seems to really be good for </v>

527
00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:59.190
<v Speaker 1>socializing young kids and rough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tumble play,</v>

528
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:02.580
<v Speaker 1>which is something that adult males </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly like to do with young kids.</v>

529
00:27:02.581 --> 00:27:03.414
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not not before nine months because </v>

530
00:27:05.221 --> 00:27:06.054
<v Speaker 1>they're just too little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once they become ambulatory and you </v>

531
00:27:08.391 --> 00:27:09.700
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of poppy like,</v>

532
00:27:09.701 --> 00:27:10.534
<v Speaker 1>so that they're a little bit more robust</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you can play a lot with them and </v>

533
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you can play with them right at the edge</v>
<v Speaker 1>of danger to which kids.</v>

534
00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They absolutely go nuts for that.</v>

535
00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:20.330
<v Speaker 1>They love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

536
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.293
<v Speaker 1>when I had little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made this kind of wrestling ring out </v>

537
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:23.814
<v Speaker 1>of these two couches that we had that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would hook together and I'd bring them </v>

538
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:29.220
<v Speaker 1>on there and toss them up in the air and</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch them,</v>

539
00:27:29.221 --> 00:27:29.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

540
00:27:29.851 --> 00:27:30.684
<v Speaker 1>10 feet.</v>

541
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.823
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

542
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.653
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

543
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.630
<v Speaker 1>A foot in the air and catch them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they go like this and then,</v>

544
00:27:36.631 --> 00:27:37.464
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I catch them and they'd laugh and I'd </v>

545
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.430
<v Speaker 1>throw them up and they're all freaked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and then they'd laugh and you know,</v>

546
00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:44.220
<v Speaker 1>so they're learning trust with that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>an embodied way.</v>

547
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.340
<v Speaker 1>And they're also learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is from stretching them out and</v>

548
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:48.174
<v Speaker 1>wrestling them and twisting them around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and letting them pull on your hair and </v>

549
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:51.750
<v Speaker 1>hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of those things,</v>

550
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.823
<v Speaker 1>they learn deep in their bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what can hurt them and what </v>

551
00:27:55.831 --> 00:27:56.664
<v Speaker 1>doesn't in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to kind of push them to the </v>

552
00:27:57.721 --> 00:27:58.554
<v Speaker 1>edge so that they can tell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between what hurts and what </v>

553
00:28:01.331 --> 00:28:02.164
<v Speaker 1>still within the realm of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do the same thing when they're </v>

554
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:05.754
<v Speaker 1>wrestling with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they learn not to awkwardly stick </v>

555
00:28:07.711 --> 00:28:09.510
<v Speaker 1>their thumb in your eye or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

556
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.820
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do things that are actually painful.</v>

557
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Like grab your lip and pull it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:14.041
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

559
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:16.620
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let go of my lip,</v>

560
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.513
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems to help regulate the </v>

561
00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:20.754
<v Speaker 1>aggressive impulses in and help the </v>
<v Speaker 1>church child find a more appropriate </v>

562
00:28:24.571 --> 00:28:25.404
<v Speaker 1>embodiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could think that what you're doing </v>

563
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:27.084
<v Speaker 1>in some sense when you're rough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tumble playing with kids is teaching </v>

564
00:28:29.131 --> 00:28:31.470
<v Speaker 1>them how to dance because that is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

565
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.693
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making them comfortable in their </v>

566
00:28:33.811 --> 00:28:34.644
<v Speaker 1>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all of its extension and building in </v>

567
00:28:36.871 --> 00:28:37.704
<v Speaker 1>that kind of body fluency that you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>in people who are well situated inside </v>

568
00:28:41.101 --> 00:28:41.934
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's something to really think </v>

569
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:43.911
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

570
00:28:43.911 --> 00:28:45.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's appalling.</v>

571
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.193
<v Speaker 1>We know that the ability to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play among rats </v>

572
00:28:48.721 --> 00:28:50.130
<v Speaker 1>inhibits aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>

573
00:28:50.131 --> 00:28:53.810
<v Speaker 1>aggressive aggression among rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also know that if you deprive rats,</v>

574
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:57.210
<v Speaker 1>have the ability to have the opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to engage in rough and tumble play,</v>

575
00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.273
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they show prefrontal cortical </v>

576
00:28:59.281 --> 00:29:00.114
<v Speaker 1>developmental deficits and manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors that are akin to attention </v>

577
00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:05.340
<v Speaker 1>deficit disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can then treat with Ritalin.</v>

578
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:06.563
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening with boys because they're way </v>

579
00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:12.240
<v Speaker 1>more dosed with attention deficit </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder medication than girls,</v>

580
00:29:12.241 --> 00:29:17.241
<v Speaker 1>is that there are natural proclivity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in robust and troublesome.</v>

581
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.413
<v Speaker 1>Active play isn't appropriate for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>school environment where you're just </v>

582
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:22.494
<v Speaker 1>supposed to sit down and shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the kids get hyperactive and </v>

583
00:29:25.471 --> 00:29:26.304
<v Speaker 1>instead of letting them out to run </v>
<v Speaker 1>around until they fall over half </v>

584
00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:30.390
<v Speaker 1>exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you should do,</v>

585
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you medicate them.</v>

586
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.500
<v Speaker 1>So that are exploratory systems which </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

587
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.823
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

588
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.430
<v Speaker 1>the activity of which is facilitated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

589
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:42.280
<v Speaker 1>by the dual pub anergic agonist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the adhd medication,</v>

590
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.300
<v Speaker 1>suppresses the play function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely appalling.</v>

591
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.210
<v Speaker 1>There's no excuse for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:29:48.211 --> 00:29:48.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

593
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.413
<v Speaker 1>it's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good indictment of the education </v>

594
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:51.934
<v Speaker 1>system because why in the world would </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take six year old kids and get them </v>

595
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:55.924
<v Speaker 1>to sit without moving for five hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you want them to grow up fat and </v>

596
00:29:59.261 --> 00:30:00.070
<v Speaker 1>stupid?</v>

597
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Why in the world would you train them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that?</v>

598
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier.</v>

599
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.750
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

600
00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:05.873
<v Speaker 1>and when they're sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing disruptive about the </v>

601
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:09.550
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play and that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite,</v>

602
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play can be quite disruptive.</v>

603
00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.513
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of these kids are reasonably well </v>

604
00:30:14.801 --> 00:30:17.500
<v Speaker 1>socialized by the time they're the age </v>
<v Speaker 1>of four music,</v>

605
00:30:17.501 --> 00:30:18.334
<v Speaker 1>one mechanism or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they learn how to regulate their </v>

606
00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:21.304
<v Speaker 1>aggression and they learn how to engage </v>
<v Speaker 1>in fictional play structures with other </v>

607
00:30:23.951 --> 00:30:24.784
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They learn how to cooperate and compete </v>

608
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.063
<v Speaker 1>and the advantage to having a well </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialized disagreeable person is that </v>

609
00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.380
<v Speaker 1>they really don't let much get in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

610
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.500
<v Speaker 1>So if you can get a kid who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable,</v>

611
00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:36.334
<v Speaker 1>socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person can be quite quite the </v>

612
00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:38.681
<v Speaker 1>creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

613
00:30:38.681 --> 00:30:39.514
<v Speaker 1>because they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very forward moving in their </v>

614
00:30:41.681 --> 00:30:43.480
<v Speaker 1>nature and very difficult to stop.</v>

615
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.020
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't get them successfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>domesticated,</v>

616
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.740
<v Speaker 1>tamed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking by the time they're for</v>

617
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.870
<v Speaker 1>their peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reject them,</v>

618
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:54.423
<v Speaker 1>and that's a big problem because your </v>
<v Speaker 1>job as a parent is to make your child </v>

619
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:01.340
<v Speaker 1>socially desirable by the age of four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

620
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.253
<v Speaker 1>You want to burn that into your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people don't know that that's </v>

621
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:07.090
<v Speaker 1>your job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's,</v>

622
00:31:07.091 --> 00:31:08.950
<v Speaker 1>here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think it's easy,</v>

623
00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:12.250
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you imagine you've got a.</v>

624
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.143
<v Speaker 1>you've got a three year old child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's sort of halfway through that </v>

625
00:31:14.921 --> 00:31:18.490
<v Speaker 1>initial period of socialization and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take that child out in public,</v>

626
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.220
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want for the Child?</v>

627
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares about you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from the child,</v>

628
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.513
<v Speaker 1>for the Child?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want the child to be able to </v>

629
00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:27.124
<v Speaker 1>interact with other children and adults </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the children are welcoming and </v>

630
00:31:31.241 --> 00:31:33.490
<v Speaker 1>smile and wanting to play with him or </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

631
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.780
<v Speaker 1>And so the adults are happy to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child and treat him or her properly,</v>

632
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:39.003
<v Speaker 1>and if your child's a horrible little </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster because you're afraid of </v>

633
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:43.300
<v Speaker 1>disciplining them or you don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that properly,</v>

634
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.433
<v Speaker 1>then what they're going to do is they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to experience nothing but </v>

635
00:31:47.111 --> 00:31:51.340
<v Speaker 1>rejection from other children and false </v>
<v Speaker 1>smiles from other parents and adults.</v>

636
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're throwing the child out there</v>

637
00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:58.600
<v Speaker 1>into a world where every single face </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they see is either hostile or lying</v>

638
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.093
<v Speaker 1>and that's not something that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be particularly conducive to the mental </v>

639
00:32:02.471 --> 00:32:03.304
<v Speaker 1>health or the wellbeing of your child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your child can learn a couple simple </v>

640
00:32:06.161 --> 00:32:09.520
<v Speaker 1>rules of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like don't interrupt adults when they're</v>

641
00:32:09.521 --> 00:32:10.354
<v Speaker 1>talking too much and pay attention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>try not to hit the other kids over the </v>

642
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:16.870
<v Speaker 1>head with the truck anymore than is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely necessary then and you know,</v>

643
00:32:16.871 --> 00:32:18.520
<v Speaker 1>and share and play properly.</v>

644
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.353
<v Speaker 1>Then when they meet other kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids are going to try out a few </v>

645
00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:22.624
<v Speaker 1>little play routines on them and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go well and then they're going </v>

646
00:32:24.331 --> 00:32:25.164
<v Speaker 1>to go off and socialize each other for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of their lives because that's </v>

647
00:32:28.481 --> 00:32:31.150
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that from four years old</v>
<v Speaker 1>onwards,</v>

648
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.253
<v Speaker 1>the primary socialization with children </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes place among other children and so </v>

649
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:36.874
<v Speaker 1>if the kids don't get in on that early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't move into that developmental </v>

650
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:44.330
<v Speaker 1>spiral upwards and they're left behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can imagine how terrible that is</v>

651
00:32:44.331 --> 00:32:48.370
<v Speaker 1>because a four year old will not play </v>
<v Speaker 1>with another four year old who's too,</v>

652
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.383
<v Speaker 1>but a five year old certainly will not </v>
<v Speaker 1>play with a five year old who's too </v>

653
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:54.343
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the gap is just starting to get </v>

654
00:32:55.251 --> 00:33:00.251
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably large and so the kids start</v>
<v Speaker 1>out behind and then the peers leave that</v>

655
00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:01.244
<v Speaker 1>behind and then those kids are alienated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and outside the Peer Group for the rest </v>

656
00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:05.624
<v Speaker 1>of their life.</v>

657
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Those are the ones that grow up to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm antisocial,</v>

658
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're already aggressive.</v>

659
00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.480
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't dip down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens to normal boys,</v>

660
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.433
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine the aggressive two-year-old </v>

661
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.943
<v Speaker 1>types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets socialized so their level of </v>

662
00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:21.464
<v Speaker 1>aggression goes down and then they hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>puberty and testosterone kicks in and </v>

663
00:33:24.171 --> 00:33:26.390
<v Speaker 1>bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of aggression go back up,</v>

664
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:30.560
<v Speaker 1>and so that's why males are criminals </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the ages roughly of 16 and about</v>

665
00:33:30.561 --> 00:33:33.560
<v Speaker 1>25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it matches the creativity curve,</v>

666
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.730
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so cool.</v>

667
00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:37.430
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the spike of creativity </v>
<v Speaker 1>among men,</v>

668
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:38.264
<v Speaker 1>16 to 25 and it starts to go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminality matches that absolutely </v>

669
00:33:42.111 --> 00:33:43.880
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite cool.</v>

670
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.193
<v Speaker 1>So and part of so the testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels raise the average level of </v>

671
00:33:49.521 --> 00:33:52.010
<v Speaker 1>aggression among men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more dominance than aggression.</v>

672
00:33:52.011 --> 00:33:52.844
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone is by no means all bad and </v>

673
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:57.680
<v Speaker 1>then it starts to decrease at about age </v>
<v Speaker 1>25 or 26,</v>

674
00:33:57.681 --> 00:33:58.700
<v Speaker 1>which is usually with men.</v>

675
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Stop staying up late at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped drinking as much,</v>

676
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.213
<v Speaker 1>develop a full time career and take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the burdens and responsibilities and </v>

677
00:34:07.671 --> 00:34:10.430
<v Speaker 1>opportunities that are associated with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm partner and family.</v>

678
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:13.640
<v Speaker 1>And so while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

679
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:16.190
<v Speaker 1>that's the development of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

680
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:18.043
<v Speaker 1>of what would I would I would call </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory aggression because I also </v>

681
00:34:20.241 --> 00:34:21.074
<v Speaker 1>think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the agreeableness distribution is </v>

682
00:34:23.331 --> 00:34:27.650
<v Speaker 1>probably something like predatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression versus maternal sympathy.</v>

683
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.450
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at other,</v>

684
00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.170
<v Speaker 1>if you look at other mammals that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are predators,</v>

685
00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:35.090
<v Speaker 1>because we're predators as well as prey </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

686
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.193
<v Speaker 1>If you look at other animals like bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the male bear has absolutely nothing to </v>

687
00:34:39.471 --> 00:34:41.210
<v Speaker 1>do with the raising of the infants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

688
00:34:41.211 --> 00:34:42.044
<v Speaker 1>the female bears will keep the mail the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell away because he's likely to kill </v>

689
00:34:44.631 --> 00:34:45.464
<v Speaker 1>the infants and maybe even to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no matter analogy at all in </v>

690
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:54.650
<v Speaker 1>solitary male mammalian predators.</v>

691
00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Now it depends on how social they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but roughly speaking,</v>

692
00:34:57.711 --> 00:35:00.380
<v Speaker 1>that's the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with human beings,</v>

693
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.720
<v Speaker 1>males are quite maternal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

694
00:35:02.721 --> 00:35:03.920
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

695
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:05.083
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extreme of agreeableness on the low </v>

696
00:35:08.361 --> 00:35:11.420
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so disagreeableness is predation and the</v>

697
00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:13.940
<v Speaker 1>extreme on the upper end is maternal </v>
<v Speaker 1>caring.</v>

698
00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.670
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those two things compete,</v>

699
00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:19.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's very difficult to be both</v>

700
00:35:19.551 --> 00:35:21.800
<v Speaker 1>of those at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so men,</v>

701
00:35:21.801 --> 00:35:23.300
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wild,</v>

702
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.220
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very,</v>

703
00:35:25.221 --> 00:35:26.054
<v Speaker 1>very few women hunt in modern societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>or an or an archaic societies and you </v>

704
00:35:30.291 --> 00:35:31.124
<v Speaker 1>can also understand why that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting actually requires hurting </v>

705
00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:35.480
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing it,</v>

706
00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:36.853
<v Speaker 1>and it's usually something that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>very impressed about being hurt or </v>

707
00:35:38.851 --> 00:35:41.670
<v Speaker 1>killed in that will emit a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>distress while it's happening.</v>

708
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And so for anybody who's compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

709
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.070
<v Speaker 1>who's got compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

710
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.970
<v Speaker 1>one of the fundamental elements of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>

711
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 1>that's something they're just not going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to tolerate at all.</v>

712
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:52.890
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

713
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:55.770
<v Speaker 1>in the evolutionary landscape because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what we're talking about.</v>

714
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:56.843
<v Speaker 1>There's tension behind the development </v>
<v Speaker 1>of different modes of being in the </v>

715
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:01.350
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're good at one thing,</v>

716
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:02.184
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes means that you can't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at the other thing at the same </v>

717
00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:05.724
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was going to have a guest speaker </v>

718
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:12.840
<v Speaker 1>for you last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the person I had invited in had some</v>

719
00:36:12.841 --> 00:36:14.550
<v Speaker 1>familial troubles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that didn't work out.</v>

720
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:18.240
<v Speaker 1>But she's a graduate student of mine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we'd been working</v>

721
00:36:18.241 --> 00:36:20.700
<v Speaker 1>on in my lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

722
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:25.710
<v Speaker 1>is the delineation of the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between personality traits and political</v>

723
00:36:25.711 --> 00:36:26.544
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until I've told you a little bit about </v>

724
00:36:28.171 --> 00:36:30.300
<v Speaker 1>the things that distinguished liberals </v>
<v Speaker 1>from conservatives,</v>

725
00:36:30.301 --> 00:36:31.134
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Conservatives are high in </v>

726
00:36:32.011 --> 00:36:32.844
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially orderliness and low in trait </v>

727
00:36:35.911 --> 00:36:38.750
<v Speaker 1>openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means a conservative,</v>

728
00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:43.590
<v Speaker 1>someone who puts things in boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts the boxes in order and doesn't like</v>

729
00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:44.760
<v Speaker 1>them to be messed up.</v>

730
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they liked the borders between things</v>

731
00:36:47.431 --> 00:36:50.400
<v Speaker 1>to remain determinant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

732
00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.260
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

733
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:53.183
<v Speaker 1>what would you say an inviolable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's true at every level </v>

734
00:36:56.461 --> 00:36:58.590
<v Speaker 1>from the conceptual all the way up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the political.</v>

735
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I think that the fundamental political </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

736
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:06.090
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is why the temperaments</v>
<v Speaker 1>align across these political dimensions,</v>

737
00:37:06.091 --> 00:37:08.670
<v Speaker 1>is whether the borders between things </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be open or closed.</v>

738
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.103
<v Speaker 1>You see this reflected it worldwide </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now in the arguments about </v>

739
00:37:12.601 --> 00:37:13.434
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

740
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.823
<v Speaker 1>Because the liberal types of saying open</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gates and the Conservatives are </v>

741
00:37:17.521 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

742
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what you're inviting in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

743
00:37:21.241 --> 00:37:22.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's right?</v>

744
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.070
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

745
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.460
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes the right answer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>open the gates.</v>

746
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:31.410
<v Speaker 1>These are interesting people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could trade with them,</v>

747
00:37:31.411 --> 00:37:32.244
<v Speaker 1>we could learn from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes the answer is don't </v>

748
00:37:34.801 --> 00:37:35.280
<v Speaker 1>bother.</v>

749
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.730
<v Speaker 1>What's going to come in is going to wipe</v>
<v Speaker 1>you out and kill you and really do it.</v>

750
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:39.623
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's an example dot why I think </v>

751
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.420
<v Speaker 1>orderliness is associated with disgust </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity,</v>

752
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.020
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of the determining factors </v>
<v Speaker 1>of conservative political belief.</v>

753
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:51.630
<v Speaker 1>What happened when the Europeans came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>North America?</v>

754
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.120
<v Speaker 1>What happened when the Spaniards came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>North America?</v>

755
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Ninety five percent of the native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans died.</v>

756
00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the Spaniards brought illness,</v>

757
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.990
<v Speaker 1>smallpox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>measles,</v>

758
00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:05.483
<v Speaker 1>chicken pox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these things that the native </v>

759
00:38:06.991 --> 00:38:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Americans had absolutely no resistance </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

760
00:38:08.881 --> 00:38:12.090
<v Speaker 1>There were hardly any diseases at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In north and South America,</v>

761
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:15.180
<v Speaker 1>the Spaniards showed up within 50 to 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

762
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen out of 20 of the native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans were dead.</v>

763
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.480
<v Speaker 1>You never know what people are bringing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

764
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:22.853
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that how </v>
<v Speaker 1>should you respond to people who are </v>

765
00:38:26.491 --> 00:38:31.080
<v Speaker 1>outside of your circle of familiarity or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is one,</v>

766
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.560
<v Speaker 1>they might kill you in all sorts of ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

767
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.380
<v Speaker 1>they might bring with them things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade their of inestimable value.</v>

768
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:40.240
<v Speaker 1>So you're stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

769
00:38:40.241 --> 00:38:42.520
<v Speaker 1>how the hell are you going to reconcile </v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem?</v>

770
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:43.720
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

771
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:46.000
<v Speaker 1>we reconcile at temperamentally roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>

772
00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.630
<v Speaker 1>So half the people are temperamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>wired up to say,</v>

773
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.990
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

774
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's keep the damn box is closed.</v>

775
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Took a long time to pack everything in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and to get it into order.</v>

776
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.090
<v Speaker 1>And the liberals say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well wait a minute,</v>

777
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.150
<v Speaker 1>you don't know if you've got things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right boxes to begin with.</v>

778
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:02.343
<v Speaker 1>The things that you're keeping in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end are getting stale and old and maybe </v>

779
00:39:04.721 --> 00:39:08.350
<v Speaker 1>we need some new ideas and new people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenate the situation.</v>

780
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.433
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's political discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that political discussion has to </v>

781
00:39:12.941 --> 00:39:13.774
<v Speaker 1>proceed because there's no way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>solving that problem except by </v>

782
00:39:16.151 --> 00:39:20.740
<v Speaker 1>discussing it so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that relate to agreeableness?</v>

783
00:39:20.741 --> 00:39:21.574
<v Speaker 1>We also looked at political correctness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so here's an interesting thing </v>

784
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:27.220
<v Speaker 1>purely from a scientific perspective.</v>

785
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:31.420
<v Speaker 1>You might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you talk about political correctness,</v>

786
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:32.283
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be labeled as political </v>

787
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:38.650
<v Speaker 1>politically correct say is there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>such thing as political correctness.</v>

788
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.633
<v Speaker 1>It's just a pejorative label that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are impo opposed to those views </v>

789
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.103
<v Speaker 1>impose on a set of beliefs to demonize </v>
<v Speaker 1>it perfectly reasonable objection and </v>

790
00:39:48.371 --> 00:39:51.400
<v Speaker 1>you'd never know it might be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is psychometrically.</v>

791
00:39:51.401 --> 00:39:52.234
<v Speaker 1>You can solve that problem and you solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>it the same way that you solve the </v>

792
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:57.190
<v Speaker 1>problem of what constitutes human </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

793
00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:00.610
<v Speaker 1>So this is the way we tried to solve it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can think about methodologically</v>

794
00:40:00.611 --> 00:40:01.990
<v Speaker 1>because that's how you should think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

795
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:03.183
<v Speaker 1>The first thing we did was collect a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very large number of statements from </v>

796
00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:07.174
<v Speaker 1>press accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seemed to indicate what people </v>

797
00:40:09.731 --> 00:40:12.010
<v Speaker 1>generally refer to as political </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness.</v>

798
00:40:12.011 --> 00:40:12.844
<v Speaker 1>So we had a small team of people combing</v>
<v Speaker 1>media reports to come out with opinions </v>

799
00:40:17.201 --> 00:40:20.620
<v Speaker 1>or attitudes that looked like they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of the.</v>

800
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:21.603
<v Speaker 1>Of the differentiation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically correct people and people </v>

801
00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:24.364
<v Speaker 1>who aren't politically correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we've got about 400 statements like </v>

802
00:40:26.861 --> 00:40:30.280
<v Speaker 1>that and what you want to do is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that,</v>

803
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:34.600
<v Speaker 1>that there is a core set of beliefs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>statements that people are defining in a</v>

804
00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:35.434
<v Speaker 1>particular way and you're trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>a handle on what that is and even if it </v>

805
00:40:38.501 --> 00:40:40.870
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is over sample it.</v>

806
00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.193
<v Speaker 1>If you can find questions that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>even tangentially be related to the </v>

807
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:47.980
<v Speaker 1>phenomena in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

808
00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:51.160
<v Speaker 1>in question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you include those because the statistics</v>

809
00:40:51.161 --> 00:40:53.320
<v Speaker 1>will take care of the excess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

810
00:40:53.321 --> 00:40:56.410
<v Speaker 1>so then what you do is you take your 400</v>
<v Speaker 1>items roughly speaking,</v>

811
00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:57.723
<v Speaker 1>and you get people to register the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree to which they agree or disagree </v>

812
00:41:00.821 --> 00:41:01.654
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a thousand people to do that and </v>

813
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:05.650
<v Speaker 1>then you subject that to a factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

814
00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:10.270
<v Speaker 1>And what the factor analysis does is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you how those questions clump.</v>

815
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Now they might not clump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

816
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:16.210
<v Speaker 1>you could do a factor analysis of a set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of questions and you can find that there</v>

817
00:41:16.211 --> 00:41:20.350
<v Speaker 1>are 200 factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's let's say at $400.</v>

818
00:41:20.351 --> 00:41:24.790
<v Speaker 1>There's 200 factors and none of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no big set of questions that are</v>

819
00:41:24.791 --> 00:41:26.050
<v Speaker 1>clumping together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you say,</v>

820
00:41:26.051 --> 00:41:28.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence here that there is a</v>

821
00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:29.374
<v Speaker 1>single underlying phenomena that unifies</v>
<v Speaker 1>those questions that you could </v>

822
00:41:33.141 --> 00:41:37.130
<v Speaker 1>reasonably characterized with a name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that isn't what we found,</v>

823
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:40.280
<v Speaker 1>we found that there were two dimensions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of political correctness.</v>

824
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.593
<v Speaker 1>One of them looked like liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that the people who were </v>

825
00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:47.120
<v Speaker 1>politically correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to being liberal,</v>

826
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.340
<v Speaker 1>we're very high in trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness</v>

827
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:55.040
<v Speaker 1>and agreeableness has almost nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with the classic liberal conservative</v>

828
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:55.874
<v Speaker 1>divide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weakly related in that </v>

829
00:41:56.991 --> 00:41:59.960
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are more compassionate </v>
<v Speaker 1>than liberals.</v>

830
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:00.913
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberals are more compassionate than </v>

831
00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:02.624
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They difference isn't huge and </v>

832
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:08.120
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are more polite than </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals and the difference isn't huge.</v>

833
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.070
<v Speaker 1>So those are the two aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness.</v>

834
00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:12.620
<v Speaker 1>If you put them together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cancel each other out,</v>

835
00:42:12.621 --> 00:42:14.840
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Average conservatives and liberals don't</v>

836
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.793
<v Speaker 1>differ in agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but polit politically political </v>

837
00:42:18.261 --> 00:42:22.040
<v Speaker 1>correctness did clump together into two </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

838
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Pc Liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we called it and pc authoritarianism.</v>

839
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.293
<v Speaker 1>The PC liberals were high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high in verbal intelligence and high in </v>

840
00:42:30.891 --> 00:42:31.724
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second group was Pc </v>

841
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:35.383
<v Speaker 1>Authoritarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were also high in </v>

842
00:42:35.751 --> 00:42:36.584
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were high in orderliness and </v>

843
00:42:38.481 --> 00:42:41.870
<v Speaker 1>the correlation with that was negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to verbal intelligence.</v>

844
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:46.490
<v Speaker 1>So we found that there were two </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories of political correctness that</v>

845
00:42:46.491 --> 00:42:47.324
<v Speaker 1>it does in fact exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that it's a very unstable construct </v>

846
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:54.110
<v Speaker 1>because factor one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was pc liberalism and factor two,</v>

847
00:42:54.111 --> 00:42:55.550
<v Speaker 1>which was pc authoritarianism.</v>

848
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:59.180
<v Speaker 1>We're only correlated at point one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what it indicates,</v>

849
00:42:59.181 --> 00:43:01.520
<v Speaker 1>and this is our prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking from the lab,</v>

850
00:43:01.521 --> 00:43:04.040
<v Speaker 1>is to the degree that there's unity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

851
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:06.980
<v Speaker 1>on the politically correct left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll fragment into two groups.</v>

852
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.760
<v Speaker 1>One will be the PC liberals and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other will be the PC authoritarians.</v>

853
00:43:10.761 --> 00:43:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Because although they're united by their</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency to agreeableness,</v>

854
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:15.703
<v Speaker 1>they're not united by other </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperamental traits nor in their core </v>

855
00:43:17.871 --> 00:43:19.850
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the PC authoritarian types.</v>

856
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:20.684
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very obsessed with language </v>

857
00:43:21.651 --> 00:43:23.240
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

858
00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.350
<v Speaker 1>and it's funny that it's agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've really been thinking about that.</v>

859
00:43:27.351 --> 00:43:30.050
<v Speaker 1>And the what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

860
00:43:30.051 --> 00:43:33.590
<v Speaker 1>this is a hypothesis and development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think what's happening is that,</v>

861
00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:34.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

862
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.233
<v Speaker 1>your temperamental proclivity allows you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lay out a kind of radical </v>

863
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:42.300
<v Speaker 1>simplification on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the advantage of having a</v>

864
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.273
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a conscientious person in </v>

865
00:43:44.441 --> 00:43:46.130
<v Speaker 1>the world is a place to go out there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

866
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:49.070
<v Speaker 1>If you're an open person in the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place to go out there and discover new</v>

867
00:43:49.071 --> 00:43:51.980
<v Speaker 1>ideas and do artistic things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're an agreeable person,</v>

868
00:43:51.981 --> 00:43:54.810
<v Speaker 1>the world's a place to go out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>establish intimate relationships.</v>

869
00:43:54.811 --> 00:43:56.930
<v Speaker 1>And so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're simplifying</v>

870
00:43:59.080 --> 00:43:59.913
<v Speaker 1>perspectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their edit and simplifying </v>

871
00:44:01.551 --> 00:44:02.384
<v Speaker 1>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there or the manner in which </v>

872
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:07.760
<v Speaker 1>you're adapted to a particular niche.</v>

873
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:10.743
<v Speaker 1>I think what you see in agreeableness in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to political belief is a </v>

874
00:44:14.621 --> 00:44:15.454
<v Speaker 1>proclivity for people to divide the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world into defenseless infants and </v>

875
00:44:19.391 --> 00:44:20.224
<v Speaker 1>predatory oppressors and that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>blasted forward onto the political </v>

876
00:44:23.951 --> 00:44:27.400
<v Speaker 1>landscape and things are conceptualized </v>
<v Speaker 1>along that temperamental variable.</v>

877
00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.970
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

878
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.690
<v Speaker 1>we're at with regards to the analysis of</v>
<v Speaker 1>political belief.</v>

879
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:35.363
<v Speaker 1>So while we've got three minutes left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm wondering if anybody has a </v>

880
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:41.220
<v Speaker 1>particularly intelligent question or </v>
<v Speaker 1>failing,</v>

881
00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:44.880
<v Speaker 1>not any question at all because I told </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a lot of things that are,</v>

882
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I would say contentious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think they're very much worth</v>

883
00:44:48.421 --> 00:44:50.470
<v Speaker 1>knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm.</v>

884
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

885
00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.800
<v Speaker 2>You say the</v>
<v Speaker 2>high in agreeableness,</v>

886
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.000
<v Speaker 2>mother infant.</v>

887
00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

888
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put projected onto the world period.</v>

889
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

890
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:08.690
<v Speaker 2>What would you say is the best way to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>about</v>

891
00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.110
<v Speaker 2>knowing that we have the simplified </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

892
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:15.923
<v Speaker 1>It's really useful to investigate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints of people who have opposing </v>

893
00:45:18.301 --> 00:45:21.390
<v Speaker 1>views to yours because they'll tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

894
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Not only will they tell you things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>

895
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:27.120
<v Speaker 1>they'll also tell you how to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world in ways that you don't see it.</v>

896
00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:31.530
<v Speaker 1>And they'll also have skills that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have that you could develop.</v>

897
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.020
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're an introverted person,</v>

898
00:45:34.021 --> 00:45:34.854
<v Speaker 1>it's very useful to watch an extroverted</v>
<v Speaker 1>person because the extroverted person </v>

899
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:40.380
<v Speaker 1>has ways of being in the social world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't natural to you,</v>

900
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.020
<v Speaker 1>that you can use this to improve your </v>
<v Speaker 1>toolkit.</v>

901
00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:44.153
<v Speaker 1>And if you're disagreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the best things to do with </v>

902
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:46.554
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if that's alienating them </v>

903
00:45:48.721 --> 00:45:49.920
<v Speaker 1>from other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

904
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:51.590
<v Speaker 1>because it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

905
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:54.690
<v Speaker 1>people treat you like you're a selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogant son of a bitch and maybe that's</v>

906
00:45:54.691 --> 00:45:55.980
<v Speaker 1>because you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

907
00:45:55.981 --> 00:45:57.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do about that?</v>

908
00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:02.540
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most promising treatments,</v>

909
00:46:03.181 --> 00:46:06.810
<v Speaker 1>let's say for that is get the person to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do something for someone else once a day</v>

910
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 1>just as a practice and learn how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

911
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can wake the circuit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

912
00:46:11.521 --> 00:46:13.290
<v Speaker 1>if you think that it's lying dormant in </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

913
00:46:13.291 --> 00:46:15.030
<v Speaker 1>which is probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

914
00:46:15.031 --> 00:46:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I think we have a very wide range of </v>
<v Speaker 1>propensity is within us.</v>

915
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.270
<v Speaker 1>Some are switched on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic propensity,</v>

916
00:46:21.271 --> 00:46:22.104
<v Speaker 1>summer switched on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that if you put yourself in </v>

917
00:46:23.821 --> 00:46:26.550
<v Speaker 1>the right situation or walk yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the right exercises,</v>

918
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:28.620
<v Speaker 1>you can switch some of these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things on as well.</v>

919
00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:31.920
<v Speaker 1>But it takes work and dedication and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline to do it</v>

920
00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.210
<v Speaker 2>proactively</v>
<v Speaker 2>for personnel.</v>

921
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

922
00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:36.301
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

923
00:46:36.301 --> 00:46:37.134
<v Speaker 1>I would say generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to adapt yourself properly </v>

924
00:46:39.451 --> 00:46:40.284
<v Speaker 1>to life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should find a niche in the </v>

925
00:46:41.221 --> 00:46:43.170
<v Speaker 1>environment that corresponds with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>

926
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:44.833
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't work at cross purposes to </v>

927
00:46:46.081 --> 00:46:48.150
<v Speaker 1>your temperament because it's just too </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn difficult.</v>

928
00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:49.283
<v Speaker 1>But having done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should work on developing the </v>

929
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.233
<v Speaker 1>skills and viewpoints that exist in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>space opposite to your personality </v>

930
00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.390
<v Speaker 1>because that's where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally underdeveloped.</v>

931
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:01.523
<v Speaker 1>That way I think you could extend out </v>
<v Speaker 1>your temperamental capability across a </v>

932
00:47:04.741 --> 00:47:05.574
<v Speaker 1>wider range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me that's roughly equivalent as </v>

933
00:47:07.771 --> 00:47:10.170
<v Speaker 1>bringing a richer tool kit to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

934
00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:12.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're hyper extroverted,</v>

935
00:47:12.571 --> 00:47:13.404
<v Speaker 1>you should probably learn to shut up at </v>
<v Speaker 1>parties now and then and listen just to </v>

936
00:47:15.721 --> 00:47:17.790
<v Speaker 1>see what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see if you can manage it,</v>

937
00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're introverted,</v>

938
00:47:19.411 --> 00:47:22.320
<v Speaker 1>well then you should learn how to speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>in public and to,</v>

939
00:47:22.321 --> 00:47:23.154
<v Speaker 1>and to learn how to go to parties </v>
<v Speaker 1>without hiding in the corner and saying </v>

940
00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:26.634
<v Speaker 1>nothing to anyone.</v>

941
00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.110
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're agreeable,</v>

942
00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:28.944
<v Speaker 1>then you need to learn how to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable so people can't push you </v>

943
00:47:30.731 --> 00:47:32.440
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're disagreeable,</v>

944
00:47:32.441 --> 00:47:34.540
<v Speaker 1>you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to learn how to be agreeable so</v>

945
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:36.370
<v Speaker 1>that you're not an evil son of a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

946
00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:37.713
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the same thing applies even in the </v>

947
00:47:39.281 --> 00:47:42.190
<v Speaker 1>conscientious domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're too conscientious,</v>

948
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:46.120
<v Speaker 1>you need to learn to relax and let go a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

949
00:47:46.121 --> 00:47:51.010
<v Speaker 1>And if you're unconscientious it's time </v>
<v Speaker 1>like get out the Google calendar man,</v>

950
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 1>and start scheduling your day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

951
00:47:53.051 --> 00:47:53.884
<v Speaker 1>And beat yourself on the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head with a stick until you're </v>

952
00:47:55.691 --> 00:47:56.524
<v Speaker 1>disciplined enough so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually stick to something for some </v>

953
00:47:58.481 --> 00:48:01.450
<v Speaker 1>length of time and not living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute squalor,</v>

954
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.553
<v Speaker 1>which is something that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterize someone who's very </v>

955
00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:05.560
<v Speaker 1>disorderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

956
00:48:05.561 --> 00:48:06.394
<v Speaker 1>because they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't notice it doesn't bother </v>

957
00:48:08.891 --> 00:48:09.460
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

958
00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe they can see it,</v>

959
00:48:12.341 --> 00:48:14.620
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have any emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>valence.</v>

960
00:48:14.621 --> 00:48:16.870
<v Speaker 1>And so it doesn't have any motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>

961
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.153
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other thing you might want to </v>

962
00:48:19.391 --> 00:48:20.224
<v Speaker 1>think about too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're choosing a partner is try not </v>

963
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:22.773
<v Speaker 1>to choose someone who's too distant from</v>
<v Speaker 1>you on the temperamental variables </v>

964
00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.390
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to have a hard time</v>
<v Speaker 1>bridging the gap.</v>

965
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.673
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for an introverted person and </v>

966
00:48:30.851 --> 00:48:31.684
<v Speaker 1>an extroverted person to coexist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard for an orderly person </v>

967
00:48:34.991 --> 00:48:38.530
<v Speaker 1>and a disorderly person to coexist </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they will drive each other nuts.</v>

968
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you pick up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you so obsessed by it?</v>

969
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:44.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the basic argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

970
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.273
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's useful to know about your </v>

971
00:48:46.991 --> 00:48:47.824
<v Speaker 1>temperament so that you can negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the space with your partner to wet as </v>

972
00:48:50.051 --> 00:48:50.884
<v Speaker 1>well and I don't think you should try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find someone who is exactly the same as </v>

973
00:48:53.471 --> 00:48:57.940
<v Speaker 1>you because then you don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of the alternative viewpoint,</v>

974
00:48:58.450 --> 00:48:59.283
<v Speaker 1>but you got to watch it because you may </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit eric and sizable differences of </v>

975
00:49:01.781 --> 00:49:02.614
<v Speaker 1>various sorts and I've seen that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly among couples who are high </v>

976
00:49:07.001 --> 00:49:08.170
<v Speaker 1>and low in openness.</v>

977
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:11.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a rough one and also high and low</v>
<v Speaker 1>in conscientiousness.</v>

978
00:49:11.861 --> 00:49:12.694
<v Speaker 1>That's another rough one because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just cannot see how the other person </v>

979
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:18.790
<v Speaker 1>sees the world at at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

980
00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:19.900
<v Speaker 1>We'll see you on Tuesday.</v>
