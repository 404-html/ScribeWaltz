<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here at the airport in Portland,</v>

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>about 50 cities into what is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 city tour.</v>

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.943
<v Speaker 1>It's going exceptionally well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Audiences in each city and the people </v>

4
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I've met afterward and being very </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic.</v>

5
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.093
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be a rapidly developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>market for relatively long form </v>

6
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:22.944
<v Speaker 1>intellectual discourse driven by Youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>and podcasts which have none of the </v>

7
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth limitations of traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>media forms.</v>

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.493
<v Speaker 1>I just had two evenings of productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion with Sam Harris in Vancouver </v>

9
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.450
<v Speaker 1>who going to post my notes from those </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks on my blog@JordanPeterson.com.</v>

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.413
<v Speaker 1>We talked about the relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts and values and the role that </v>

11
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:46.524
<v Speaker 1>narrative and story might play in </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing the two together for better or </v>

12
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Vancouver event sold out.</v>

13
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.863

<v Speaker 1>arena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed by the final fourth discussion </v>

16
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.300
