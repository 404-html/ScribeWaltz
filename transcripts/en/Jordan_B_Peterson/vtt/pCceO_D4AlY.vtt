1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.290
<v Speaker 2>so I want to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make an a little</v>

3
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 2>announcement first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do a series of lectures,</v>

4
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 2>I think starting in May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe at the Isabel Bader theater.</v>

5
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to look into booking that</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

6
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do a psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of the Bible from</v>

7
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:30.920
<v Speaker 2>beginning to end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the plan anyway,</v>

8
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:33.890
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to do that once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're interested in,</v>

9
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would recommend that you men,</v>

10
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:38.870
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're not and that's fine</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

11
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Speaker 2>but if you go onto my twitter account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just,</v>

12
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.870
<v Speaker 2>there's a place you can sign up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that you'll attend.</v>

13
00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to see if there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are interested in.</v>

14
00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I'd been interested in doing that for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time and so I think I'm going to</v>

15
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:51.830
<v Speaker 2>try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

16
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.550
<v Speaker 2>that's the announcement then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sad about it.</v>

17
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.330
<v Speaker 2>I guess so.</v>

18
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

19
00:00:57.171 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 2>we're going to switch gears today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

20
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.630
<v Speaker 2>the first half of this course as you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt already gathered is because</v>

21
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 2>it's round grounded essentially in</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical theories of personality.</v>

22
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 2>It tends more towards the philosophical</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I told you that the reason for that</v>

23
00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 2>was that I regard clinical psychology as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a branch of engineering rather than a</v>

24
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:19.220
<v Speaker 2>branch of science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's human engineering obviously,</v>

25
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 2>and because of that it's an applied</v>
<v Speaker 2>science and so that means it straddles</v>

26
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 2>the ground between a science and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>practice and it and because it's.</v>

27
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.950
<v Speaker 2>It involves human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It necessarily involves value because we</v>

28
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.780
<v Speaker 2>live inside value structures and so the</v>
<v Speaker 2>logical consequence of that is that</v>

29
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.740
<v Speaker 2>investigation into the philosophy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>value is necessary in order to</v>

30
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 2>understand clinical psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>theories.</v>

31
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Because really what you're trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a clinician,</v>

32
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.240
<v Speaker 2>you could say you're trying to do two</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

33
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 2>One is to help people have less terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>

34
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.080
<v Speaker 2>but you're also trying to help them have</v>
<v Speaker 2>better lives and there's obviously a</v>

35
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 2>value structure that's inherent in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt because you're moving from</v>

36
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:05.900
<v Speaker 2>something of less value to something of</v>
<v Speaker 2>more value and so and it's best to just</v>

37
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.270
<v Speaker 2>face that and all the complexities that</v>
<v Speaker 2>come along with that head on.</v>

38
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what you do as a clinician to</v>

39
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:18.560
<v Speaker 2>overcome whatever tendency you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to impose your value structure on</v>

40
00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:22.520
<v Speaker 2>someone is you do an awful lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>listening and so my basic practice with</v>

41
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 2>people is to say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

42
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.320
<v Speaker 2>obviously you're here because you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>like things to be better,</v>

43
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.500
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can use your definition of what</v>

44
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 2>constitutes better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can use your definition of what</v>

45
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 2>constitutes worse at air or we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>establish that through dialogue and</v>

46
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:38.294
<v Speaker 2>negotiation.</v>

47
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.330
<v Speaker 2>What are you aiming at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you like things to be better a</v>

48
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.510
<v Speaker 2>year from now safe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could have what you wanted?</v>

49
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.150
<v Speaker 2>If your life was put together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would that look like and you can</v>

50
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:50.450
<v Speaker 2>have a very straightforward discussion</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people about that.</v>

51
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.680
<v Speaker 2>If you're not trying to cram the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are orienting the world into your</v>

52
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 2>particular perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's one of the dangers of being</v>

53
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 2>the adherent of a psychological school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

54
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:05.521
<v Speaker 2>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also there was research done many</v>

55
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 2>years ago showing that if you are an</v>
<v Speaker 2>eclectic psychotherapists best,</v>

56
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 2>which means that you sort of picked and</v>
<v Speaker 2>chose from different psychotherapeutic</v>

57
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 2>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tended to not be as effective as you</v>

58
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>were if you were the dedicated adherent</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a given school.</v>

59
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason for that is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many schools have</v>

60
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 2>psychological thought that if you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you pick and choose from all of</v>

61
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

62
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 2>What that really means is that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know anything about any of them.</v>

63
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.630
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also the additional</v>
<v Speaker 2>factor maybe might call it that.</v>

64
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 2>If someone comes to you and they're very</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic and confused,</v>

65
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 2>helping them impose any structure onto</v>
<v Speaker 2>their life is likely to be an</v>

66
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 2>improvement over no structure at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could think about that in a pig,</v>

67
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Eddie and sense is that you know you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be happier playing a game</v>

68
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 2>rather than no game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's many games that you could</v>

69
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 2>play that are better than no game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you go to a therapist that has</v>

70
00:03:56.561 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 2>a particular viewpoint and they help you</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure your understanding of the</v>

71
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 2>world within the confines of a given</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical model and you came in,</v>

72
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 2>they're very chaotic and uncertain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe that's going to be a lot</v>

73
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 2>better for you than just floundering.</v>

74
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's some real truth in</v>

75
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's part and parcel</v>

76
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 2>of the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

77
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.210
<v Speaker 2>of another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you might call it,</v>

78
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 2>reasonable observation about maturation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's very necessary for people</v>

79
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 2>at some point in their life to dedicate</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves to a single game of some</v>

80
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 2>sort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of what you're doing in</v>

81
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:29.050
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

82
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 2>you have to become one thing at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>point in your life.</v>

83
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 2>And the sacrifice of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you give up all the other things</v>

84
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:37.840
<v Speaker 2>that you could become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

85
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't really have a choice because</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't decide voluntarily to</v>

86
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:42.510
<v Speaker 2>become one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

87
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 2>to become a disciplined adherents of</v>
<v Speaker 2>some specific,</v>

88
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

89
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.370
<v Speaker 2>practice or profession or viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you risk just aging chaotically and</v>

90
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get away with not aging.</v>

91
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:59.200
<v Speaker 2>So you might as well age into something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

92
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 2>that's actually something rather than</v>
<v Speaker 2>just remaining or then just becoming an</v>

93
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 2>old child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really not a,</v>

94
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 2>not a good thing.</v>

95
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good thing to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially by the time people hit about</v>

96
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 2>40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

97
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not pretty for them or anyone else.</v>

98
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 2>And even at 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting pretty old at that point.</v>

99
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 2>40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's almost a repairable at</v>

100
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.110
<v Speaker 2>40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is you run and</v>

101
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 2>you start running out of opportunities</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're young and stupid.</v>

102
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:25.930
<v Speaker 2>People don't care because they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

103
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

104
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 2>you've got decades of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

105
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 2>of possibility still ready to unfold in</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

106
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 2>But if you're in the same unspecified</v>
<v Speaker 2>position at 40,</v>

107
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 2>people are much less forgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially because if they're going to</v>

108
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 2>hire someone who doesn't know what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on or or employ them or or sorry</v>

109
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 2>or engage them in some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>productive activity,</v>

110
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 2>they might as well take a chance on</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone young and full of potential</v>

111
00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 2>rather than someone who's really lived</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than half of their life already</v>

112
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 2>because of course you have by the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're 40 more that.</v>

113
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so so anyway,</v>

114
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 2>so that's with regards to putting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first half of the course to bed,</v>

115
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second half is more more scientific</v>

116
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 2>and there's a bit of a gap that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a gap I'm trying to resolve</v>

117
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 2>conceptually because now we move into</v>
<v Speaker 2>more biological models and into models</v>

118
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:21.761
<v Speaker 2>that are psychometric and psychometrics</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the psychological study or the study</v>

119
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 2>of psychological measurement and now if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a scientist,</v>

120
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.400
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of things that you're</v>

121
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 2>obliged to do if you're a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is to utilize the scientific method.</v>

122
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 2>That's usually the experimental method</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you take two groups randomly</v>

123
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 2>selected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apply a manipulation to one of them and</v>

124
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 2>not an equivalent manipulation of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different source to another.</v>

125
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Hypothesize about what the outcome is</v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to be and then test it.</v>

126
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

127
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 2>that's the technical experimental model</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

128
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.340
<v Speaker 2>You're also obliged as a scientist to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with a measurement of your,</v>

129
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.010
<v Speaker 2>of your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

130
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 2>to come up with a measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just put it that way.</v>

131
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 2>That's reliable and valid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

132
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 2>And what a reliable measure is one that</v>
<v Speaker 2>measures the same way across multiple</v>

133
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 2>measurements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

134
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't want to take a ruler that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>made out of flexible rubber to measure</v>

135
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:19.250
<v Speaker 2>things with because it wouldn't give you</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same measurement if you put it in</v>

136
00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:22.610
<v Speaker 2>different situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's reliability and it's a term you</v>

137
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 2>need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that the measurement tool</v>

138
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:28.910
<v Speaker 2>produces stable results across different</v>
<v Speaker 2>instances of the measurement.</v>

139
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Without that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a measurement.</v>

140
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.580
<v Speaker 2>The other critical</v>
<v Speaker 2>factor with regards to a measurement is</v>

141
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 2>that it has to be valid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that it actually has to</v>

142
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.050
<v Speaker 2>measure what it purports to measure and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be usable for an array of</v>

143
00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:49.100
<v Speaker 2>different purposes as a consequence.</v>

144
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 2>And so you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

145
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of scientific endeavor is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>predict and to control.</v>

146
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.340
<v Speaker 2>You could say understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predict,</v>

147
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 2>and control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but understanding prediction and</v>

148
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:02.630
<v Speaker 2>controls are all manifestations of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same underlying</v>

149
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 2>thoroughly designed comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

150
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 2>here's what's happened with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>measurement of personality.</v>

151
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny story in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a peculiar story because</v>

152
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 2>in many ways what we've come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand about personality from a</v>

153
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:26.141
<v Speaker 2>scientific perspective developed in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very atheoretical manner.</v>

154
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:30.740
<v Speaker 2>It's not very common in scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>endeavor that that occurs is that what</v>

155
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 2>we know about personality emerged from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say statistically rigorous</v>

156
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 2>observation without it being the</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of any real model.</v>

157
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:45.130
<v Speaker 2>So often what happens in scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>endeavor is that someone generates a</v>

158
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 2>model first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a theoretical understanding,</v>

159
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.690
<v Speaker 2>and then they generate measurement tools</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on that theoretical understanding</v>

160
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.470
<v Speaker 2>and then they test the measurement tools</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see if all of the measurement tools</v>

161
00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 2>perform and if they fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least to invalidate the underlying</v>

162
00:08:58.681 --> 00:08:59.010
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

163
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 2>That isn't what happened with</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychometrics,</v>

164
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 2>what except in a loose way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the loose theory and you've</v>

165
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 2>got to get this exactly right to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand this property.</v>

166
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get it exactly right and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really important because in so far</v>

167
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 2>as you guys are interested in</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>

168
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:17.130
<v Speaker 2>especially in the experimental end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>

169
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.290
<v Speaker 2>measurement is everything and so much of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what psychologists publish and write</v>

170
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 2>about is incorrect and the reason it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorrect is because they do not have</v>

171
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:28.470
<v Speaker 2>their measurements properly instantiate</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

172
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a massive problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially in social psychology.</v>

173
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a fatal problem in that</v>

174
00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:37.880
<v Speaker 2>most of the things that social</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists measure don't exist and in</v>

175
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 2>social psychology has been rife with</v>
<v Speaker 2>scandals for the last four or five years</v>

176
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 2>and and there's good reason for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a big part of the problem is is that</v>

177
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.620
<v Speaker 2>the measurement that people are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>stringent and careful enough about their</v>

178
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:50.040
<v Speaker 2>measurements.</v>

179
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 2>So we're gonna walk through this very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very carefully.</v>

180
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:56.010
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to set forward a set of</v>
<v Speaker 2>propositions and you have to think about</v>

181
00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 2>them because each of them are there</v>
<v Speaker 2>axiomatic.</v>

182
00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:01.290
<v Speaker 2>So you sort of have to accept them</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you go onto the next step.</v>

183
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.510
<v Speaker 2>And there's certainly room to question</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

184
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.830
<v Speaker 2>But here's the bare bones of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychometric of model of personality,</v>

185
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 2>so we'll call it roughly the big five</v>
<v Speaker 2>model and the reason it's called the big</v>

186
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:15.990
<v Speaker 2>five model is because the psychometric</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigations have indicated that you</v>

187
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 2>can specify human personality along five</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic dimensions.</v>

188
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.121
<v Speaker 2>You might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

189
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:24.930
<v Speaker 2>what exactly is personality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while that's partly what we've been</v>

190
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:27.240
<v Speaker 2>trying to wrestle with the entire course</v>
<v Speaker 2>so far,</v>

191
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:30.410
<v Speaker 2>and I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what exactly is a trait?</v>

192
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Think of a trait has an element of</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>

193
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.710
<v Speaker 2>And I think the best way to think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trait is as a subpersonality,</v>

194
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.010
<v Speaker 2>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're made up of sub personalities that</v>

195
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Speaker 2>are integrated into something vaguely</v>
<v Speaker 2>resembling a unity.</v>

196
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.950
<v Speaker 2>But the unity is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is diverse.</v>

197
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:47.820
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

198
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.300
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are describable stable elements</v>

199
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:54.900
<v Speaker 2>that characterize you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are elements of your being.</v>

200
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

201
00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:57.900
<v Speaker 2>here's some common ones I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

202
00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:00.450
<v Speaker 2>are you social or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or would you rather be alone?</v>

203
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:00.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

204
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a good question for you to</v>

205
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:04.500
<v Speaker 2>define.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decide whether you're extroverted or</v>

206
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 2>introverted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty straightforward because</v>

207
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the first major dimension.</v>

208
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.360
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take any set of questions about</v>

209
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.760
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any set of questions that could be</v>

210
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:19.761
<v Speaker 2>applied descriptively to a human being</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you subject them to a statistical</v>

211
00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:23.890
<v Speaker 2>process called factor analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can determine how they grouped</v>

212
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I would be interested in,</v>

213
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:30.060
<v Speaker 2>let's say I asked you 100 questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say asked 100 questions of you and</v>

214
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 2>a hundred other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I would find was that reliably,</v>

215
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 2>if some person answered question a say</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a scale of one to seven,</v>

216
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.420
<v Speaker 2>six or seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be other questions in the</v>

217
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:47.421
<v Speaker 2>set of questions that they also tended</v>
<v Speaker 2>to answer on the upper end of the scale</v>

218
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.640
<v Speaker 2>or reliably if they answered one</v>
<v Speaker 2>question at the top of the scale data</v>

219
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 2>answer another question at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a pattern of covariation.</v>

220
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 2>So you're looking for how the questions</v>
<v Speaker 2>co-vary across large numbers of people.</v>

221
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 2>So let's say here's a stupid example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

222
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.700
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really straightforward,</v>

223
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 2>easy to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might say,</v>

224
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.680
<v Speaker 2>how often do you smile?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One to seven.</v>

225
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 2>How often are you happy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One to seven.</v>

226
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you'd find obviously is that people</v>

227
00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 2>who tended to answer that they smiled a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot,</v>

228
00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 2>would also tend to answer that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy a lot and so smiling and happy are</v>

229
00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:26.230
<v Speaker 2>not exactly the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why we have two different</v>

230
00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 2>phrases to describe them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're close enough so that they</v>

231
00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:32.230
<v Speaker 2>seem to be reflective of some underlying</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

232
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.610
<v Speaker 2>and so that's what factor analysis does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it allows you to take a large set of</v>

233
00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Speaker 2>questions to administer it to a large</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of people and then to</v>

234
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:43.780
<v Speaker 2>statistically analyze it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looking how the questions relate to one</v>

235
00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:48.280
<v Speaker 2>another across the entire group so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can infer what the underlying</v>

236
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:49.114
<v Speaker 2>structure is.</v>

237
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.620
<v Speaker 2>And here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the question.</v>

238
00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:53.200
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I ask you 100 questions,</v>

239
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.570
<v Speaker 2>how many questions am I really asking</v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

240
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

241
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 2>are you do you smile a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you happy?</v>

242
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you wake up eager to start the day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

243
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that one question asked three ways,</v>

244
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.740
<v Speaker 2>or is it three separate questions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>

245
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:15.370
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the answer's reliably co-vary,</v>

246
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.880
<v Speaker 2>then it's reflection of an underlying</v>
<v Speaker 2>single dimension.</v>

247
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously those questions are</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly different now,</v>

248
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.730
<v Speaker 2>but they'll relate to one another</v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainably.</v>

249
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.740
<v Speaker 2>And so you can infer out the central</v>
<v Speaker 2>stable factors.</v>

250
00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Now it might be the case that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>

251
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.070
<v Speaker 2>here's an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you might ask how many stable</v>

252
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.680
<v Speaker 2>underlying dimensions are there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In any set of questions,</v>

253
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:43.510
<v Speaker 2>if I ask you questions that relate to</v>
<v Speaker 2>your capacity to manipulate</v>

254
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 2>abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all find that there's one factor.</v>

255
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:52.350
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you had an infinite library</v>
<v Speaker 2>of problem solving questions.</v>

256
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Capital of Georgia.</v>

257
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Here's the sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

258
00:13:56.831 --> 00:13:57.611
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

259
00:13:57.611 --> 00:13:58.271
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10.</v>

260
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:00.640
<v Speaker 2>What's the next number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's five patterns.</v>

261
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Here's and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

262
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.340
<v Speaker 2>they transform predictably across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern array.</v>

263
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Here's five alternatives that the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern might be.</v>

264
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Pick that one here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's 10 words,</v>

265
00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:14.110
<v Speaker 2>tell me what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything like that.</v>

266
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:16.120
<v Speaker 2>Here's a mathematical operation</v>
<v Speaker 2>computed,</v>

267
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.730
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you had a very large library of</v>

268
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:20.590
<v Speaker 2>questions like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

269
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:23.470
<v Speaker 2>And Infinite Library.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you took random sets of 100</v>

270
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 2>questions from that library and you gave</v>
<v Speaker 2>that those cassettes to a thousand</v>

271
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:32.340
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you'd find was that people who and</v>

272
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.420
<v Speaker 2>the score,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you gave them a hundred questions and</v>

273
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 2>then you summed across all the items to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see how well they did.</v>

274
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.590
<v Speaker 2>What you'd find was that people who did</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well on one set of items would do</v>

275
00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:44.920
<v Speaker 2>very well on another set of items and</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well have another set of items.</v>

276
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.490
<v Speaker 2>And that would be the same for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who did badly if they did badly on any</v>

277
00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:51.830
<v Speaker 2>one of the sets of randomly chosen items</v>
<v Speaker 2>of abstraction.</v>

278
00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:55.010
<v Speaker 2>They do badly on the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's basically Iq.</v>

279
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.070
<v Speaker 2>That's all there is to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it.</v>

280
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 2>What Iq does is correct that for age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than that,</v>

281
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:03.830
<v Speaker 2>that's all there is to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's interesting about</v>

282
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.820
<v Speaker 2>those random sets of abstract problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>solving questions is there's one</v>

283
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.890
<v Speaker 2>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

284
00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Intelligence has one dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's one of the most terrifying</v>

285
00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:18.760
<v Speaker 2>statistics that are known to social</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>

286
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.440
<v Speaker 2>And Iq is an extraordinarily powerful</v>
<v Speaker 2>predictor of longterm success,</v>

287
00:15:23.441 --> 00:15:26.650
<v Speaker 2>especially in complex jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that,</v>

288
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:31.770
<v Speaker 2>it's quite straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most complex jobs throw random sets of</v>

289
00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:33.250
<v Speaker 2>complex problems at you.</v>

290
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 2>That's what that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their definition.</v>

291
00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:39.020
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're working as a lawyer on complex</v>

292
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.870
<v Speaker 2>on complex court cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to read very</v>

293
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:43.880
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to abstract,</v>

294
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:46.280
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to problem solve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be able to formulate</v>

295
00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 2>arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to do that repeatedly in</v>

296
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.310
<v Speaker 2>different ways across very large spans</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>

297
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 2>And so the fact that your ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve any set of random problems is a</v>

298
00:15:57.381 --> 00:16:01.490
<v Speaker 2>really good predictor of your ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve any set of random legal problems.</v>

299
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.160
<v Speaker 2>It's more or less self evident that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the case,</v>

300
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.420
<v Speaker 2>but the but the thing is the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes Iq so damn powerful and it's one</v>

301
00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:10.490
<v Speaker 2>of the personality traits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

302
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 2>the thing that makes Iq so powerful is</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can basically get a decent measure</v>

303
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:14.930
<v Speaker 2>of it in 20 minutes.</v>

304
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.990
<v Speaker 2>It's very terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

305
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.700
<v Speaker 2>we'll go into ICU and some depths as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>progress through the course,</v>

306
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.270
<v Speaker 2>but you get one dimension out of out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>factor analysis of Iq.</v>

307
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Now in the personality domain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're using descriptive items.</v>

308
00:16:27.201 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get five dimensions and so,</v>

309
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.700
<v Speaker 2>so and you and what are these dimensions</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly while you could think about them</v>

310
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.990
<v Speaker 2>as I think of them as sub personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's some other ways of thinking</v>

311
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:40.940
<v Speaker 2>about them because we want to flesh this</v>
<v Speaker 2>out a little bit.</v>

312
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 2>You can think of them as a frame of</v>
<v Speaker 2>reference so that if you're an</v>

313
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:45.560
<v Speaker 2>extrovert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was going to tell you the</v>

314
00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:49.250
<v Speaker 2>extroverted question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does being around groups of people make</v>

315
00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:54.251
<v Speaker 2>you energetic or does it exhaust you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're the sort of person that will</v>

316
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.720
<v Speaker 2>go to a party and interact with 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in,</v>

317
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.840
<v Speaker 2>then you have to go home and be by</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself for like two weeks.</v>

318
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Then you're introverted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Introverts are exhausted by social</v>

319
00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:05.750
<v Speaker 2>interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Extroverts are the opposite.</v>

320
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:06.853
<v Speaker 2>They all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

321
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.940
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

322
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.670
<v Speaker 2>they're energized by social interactions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

323
00:17:10.671 --> 00:17:14.390
<v Speaker 2>you might be in the middle so that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can take it or leave it with regards to</v>

324
00:17:14.391 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 2>social interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're happy to go to them and</v>

325
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:19.310
<v Speaker 2>you're happy to spend time by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a real extrovert,</v>

326
00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:22.940
<v Speaker 2>there'll be some of you in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of you can't stand spending</v>

327
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:23.774
<v Speaker 2>time alone?</v>

328
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's only two that will admit it.</v>

329
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 2>Extroverts are more likely to admit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing too,</v>

330
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:32.960
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then how many of you you like to</v>

331
00:17:32.961 --> 00:17:35.090
<v Speaker 2>spend time alone or would rather be</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone?</v>

332
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there is a preponderance of</v>

333
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:39.190
<v Speaker 2>introverts in this class is by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

334
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.910
<v Speaker 2>by all appearances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a really,</v>

335
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.540
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty canonical question for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for extroversion versus introversion.</v>

336
00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a very stable trait by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It manifests itself early in life and</v>

337
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.550
<v Speaker 2>it's stable across the age span,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not completely.</v>

338
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Introverts can learn to be extroverted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Extroverts can learn to spend time on</v>

339
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:00.960
<v Speaker 2>their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that actually your capacity to</v>

340
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:05.460
<v Speaker 2>expand your ability past the initial</v>
<v Speaker 2>constraints of your biological</v>

341
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 2>temperament is something like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>development of character or wisdom you</v>

342
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:11.400
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're an introvert by nature and</v>

343
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:15.120
<v Speaker 2>you learn how to be extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that expands your domain of</v>

344
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:17.430
<v Speaker 2>competence and if you're extroverted and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn to be introverted,</v>

345
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:19.530
<v Speaker 2>the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost like imagine a</v>

346
00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:21.960
<v Speaker 2>distribution of extrovert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>introversion here,</v>

347
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:27.110
<v Speaker 2>extroversion here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a normal distribution you're set when</v>

348
00:18:27.271 --> 00:18:27.690
<v Speaker 2>you're young.</v>

349
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:31.020
<v Speaker 2>It's somewhere along that distribution</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some range around it.</v>

350
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.700
<v Speaker 2>And I think what you do as you mature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you develop your skills as you expand</v>

351
00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:36.960
<v Speaker 2>that range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're set,</v>

352
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.930
<v Speaker 2>the place at which you're set doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>move that much.</v>

353
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.970
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's.</v>

354
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.830
<v Speaker 2>So you can think about them as</v>
<v Speaker 2>subpersonalities.</v>

355
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.560
<v Speaker 2>You can think about them as frames of</v>
<v Speaker 2>reference.</v>

356
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:48.960
<v Speaker 2>So frame of reference would be something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

357
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since you're extroverted,</v>

358
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:53.400
<v Speaker 2>you value being with people and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to look at the world.</v>

359
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.140
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're extroverted,</v>

360
00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:56.520
<v Speaker 2>you come into a room like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

361
00:18:56.521 --> 00:18:58.920
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole field of opportunity for</v>

362
00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:01.170
<v Speaker 2>social interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're introverted you think,</v>

363
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.140
<v Speaker 2>well maybe I'll go sit up in the corner</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hope everybody leaves me the hell</v>

364
00:19:04.141 --> 00:19:05.370
<v Speaker 2>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so,</v>

365
00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:09.810
<v Speaker 2>so it's an a priority set of perceptual</v>
<v Speaker 2>structures that you bring to bear on a</v>

366
00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:11.130
<v Speaker 2>whole sequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

367
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.000
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

368
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.540
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

369
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.090
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're high in openness versus low</v>

370
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:17.220
<v Speaker 2>in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the creativity dimension.</v>

371
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.210
<v Speaker 2>People are high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to be artists and entrepreneurs and</v>

372
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:26.300
<v Speaker 2>open people will look at other people as</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities to engage in interesting</v>

373
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:31.080
<v Speaker 2>intellectual conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can tell when you're talking</v>

374
00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:32.580
<v Speaker 2>to someone's old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone opened,</v>

375
00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:35.110
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're very high in</v>
<v Speaker 2>openness because they're going to want</v>

376
00:19:35.111 --> 00:19:37.980
<v Speaker 2>to talk to you about ideas or about</v>
<v Speaker 2>aesthetics.</v>

377
00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:41.610
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's going to go right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's how they view you as a source</v>

378
00:19:41.611 --> 00:19:44.700
<v Speaker 2>of that sort of conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they view the landscape.</v>

379
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Someone who's high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a negative emotion dimension,</v>

380
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.930
<v Speaker 2>is more likely to view the world as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>place of threats to be,</v>

381
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:56.490
<v Speaker 2>to be protected against because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>more anxious and more prone to emotional</v>

382
00:19:56.491 --> 00:19:57.600
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

383
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.770
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

384
00:19:58.771 --> 00:20:00.520
<v Speaker 2>so that's the frame of reference issue.</v>

385
00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.390
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about your,</v>

386
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.400
<v Speaker 2>under an underlying fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological traits that determine or</v>

387
00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:09.750
<v Speaker 2>influenced at least your value</v>
<v Speaker 2>structures.</v>

388
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.670
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do it at the level of perception.</v>

389
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:17.120
<v Speaker 2>They also tend to set your goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So extroverted people have as one goal,</v>

390
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.370
<v Speaker 2>the opportunity to engage with other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

391
00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:24.060
<v Speaker 2>So extroverts love parties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live for parties,</v>

392
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.810
<v Speaker 2>they love to tell jokes as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very good behavioral marker of</v>

393
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.680
<v Speaker 2>extraversion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they,</v>

394
00:20:31.681 --> 00:20:33.360
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they value those sorts of</v>

395
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:35.640
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they set them as goals in their life or</v>

396
00:20:35.641 --> 00:20:39.810
<v Speaker 2>you could say the extroversion operating</v>
<v Speaker 2>within them sets them as goals within</v>

397
00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:42.470
<v Speaker 2>their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on how deterministic you want</v>

398
00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:43.980
<v Speaker 2>to be about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

399
00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there their patterns of behavior,</v>

400
00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 2>that's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a micro level,</v>

401
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I showed you that sort of hierarchy of,</v>

402
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:51.390
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

403
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:56.610
<v Speaker 2>of value slash frames of references that</v>
<v Speaker 2>ranged from micro-behaviors up to high</v>

404
00:20:57.161 --> 00:21:02.161
<v Speaker 2>order abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can extract out a personality from,</v>

405
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 2>by looking at people's micro actions as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

406
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:08.230
<v Speaker 2>And one of the papers that I want you</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys to read that's on the course</v>

407
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:12.430
<v Speaker 2>website has to do with our investigation</v>
<v Speaker 2>into behavioral markers of the big five</v>

408
00:21:12.431 --> 00:21:13.264
<v Speaker 2>traits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

409
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know exactly.</v>

410
00:21:20.501 --> 00:21:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll get back to that at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what it looks like is</v>

411
00:21:23.391 --> 00:21:26.110
<v Speaker 2>that introversion is something like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>absence of extroversion.</v>

412
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:29.920
<v Speaker 2>But let me explain extraversion more</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly and it'll make more sense.</v>

413
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

414
00:21:31.091 --> 00:21:33.910
<v Speaker 2>So you can think about them as stable</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation.</v>

415
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:34.870
<v Speaker 2>So pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

416
00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:38.560
<v Speaker 2>people who hired agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can generally tell people who are high</v>

417
00:21:38.561 --> 00:21:42.310
<v Speaker 2>in agreeableness when they come into my</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical practice and I start asking</v>

418
00:21:42.311 --> 00:21:47.050
<v Speaker 2>them about their biography because my</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience has been that people who are</v>

419
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:51.880
<v Speaker 2>agreeable will tell you their biography</v>
<v Speaker 2>defined by relationships they've had</v>

420
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:54.640
<v Speaker 2>over their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So agreeable people are high and</v>

421
00:21:54.641 --> 00:21:57.760
<v Speaker 2>compassion and high end politeness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like the maternal dimension,</v>

422
00:21:57.761 --> 00:21:59.650
<v Speaker 2>it looks like the pair bonding</v>
<v Speaker 2>dimension,</v>

423
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.110
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so agreeable people tend to</v>

424
00:22:02.111 --> 00:22:06.220
<v Speaker 2>characterize their lives in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimate relationships they've had and</v>

425
00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:10.450
<v Speaker 2>so those are also people who would value</v>
<v Speaker 2>an intimate relationship over anything</v>

426
00:22:10.451 --> 00:22:10.750
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

427
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:15.250
<v Speaker 2>If agreeableness is the uppermost trait</v>
<v Speaker 2>that characterizes their personality,</v>

428
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:20.830
<v Speaker 2>then well systems of values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we already talked about that a little</v>

429
00:22:20.831 --> 00:22:23.020
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The higher you are at a given trait,</v>

430
00:22:23.021 --> 00:22:27.070
<v Speaker 2>the more you value certain opportunities</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are associated with that trait and</v>

431
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:32.050
<v Speaker 2>so I think it's worthwhile thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about traits along using all of those</v>

432
00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:36.010
<v Speaker 2>different conceptual schemes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what constitutes a trait,</v>

433
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.000
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people are in some sense is a</v>

434
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:42.070
<v Speaker 2>little melody of traits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melody,</v>

435
00:22:42.071 --> 00:22:43.030
<v Speaker 2>not m,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a l,</v>

436
00:22:43.031 --> 00:22:43.750
<v Speaker 2>a d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>y,</v>

437
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.450
<v Speaker 2>although some people are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but melody like a song,</v>

438
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:51.930
<v Speaker 2>you know where were different amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>each of the canonical traits operate to</v>

439
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:55.540
<v Speaker 2>a different degree at each person and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person that manifest themselves as</v>

440
00:22:55.541 --> 00:23:00.250
<v Speaker 2>the is the is the is the panoply of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those traits as they manifest themselves</v>

441
00:23:00.251 --> 00:23:03.520
<v Speaker 2>in the world and so it's actually very</v>
<v Speaker 2>useful to understand your,</v>

442
00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.410
<v Speaker 2>your big five traits as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

443
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I have you do that exercise</v>

444
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:09.780
<v Speaker 2>that you're supposed to do for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>class that helps you.</v>

445
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:15.040
<v Speaker 2>You identify your faults and virtues and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used big five terminology to help you</v>

446
00:23:15.251 --> 00:23:18.640
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm part of the reason it's useful to</v>

447
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:21.580
<v Speaker 2>know what your traits are is because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can help you figure out how you should</v>

448
00:23:21.581 --> 00:23:23.470
<v Speaker 2>orient your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

449
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.010
<v Speaker 2>if you're a hired extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you've.</v>

450
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.600
<v Speaker 2>You've got a proclivity towards sales</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

451
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.630
<v Speaker 2>and you're gonna like you're gonna like</v>
<v Speaker 2>occupations where you have a lot of</v>

452
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:34.330
<v Speaker 2>opportunity for social interactions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>social networking.</v>

453
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be happy if your job</v>
<v Speaker 2>requires you to sit alone by,</v>

454
00:23:39.131 --> 00:23:40.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

455
00:23:40.031 --> 00:23:43.690
<v Speaker 2>for extended periods of time and work in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the absence of social interaction.</v>

456
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.030
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be one of those annoying</v>
<v Speaker 2>people then in one of those offices that</v>

457
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.080
<v Speaker 2>instead of sitting alone in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>offices,</v>

458
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 2>going from doorway to doorway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging everyone in conversation,</v>

459
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

460
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 2>So and you want to be in a position that</v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalizes on your traits because it's</v>

461
00:23:57.111 --> 00:24:01.010
<v Speaker 2>really difficult to work contrary to</v>
<v Speaker 2>your traits.</v>

462
00:24:01.011 --> 00:24:02.730
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that's worth thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about too,</v>

463
00:24:02.731 --> 00:24:06.050
<v Speaker 2>and we're actually building a computer</v>
<v Speaker 2>app for this,</v>

464
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.350
<v Speaker 2>which is about which has been about 80</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent done for a whole year.</v>

465
00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:14.360
<v Speaker 2>We've got a hypothesis that we're still</v>
<v Speaker 2>working out that's supported to some</v>

466
00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:17.540
<v Speaker 2>degree by the relevant literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you're looking for a</v>

467
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:19.310
<v Speaker 2>stable partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

468
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 2>So you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

469
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.800
<v Speaker 2>what do you want in a stable partner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at least in principle,</v>

470
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:29.780
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you don't want is too</v>
<v Speaker 2>much mismatch between you and that</v>

471
00:24:29.781 --> 00:24:32.780
<v Speaker 2>person on the five fundamental dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

472
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.890
<v Speaker 2>if you're really extroverted and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a really introverted partner,</v>

473
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.110
<v Speaker 2>you're going to engage in continual</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict about how much social activity</v>

474
00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.600
<v Speaker 2>the two of you should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be,</v>

475
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.810
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should what subject yourself to.</v>

476
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.780
<v Speaker 2>And it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult for people who broadly</v>

477
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:55.781
<v Speaker 2>differ widely differ on those dimensions</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come to consensus because it's not</v>

478
00:24:55.881 --> 00:24:57.500
<v Speaker 2>just a matter of opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

479
00:24:57.501 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 2>It's really a matter of different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're looking at extremes of really</v>

480
00:25:01.671 --> 00:25:04.670
<v Speaker 2>different types of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing about introverts is they</v>

481
00:25:04.671 --> 00:25:08.450
<v Speaker 2>just don't enjoy large scale social</v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction.</v>

482
00:25:08.451 --> 00:25:10.340
<v Speaker 2>That much one on one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're often fine,</v>

483
00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:12.130
<v Speaker 2>but in a group they don't like that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

484
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.630
<v Speaker 2>It tires them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas a real extrovert,</v>

485
00:25:14.631 --> 00:25:18.770
<v Speaker 2>it's like you isolate them and and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just wither on the vine because a huge</v>

486
00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:23.150
<v Speaker 2>part of what actually motivates them in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a positive way is tangled up with social</v>

487
00:25:23.151 --> 00:25:27.080
<v Speaker 2>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're an agreeable person and</v>

488
00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:29.240
<v Speaker 2>you have a particularly disagreeable</v>
<v Speaker 2>partner,</v>

489
00:25:29.241 --> 00:25:32.780
<v Speaker 2>you're also going to run into problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the agreeable person will say</v>

490
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:35.670
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever and the agreeable per a</v>

491
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 2>disagreeable person will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

492
00:25:37.671 --> 00:25:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to know what the hell you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a change and be much more harsh and</v>

493
00:25:41.751 --> 00:25:45.530
<v Speaker 2>much more demanding in this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the agreeable person is going to</v>

494
00:25:45.531 --> 00:25:48.320
<v Speaker 2>find the disagreeable person harsh and</v>
<v Speaker 2>unpleasant,</v>

495
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.910
<v Speaker 2>and the disagreeable person is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find the agreeable person wishy washy</v>

496
00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:54.800
<v Speaker 2>and unable to stand up for themselves.</v>

497
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.633
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

498
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:59.120
<v Speaker 2>that's actually one of the primary</v>
<v Speaker 2>sources of tension between men and women</v>

499
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.090
<v Speaker 2>because women tend to be higher in</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness than men.</v>

500
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.430
<v Speaker 2>It's about half a standard deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite,</v>

501
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:05.120
<v Speaker 2>quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

502
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.760
<v Speaker 2>quite a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a large difference by</v>

503
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:12.950
<v Speaker 2>psychological standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means,</v>

504
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.530
<v Speaker 2>I probably haven't got this statistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite right,</v>

505
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.220
<v Speaker 2>but I think I've got it about right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What that means fundamentally,</v>

506
00:26:19.221 --> 00:26:23.630
<v Speaker 2>just so you have some sense of how large</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fact that is,</v>

507
00:26:23.631 --> 00:26:27.470
<v Speaker 2>is that if you have a group of men and</v>
<v Speaker 2>women and you pick out random pairs,</v>

508
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.340
<v Speaker 2>the woman is going to be more agreeable</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the man 60 percent of the time,</v>

509
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.740
<v Speaker 2>so that's not an overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 2>proportion,</v>

510
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's reliable and it's quite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite large by psychological</v>

511
00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:39.770
<v Speaker 2>standards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's the problem with</v>

512
00:26:39.771 --> 00:26:42.680
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness with conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

513
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:47.360
<v Speaker 2>if you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're industrious and orderly and</v>

514
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 2>orderly.</v>

515
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.130
<v Speaker 2>People seem to be sensitive to</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed,</v>

516
00:26:50.131 --> 00:26:52.110
<v Speaker 2>which is something we'll talk about in</v>
<v Speaker 2>detail later.</v>

517
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:56.970
<v Speaker 2>We've had a hard time specifying exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>what makes industrious people</v>

518
00:26:56.971 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 2>industrious because it's hard to come up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with an animal model for that sort of</v>

519
00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:05.001
<v Speaker 2>thing and there's no theoretical model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our latest idea is that it's not my</v>

520
00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:07.530
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually the idea of my graduate</v>

521
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 2>student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christine Brophy,</v>

522
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 2>is that industrious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People find it</v>

523
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 2>unpleasant and unsettling to to not be</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something so it isn't so much that</v>

524
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 2>industriousness makes them happy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>fills them with positive emotion.</v>

525
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.060
<v Speaker 2>That would be more extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

526
00:27:24.061 --> 00:27:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Because extroversion is the positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion dimension.</v>

527
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Speaker 2>It's an industrious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can't stand sitting around doing</v>

528
00:27:30.061 --> 00:27:33.810
<v Speaker 2>nothing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is speculation,</v>

529
00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:38.430
<v Speaker 2>but human beings are obviously always</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged in the exchange of labor,</v>

530
00:27:38.431 --> 00:27:40.740
<v Speaker 2>especially the reciprocal exchange of</v>
<v Speaker 2>labor.</v>

531
00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:45.741
<v Speaker 2>And you can imagine that in a in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>community where everyone knows everyone,</v>

532
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.350
<v Speaker 2>the people who work hard are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty irritated on a fairly chronic</v>

533
00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:52.020
<v Speaker 2>basis with the people who are completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>unproductive.</v>

534
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.760
<v Speaker 2>And my suspicions are that plenty of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who were completely unproductive</v>

535
00:27:56.761 --> 00:27:58.410
<v Speaker 2>in the history of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our,</v>

536
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.370
<v Speaker 2>of the evolution of our species were</v>
<v Speaker 2>wiped out by people who were unhappy</v>

537
00:28:02.371 --> 00:28:06.930
<v Speaker 2>with their lack of productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think generally speaking,</v>

538
00:28:06.931 --> 00:28:10.980
<v Speaker 2>human beings have this sense of ethical</v>
<v Speaker 2>obligation with regards to one another</v>

539
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.120
<v Speaker 2>to share labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people who are conscientious really,</v>

540
00:28:15.121 --> 00:28:19.560
<v Speaker 2>really feel that so they feel bad if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not busily working on something</v>

541
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.760
<v Speaker 2>that's productive all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the advantage to being with</v>

542
00:28:23.761 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 2>someone conscientious is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

543
00:28:25.081 --> 00:28:27.290
<v Speaker 2>they're going to work like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the disadvantages,</v>

544
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.150
<v Speaker 2>they're going to work like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

545
00:28:30.151 --> 00:28:33.560
<v Speaker 2>if you're looking for a partner that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to relax with or have fun with or</v>

546
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.420
<v Speaker 2>who isn't uptight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then a conscientious person is probably</v>

547
00:28:36.421 --> 00:28:38.790
<v Speaker 2>not a very good choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

548
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.150
<v Speaker 2>if you're a conscientious person and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're living with someone who's really</v>

549
00:28:42.151 --> 00:28:44.790
<v Speaker 2>unconscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good because they might be able</v>

550
00:28:44.791 --> 00:28:46.860
<v Speaker 2>to help you relax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to be happy with</v>

551
00:28:46.861 --> 00:28:48.720
<v Speaker 2>them because they don't work nearly as</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard as you do.</v>

552
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.780
<v Speaker 2>But even worse on the orderly dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

553
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.860
<v Speaker 2>some of you have had roommates and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more orderly than your roommate.</v>

554
00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:00.750
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means you're annoyed by mess before</v>

555
00:29:00.751 --> 00:29:05.100
<v Speaker 2>they are and you don't have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>annoyed by mess much before you're less</v>

556
00:29:05.101 --> 00:29:08.430
<v Speaker 2>orderly roommate for you to be the one</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always running around picking</v>

557
00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:11.520
<v Speaker 2>things up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so actually one of the things that's</v>

558
00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:15.360
<v Speaker 2>emerged from the psychometric analysis</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that women are slightly more orderly</v>

559
00:29:15.361 --> 00:29:18.120
<v Speaker 2>than men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I suspect that has something to do</v>

560
00:29:18.121 --> 00:29:20.010
<v Speaker 2>with Un.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you call it?</v>

561
00:29:20.011 --> 00:29:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Inequitable distribution of housework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because even if you're imagine that your</v>

562
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:29.100
<v Speaker 2>proclivity is to be triggered by</v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder 25 seconds before your</v>

563
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:31.500
<v Speaker 2>partners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you're going to end up.</v>

564
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:34.710
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take much difference for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the one that's always concerned</v>

565
00:29:34.711 --> 00:29:37.410
<v Speaker 2>about the mess first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways.</v>

566
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:40.680
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're a really orderly person</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you live with a disorderly person,</v>

567
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.450
<v Speaker 2>well good luck getting along with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to regard you as like</v>

568
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 2>uptight and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and over concerned with details and,</v>

569
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and well and unwilling to relax.</v>

570
00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're are going to regard you as</v>

571
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.520
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a bloody mess.</v>

572
00:29:57.521 --> 00:30:00.070
<v Speaker 2>And how can anyone possibly live with</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like you.</v>

573
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.610
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so another reason why it's useful to</v>

574
00:30:03.611 --> 00:30:07.930
<v Speaker 2>understand your personality is because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it gives you a better crack at</v>

575
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:11.530
<v Speaker 2>finding someone that you can actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>live with over the long run.</v>

576
00:30:11.531 --> 00:30:14.650
<v Speaker 2>And we don't know what the optimal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you want to live with</v>

577
00:30:14.651 --> 00:30:18.760
<v Speaker 2>someone who is exactly like you because</v>
<v Speaker 2>then both of you have the same strengths</v>

578
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:20.950
<v Speaker 2>and weaknesses and there's a bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem there,</v>

579
00:30:20.951 --> 00:30:23.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because maybe an agreeable person can</v>

580
00:30:23.861 --> 00:30:27.580
<v Speaker 2>use a bit of disagreeable person around</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to balance each other out and vice</v>

581
00:30:27.581 --> 00:30:28.414
<v Speaker 2>versa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

582
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.830
<v Speaker 2>So we don't understand the optimal</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance for,</v>

583
00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.260
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for longterm thriving in a relationship.</v>

584
00:30:35.261 --> 00:30:39.520
<v Speaker 2>But I think we do understand the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you're too different in your</v>

585
00:30:39.521 --> 00:30:42.070
<v Speaker 2>traits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that those where you're different is</v>

586
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:45.520
<v Speaker 2>going to constitute a chronic source of</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

587
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.960
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>

588
00:30:47.961 --> 00:30:49.450
<v Speaker 2>so you can think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

589
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how have psychologists studied</v>

590
00:30:54.821 --> 00:30:55.690
<v Speaker 2>personality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

591
00:30:55.691 --> 00:30:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to talk most about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>statistical psychometric approach to</v>

592
00:30:58.871 --> 00:31:01.360
<v Speaker 2>begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are other approaches that we</v>

593
00:31:01.361 --> 00:31:03.280
<v Speaker 2>will talk about as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

594
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me give you some let,</v>

595
00:31:06.881 --> 00:31:08.980
<v Speaker 2>let me give you the background on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>self report.</v>

596
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>methodology first because it's really</v>

597
00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:16.380
<v Speaker 2>formed the back bone of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of psychological research into</v>

598
00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:21.390
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you took a comprehensive</v>

599
00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:26.110
<v Speaker 2>sample of all the descriptive adjectives</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the English language.</v>

600
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's trickier than you think because</v>

601
00:31:29.081 --> 00:31:32.770
<v Speaker 2>actually what constitutes an adjective</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that easy to determine because</v>

602
00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:35.020
<v Speaker 2>many words have forms that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>adjective,</v>

603
00:31:35.021 --> 00:31:36.400
<v Speaker 2>verb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Noun,</v>

604
00:31:36.401 --> 00:31:39.220
<v Speaker 2>depending on how their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the same word is written out,</v>

605
00:31:39.221 --> 00:31:43.150
<v Speaker 2>so distinguishing adjectives from verbs</v>
<v Speaker 2>or adverbs turns out to be more</v>

606
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 2>difficult than you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just say for the sake of</v>

607
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:49.720
<v Speaker 2>argument that you could collect all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the descriptive adjectives in the</v>

608
00:31:49.721 --> 00:31:53.950
<v Speaker 2>English language and that then perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 2>you decided because you don't want to</v>

609
00:31:53.951 --> 00:31:56.470
<v Speaker 2>use all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you decided that you were going to use</v>

610
00:31:56.471 --> 00:32:01.310
<v Speaker 2>the most common thousand of them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are tables that enable,</v>

611
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:04.510
<v Speaker 2>enable you to look up the frequency of</v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

612
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.120
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out that in common</v>
<v Speaker 2>parlance,</v>

613
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:12.670
<v Speaker 2>it's like five percent of the vocabulary</v>
<v Speaker 2>of English language accounts for 95</v>

614
00:32:12.671 --> 00:32:15.460
<v Speaker 2>percent of the usage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an example of this phenomena called</v>

615
00:32:15.461 --> 00:32:17.650
<v Speaker 2>the burrito distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we'll talk about later.</v>

616
00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:22.330
<v Speaker 2>So in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most discourse has done with 500 words.</v>

617
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.360
<v Speaker 2>You can get about 80 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that of speech in terms</v>

618
00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:29.950
<v Speaker 2>of single word comprehension with 500</v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

619
00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:34.240
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you took the thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you took all the descriptive adjectives</v>

620
00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.940
<v Speaker 2>and then you took the ones that were the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most common thousand.</v>

621
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.740
<v Speaker 2>And so here's the hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis part,</v>

622
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.990
<v Speaker 2>and this is a critical thing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is called the linguistic</v>

623
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:48.890
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The linguistic hypothesis is that</v>

624
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:54.820
<v Speaker 2>variation in personality among human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings is of sufficient import so that</v>

625
00:32:56.211 --> 00:32:59.660
<v Speaker 2>it's become accurately coded in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lexicon.</v>

626
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.100
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is that roughly</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>

627
00:33:04.101 --> 00:33:07.550
<v Speaker 2>is that over the course of the evolution</v>
<v Speaker 2>or evolution of any language,</v>

628
00:33:07.551 --> 00:33:12.551
<v Speaker 2>we use English as the example here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>descriptive terms have been generated</v>

629
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:18.040
<v Speaker 2>that actually do cover the variation in</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality and that essentially cover</v>

630
00:33:18.411 --> 00:33:20.030
<v Speaker 2>them without bias.</v>

631
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

632
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:26.810
<v Speaker 2>It's an axiom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because the hypothesis is in some</v>

633
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:28.910
<v Speaker 2>sense isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not exactly testable.</v>

634
00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.630
<v Speaker 2>We'll leave that aside for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's testable a little bit,</v>

635
00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:33.770
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not easily.</v>

636
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.600
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the first thing you have to</v>

637
00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:38.030
<v Speaker 2>accept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to accept that it's possible to</v>

638
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:41.840
<v Speaker 2>extract out what constitutes personality</v>
<v Speaker 2>by looking at the linguistic</v>

639
00:33:41.841 --> 00:33:46.790
<v Speaker 2>representation of descriptors in so far</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they're encapsulated in language.</v>

640
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>

641
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.300
<v Speaker 2>when people talk about trait models,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the big five being comprehensive</v>

642
00:33:53.301 --> 00:33:58.010
<v Speaker 2>representations of personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that isn't exactly what they mean</v>

643
00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:02.360
<v Speaker 2>and you need to know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they mean is that it's a</v>

644
00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:06.680
<v Speaker 2>comprehensive representation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality in so far as personality has</v>

645
00:34:06.681 --> 00:34:10.430
<v Speaker 2>been encapsulated in language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There may be elements of personality</v>

646
00:34:10.431 --> 00:34:13.310
<v Speaker 2>that we haven't been able to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we don't know how to talk about that</v>

647
00:34:13.311 --> 00:34:16.880
<v Speaker 2>are of crucial importance and there may</v>
<v Speaker 2>not be,</v>

648
00:34:16.881 --> 00:34:19.970
<v Speaker 2>but the big five theorists assume that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there aren't.</v>

649
00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:22.003
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

650
00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

651
00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.480
<v Speaker 2>that's a limitation of the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you accept that,</v>

652
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.591
<v Speaker 2>then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

653
00:34:27.591 --> 00:34:31.760
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you want to do is take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively random cross section of the</v>

654
00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:36.761
<v Speaker 2>descriptive terms because then you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduce bias into the initial stages</v>

655
00:34:36.921 --> 00:34:38.760
<v Speaker 2>of the inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Matt,</v>

656
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you something that we did</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently and you can tell me what you</v>

657
00:34:41.811 --> 00:34:44.450
<v Speaker 2>think about its analogous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to study political</v>

658
00:34:44.451 --> 00:34:47.180
<v Speaker 2>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what the first thing we're trying</v>

659
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:49.340
<v Speaker 2>to figure out was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there even such a thing?</v>

660
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the political dialogue,</v>

661
00:34:52.851 --> 00:34:56.990
<v Speaker 2>what you find is that people on the side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the political spectrum who have been</v>

662
00:34:56.991 --> 00:35:00.420
<v Speaker 2>defined as politically correct tend to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say that it doesn't exist and that</v>

663
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.950
<v Speaker 2>category is just a pejorative term that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was invented by people who hold</v>

664
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.080
<v Speaker 2>alternative political opinions.</v>

665
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.970
<v Speaker 2>And so the first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

666
00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:12.740
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean some does it exist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by exist?</v>

667
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.110
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you tell if a psychological</v>

668
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:19.250
<v Speaker 2>concept is real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his anger is anger or something</v>

669
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:23.120
<v Speaker 2>that exists objectively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it done an objective phenomena?</v>

670
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy to,</v>

671
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.240
<v Speaker 2>to determine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

672
00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:29.690
<v Speaker 2>well we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we act like it is and we understand what</v>

673
00:35:29.691 --> 00:35:34.640
<v Speaker 2>anger means if but no one goes around in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and says anger without saying</v>

674
00:35:34.641 --> 00:35:36.350
<v Speaker 2>anything else or you'd run away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

675
00:35:36.351 --> 00:35:38.600
<v Speaker 2>You know what they do is they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

676
00:35:38.601 --> 00:35:43.230
<v Speaker 2>they placed the word anger into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence and place the sentence within a</v>

677
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:47.550
<v Speaker 2>conversation and they enable you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>infer exactly what they mean by the word</v>

678
00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:50.160
<v Speaker 2>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by listening to the surrounding context.</v>

679
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're going to turn that into</v>

680
00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 2>something like an objective term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do is you pull out the term</v>

681
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.790
<v Speaker 2>anger and then you make the hypothesis</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it represents something real in the</v>

682
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:00.810
<v Speaker 2>objective world.</v>

683
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:04.200
<v Speaker 2>But it's not that easy to determine if</v>
<v Speaker 2>something does exist,</v>

684
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.680
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's a psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena in the real world.</v>

685
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:11.520
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by exist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem of construct</v>

686
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:12.660
<v Speaker 2>validation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

687
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.270
<v Speaker 2>so that's another term you really need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know if you're interested in</v>

688
00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:18.300
<v Speaker 2>experimental psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially on the personality and a</v>

689
00:36:18.301 --> 00:36:23.301
<v Speaker 2>construct is a representation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>something psychological that</v>

690
00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Objectively,</v>

691
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.350
<v Speaker 2>how do you establish its existence</v>
<v Speaker 2>objectively?</v>

692
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does fear exist?</v>

693
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Now you have the problem with all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional terms.</v>

694
00:36:33.931 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Does joy exist to surprise exist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does embarrassment exists?</v>

695
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Does guilt exist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shame?</v>

696
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 2>How are they related to one of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>guilt and shame,</v>

697
00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:43.650
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem quite similar to one another.</v>

698
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And pain and fear and anger all seem to</v>

699
00:36:46.891 --> 00:36:48.110
<v Speaker 2>share the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

700
00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.180
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attribute of unpleasant and negative</v>

701
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:53.370
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so how similar,</v>

702
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.680
<v Speaker 2>how something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If something exists,</v>

703
00:36:55.681 --> 00:36:58.560
<v Speaker 2>it should be the same as some things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>different from other things,</v>

704
00:36:58.561 --> 00:37:03.150
<v Speaker 2>and that's part of construct validation</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well to specify how the construct is</v>

705
00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:05.700
<v Speaker 2>the same as some things and different</v>
<v Speaker 2>from others.</v>

706
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Anger should be reliably distinguishable</v>
<v Speaker 2>from joy,</v>

707
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.370
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise they're not different</v>

708
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:15.300
<v Speaker 2>and anger and fear should be somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same if they're both negative</v>

709
00:37:15.301 --> 00:37:18.860
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's extraordinarily complex to to,</v>

710
00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.530
<v Speaker 2>to validate a construct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so here,</v>

711
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.180
<v Speaker 2>here's what we did with political</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness and it's.</v>

712
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.710
<v Speaker 2>The reason I'm using the political</v>
<v Speaker 2>examples is because that's an obvious</v>

713
00:37:28.711 --> 00:37:33.480
<v Speaker 2>place where self serving bias can enter</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientific arena.</v>

714
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I wanted to make a point about</v>

715
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:41.070
<v Speaker 2>political correctness or if I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a point about rightwing fascism,</v>

716
00:37:41.071 --> 00:37:45.390
<v Speaker 2>I could build my biases into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>measurement instruments accidentally and</v>

717
00:37:45.391 --> 00:37:48.660
<v Speaker 2>then they would produce as output,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I put into them as input.</v>

718
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.810
<v Speaker 2>And I want to protect myself against</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if I actually want to do this</v>

719
00:37:51.811 --> 00:37:56.460
<v Speaker 2>scientific investigation properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what we did when we started to</v>

720
00:37:56.461 --> 00:38:00.660
<v Speaker 2>construct our measures of political</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness was getting employee a</v>

721
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:05.340
<v Speaker 2>number of people to go through as many</v>
<v Speaker 2>news sources as they could get their</v>

722
00:38:05.341 --> 00:38:09.690
<v Speaker 2>hands on to identify any attitude or</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

723
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.590
<v Speaker 2>some roughly that that had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>described by anyone at all as</v>

724
00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:15.330
<v Speaker 2>potentially politically correct.</v>

725
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:19.200
<v Speaker 2>So it was kind of agnostic and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do it as randomly as possible,</v>

726
00:38:19.201 --> 00:38:20.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get as many new sources as we</v>

727
00:38:20.971 --> 00:38:25.971
<v Speaker 2>possibly could so that we were sampling</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the environment without bias.</v>

728
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then we came up with,</v>

729
00:38:28.141 --> 00:38:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple hundred,</v>

730
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.950
<v Speaker 2>maybe more a couple hundred items that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were roughly indicative of what you</v>

731
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.750
<v Speaker 2>might describe as political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not good enough,</v>

732
00:38:37.751 --> 00:38:39.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because just because you have this</v>

733
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:43.510
<v Speaker 2>random assemblage of items doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>indicate at all that they're all</v>

734
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 2>measuring something that was similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just implicit.</v>

735
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:48.970
<v Speaker 2>They're all called political</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness,</v>

736
00:38:48.971 --> 00:38:51.760
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know if those attitudes</v>
<v Speaker 2>covariant.</v>

737
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:55.480
<v Speaker 2>What that means is if you held one</v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude of that list,</v>

738
00:38:55.481 --> 00:38:59.200
<v Speaker 2>were you more likely to hold another or</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple others?</v>

739
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is the conditional probability of</v>

740
00:39:02.351 --> 00:39:07.210
<v Speaker 2>holding multiple items.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a high probability of holding</v>

741
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.560
<v Speaker 2>true multiple items simultaneously while</v>
<v Speaker 2>you figure that out with factor</v>

742
00:39:11.561 --> 00:39:12.040
<v Speaker 2>analysis?</v>

743
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.700
<v Speaker 2>So what we did is we turned that into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>questionnaire using different question</v>

744
00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:19.840
<v Speaker 2>types and we administered it to several</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred people and we did a factor</v>

745
00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:22.930
<v Speaker 2>analysis and we found actually that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was such a thing as political</v>

746
00:39:22.931 --> 00:39:25.960
<v Speaker 2>correctness because the questions</v>
<v Speaker 2>clumped together,</v>

747
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:28.900
<v Speaker 2>people would reliably answered them in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern manner,</v>

748
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.660
<v Speaker 2>but that there were actually two</v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensions that were quite separate.</v>

749
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.970
<v Speaker 2>So there isn't one political</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness,</v>

750
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:37.360
<v Speaker 2>there seems to be two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we looked at the personality</v>

751
00:39:37.361 --> 00:39:41.230
<v Speaker 2>predictors in the ICU predictors in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>variety of other predictors that would</v>

752
00:39:41.231 --> 00:39:46.231
<v Speaker 2>enable us to come to some understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the temperamental proclivity towards</v>

753
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:48.880
<v Speaker 2>those political attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if any.</v>

754
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:54.090
<v Speaker 2>We knew already that</v>
<v Speaker 2>political conservatives tended to be low</v>

755
00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:58.090
<v Speaker 2>in trait openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the creativity dimension and high</v>

756
00:39:58.091 --> 00:40:01.870
<v Speaker 2>in trait conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas political liberals tended to be</v>

757
00:40:01.871 --> 00:40:04.960
<v Speaker 2>high in trait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>openness and low in conscientiousness.</v>

758
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:09.130
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily interesting to know from</v>

759
00:40:09.131 --> 00:40:13.360
<v Speaker 2>the big five perspective is that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>political proclivities are very</v>

760
00:40:13.361 --> 00:40:15.340
<v Speaker 2>powerfully influenced by your</v>
<v Speaker 2>temperament.</v>

761
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:19.120
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things you can think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about with regards to ongoing political</v>

762
00:40:19.121 --> 00:40:23.230
<v Speaker 2>discussions in the real world is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>those discussions are actually attempts</v>

763
00:40:23.231 --> 00:40:26.320
<v Speaker 2>by people of different temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

764
00:40:26.321 --> 00:40:31.321
<v Speaker 2>to impose their temperamental viewpoints</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the world and to to engage in a</v>

765
00:40:31.631 --> 00:40:34.720
<v Speaker 2>dialogue with people who are actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite different than they are.</v>

766
00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:39.550
<v Speaker 2>So like conscientious people like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they value hard work,</v>

767
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.170
<v Speaker 2>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>order</v>

768
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.060
<v Speaker 2>reliability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity and structure.</v>

769
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:50.050
<v Speaker 2>And so their dutiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We analyze what predicted military</v>

770
00:40:50.051 --> 00:40:51.130
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

771
00:40:51.131 --> 00:40:54.100
<v Speaker 2>in theU ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s army overwhelmingly conscientiousness.</v>

772
00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:55.540
<v Speaker 2>It's not surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

773
00:40:55.541 --> 00:41:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a very structured rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ordered top down,</v>

774
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:05.750
<v Speaker 2>a follow procedure sort of endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the armed forces had problems with</v>

775
00:41:06.641 --> 00:41:09.970
<v Speaker 2>that to some degree because they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>also simultaneously looking for people</v>

776
00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.460
<v Speaker 2>who could think independently on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>

777
00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're in a battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

778
00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.170
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're isolated from your</v>
<v Speaker 2>command structure,</v>

779
00:41:17.171 --> 00:41:20.530
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna be times when you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make extraordinarily difficult decisions</v>

780
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:24.220
<v Speaker 2>on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're selected primarily for</v>

781
00:41:24.221 --> 00:41:26.740
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to be your forte</v>

782
00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:28.480
<v Speaker 2>because if you're a conscientious</v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

783
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.870
<v Speaker 2>what happens is that you enter into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>contract with someone,</v>

784
00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 2>even yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you carry it out.</v>

785
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:38.450
<v Speaker 2>So now we've also spent a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>selecting entrepreneurs.</v>

786
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I work with this company in California</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has started schools for</v>

787
00:41:43.521 --> 00:41:48.140
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs in 100 and now I think 160</v>
<v Speaker 2>different countries all over the world.</v>

788
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:51.130
<v Speaker 2>This the guy who started this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose name is Dale Resi,</v>

789
00:41:51.131 --> 00:41:53.000
<v Speaker 2>he's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an absolute monster.</v>

790
00:41:53.001 --> 00:41:54.590
<v Speaker 2>The guy started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

791
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 2>he started all those schools in five</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

792
00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:01.400
<v Speaker 2>165 schools in all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all across the world,</v>

793
00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:05.060
<v Speaker 2>eight different languages and we've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>screening people for entrepreneurial</v>

794
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:07.190
<v Speaker 2>ability and if you're going to be an</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneur,</v>

795
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:09.230
<v Speaker 2>you almost have the opposite profile.</v>

796
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.470
<v Speaker 2>As a soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're very high in openness and you're</v>

797
00:42:12.471 --> 00:42:15.980
<v Speaker 2>lowering conscientiousness or at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness is irrelevant.</v>

798
00:42:15.981 --> 00:42:19.850
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that seems to be that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're an orderly person and</v>

799
00:42:19.851 --> 00:42:21.950
<v Speaker 2>you'd like to follow procedures and</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules,</v>

800
00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.580
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of hard for you to start a</v>
<v Speaker 2>company because when you first start a</v>

801
00:42:25.581 --> 00:42:27.860
<v Speaker 2>company or engage in any other creative</v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

802
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:30.380
<v Speaker 2>because entrepreneurs turn out to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same as artists,</v>

803
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:34.400
<v Speaker 2>you kind of have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not operating within a rural</v>

804
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:35.720
<v Speaker 2>governance structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

805
00:42:35.721 --> 00:42:40.721
<v Speaker 2>there may be many times where you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to break a small rule to to move</v>

806
00:42:41.421 --> 00:42:45.800
<v Speaker 2>properly at a higher level of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no algorithmic way of generating</v>

807
00:42:45.801 --> 00:42:46.940
<v Speaker 2>a new company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

808
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's people who are very high in</v>

809
00:42:49.941 --> 00:42:52.430
<v Speaker 2>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who happened to be good entrepreneurs.</v>

810
00:42:52.431 --> 00:42:56.620
<v Speaker 2>And so this is something I thought was</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily cool because we'd.</v>

811
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 2>We'd also already known what predicts</v>
<v Speaker 2>managerial,</v>

812
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:04.331
<v Speaker 2>administrative and academic ability and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iq is crucial for any complex jobs.</v>

813
00:43:04.701 --> 00:43:07.880
<v Speaker 2>So we'll just leave that behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what predicts academic ability,</v>

814
00:43:07.881 --> 00:43:12.020
<v Speaker 2>for example at the University of Toronto</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in intelligence obviously,</v>

815
00:43:12.021 --> 00:43:15.530
<v Speaker 2>but also conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The correlation between creativity and</v>

816
00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:18.980
<v Speaker 2>grades at the UFT is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>

817
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.690
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not.</v>

818
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not surprising that the thing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

819
00:43:23.031 --> 00:43:25.940
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to be cynical about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things you have to</v>

820
00:43:25.941 --> 00:43:30.560
<v Speaker 2>understand about creative people is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they continually step outside of the</v>

821
00:43:30.561 --> 00:43:33.110
<v Speaker 2>domain of evaluation structures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

822
00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're going to say you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to evaluate the performance of 100</v>

823
00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:41.360
<v Speaker 2>professors on their lecturing ability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you kind of have to measure what's</v>

824
00:43:41.361 --> 00:43:45.590
<v Speaker 2>common across all the professors in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to come up with the standards for</v>

825
00:43:45.591 --> 00:43:48.320
<v Speaker 2>evaluation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that means you're not going to be</v>

826
00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 2>able to use that structure to evaluate a</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly creative professor because</v>

827
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:56.570
<v Speaker 2>he or she is going to do something in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that's so different that it won't</v>

828
00:43:56.571 --> 00:43:59.990
<v Speaker 2>show up on the evaluation measure and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that of course that's what happens in</v>

829
00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:00.650
<v Speaker 2>universities.</v>

830
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:04.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody sent me a couple of days ago,</v>

831
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:08.150
<v Speaker 2>somebody sent me an essay that they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>written for their master's thesis that</v>

832
00:44:08.151 --> 00:44:12.650
<v Speaker 2>was wildly creative and they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically told to leave the program and</v>

833
00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.720
<v Speaker 2>that they couldn't continue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not in a mean way.</v>

834
00:44:14.721 --> 00:44:16.820
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened was that what they were</v>

835
00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:20.930
<v Speaker 2>thinking was so outside of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conventions in the discipline is that no</v>

836
00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:22.880
<v Speaker 2>one had any idea what to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>essay,</v>

837
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.030
<v Speaker 2>so then that's really the law of</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative people,</v>

838
00:44:26.031 --> 00:44:27.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always stepping outside of</v>

839
00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:31.740
<v Speaker 2>evaluation structures and so it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>that surprising that relationship</v>

840
00:44:31.741 --> 00:44:35.220
<v Speaker 2>between creativity and grades at the u</v>
<v Speaker 2>of t is zero.</v>

841
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.940
<v Speaker 2>We found out as well by looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate student performance across</v>

842
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:43.200
<v Speaker 2>multiple institutions that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative correlation between creativity</v>

843
00:44:43.201 --> 00:44:46.200
<v Speaker 2>and graduate school performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even zero.</v>

844
00:44:46.201 --> 00:44:50.550
<v Speaker 2>It was worse than negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being creative was negative and you</v>

845
00:44:50.551 --> 00:44:52.170
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that could make you cynical as</v>

846
00:44:52.171 --> 00:44:52.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

847
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:57.790
<v Speaker 2>But you can't be cynical in that way</v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things that happens</v>

848
00:44:58.021 --> 00:45:03.021
<v Speaker 2>in science is that science tends to</v>
<v Speaker 2>progress incrementally rather than in</v>

849
00:45:03.091 --> 00:45:07.110
<v Speaker 2>great leaps now and then someone comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>along who blows the structure out of a</v>

850
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:10.170
<v Speaker 2>science advances at a ridiculously like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Einstein,</v>

851
00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:13.530
<v Speaker 2>but like most people are nine style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be thank God for that.</v>

852
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time you're in a discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

853
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:20.340
<v Speaker 2>you understand the discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then once you've developed</v>

854
00:45:20.341 --> 00:45:24.480
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what the next micro question is</v>

855
00:45:24.481 --> 00:45:28.500
<v Speaker 2>that should be answered and part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason that science is so powerful is</v>

856
00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:32.850
<v Speaker 2>because it allows people who aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>genius level creatives to make real</v>

857
00:45:32.851 --> 00:45:37.200
<v Speaker 2>advances in the generation of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One tiny micro step at a time,</v>

858
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:42.030
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter if there's 100,000 people</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it and each of them is making a</v>

859
00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:42.930
<v Speaker 2>micro step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

860
00:45:42.931 --> 00:45:45.780
<v Speaker 2>we're zipping along as fast as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly wanted zip along,</v>

861
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.060
<v Speaker 2>and so it turns out to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness.</v>

862
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.490
<v Speaker 2>That's the excellent predictor of</v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate student performance.</v>

863
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:54.270
<v Speaker 2>That's the best predictor for law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best predictor for managerial</v>

864
00:45:54.271 --> 00:45:55.800
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best predictor for</v>

865
00:45:55.801 --> 00:45:59.400
<v Speaker 2>administrative positions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that has a structure of rules</v>

866
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:03.360
<v Speaker 2>that needs to be applied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conscientiousness is a great predictor,</v>

867
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:07.140
<v Speaker 2>so but it's not good for predicting</v>
<v Speaker 2>artistic ability or entrepreneurial</v>

868
00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:10.050
<v Speaker 2>ability and that's also really important</v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things.</v>

869
00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:13.650
<v Speaker 2>This is partly why bureaucracies</v>
<v Speaker 2>stultify right?</v>

870
00:46:13.651 --> 00:46:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Because what happens is they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they develop,</v>

871
00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:19.290
<v Speaker 2>they get chock full of conscientious</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with a few psychopaths thrown in</v>

872
00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:23.040
<v Speaker 2>there just for good measure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get chocked full of conscientious</v>

873
00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:26.910
<v Speaker 2>people busily zooming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiently down to a single track,</v>

874
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.630
<v Speaker 2>and then all of a sudden the landscape</v>
<v Speaker 2>shifts and they're going very,</v>

875
00:46:30.631 --> 00:46:34.230
<v Speaker 2>very efficiently in exactly the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction and then the whole bloody</v>

876
00:46:34.231 --> 00:46:37.740
<v Speaker 2>thing falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need to have some creative wing</v>

877
00:46:37.741 --> 00:46:42.741
<v Speaker 2>knots in your organization to come up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with completely absurd ideas that might</v>

878
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:44.700
<v Speaker 2>just on the off chance be true.</v>

879
00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:47.850
<v Speaker 2>And so creativity is strange in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>manner too.</v>

880
00:46:47.851 --> 00:46:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high return game.</v>

881
00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:55.580
<v Speaker 2>You're a lot safer in your life to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>a functioning entity and to operate as a</v>

882
00:46:55.771 --> 00:46:58.710
<v Speaker 2>cog within it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as the entity keeps functioning.</v>

883
00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're creative and you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>off on tangents all the time,</v>

884
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.050
<v Speaker 2>there's some probability that one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those tangents is going to be exactly</v>

885
00:47:07.051 --> 00:47:10.170
<v Speaker 2>what is needed at the time and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to become hyper successful as a</v>

886
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:12.750
<v Speaker 2>consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's much more probability that</v>

887
00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:15.810
<v Speaker 2>even though your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of your ideas might be highly</v>

888
00:47:15.811 --> 00:47:18.600
<v Speaker 2>valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that this is the right</v>

889
00:47:18.601 --> 00:47:21.780
<v Speaker 2>time and place for them is</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily low,</v>

890
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:24.420
<v Speaker 2>so to produce a successful creative</v>
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>

891
00:47:24.421 --> 00:47:25.830
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the marketplace,</v>

892
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:30.880
<v Speaker 2>you need a ridiculous combination of</v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity so that you keep generating</v>

893
00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:35.881
<v Speaker 2>ideas and then a network around you of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have skills that you don't</v>

894
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.820
<v Speaker 2>and then the production of a of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>

895
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 2>let's say whatever that happens to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually in demand by the</v>

896
00:47:43.271 --> 00:47:48.040
<v Speaker 2>marketplace at exactly that moment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone else hasn't already done</v>

897
00:47:48.041 --> 00:47:48.874
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

898
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:53.910
<v Speaker 2>So the sensible thing to tell anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wants to be creative is that stupid.</v>

899
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:55.880
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

900
00:47:55.881 --> 00:48:00.790
<v Speaker 2>it's your probability of success is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>low that it's better just to do</v>

901
00:48:00.791 --> 00:48:03.340
<v Speaker 2>something sensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with that is that</v>

902
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:07.270
<v Speaker 2>creative people can't do that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're creative and if they shut down</v>

903
00:48:07.271 --> 00:48:09.820
<v Speaker 2>their creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like an extrovert who's gone to</v>

904
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:12.280
<v Speaker 2>live in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an isolated cell,</v>

905
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.560
<v Speaker 2>a creative person who isn't being</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative,</v>

906
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just wither and die.</v>

907
00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.730
<v Speaker 2>So they're stuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

908
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:21.670
<v Speaker 2>But it is a high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high return strategy.</v>

909
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:26.290
<v Speaker 2>So probably better if you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative or if you are and you should</v>

910
00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:29.260
<v Speaker 2>take this advice to heart because I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>been watching people for a long time.</v>

911
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.840
<v Speaker 2>If you want to engage in a creative</v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuit,</v>

912
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:37.500
<v Speaker 2>you should find something stable to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will generate you an income and you</v>

913
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:40.930
<v Speaker 2>should pursue the thing that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative about on the side because</v>

914
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.880
<v Speaker 2>monetizing creative production is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody difficult that especially now</v>

915
00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.100
<v Speaker 2>like especially in like artistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>domains,</v>

916
00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.960
<v Speaker 2>generation of music and that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

917
00:48:49.961 --> 00:48:54.961
<v Speaker 2>It's like you just have no idea how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>million songs there are on the Internet</v>

918
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.740
<v Speaker 2>and the vast majority of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercially available get downloaded</v>

919
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.060
<v Speaker 2>zero times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 80 per,</v>

920
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I think there's 80 million songs or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that on the net and I</v>

921
00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:08.590
<v Speaker 2>believe it's something in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood of 70 million get</v>

922
00:49:08.591 --> 00:49:13.591
<v Speaker 2>downloaded zero times and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 that can get downloaded like $350</v>

923
00:49:14.131 --> 00:49:16.600
<v Speaker 2>million times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those people are wildly</v>

924
00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:19.420
<v Speaker 2>successful and everyone else collapses</v>
<v Speaker 2>in failure.</v>

925
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:20.343
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

926
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:25.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about that more.</v>

927
00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's not a bad overview for,</v>

928
00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:30.310
<v Speaker 2>for initial foray into psychometrics.</v>
