00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.283
<v Speaker 1>Hi there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my message to millennials about </v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>how to change the world and I would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to change the world properly.</v>

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question then is,</v>

4
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what do you mean by properly?</v>

5
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

6
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to walk through that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

7
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>So I'm gonna and I've also got an offer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make to any millennials that are,</v>

8
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>are willing to watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

9
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.383
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was triggered in part by something </v>

10
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:26.604
<v Speaker 1>I read recently by Jonathan Haidt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Haidt is the professor of </v>

11
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:30.024
<v Speaker 1>ethical leadership at a Nyu stern school</v>
<v Speaker 1>of business and he's been a very astute </v>

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.973
<v Speaker 1>commentator recently on some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political battles that have been going </v>

13
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>on in the social sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm noting,</v>

14
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:40.554
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is very little political </v>

15
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:43.044
<v Speaker 1>diversity in the views of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists and perhaps even less on the </v>

16
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>part of the people in the humanities.</v>

17
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.103
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hate recently wrote something which </v>

18
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:51.564
<v Speaker 1>will all put a you linked to in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of this video where he </v>

19
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.354
<v Speaker 1>claimed that universities have to decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>between social justice and truth and on </v>

20
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:02.454
<v Speaker 1>the side of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he puts a philosopher called named John </v>

21
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.083
<v Speaker 1>Stuart Mill and English philosopher who </v>
<v Speaker 1>said he who knows only his side of the </v>

22
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:10.254
<v Speaker 1>case knows little of that his reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be good and no one may have been </v>

23
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:14.904
<v Speaker 1>able to refute them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he is equally unable to refute </v>

24
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 1>the reasons on the opposite side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he does not,</v>

25
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>he does not so much as know what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

26
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>He has no grown for preferring either </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

27
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>And then he juxtaposes John Stuart mill </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Karl Marx who said,</v>

28
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>the philosophers have only interpreted </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world in various ways.</v>

29
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.243
<v Speaker 1>The point is to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He considers marks the patron saint of </v>

30
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.443
<v Speaker 1>social justice university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is oriented around changing the </v>

31
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>world in part by overthrowing power </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures and privilege.</v>

32
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>It sees political diversity as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle to action.</v>

33
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

34
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:48.594
<v Speaker 1>according to hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the patron saint of what he calls </v>

35
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would,</v>

36
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:52.264
<v Speaker 1>she's truth as a process in which flawed</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals challenging each other's </v>

37
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>biased and incomplete reasoning and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the process all become smarter,</v>

38
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.013
<v Speaker 1>hate points out the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>University dies when it becomes </v>

39
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>intellectually uniform or politically </v>
<v Speaker 1>orthodox.</v>

40
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.383
<v Speaker 1>So I guess this video is in part my call</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with Jonathan Haidt for young </v>

41
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:12.504
<v Speaker 1>people to join truth university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a problem with that because </v>

42
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>the university is where the truth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being sought.</v>

43
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.853
<v Speaker 1>That's the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a problem and that is that </v>

44
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>young people want to change the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's part of what piaget,</v>

45
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:25.584
<v Speaker 1>the developmental psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget called the messianic stage and </v>

46
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>there's some real utility in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're social creatures and,</v>

47
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we construct ourselves and,</v>

48
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:36.764
<v Speaker 1>and formulate ourselves and bring our </v>
<v Speaker 1>own character into being predicated on </v>

49
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our biological,</v>

50
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>a platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our biological being.</v>

51
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>We also simultaneously have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrate,</v>

52
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.723
<v Speaker 1>adjust to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrate with and negotiate with </v>

53
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>society which sometimes needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

54
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>The structure of society has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>preserved,</v>

55
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be updated and improved as</v>
<v Speaker 1>it moves forward.</v>

56
00:02:57.101 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the problem is how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>update and improve it without doing that</v>

57
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>so rapidly that you destroy everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>of any value.</v>

58
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>So the problem I have with the Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

59
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>and I've had this problem with it for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>

60
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>is that I don't think that you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust people whose primary goal,</v>

61
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

62
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.693
<v Speaker 1>when they're attempting to change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world for the better is to change other </v>

63
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:18.574
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell who those people are </v>

64
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>because they're always blaming other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and they're looking for victims.</v>

65
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for perpetrators and </v>
<v Speaker 1>victims.</v>

66
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>And then they're going off to stop the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetrators.</v>

67
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's wrong because as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn said,</v>

68
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>he's a great Russian writer who helped </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring down the Soviet Union.</v>

69
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>He said the line between good and evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>runs down every,</v>

70
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.980
<v Speaker 1>every human's heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

71
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>so the real battle as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

72
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:41.074
<v Speaker 1>and I think this goes along with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition in which John Stuart mill is </v>

73
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.123
<v Speaker 1>firmly placed and is that to overcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny and malevolence and chaos and </v>

74
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:50.944
<v Speaker 1>nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the desire to bring everything to a </v>

75
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>halt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to repair the fissures.</v>

76
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>And the and the riff that's in your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul basically,</v>

77
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>and that means that you have to confront</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil that lives in your own heart.</v>

78
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:04.144
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a statement from the New </v>

79
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:05.944
<v Speaker 1>Testament that I think is very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>apropos with regards to this particular </v>

80
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a car.</v>

81
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 1>There's this part of the sermon on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mount,</v>

82
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 1>which is a central text in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Western,</v>

83
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:17.134
<v Speaker 1>in the western tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say obviously central to </v>

84
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:19.144
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but central to everything that Western </v>

85
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 1>civilization has built.</v>

86
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.080
<v Speaker 1>And so Christ says to his followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>why behold thou the moat that is in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother's eye,</v>

88
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.113
<v Speaker 1>but consider it's not the beam that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>in [inaudible] or how will they'll say </v>

89
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:37.770
<v Speaker 1>to thy brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me pull out the mote out of Sinai.</v>

90
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 1>And behold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beam is in Dine Oni.</v>

91
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Thou hypocrite first cast out the beam </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the nine Onei.</v>

92
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 1>And then shalt thou see clearly to cast </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of thy brother's eye.</v>

93
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 1>While I like that quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it places the responsibility for</v>

94
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>change at every level of being on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

95
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>And obviously the individual interacts </v>
<v Speaker 1>with society.</v>

96
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:00.934
<v Speaker 1>But the idea here is that unless the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual straightens out his or her </v>

97
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:04.774
<v Speaker 1>own soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no possibility that the impact </v>

98
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>the individual can have on society can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be anything,</v>

99
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:12.820
<v Speaker 1>but let's say harmful in proportion to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the harm that's still in the soul.</v>

100
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.983
<v Speaker 1>These are important things to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are vitally important things to </v>

101
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:17.680
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

102
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:18.514
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then we're faced with a conundrum </v>

103
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>that young people also want to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

104
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>But that's no problem because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can bring.</v>

105
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>You can bring truth university together </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a desire to,</v>

106
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.590
<v Speaker 1>to make real change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but change,</v>

107
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change has to start in the right place.</v>

108
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.063
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to tell you how I think you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should change yourself so that you can </v>

109
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 1>change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

110
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.320
<v Speaker 1>the world that you bring into being will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a better world in order.</v>

111
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Worst one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>

112
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to know about this,</v>

113
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:44.584
<v Speaker 1>that the world that the followers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mark's brought into being in the 20th </v>

114
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 1>century killed more than 100 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say in China and Russia,</v>

115
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.700
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in places like Cambodia and Vietnam,</v>

116
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 1>the world certainly changed as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence Marxist doctrine,</v>

117
00:05:57.921 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't change in in a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

118
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.793
<v Speaker 1>And of course the Marxist doctrine is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is making itself heard in a massive way </v>

119
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 1>across the west again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

120
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

121
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:09.620
<v Speaker 1>so what should you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

122
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an idea.</v>

123
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you have to do is Orient</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yourself.</v>

124
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Now you probably have all watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio.</v>

125
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.443
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio was about how a Marionette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone whose whose strings are being </v>

126
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 1>pulled by forces beyond his </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehension.</v>

127
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the situation of the undeveloped </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual Japan Eto,</v>

128
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>who's a benevolent father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so benevolent,</v>

129
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 1>a symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a symbol of benevolent culture,</v>

130
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>makes a puppet his son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then wishes on a star.</v>

131
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:36.704
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a star is something that glitters up in </v>

132
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>the sky and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

133
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>it's associated with the transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the beyond and the divine.</v>

134
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look up in the night sky and it's</v>

135
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 1>very dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a feeling of arts because you're</v>

136
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 1>confronting your soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

137
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Your individual soul is confronting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmos and you can feel the relationship</v>

138
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>between you and and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the totality.</v>

139
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 1>So looking up into the sky as a like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious experience,</v>

140
00:06:58.311 --> 00:06:59.144
<v Speaker 1>if it's a starry sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to wish upon a star is to find in a </v>

141
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 1>light that orients you like the North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Star,</v>

142
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.013
<v Speaker 1>and to pick a highest goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pick the highest school you can </v>

143
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 1>conceive of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what Japan does.</v>

144
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:10.754
<v Speaker 1>He raises his eyes above his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his day to day concerns and tries to </v>

145
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 1>establish a relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest of all possible values.</v>

146
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

147
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:20.174
<v Speaker 1>and he has the most profound of wishes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the most profound of wishes is that </v>

148
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 1>the puppet that he's created could </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a genuine individual,</v>

149
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:28.970
<v Speaker 1>genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully,</v>

150
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.833
<v Speaker 1>fully developed human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you can wish for </v>

151
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.730
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you can wish and,</v>

152
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:34.271
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

153
00:07:34.271 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>and aim for that in yourself.</v>

154
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 1>And then you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you deal with the suffering.</v>

155
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:39.434
<v Speaker 1>That's attendant on life because life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and because life is very hard </v>

156
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:43.334
<v Speaker 1>and people get sick and they they become</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally ill and and and there's </v>

157
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 1>malevolence in the world and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and so life is very,</v>

158
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 1>very hard and if you're not properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented with regards to life,</v>

159
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it's hard and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's full of suffering can,</v>

160
00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:00.550
<v Speaker 1>can warp and twist and bend you until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you become murderous and resentful and,</v>

161
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.560
<v Speaker 1>and even go beyond murders and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment to wish for,</v>

162
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:04.603
<v Speaker 1>for genocide and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even to wish for the destruction of </v>

163
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:07.244
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to learn how to </v>

164
00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:10.394
<v Speaker 1>strengthen yourself as an individual so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can bear the burden of being </v>

165
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:14.744
<v Speaker 1>without becoming corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to decide that that is what </v>

166
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.833
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you want to become a fully </v>

167
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:19.784
<v Speaker 1>developed human being and start being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathetic marionette whose strings are </v>

168
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:25.310
<v Speaker 1>being pulled by horrible forces behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scenes.</v>

169
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>So I would say to any to wish on a star </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to aim at the highest good.</v>

170
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:31.010
<v Speaker 1>And the question then is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

171
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.300
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the good?</v>

172
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can answer that in two ways.</v>

173
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.290
<v Speaker 1>We could say that the good is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite of evil and I can tell you what</v>

174
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:40.124
<v Speaker 1>evil is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evil is the conscious desire to produce </v>

175
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:44.084
<v Speaker 1>suffering were suffering is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary and so if you read about what </v>

176
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:49.340
<v Speaker 1>happened in the Nazi concentration </v>
<v Speaker 1>camps,</v>

177
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:50.174
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in the in the Russian concentration </v>

178
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:53.930
<v Speaker 1>camps during the Soviet time of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union,</v>

179
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:54.764
<v Speaker 1>you get a good flavor for what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes evil and evil is the desire </v>

180
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>to exploit the vulnerability of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

181
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:01.014
<v Speaker 1>to self consciously exploit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability of other people and to </v>

182
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:04.134
<v Speaker 1>elevate their suffering beyond there or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone's ability to tolerate and so the </v>

183
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:08.274
<v Speaker 1>good is the opposite of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the opposite of that is the </v>

184
00:09:10.691 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 1>good is harder to get a handle on.</v>

185
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 1>But here's one hint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got this from reading.</v>

186
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:15.594
<v Speaker 1>John Piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly who's a developmental </v>

187
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:17.694
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and Piaget talked about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevated state and then the state is </v>

188
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:26.760
<v Speaker 1>like a game that children play where </v>
<v Speaker 1>every child wants to play the game.</v>

189
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.653
<v Speaker 1>You have a little social group and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the children's playgroup and any </v>

190
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:31.074
<v Speaker 1>of the individuals within it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the individual children and </v>

191
00:09:32.901 --> 00:09:33.734
<v Speaker 1>the and the structure is the game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good game if everyone wants to </v>

192
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:37.854
<v Speaker 1>play it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and Piaget noted that a game like </v>

193
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>that will outperform a game that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be tyrannized to play because it</v>

194
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 1>doesn't entail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't require any enforcement cost.</v>

195
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.953
<v Speaker 1>And so I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've sort of developed the idea of Neil </v>

196
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.833
<v Speaker 1>equilibrated state to think that if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're aiming at the good then you </v>

197
00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:56.874
<v Speaker 1>want what's good for you and I mean good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you as if you were taking care of </v>

198
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:00.294
<v Speaker 1>yourself and we're good to yourself who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were treating yourself like someone you </v>

199
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:03.414
<v Speaker 1>loved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was good for you in a way that </v>

200
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:05.904
<v Speaker 1>would also be good for your family and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it would be good for you and your </v>

201
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:11.580
<v Speaker 1>family in a way that was also good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

202
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.593
<v Speaker 1>And then it would be good for you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family and society in a way that </v>

203
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:17.244
<v Speaker 1>would be good for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it would be good now and it </v>

204
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>would be good next week and the week </v>
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

205
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.380
<v Speaker 1>and a year from now and as long into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future as you can see.</v>

206
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:26.214
<v Speaker 1>So the good is something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent rated across multiple levels </v>

207
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:30.234
<v Speaker 1>of being in multiple timeframes </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and it isn't necessarily </v>

208
00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:35.760
<v Speaker 1>that you know what that is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>at any given moment,</v>

209
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:39.240
<v Speaker 1>but you can orient yourself so that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state that you want to exist in.</v>

210
00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you exist in that state,</v>

211
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.473
<v Speaker 1>even moment by moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life is imbued with a sense of </v>

212
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 1>meaning and that sense of meaning can </v>
<v Speaker 1>help you transcend suffering.</v>

213
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:57.040
<v Speaker 1>The philosopher Nietzsche said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he who has a why can bear anyhow,</v>

214
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.960
<v Speaker 1>he who has a why can bear anyhow and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>niches.</v>

215
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Idea was that if there was purpose in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

216
00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.980
<v Speaker 1>have sufficient grandier that not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>could the suffering in life be accepted,</v>

217
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.073
<v Speaker 1>but maybe could even be appreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it could be that you're willing to </v>

218
00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:14.874
<v Speaker 1>bear the burden of being because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting things that you can do with </v>

219
00:11:18.421 --> 00:11:19.254
<v Speaker 1>being the things you can build in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that you can bring about and </v>

220
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:22.674
<v Speaker 1>that might be the highest imaginable </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of being and that's that's a form </v>

221
00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:26.094
<v Speaker 1>of paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a paradise that you </v>

222
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:28.314
<v Speaker 1>attained by transforming others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a paradise that you attain by </v>

223
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:31.674
<v Speaker 1>transforming yourself and that's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult thing to do and it's a very </v>

224
00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Speaker 1>frightening thing to do because it means</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're.</v>

225
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 1>You're retooling your soul and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a job for a real.</v>

226
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.863
<v Speaker 1>That's the job for a forthright and </v>
<v Speaker 1>honorable person and it's an exciting </v>

227
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:47.124
<v Speaker 1>enough task so that it will keep you </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupied for the rest of your life and </v>

228
00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:50.940
<v Speaker 1>then magical things will happen to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're.</v>

229
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.073
<v Speaker 1>While you're doing it and the world will</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself around you in the most wonderful </v>

230
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a musical way.</v>

231
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.423
<v Speaker 1>So that every part of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing plays off against every </v>

232
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 1>other part in a manner that's has </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning embedded in every aspect of it.</v>

233
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.660
<v Speaker 1>And you experienced that by the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced that.</v>

234
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 1>When you listen to a piece of music that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you love,</v>

235
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:11.740
<v Speaker 1>music represents that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why people.</v>

236
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 1>That's why Mira music nourishes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>

237
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the highest form of art,</v>

238
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.393
<v Speaker 1>at least in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to live your life as if </v>

239
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 1>being is as symphony and you're playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're playing your instrumental part.</v>

240
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Once you Orient Yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have an obligation,</v>

241
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I would say an obligation to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of your soul,</v>

242
00:12:53.011 --> 00:12:55.680
<v Speaker 1>to speak the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be oriented properly.</v>

243
00:12:55.681 --> 00:12:56.514
<v Speaker 1>They'll because the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that exists in service to </v>

244
00:12:58.951 --> 00:13:00.660
<v Speaker 1>an ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ideal of sorts.</v>

245
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Then you can imagine that you could use </v>
<v Speaker 1>your language two ways.</v>

246
00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:03.924
<v Speaker 1>You can use your language to manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and to extract from it what </v>

247
00:13:07.471 --> 00:13:08.580
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

248
00:13:08.581 --> 00:13:09.414
<v Speaker 1>maybe you go out into date with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you decide that the end goal of the </v>

249
00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:14.550
<v Speaker 1>date is to have a sexual partner for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

250
00:13:14.551 --> 00:13:18.270
<v Speaker 1>And then you can craft your language to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate the person into providing you</v>

251
00:13:18.271 --> 00:13:19.104
<v Speaker 1>with you with what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's like an instrumental use of </v>

252
00:13:21.571 --> 00:13:24.420
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that,</v>

253
00:13:24.421 --> 00:13:26.040
<v Speaker 1>there's many problems with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is,</v>

254
00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:28.890
<v Speaker 1>is that what if your idea about what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should want is wrong,</v>

255
00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:29.724
<v Speaker 1>like maybe that's not the way to treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that you're on a date out on a </v>

256
00:13:32.371 --> 00:13:33.570
<v Speaker 1>date with maybe.</v>

257
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're minimizing and reducing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions between you from what could</v>

258
00:13:39.811 --> 00:13:40.644
<v Speaker 1>be a healthy and elevated state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction and discourse to something </v>

259
00:13:45.721 --> 00:13:46.554
<v Speaker 1>that's that basically the pursuit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive pleasure and not maybe that's </v>

260
00:13:50.821 --> 00:13:51.654
<v Speaker 1>not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next week and the week after a month </v>

261
00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:54.804
<v Speaker 1>down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe orienting yourself towards </v>

262
00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:59.790
<v Speaker 1>impulsive pleasure is a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember what happens in Pinocchio.</v>

263
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.043
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio goes to Pleasure Island and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure island is a place where </v>

264
00:14:03.151 --> 00:14:06.540
<v Speaker 1>impulsive pleasures can be had at at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment's notice,</v>

265
00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:09.360
<v Speaker 1>but what Pinocchio discovers along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimminy Cricket,</v>

266
00:14:09.361 --> 00:14:14.070
<v Speaker 1>that pleasure island is run by masked </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarians.</v>

267
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.450
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all dressed in black.</v>

268
00:14:15.451 --> 00:14:16.340
<v Speaker 1>You remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

269
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.220
<v Speaker 1>they're turning the children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescents who are on pleasure island.</v>

270
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:21.683
<v Speaker 1>They're depriving them of their voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning them into bring jackasses and </v>

271
00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:26.430
<v Speaker 1>preparing to sell them as slaves to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>salt mines,</v>

272
00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:27.264
<v Speaker 1>and so there's an implication in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>story that the pursuit of impulsive </v>

273
00:14:30.601 --> 00:14:34.440
<v Speaker 1>pleasure is one route to totalitarianism</v>
<v Speaker 1>and slavery,</v>

274
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.283
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that so perhaps orienting </v>
<v Speaker 1>your language towards the gathering of </v>

275
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:43.800
<v Speaker 1>the impulsive pleasure is a miss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a misuse of your highest gift.</v>

276
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.350
<v Speaker 1>The gift of logos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gift of communication.</v>

277
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:47.603
<v Speaker 1>The alternative is to Orient Yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the highest good as we already </v>

278
00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 1>described it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the truth which and you can.</v>

279
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 1>You can tell when you're doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can tell her when you're not</v>

280
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 1>doing that because if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not telling the truth,</v>

281
00:14:57.471 --> 00:14:58.304
<v Speaker 1>if you're using someone else's words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being manipulated in a sense by </v>

282
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:05.090
<v Speaker 1>forces that are behind the scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not using your own words.</v>

283
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.193
<v Speaker 1>You're the puppet of an ideology or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another thinker or your own impulsive </v>

284
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:11.084
<v Speaker 1>desires and you can tell when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking like that because it makes you </v>

285
00:15:13.401 --> 00:15:14.234
<v Speaker 1>feel weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel weak and ashamed and </v>

286
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 1>you can localize that feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically.</v>

287
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:18.884
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to yourself talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell when when you're speaking </v>

288
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:23.834
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will experience a feeling of </v>

289
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:26.564
<v Speaker 1>integration and strength and when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking in a deceitful or manipulative </v>

290
00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:31.610
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll feel that you're starting to come</v>

291
00:15:31.611 --> 00:15:32.444
<v Speaker 1>across apart at the seams and what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to do is practice only saying </v>

292
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:38.960
<v Speaker 1>things that make you feel stronger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll mean to begin with.</v>

293
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.330
<v Speaker 1>You'll notice that almost everything you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say is a lie.</v>

294
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 1>It's either a lie or someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

295
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.473
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to find your own words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't actually exist until you </v>

296
00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:49.460
<v Speaker 1>have your own words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>

297
00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:50.294
<v Speaker 1>so then you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try to teach yourself how to speak </v>

298
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:53.654
<v Speaker 1>your own truth and you listen to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people while you're doing that because </v>

299
00:15:55.851 --> 00:15:58.940
<v Speaker 1>they can help you shape and correct your</v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

300
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>They'll react to them badly if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate your ideas badly,</v>

301
00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:03.314
<v Speaker 1>and if you listen and pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can learn to formulate your </v>

302
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:07.250
<v Speaker 1>words more and more clearly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately,</v>

303
00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:08.870
<v Speaker 1>and that makes you more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

304
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.780
<v Speaker 1>It makes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you more and more authority,</v>

305
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:14.450
<v Speaker 1>which is the which is the beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of power.</v>

306
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you do that and then you have to make</v>

307
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:18.164
<v Speaker 1>a decision of faith and that's basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can easily either use your </v>

308
00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:21.674
<v Speaker 1>language to manipulate the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it do what you want or you can use </v>

309
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:29.840
<v Speaker 1>your language to try to articulate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth as carefully as you possibly can,</v>

310
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.420
<v Speaker 1>and then you can see what happens.</v>

311
00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.220
<v Speaker 1>You have to let go of your desire for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the for the consequences that you want.</v>

312
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:39.560
<v Speaker 1>You have to assume that if you speak the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

313
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.873
<v Speaker 1>the results are the best that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible under the circumstances and so </v>

314
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

315
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.610
<v Speaker 1>it's an exciting way of living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>simpsons.</v>

316
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.473
<v Speaker 1>Some sense it's like continually walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>off a cliff because you don't know </v>

317
00:16:49.581 --> 00:16:53.300
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If all you do is say what you think,</v>

318
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:54.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you're at work and you say </v>

319
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 1>what you think and you get fired and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

320
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible catastrophe,</v>

321
00:16:58.101 --> 00:16:58.934
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe if you're working </v>

322
00:17:00.651 --> 00:17:03.860
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and you have to lie to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain your job,</v>

323
00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:04.694
<v Speaker 1>maybe you shouldn't be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's deadening your soul and </v>

324
00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:07.424
<v Speaker 1>damaging you in some permanent manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>and making you corrupt and so you have </v>

325
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 1>to Orient Yourself.</v>

326
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.980
<v Speaker 1>You have to speak the truth as carefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can,</v>

327
00:17:14.981 --> 00:17:15.814
<v Speaker 1>and you have to listen to others so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you correct your speech and then you </v>

328
00:17:18.711 --> 00:17:23.210
<v Speaker 1>have to allow the consequences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensue to unfold as they will.</v>

329
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the ultimate act of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

330
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:27.710
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you belong to truth university.</v>

331
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.050
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so more practically speaking,</v>

332
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.240
<v Speaker 1>then you should educate yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to do now because you</v>

333
00:17:35.241 --> 00:17:36.074
<v Speaker 1>have to find people who can actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you mostly what to read and maybe </v>

334
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:39.584
<v Speaker 1>also how to write because writing is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of formulating your thoughts </v>

335
00:17:42.111 --> 00:17:44.450
<v Speaker 1>evermore precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you go to university to learn</v>

336
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:45.850
<v Speaker 1>how to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you learn,</v>

337
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.540
<v Speaker 1>if you know how to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think.</v>

338
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.460
<v Speaker 1>If you can think and speak and </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate in writing,</v>

339
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:51.643
<v Speaker 1>you're unbelievably powerful in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority manner because arguments move </v>

340
00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:02.520
<v Speaker 1>the world forward and if your arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>are tight and well constructed and lucid</v>

341
00:18:02.521 --> 00:18:06.300
<v Speaker 1>and well edited and carefully thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and you have five rationales for</v>

342
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:07.134
<v Speaker 1>everything that you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what happens if you learn to </v>

343
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:11.040
<v Speaker 1>write properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're like a force of nature,</v>

344
00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:11.520
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

345
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.353
<v Speaker 1>No one can take you down and that's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things that people aren't taught </v>

346
00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:16.320
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you go get educated,</v>

347
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:19.440
<v Speaker 1>especially in the humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities education,</v>

348
00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:23.040
<v Speaker 1>if it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizes your psyche grounds.</v>

349
00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:27.150
<v Speaker 1>You puts you on a rock and makes you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>force to contend with,</v>

350
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.990
<v Speaker 1>but you have to read the right people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so and those are the great,</v>

351
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.103
<v Speaker 1>the great people of the past in my list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the great men of the past and </v>

352
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:38.670
<v Speaker 1>that's just how it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so here's who I would recommend.</v>

353
00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:41.340
<v Speaker 1>I put reading lists up at Jordan B </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson Dotcom.</v>

354
00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:42.174
<v Speaker 1>There's two of them and the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I recommend primarily are there books </v>

355
00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 1>written by the following list of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theodore,</v>

356
00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:49.284
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky and Tolstoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I think perhaps the greatest </v>

357
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:54.690
<v Speaker 1>novelist the world has ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexander Solzhenitsyn,</v>

358
00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:55.524
<v Speaker 1>another great Russian novelist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is about the </v>

359
00:18:57.181 --> 00:18:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

360
00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 1>they produce.</v>

361
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.710
<v Speaker 1>They produce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Writers that are in comparable.</v>

362
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.873
<v Speaker 1>Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Gulag archipelago where he </v>

363
00:19:05.551 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 1>analyzed the Soviet prison camp system </v>
<v Speaker 1>that arose after the leninist revolution</v>

364
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:15.120
<v Speaker 1>in the second decade of the 20th century</v>
<v Speaker 1>and details and absolutely precisely how</v>

365
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:15.954
<v Speaker 1>the tenants of Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxists tenants that are supposed to </v>

366
00:19:19.651 --> 00:19:23.160
<v Speaker 1>free everyone and changed the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced legislation that was,</v>

367
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.053
<v Speaker 1>that was absolutely murderous in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences and social units and </v>

368
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.433
<v Speaker 1>painstakingly traces the logical pathway</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the original Marxist principles to </v>

369
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:33.504
<v Speaker 1>the legislation to the to the genocides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you'll hear people who are </v>

370
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:39.180
<v Speaker 1>basically Marxist to say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

371
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.710
<v Speaker 1>true Marxism never existed and social </v>
<v Speaker 1>units.</v>

372
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.553
<v Speaker 1>And took that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That argument apart in the in the mid </v>

373
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 1>seventies and and the gulag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archipelago was an intellectual bomb.</v>

374
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:49.314
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

375
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:50.573
<v Speaker 1>it demolished any credibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxism had to intellectual </v>

376
00:19:53.341 --> 00:19:55.260
<v Speaker 1>respectability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to read the book.</v>

377
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.890
<v Speaker 1>The book is about the central issue in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture at the moment.</v>

378
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 1>If you don't read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not informed.</v>

379
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.150
<v Speaker 1>You can't participate in the debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>except as a puppet.</v>

380
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.140
<v Speaker 1>And so I wouldn't recommend </v>
<v Speaker 1>participating in this debate as a puppet</v>

381
00:20:07.141 --> 00:20:09.990
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know who's behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes pulling the strings.</v>

382
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.530
<v Speaker 1>If you remember the Pinocchio Story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forces that were pulling the strings</v>

383
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:14.850
<v Speaker 1>were not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

384
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.940
<v Speaker 1>they were not forces that we're acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Pinocchio's best interest,</v>

385
00:20:17.941 --> 00:20:20.070
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell,</v>

386
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:20.963
<v Speaker 1>English essayist in comparable </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentator on socialist </v>

387
00:20:23.551 --> 00:20:24.384
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he was a left winger and a </v>

388
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:28.710
<v Speaker 1>brilliant one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aldous Huxley wrote Brave New World,</v>

389
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:29.863
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had some very brilliant things to say </v>

390
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:33.150
<v Speaker 1>about the potential demolition of sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>

391
00:20:33.151 --> 00:20:36.930
<v Speaker 1>of choice of sexual partner as a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of a dystopian future.</v>

392
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.003
<v Speaker 1>Friedrich Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosopher who described himself </v>

393
00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:44.970
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as someone who thought with a hammer and</v>

394
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:45.863
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous person and an absolutely </v>

395
00:20:47.741 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 1>brilliant writer.</v>

396
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 1>And Carl Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a student of Nisha and who Nisha</v>

397
00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:53.644
<v Speaker 1>was the philosopher who I announced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death of God back in the late 18 </v>

398
00:20:56.111 --> 00:21:00.700
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and spent his whole life </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to revivify God.</v>

399
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.750
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you educate yourself,</v>

400
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:06.070
<v Speaker 1>and this is a really good place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

401
00:21:06.071 --> 00:21:08.380
<v Speaker 1>If you read these authors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll know what else to read.</v>

402
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:09.580
<v Speaker 1>If you read these authors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>

403
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 1>it'll take you a good long time and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be very,</v>

404
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:12.394
<v Speaker 1>very hard on you and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you won't be the same person when </v>

405
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:16.270
<v Speaker 1>you come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's very frightening.</v>

406
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.890
<v Speaker 1>And because being torn down and rebuilt </v>
<v Speaker 1>is no is no joke,</v>

407
00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:22.540
<v Speaker 1>but it beats the hell out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative,</v>

408
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:26.050
<v Speaker 1>which is just to stagnate and stay as </v>
<v Speaker 1>stagnant infant,</v>

409
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.930
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not something I'd recommend.</v>

410
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:32.800
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing uglier than a stagnant </v>
<v Speaker 1>40 year old infant.</v>

411
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's equivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so you know,</v>

412
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:37.600
<v Speaker 1>to Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to the Pinocchio Story,</v>

413
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.240
<v Speaker 1>rescuing Japan from the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when he was,</v>

414
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.343
<v Speaker 1>he had kind of turned into a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>jackass after being at the at pleasure </v>

415
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:45.304
<v Speaker 1>island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he was enticed by the way from a </v>

416
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.183
<v Speaker 1>couple of people who that was the Fox </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the cat who attempted to entice </v>

417
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:54.040
<v Speaker 1>himself into believing that he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>victim and needed a vacation.</v>

418
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.730
<v Speaker 1>So Pinocchio was enticed onto pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 1>island by two,</v>

419
00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.773
<v Speaker 1>two fingers that that played on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of victimization and neurosis and </v>

420
00:22:02.111 --> 00:22:04.230
<v Speaker 1>suffering to convince him that he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to.</v>

421
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.060
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have to take any </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for his own existence and</v>

422
00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:09.640
<v Speaker 1>he could just be busy himself with </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive pleasures.</v>

423
00:22:09.641 --> 00:22:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we fell into the hands of the</v>

424
00:22:11.681 --> 00:22:13.930
<v Speaker 1>totalitarians on pleasure island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

425
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:16.180
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio,</v>

426
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.810
<v Speaker 1>after he left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure island had to go into the ocean</v>

427
00:22:19.811 --> 00:22:20.290
<v Speaker 1>twice.</v>

428
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And the second time he went into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>

429
00:22:22.061 --> 00:22:23.470
<v Speaker 1>he was looking for his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

430
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.920
<v Speaker 1>everyone's father from a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

431
00:22:26.921 --> 00:22:31.921
<v Speaker 1>is dying in the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the chaos because everyone inhabits a</v>

432
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 1>culture that's sick and old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

433
00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:35.584
<v Speaker 1>And it's sick and old because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>made by the dad and the living have to </v>

434
00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:38.944
<v Speaker 1>revivify it continually in order for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a dynamic force and the living </v>

435
00:22:42.101 --> 00:22:42.934
<v Speaker 1>have to revive a fi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their connection with the culture </v>

436
00:22:44.201 --> 00:22:46.600
<v Speaker 1>internally too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your constructions of culture,</v>

437
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:47.434
<v Speaker 1>although not only constructions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and you have to understand </v>

438
00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:52.540
<v Speaker 1>history because otherwise you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand yourself.</v>

439
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:56.260
<v Speaker 1>You're a historical creature and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to rescue your dead father from the</v>

440
00:22:56.261 --> 00:22:59.440
<v Speaker 1>belly of the beast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Dragon Guess Remember the whale</v>

441
00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:01.420
<v Speaker 1>in Pinocchio is also a fire breathing </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon.</v>

442
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.690
<v Speaker 1>And that means you have to face the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you most fear.</v>

443
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.273
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll rescue your father from the </v>

444
00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:10.900
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are very complex ideas and you can</v>

445
00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:13.060
<v Speaker 1>read about them in my book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maps of meaning if you want.</v>

446
00:23:13.061 --> 00:23:13.894
<v Speaker 1>It's on the reading list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a free copy of it on Jordan would </v>

447
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:18.310
<v Speaker 1>be Peterson Dotcom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can download it.</v>

448
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I take apart these sorts of things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail.</v>

449
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:21.603
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to vivify your father before </v>

450
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:25.230
<v Speaker 1>you can become real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

451
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.440
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of the problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist and feminist and social justice</v>

452
00:23:30.461 --> 00:23:32.950
<v Speaker 1>warrior insistence on the existence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the patriarchy.</v>

453
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:35.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like everyone's known since the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of time,</v>

454
00:23:35.741 --> 00:23:39.700
<v Speaker 1>that culture is corrupt and tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also protective and benevolent.</v>

455
00:23:39.701 --> 00:23:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Even the language use is a product of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

456
00:23:41.861 --> 00:23:44.260
<v Speaker 1>and so you don't overthrow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy,</v>

457
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:45.243
<v Speaker 1>you a fire your culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that by adopting </v>

458
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:48.884
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for your own being and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then acting as a moral agent in the </v>

459
00:23:51.921 --> 00:23:54.560
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do to become educated.</v>

460
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:56.900
<v Speaker 1>So read these books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read these books.</v>

461
00:23:56.901 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 1>They'll change your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee it.</v>

462
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:00.350
<v Speaker 1>They'll change your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll take you apart,</v>

463
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.393
<v Speaker 1>they'll devastate you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll rebuild you into </v>

464
00:24:03.021 --> 00:24:04.820
<v Speaker 1>something far greater than you are now.</v>

465
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.740
<v Speaker 2>But don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jenny,</v>

466
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:10.563
<v Speaker 2>you need to get yourself out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Follow the chamber and you'll find </v>

467
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.940
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will bring in folks,</v>

468
00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I just wasn't quick enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix tears have healing powers</v>

469
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.230
<v Speaker 1>and that's what to aim for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

470
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.093
<v Speaker 1>and here's something that will help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My colleagues and I have developed a </v>

471
00:25:12.441 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 1>series of online writing programs called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cell phone ring suite,</v>

472
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:16.873
<v Speaker 1>and they help people write about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>past and organize that and they're </v>

473
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.323
<v Speaker 1>present personality and organize and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that and then the future and </v>

474
00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.613
<v Speaker 1>the future authoring program asks you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write about six different dimensions of </v>

475
00:25:28.401 --> 00:25:32.690
<v Speaker 1>your life so it asked you first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat yourself as if you're someone that</v>

476
00:25:32.691 --> 00:25:36.530
<v Speaker 1>you want to help and that someone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you love and take care of it and someone</v>

477
00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:38.570
<v Speaker 1>that you want to help and then it asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

478
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:39.404
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could,</v>

479
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:43.400
<v Speaker 1>if you could organize your life in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best possible manner and in keeping with</v>

480
00:25:43.401 --> 00:25:47.060
<v Speaker 1>those principles we discussed earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

481
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.390
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for your career?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you want?</v>

482
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.760
<v Speaker 1>What would make your life meaningful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for your career?</v>

483
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.160
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for your family and </v>
<v Speaker 1>from your family?</v>

484
00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:56.900
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>

485
00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.633
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to handle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to take care of your </v>

486
00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.150
<v Speaker 1>mental and physical health?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to handle drug,</v>

487
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:03.043
<v Speaker 1>drug and alcohol use?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It asks you a series of fundamental </v>

488
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:09.680
<v Speaker 1>questions like that to get your mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving and then it asks you to write for</v>

489
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:10.514
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes about what your life could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 53 to five years in the future if </v>

490
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:15.374
<v Speaker 1>it was laid out like you were laying out</v>
<v Speaker 1>a life for someone you deeply cared </v>

491
00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:18.554
<v Speaker 1>about and so you're asked to write for </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes about that without worrying </v>

492
00:26:21.261 --> 00:26:22.094
<v Speaker 1>too much about structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure of the argument or or or </v>

493
00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.920
<v Speaker 1>any grammatical niceties that that's put</v>
<v Speaker 1>off for later.</v>

494
00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.140
<v Speaker 1>So that gives you a little heaven name </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>

495
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:30.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

496
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:31.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could have this,</v>

497
00:26:31.971 --> 00:26:32.804
<v Speaker 1>my life would be clearly worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if I had to put up with a fair bit </v>

498
00:26:35.121 --> 00:26:35.954
<v Speaker 1>of suffering along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're trying to construct </v>

499
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.400
<v Speaker 1>and you could think about that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven worth moving towards.</v>

500
00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.653
<v Speaker 1>And then the second part of the program </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked to write about what your life </v>

501
00:26:45.181 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 1>would be like three to five years down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>

502
00:26:46.831 --> 00:26:47.664
<v Speaker 1>If all of your bad habits and nihilistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendencies and proclivity towards </v>

503
00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:54.570
<v Speaker 1>resentment and lack of desire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder responsibility,</v>

504
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:55.463
<v Speaker 1>fall your weak points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got the upper hand and just augured you </v>

505
00:26:57.421 --> 00:27:00.540
<v Speaker 1>into the ground and everyone knows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you'd be like.</v>

506
00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:01.374
<v Speaker 1>If you just let everything slide and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what particular hell you were </v>

507
00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:07.980
<v Speaker 1>ended up heading towards and so the sec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second part of the program asked you</v>

508
00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:08.814
<v Speaker 1>to write about what your life would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like three to five years down the road </v>

509
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.173
<v Speaker 1>if everything just went to hell around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and so that gives you a hell to </v>

510
00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:15.504
<v Speaker 1>avoid and heaven to strive for and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need both of those because that's what </v>

511
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 1>keeps you properly motivated in life.</v>

512
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:21.383
<v Speaker 1>And then the second half of the program </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the next part of the program helps </v>

513
00:27:24.661 --> 00:27:29.370
<v Speaker 1>you turn your vision of the desirable </v>
<v Speaker 1>future into an implementable reality and</v>

514
00:27:29.371 --> 00:27:30.204
<v Speaker 1>to articulate it fully and to articulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arguments for why you want that and </v>

515
00:27:34.501 --> 00:27:36.420
<v Speaker 1>those even help you overcome your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubts.</v>

516
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:37.254
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only to argue against other </v>

517
00:27:37.981 --> 00:27:38.814
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to argue against the chattering </v>

518
00:27:40.201 --> 00:27:41.034
<v Speaker 1>demons of nihilism and hopelessness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideological possession that that </v>

519
00:27:44.941 --> 00:27:47.370
<v Speaker 1>exist in your mind and in society </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>

520
00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:50.100
<v Speaker 1>You need powerful weapons to fight back </v>
<v Speaker 1>against those.</v>

521
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.533
<v Speaker 1>So here's an offer for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've made the future authoring program </v>

522
00:27:54.001 --> 00:27:57.110
<v Speaker 1>available free for the next while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

523
00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.013
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long a while be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's assume a week or something </v>

524
00:27:59.881 --> 00:28:00.714
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you go to ww dot [inaudible] </v>

525
00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:10.461
<v Speaker 1>dot com slash future authoring dot html,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can read about the program there and</v>

526
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.143
<v Speaker 1>now I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've used this program and about 5,000 </v>

527
00:28:17.311 --> 00:28:18.144
<v Speaker 1>university students so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly in Holland but some in Canada as </v>

528
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:21.030
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

529
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.360
<v Speaker 1>And what we've shown is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the program,</v>

530
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:25.243
<v Speaker 1>if you complete this program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you do it badly and I would </v>

531
00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:29.100
<v Speaker 1>recommend it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it badly,</v>

532
00:28:29.101 --> 00:28:30.060
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

533
00:28:30.061 --> 00:28:31.800
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do it perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it badly,</v>

534
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:33.510
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe do it better as you move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

535
00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:34.344
<v Speaker 1>but at least do it badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It increases the performance of </v>

536
00:28:37.081 --> 00:28:37.914
<v Speaker 1>university students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It increases their grades by between 20 </v>

537
00:28:39.811 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 1>and 25 percent and decreases their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropout by about the same percent,</v>

538
00:28:43.591 --> 00:28:44.424
<v Speaker 1>and so we have data on 5,000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of those papers is been published </v>

539
00:28:47.461 --> 00:28:49.620
<v Speaker 1>and I'll put that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the description,</v>

540
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:50.843
<v Speaker 1>in the description of this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so this program really works if you </v>

541
00:28:53.161 --> 00:28:56.700
<v Speaker 1>do it and and so I would highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend that you do it anyways.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can read about the program there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

546
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.280
<v Speaker 1>And so here's what millennials should </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

547
00:29:11.281 --> 00:29:14.220
<v Speaker 1>If they want to change the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they should do is orient</v>

548
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:17.910
<v Speaker 1>themselves to the good and that's away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from evil,</v>

549
00:29:17.911 --> 00:29:18.744
<v Speaker 1>away from malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the manufacturer of pointless </v>

550
00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:22.644
<v Speaker 1>suffering and pain away from Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say in a way from the Gulag </v>

551
00:29:25.471 --> 00:29:26.304
<v Speaker 1>archipelago and the terrible Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>camps and the massive murders that </v>

552
00:29:29.221 --> 00:29:30.054
<v Speaker 1>occurred in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get it and you want to get </v>

553
00:29:31.651 --> 00:29:33.450
<v Speaker 1>as far away from that as you possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

554
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Whatever direction is away from that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a good direction,</v>

555
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:38.123
<v Speaker 1>and then you also wanted to contemplate </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the highest possible good could </v>

556
00:29:41.201 --> 00:29:43.450
<v Speaker 1>look like for you and your family and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your society.</v>

557
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:44.284
<v Speaker 1>We already discussed that and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to speak the truth in relationship </v>

558
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:48.394
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you need to educate yourself </v>

559
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.660
<v Speaker 1>and then you need to shoulder you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

560
00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Responsibility is a good thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you strong to bear up under.</v>

561
00:29:57.131 --> 00:29:59.220
<v Speaker 1>It makes you strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can turn yourself into a.</v>

562
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.273
<v Speaker 1>You can free yourself from your strings </v>
<v Speaker 1>and turn yourself into a genuine </v>

563
00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:03.814
<v Speaker 1>individual and then you can shoulder the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and then you're in a position to </v>

564
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:10.270
<v Speaker 1>make to make change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a person like that,</v>

565
