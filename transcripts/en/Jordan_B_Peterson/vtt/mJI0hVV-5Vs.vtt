1
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.533
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.693
<v Speaker 1>this part of the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always a part I have difficulty </v>

3
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>with because the conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation is very,</v>

4
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>very large because so far we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

5
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:18.943
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say biological and evolutionary </v>

6
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.554
<v Speaker 1>realities in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've been doing that in a </v>

7
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>relatively standard manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>there are elements of Piaget Yeti in </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory that run through it.</v>

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.503
<v Speaker 1>There are elements of cybernetic theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are elements of neurobiology in </v>

10
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:40.070
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

11
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.410
<v Speaker 1>none of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of it,</v>

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.963
<v Speaker 1>I would say in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is radically outside the way the sorts </v>

13
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:54.021
<v Speaker 1>of problems might be discussed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

14
00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:54.921
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

15
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:55.521
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

16
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the typical,</v>

17
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.880
<v Speaker 1>in a typical scientific or social </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific manner,</v>

18
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>except for maybe the fact that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn a explicit distinction between the</v>

19
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:14.500
<v Speaker 1>world as a place of things in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a place of action.</v>

20
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.803
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are consequences to the idea that </v>

21
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:22.564
<v Speaker 1>the world is a place of action that </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to become more radical at this </v>

22
00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:25.774
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But drawing the relationship between </v>

23
00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:29.764
<v Speaker 1>what I've already talked to you about </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the narrative domains that we're </v>

24
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>going to explore now requires a</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a radical shift in,</v>

25
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.903
<v Speaker 1>in conceptual focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the way I'm going to handle that </v>

26
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:51.621
<v Speaker 1>is by hitting it from 10 or 11 different</v>
<v Speaker 1>directions and building up a pattern.</v>

27
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Know if you listened to a complex piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of music,</v>

28
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.083
<v Speaker 1>or at least this is my experience with </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex music is sometimes the first </v>

29
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>time I hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like it and I don't,</v>

30
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I also don't understand it.</v>

31
00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I actually can't hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe a musical genius could hear the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing instantly,</v>

33
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a Franz Liszt,</v>

34
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>they say he could sight read anything on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the piano first try.</v>

35
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.761
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:20.594
<v Speaker 1>some people are so intelligent musically</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's incomprehensible and I'm sure </v>

37
00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:26.000
<v Speaker 1>they hear things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just find the first time they hear them.</v>

38
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:29.750
<v Speaker 1>But then what happens for me is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to it a couple of more times,</v>

39
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:31.180
<v Speaker 1>there are pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chunks of it,</v>

40
00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:33.140
<v Speaker 1>it starts to fall into place that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow.</v>

41
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:33.890
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

42
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.723
<v Speaker 1>I can see the beauty sort of shine </v>
<v Speaker 1>through those and then eventually the </v>

43
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.690
<v Speaker 1>whole thing links together and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can listen to it.</v>

44
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it's a complex complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of music many,</v>

45
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:45.950
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times.</v>

46
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.580
<v Speaker 1>And the more complex and probably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>better the piece of music,</v>

47
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:50.414
<v Speaker 1>the more I can listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I listen to it enough at some </v>

48
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:53.414
<v Speaker 1>point then I've had enough of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all very strange phenomenon </v>

49
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.233
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you might ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself is what exactly are you </v>

50
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:02.420
<v Speaker 1>learning while you're doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

51
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you want the music,</v>

52
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:05.404
<v Speaker 1>it's something like you want the music </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be just exactly the right amount of </v>

53
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:10.384
<v Speaker 1>predictable and unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's too unpredictable then you </v>

54
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>can't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's too predictable,</v>

55
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:14.824
<v Speaker 1>it's boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's just like a conversation </v>

56
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually just like life as well,</v>

57
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want things to be </v>

58
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.663
<v Speaker 1>predictable and stable and you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to be unpredictable and </v>

59
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>interesting and the degree to which you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

60
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.863
<v Speaker 1>Each of those is going to depend on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and the context and also on your </v>

61
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>own intelligence and temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

62
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to tell you a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories and give you a bunch of a number</v>

63
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>of pieces of information and hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll click together.</v>

64
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.873
<v Speaker 1>Now I think the reason that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>information has always been transmitted </v>

65
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>in story and image form is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

66
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:54.124
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to transform it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated like into fully articulated </v>

67
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't really how it works,</v>

68
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not really accustomed to thinking </v>

69
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:03.934
<v Speaker 1>about the idea that there are certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of information that and that that </v>

70
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 1>are valid forms of information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be transmitted verbally.</v>

71
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>But of course if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all understand this deeply because,</v>

72
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a bunch of examples.</v>

73
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 1>The first example is that when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>

74
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 1>not only view speak in words and phrases</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sentences and paragraphs,</v>

75
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 1>but you also speak melodically.</v>

76
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.023
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that you can </v>

77
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:30.034
<v Speaker 1>understand melodies and that they make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to you is that what artists have </v>

78
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:34.744
<v Speaker 1>done is separated the melodic element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech from the semantic element and </v>

79
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>then played with the melodic element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the melodic element tends to carry a</v>

80
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:44.704
<v Speaker 1>lot of emotion and intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're listening to someone </v>

81
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell when they're being ironic,</v>

82
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'd raised an eyebrow and </v>

83
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:56.170
<v Speaker 1>their voice changes slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they might be using,</v>

84
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>in fact they are using exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

85
00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>And in fact someone who's very good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>being witty or ironic,</v>

86
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 1>we'll set the situation up so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can barely tell that they're joking.</v>

87
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:06.934
<v Speaker 1>And the better they are at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Tinier the hint they give you that </v>

88
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 1>you can still catch on to the final </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

89
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.043
<v Speaker 1>The situation is so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we know that information can be </v>

90
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 1>transmitted through nonverbal channels.</v>

91
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.093
<v Speaker 1>It even happens during speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course we understand that </v>

92
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:26.494
<v Speaker 1>music presents to us an intimation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that's very difficult to fully </v>

93
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 1>grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And music for me has always been,</v>

94
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.933
<v Speaker 1>ineffable phenomena in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it carries the intimation of </v>

96
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:42.334
<v Speaker 1>meaning in a manner that can't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationally dismissed or that people </v>

97
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 1>aren't interested in rationally </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismissing.</v>

98
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:52.210
<v Speaker 1>So you've even punk rock nihilists </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to Punk Rock,</v>

99
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:54.320
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic music and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 1>they find that meaningful even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't believe in meaning.</v>

101
00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.191
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.024
<v Speaker 1>in some sense they're victims of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own rationality because they do believe </v>

103
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>in meaning or they wouldn't be listening</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the music,</v>

104
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>but they can't understand how they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly believe in it.</v>

105
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 1>So their rational mind has dispensed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea.</v>

106
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:11.324
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that's people dispense </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of meaning for lots of </v>

107
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because of,</v>

108
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>because it's inevitable in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>with sufficient rationality,</v>

109
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.473
<v Speaker 1>but also because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's always useful to look for </v>

110
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:28.661
<v Speaker 1>the underbelly of things because it also</v>
<v Speaker 1>justifies not bearing any responsibility</v>

111
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 1>for your life and not had some fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

112
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.683
<v Speaker 1>what that can be a very desirable side </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect of a particular ideological </v>

113
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 1>irrational belief.</v>

114
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.593
<v Speaker 1>And then there's dance of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dances even more ineffable than </v>

115
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's often paired with music,</v>

116
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:45.344
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

117
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.693
<v Speaker 1>and if it grips people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you see a remarkable downs </v>

118
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:50.234
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well part of it is that you're sort of </v>

119
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 1>thrilled and excited about seeing just </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what the human form can do.</v>

120
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.793
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because perhaps partly because you're </v>

121
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:04.001
<v Speaker 1>human and when you see someone extending</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain ability far beyond the norm,</v>

122
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>then it expands your sense of what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being is capable of.</v>

123
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's that,</v>

124
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:10.964
<v Speaker 1>there's just the pure scale element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the novelty element </v>

125
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>because often if you watch a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly good dancer,</v>

126
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:18.344
<v Speaker 1>there's things they do that you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen before that you didn't know anyone </v>

127
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:21.464
<v Speaker 1>can do and that's pretty fun and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>often the dances is joined with the </v>

128
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:26.534
<v Speaker 1>music and the body is expressing what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the music means and even though you </v>

129
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:30.464
<v Speaker 1>can't tell what the music means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell that the dance is </v>

130
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 1>expressing it and see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens there is that music</v>

131
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.263
<v Speaker 1>represents the patterns of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually because people think of </v>

132
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 1>music has a non representational art but</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's wrong.</v>

133
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.623
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>representational art is that being is </v>

134
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:51.920
<v Speaker 1>made up of layers of pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>layers of patterns constantly interact,</v>

135
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.933
<v Speaker 1>interacting and hopefully in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively harmonious way and music </v>

136
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 1>music demonstrates that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mimics it in some sense abstractly.</v>

137
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Speaker 1>And then the dance is an abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

138
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:04.814
<v Speaker 1>Like people adapt to the patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being and the dancer adapts to the </v>

139
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 1>pattern of music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a,</v>

140
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a symbolic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an embodied display of the place of</v>

141
00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>the person in the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can,</v>

142
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.253
<v Speaker 1>you can also make that case when you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>people dancing in pairs because you can </v>

143
00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:22.304
<v Speaker 1>dance alone or you can dance in pairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically standard human </v>

144
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 1>adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

145
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.660
<v Speaker 1>and music is interesting too because one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things that you'll notice is that</v>

146
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 1>there's always music in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost always there's the odd movie that</v>

147
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:37.890
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

148
00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>it's quite marked when it's absent.</v>

149
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.633
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie feels a lot more cold and </v>

150
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:43.640
<v Speaker 1>clinical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it can work.</v>

151
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:49.060
<v Speaker 1>But we accept the idea that music can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to fill in the missing context in a</v>

152
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:51.380
<v Speaker 1>movie without even ever questioning it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

153
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Like it's very strange if you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

154
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:54.464
<v Speaker 1>that you go to a movie that is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least at least part of its function </v>

155
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 1>is to portray reality in a realistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

156
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 1>But there's a soundtrack playing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background all the time.</v>

157
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:05.010
<v Speaker 1>And you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:05.844
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so useful and so appropriate that </v>

159
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 1>you don't notice how strange it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

160
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.570
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my point is,</v>

161
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 1>is that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

162
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:19.164
<v Speaker 1>and then of course you can talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>novels and plays the same way because </v>

163
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more to a novel then than </v>

164
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:27.470
<v Speaker 1>the words themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

165
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a novel is a deeply layered </v>

166
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:29.870
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

167
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:30.703
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of your understanding of the </v>

168
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 1>novel novel is your understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interrelationships between the layers,</v>

169
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:40.740
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a profound novel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

170
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I think this is why we have the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>depth in,</v>

171
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 1>in artistic and literary works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if it,</v>

172
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 1>if work is deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it has many,</v>

173
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:52.800
<v Speaker 1>many layers and the more layers it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting at the same time,</v>

174
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 1>the more it's a useful representation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the essential elements of being.</v>

175
00:09:57.481 --> 00:09:58.314
<v Speaker 1>And so the more meaningful it is to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's all to say that there are </v>

176
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:04.404
<v Speaker 1>modes of communication that provide us </v>
<v Speaker 1>with information that we can't </v>

177
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 1>articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that we still act,</v>

178
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.660
<v Speaker 1>we still act as if that information is </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid.</v>

179
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

180
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.670
<v Speaker 1>valid for what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly is it doing?</v>

181
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:18.504
<v Speaker 1>What is it representing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of information is it offering </v>

182
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Speaker 1>that's so compelling?</v>

183
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.933
<v Speaker 1>And what's so interesting about it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of information that we're </v>

184
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:26.544
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that information is so compelling that </v>

185
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:32.910
<v Speaker 1>you'll pay to expose yourself to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

186
00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a rare lecture that you'll go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have to pay for the lecture itself.</v>

187
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll come to the university and you'll</v>

188
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:41.490
<v Speaker 1>get your degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you had your option on a Saturday</v>

189
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:43.860
<v Speaker 1>afternoon or a Saturday night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

190
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.430
<v Speaker 1>it's relatively unlikely that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>attend a lecture,</v>

191
00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:50.100
<v Speaker 1>and certainly even more unlikely that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would pay to attend one,</v>

192
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:53.640
<v Speaker 1>but you'll certainly pay to go somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dance to music.</v>

193
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know why that is is not obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

194
00:10:58.021 --> 00:10:58.501
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

195
00:10:58.501 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

196
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 1>it's entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

197
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entertaining.</v>

198
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a lot more than that.</v>

199
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:06.720
<v Speaker 1>And I think that dismissing things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are enjoyable as entertainment,</v>

200
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 1>which means they're sort of peripheral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're unimportant in some sense,</v>

201
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.290
<v Speaker 1>which is often what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real,</v>

202
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a real terrible habit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists.</v>

203
00:11:16.171 --> 00:11:19.800
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Steven pinker wrote his book,</v>

204
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.100
<v Speaker 1>it's the book on language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate,</v>

205
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the name at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

206
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.453
<v Speaker 1>he devoted one chapter at the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically to nonverbal cultural forms </v>

207
00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:31.110
<v Speaker 1>and he talked about them as</v>

208
00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.573
<v Speaker 2>s</v>

209
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.190
<v Speaker 1>epic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenal.</v>

210
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

211
00:11:36.141 --> 00:11:36.974
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a byproduct and I think that's </v>

212
00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:39.914
<v Speaker 1>deeply wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that our culture actually grew </v>

213
00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:47.801
<v Speaker 1>out of dance and drama and music and </v>
<v Speaker 1>science came way,</v>

214
00:11:48.981 --> 00:11:49.760
<v Speaker 1>way later than</v>

215
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.260
<v Speaker 2>math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

216
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.293
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

217
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I was watching an old video today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

218
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 1>was up to the animals playing house of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rising sun in 1964.</v>

219
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty good video and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great old song.</v>

220
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't write it.</v>

221
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.223
<v Speaker 1>It's an old blues song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great old song and they do a </v>

222
00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:11.170
<v Speaker 1>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good job of it.</v>

223
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>And the audience was full of girls and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were screaming madly away.</v>

224
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Now it wasn't quite as bad as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beatles,</v>

225
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:21.370
<v Speaker 1>which was completely unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was still,</v>

226
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:22.204
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fairly continual den of delighted </v>

227
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:27.340
<v Speaker 1>shrieks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

228
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.713
<v Speaker 1>I think that's extremely interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'd never see that at a </v>

229
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 1>scientific conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

230
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:34.180
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's strange,</v>

231
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 1>like there isn't anything else that </v>
<v Speaker 1>elicits that kind of response.</v>

232
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

233
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe sports to some minimal degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly nowhere near the same,</v>

234
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.050
<v Speaker 1>nowhere near it with the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm.</v>

235
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.550
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you,</v>

236
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:50.560
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been happening for a long time.</v>

237
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:53.500
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't merely a phenomena of the 60s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

238
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.813
<v Speaker 1>I suspect it's been happening ever since</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been wandering minstrels and </v>

239
00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:59.050
<v Speaker 1>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>

240
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect those wandering minstrels </v>
<v Speaker 1>left many offspring behind them.</v>

241
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.420
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

242
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.150
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting about that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:07.984
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously part of the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings can sing is because we've </v>

244
00:13:10.571 --> 00:13:12.520
<v Speaker 1>selected each other for that ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

245
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:13.354
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean there's something very </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive about someone who's </v>

246
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.143
<v Speaker 1>artistically gifted and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that women will do back flips </v>

247
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.283
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

248
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.333
<v Speaker 1>for a singer is not necessarily any </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative comment on their ability to </v>

249
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.260
<v Speaker 1>evaluate what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be quite the reverse.</v>

250
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.123
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

251
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:34.840
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

252
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.673
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is there's lots of different </v>

253
00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:39.430
<v Speaker 1>ways that we can convey information and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

254
00:13:39.431 --> 00:13:40.264
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only simple information that can </v>

255
00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:42.610
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be conveyed that way.</v>

256
00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:46.750
<v Speaker 1>And you have to convey the complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>information in more formal forms,</v>

257
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 1>scientific and philosophical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's exactly backwards.</v>

258
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.813
<v Speaker 1>I think we get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get to articulate the simple stuff </v>

259
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:55.930
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is only what you'd expect,</v>

260
00:13:55.931 --> 00:13:56.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if,</v>

261
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.363
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're mastering something </v>

262
00:13:58.361 --> 00:13:59.650
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

263
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unfolding of being,</v>

264
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:02.674
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the simple things first and </v>

265
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.440
<v Speaker 1>complicated things later is pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>

266
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:09.274
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different fields advance at different </v>

267
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:11.470
<v Speaker 1>speeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

268
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:13.923
<v Speaker 1>about the artists and the musicians get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the complex matters far before the </v>

269
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.360
<v Speaker 1>scientists and the engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it has to be that way.</v>

270
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.060
<v Speaker 1>One of the deep things I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 1>young was that,</v>

271
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.420
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

272
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.020
<v Speaker 1>well as soon as our knowledge expands </v>
<v Speaker 1>out into the unknown,</v>

273
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.240
<v Speaker 1>there are people operating at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>periphery.</v>

274
00:14:33.241 --> 00:14:34.150
<v Speaker 1>And so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

275
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.770
<v Speaker 1>they really have one foot in the unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one foot on dry land,</v>

276
00:14:37.771 --> 00:14:38.604
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of the more and more in the </v>

277
00:14:39.991 --> 00:14:43.050
<v Speaker 1>water than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ones who are almost submerged up</v>

278
00:14:43.051 --> 00:14:45.210
<v Speaker 1>to their neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they tell you what they're seeing,</v>

279
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:46.044
<v Speaker 1>it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be poetic and musical and </v>

280
00:14:47.671 --> 00:14:48.504
<v Speaker 1>artistic because it's so far beyond our </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to articulate that we can't </v>

281
00:14:52.881 --> 00:14:53.714
<v Speaker 1>represent it in words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all that can happen is the </v>

282
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:59.030
<v Speaker 1>artists can get ahold of it and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're religious.</v>

283
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.470
<v Speaker 1>They're the people who are prone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious life sentiments,</v>

284
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:04.304
<v Speaker 1>which at least experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be associated by the way </v>

285
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:07.394
<v Speaker 1>with trade openness to have the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious experience rather than to be </v>

286
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:14.360
<v Speaker 1>an inherent of the dogma which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with low openness.</v>

287
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 1>So for young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:17.654
<v Speaker 1>it was the artists and the entrepreneurs</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're the same people who are </v>

289
00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:25.550
<v Speaker 1>at the forefront of the expansion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we know into what is unknown.</v>

290
00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:29.840
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can see echoes of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the way that cities are rejuvenated.</v>

291
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what happens,</v>

292
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:35.420
<v Speaker 1>you can certainly see this in Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a part of the city that has some</v>

293
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:39.620
<v Speaker 1>architectural or contextual interest but</v>
<v Speaker 1>is badly run down,</v>

294
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.990
<v Speaker 1>starts to get at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

295
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.200
<v Speaker 1>the artistic people show up and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

296
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.043
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

297
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.970
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of cool if we just did this</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it,</v>

298
00:15:47.971 --> 00:15:48.804
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

299
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:50.850
<v Speaker 1>they're re we really something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's usually,</v>

300
00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:54.560
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hurt that the rents are low </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course artists never have any</v>

301
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:55.394
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they go in there and civilize </v>

302
00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:58.130
<v Speaker 1>the hell out of it.</v>

303
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:58.963
<v Speaker 1>And of course they're ranting and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>drag jacks up the property values and </v>

304
00:16:01.641 --> 00:16:02.474
<v Speaker 1>then the people who are a little less </v>
<v Speaker 1>open but kinda interested in art start </v>

305
00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:06.014
<v Speaker 1>flowing in behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then soon the whole place is </v>

306
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.373
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenated and expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the artists have to go </v>

307
00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:12.580
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

308
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:13.650
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

309
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a very interesting phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what's happening is that even in</v>

310
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:21.110
<v Speaker 1>the cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're taking chaos and turning it into</v>

311
00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:22.910
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what artists do.</v>

312
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.010
<v Speaker 1>So now that's all to tell you that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are different ways of,</v>

313
00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.670
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

314
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitting,</v>

315
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:31.423
<v Speaker 1>representing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and transmitting information and that </v>

316
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.680
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

317
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.320
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

318
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.253
<v Speaker 1>incorporate the information without </v>
<v Speaker 1>having any articulated notion of what </v>

319
00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:39.764
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course that's the case because </v>

320
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:43.484
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you'd have to claim that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand everything you do and can </v>

321
00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:46.670
<v Speaker 1>articulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

322
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.230
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

323
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.370
<v Speaker 1>that's just wrong.</v>

324
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a theory of yourself,</v>

325
00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:53.414
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a very accurate theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you're always doing things </v>

326
00:16:55.821 --> 00:16:58.120
<v Speaker 1>that are strange as far as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

327
00:16:58.121 --> 00:17:00.110
<v Speaker 1>which is also extremely bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

328
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 1>who the hell are you if you can't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>control your own behavior,</v>

329
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

330
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.510
<v Speaker 1>and what does it mean to control it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to not control it?</v>

331
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.870
<v Speaker 1>These are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex and strange issues.</v>

332
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.330
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

333
00:17:14.331 --> 00:17:15.164
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the best way into this is </v>

334
00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>actually from an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

335
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.860
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced that this is correct,</v>

336
00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something to it.</v>

337
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:32.260
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

338
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.620
<v Speaker 1>when you think about the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience then you think,</v>

339
00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:37.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

340
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.113
<v Speaker 1>the nature of experience is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>different for quite different for </v>

341
00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:40.754
<v Speaker 1>different sorts of creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the primary difference </v>

342
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.290
<v Speaker 1>between creatures is the degree to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're capable of social interaction.</v>

343
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:53.290
<v Speaker 1>And then of complex social interaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>and primates generally speaking,</v>

344
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:58.311
<v Speaker 1>are very social creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live in troops or packs like dogs,</v>

345
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:00.743
<v Speaker 1>which is why we can get along with dogs </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we understand each other being </v>

346
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:04.104
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical troop animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We understand dogs and they understand </v>

347
00:18:06.901 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 1>us and they can fit right in pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

348
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:13.350
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very,</v>

349
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:15.810
<v Speaker 1>very good at figuring out where we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the truth.</v>

350
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.050
<v Speaker 1>And by we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean primates,</v>

351
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean us going back a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time.</v>

352
00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.253
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys and chimpanzees have very </v>

353
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:27.920
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated knowledge of the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure surrounding them.</v>

354
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.230
<v Speaker 1>They know who's who and they know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>status they are,</v>

355
00:18:31.231 --> 00:18:33.000
<v Speaker 1>they know what rank they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

356
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.673
<v Speaker 1>And that's also the case with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that you might </v>

357
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:43.320
<v Speaker 1>say about people is that our reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't nature.</v>

358
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's culture.</v>

359
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:47.483
<v Speaker 1>Now you can make the argument that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't really distinguish nature from </v>

360
00:18:49.951 --> 00:18:50.410
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

361
00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:51.780
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that</v>

362
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.090
<v Speaker 1>that's true and untrue in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

363
00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:01.310
<v Speaker 1>I think you can talk about the human and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonhuman elements of reality and you can</v>

364
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Speaker 1>identify the human elements of reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>as culture,</v>

365
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.810
<v Speaker 1>even though culture is so old that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can also think about it as an inevitable</v>

366
00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:12.550
<v Speaker 1>part of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

367
00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:17.551
<v Speaker 1>so most of our experience in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary past,</v>

368
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.043
<v Speaker 1>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say for the last several million </v>

369
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.043
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might as well go back to when the </v>

370
00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:24.624
<v Speaker 1>ancestors of humans hypothetically</v>
<v Speaker 1>split off from the ancestors of </v>

371
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.020
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

372
00:19:31.021 --> 00:19:31.854
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people know very accurately when </v>

373
00:19:34.231 --> 00:19:35.064
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of splits occur by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what they do is they have some </v>

374
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 1>sense of the rate of transformation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>DNA.</v>

375
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

376
00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:41.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

377
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.940
<v Speaker 1>it transforms at a rate that's fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant across time.</v>

378
00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:45.774
<v Speaker 1>And so then if you take two creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you determine how much genetic </v>

379
00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:50.184
<v Speaker 1>similarity there is between them and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much difference you can calculate how </v>

380
00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:54.540
<v Speaker 1>far back they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

381
00:19:54.541 --> 00:19:55.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverged.</v>

382
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.330
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

383
00:19:57.331 --> 00:20:00.000
<v Speaker 1>the fossil record helps with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's very sparse.</v>

384
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:00.834
<v Speaker 1>But the DNA record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really sparse at all in some </v>

385
00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:05.190
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can be very accurate about,</v>

386
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.720
<v Speaker 1>we can even tell when people evolved to </v>
<v Speaker 1>clerk or learn to wear clothing.</v>

387
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.213
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we can tell that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are certain kinds of </v>

388
00:20:12.841 --> 00:20:13.674
<v Speaker 1>lights that can only live on clothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they seem to have diverged from the </v>

389
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:20.340
<v Speaker 1>lice that live in hair about 50,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

390
00:20:20.341 --> 00:20:23.190
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the hypothesis is,</v>

391
00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:24.024
<v Speaker 1>well we must be figuring out how to wear</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes at that point because the lice </v>

392
00:20:26.671 --> 00:20:28.870
<v Speaker 1>figured out of the live in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

393
00:20:28.871 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 1>it probably took them a little while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I doubt if it took very long,</v>

394
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those little little creatures that breed</v>

395
00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:34.831
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

396
00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:38.130
<v Speaker 1>those things can evolve quickly much to </v>
<v Speaker 1>our dismay.</v>

397
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:39.863
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a big part of the experiential field </v>

398
00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:45.330
<v Speaker 1>of advanced primates is the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

399
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.093
<v Speaker 1>And so we could that the primate world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we could also say that another </v>

400
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:53.200
<v Speaker 1>big part of their experience is the non </v>
<v Speaker 1>primate world,</v>

401
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.290
<v Speaker 1>which would be roughly speaking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural world.</v>

402
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 1>And then we could also say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other element of their experience,</v>

403
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.513
<v Speaker 1>the other elements of their experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are very constant is their </v>

404
00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:04.894
<v Speaker 1>subjective being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know much about the </v>

405
00:21:08.081 --> 00:21:10.930
<v Speaker 1>subjective being of of creatures like </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees.</v>

406
00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Although</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

407
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.673
<v Speaker 1>you can understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this objective being of a dog </v>

408
00:21:17.081 --> 00:21:21.880
<v Speaker 1>well enough to be friend the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have some insight and I think</v>

409
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:22.714
<v Speaker 1>it's also reasonable to assume that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for a long time people were </v>

410
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:29.020
<v Speaker 1>unwilling to admit that animals while </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a soul,</v>

411
00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:30.070
<v Speaker 1>that was the first problem.</v>

412
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.903
<v Speaker 1>But after that that they were conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even the behavior is fought that </v>

413
00:21:34.271 --> 00:21:35.104
<v Speaker 1>notion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think the simplest thing to do is </v>

414
00:21:37.811 --> 00:21:40.390
<v Speaker 1>to assume that animals and human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the same,</v>

415
00:21:40.391 --> 00:21:41.224
<v Speaker 1>except when you can prove that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>are different because we share so much </v>

416
00:21:43.541 --> 00:21:47.080
<v Speaker 1>of our evolutionary paths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the logical inference is that if you</v>

417
00:21:47.081 --> 00:21:47.914
<v Speaker 1>think a dog is doing something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like you would do in that </v>

418
00:21:49.721 --> 00:21:50.554
<v Speaker 1>situation and feeling that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably is with certain exceptions </v>

419
00:21:54.161 --> 00:21:56.860
<v Speaker 1>for species difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that wasn't the case,</v>

420
00:21:56.861 --> 00:22:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you could have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with a dog or cat.</v>

421
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.040
<v Speaker 1>You can't have much of a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lizard.</v>

422
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Although there are lizards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are lizards,</v>

423
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.500
<v Speaker 1>a bearded dragons in particular that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>social.</v>

424
00:22:08.501 --> 00:22:09.334
<v Speaker 1>They like to lay on top of each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they hang around together and you </v>

425
00:22:11.711 --> 00:22:13.810
<v Speaker 1>can actually have more of a relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

426
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.150
<v Speaker 1>And apparently the same is true if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go on us.</v>

427
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.120
<v Speaker 1>So you can go quite a ways back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary,</v>

428
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards in evolutionary time and still</v>

429
00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:24.214
<v Speaker 1>have enough similarity between you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the creature that you're interacting </v>

430
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:27.334
<v Speaker 1>with so that you can get a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of at least some element of their </v>

431
00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.270
<v Speaker 1>their being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that subjective,</v>

432
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:38.380
<v Speaker 1>our subjectivity is a very ancient part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our experience.</v>

433
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:40.990
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me to be a perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable supposition.</v>

434
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.183
<v Speaker 1>We certainly know that it's been around </v>
<v Speaker 1>in all likelihood for at least 150,000 </v>

435
00:22:46.511 --> 00:22:47.344
<v Speaker 1>years on the conservative side because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been human beings that are </v>

436
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.513
<v Speaker 1>essentially identical to us from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic perspective going back 150,000 </v>

437
00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:56.674
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think you'd have to be a pretty </v>

438
00:22:58.631 --> 00:23:01.900
<v Speaker 1>harsh judge to assume that higher order </v>
<v Speaker 1>primates,</v>

439
00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 1>like chimps don't have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and you know,</v>

440
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.850
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some limited self consciousness.</v>

441
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you market chimps knows with lipstick</v>

442
00:23:12.431 --> 00:23:13.264
<v Speaker 1>and then show it a mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will at least sometimes take the </v>

443
00:23:16.811 --> 00:23:17.644
<v Speaker 1>lipstick off its nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I've seen a gorilla try to </v>

444
00:23:19.781 --> 00:23:21.310
<v Speaker 1>fight with a mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

445
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.650
<v Speaker 1>well not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't personally seen that,</v>

446
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.360
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen a very good video of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

447
00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:30.520
<v Speaker 1>But I think the gorilla and it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually figure out that it was,</v>

448
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.930
<v Speaker 1>that was him in the mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

449
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.353
<v Speaker 1>dogs will recognize a dog in the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they seem to learn to ignore their </v>

450
00:23:38.771 --> 00:23:40.360
<v Speaker 1>reflection very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

451
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:41.194
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if that means that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a rudimentary self consciousness </v>

452
00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:46.640
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they figure out that that dog is them.</v>

453
00:23:46.641 --> 00:23:47.474
<v Speaker 1>Or if the dog just doesn't smell like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog and then the dog thinks while it </v>

454
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:52.514
<v Speaker 1>can't be a dog because it doesn't smell </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dog and the dog's probably think </v>

455
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:55.724
<v Speaker 1>that something is a dog because of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>it smells and not because of how it </v>

456
00:23:58.671 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Speaker 1>looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

457
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.310
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I think that's why dogs </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't seem to have any sense of relative</v>

458
00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:06.530
<v Speaker 1>size because you can get a chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

459
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:09.500
<v Speaker 1>a little Chihuahua barking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mad at a great Dane.</v>

460
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:11.180
<v Speaker 1>You think really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

461
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to work is it?</v>

462
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.280
<v Speaker 1>The dog doesn't seem to have a clue </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

463
00:24:16.281 --> 00:24:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Like he's perfectly happy and great day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and weirdly enough we'll often back off.</v>

464
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.750
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

465
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:29.600
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been in the social world at deeply</v>

466
00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:30.434
<v Speaker 1>social world for a long time and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>also going to make the presupposition </v>

467
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:36.810
<v Speaker 1>that we'd been in the stratified social </v>
<v Speaker 1>world for a very long period of time.</v>

468
00:24:36.811 --> 00:24:39.920
<v Speaker 1>And I think that you could call that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to.</v>

469
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:41.780
<v Speaker 1>And I would never want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

470
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:44.330
<v Speaker 1>you could call that the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

471
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:45.973
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it that because that's </v>

472
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:49.670
<v Speaker 1>not what it is.</v>

473
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:50.893
<v Speaker 1>But I think that the fact that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>called that and that that's accepted as </v>

474
00:24:56.871 --> 00:24:57.704
<v Speaker 1>a reasonable representation is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of the action of an </v>

475
00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:02.624
<v Speaker 1>archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the archetype is that it's the </v>

476
00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:08.210
<v Speaker 1>archetype of the terrible great father </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

477
00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 1>because you think there's a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure with striations in it and that</v>

478
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:15.590
<v Speaker 1>has advantages and disadvantages and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages are you can live in it.</v>

479
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:20.090
<v Speaker 1>And the disadvantages are you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the damn rules and they might not</v>

480
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.640
<v Speaker 1>necessarily be to your individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits.</v>

481
00:25:22.641 --> 00:25:27.440
<v Speaker 1>So within a social dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is always a bifurcated.</v>

482
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.430
<v Speaker 1>It also always has bifurcated </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>

483
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.910
<v Speaker 1>It can be good and he is good in so far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it protects you from say,</v>

484
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.880
<v Speaker 1>from threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from without,</v>

485
00:25:37.881 --> 00:25:38.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe from,</v>

486
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.000
<v Speaker 1>from other primates invading your </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>

487
00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:41.834
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also can be a very dismal </v>

488
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:46.850
<v Speaker 1>structure for if you happen to be at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the hierarchy.</v>

489
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

490
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.953
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dominant structures typically </v>

491
00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.460
<v Speaker 1>represented as masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that,</v>

492
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.590
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not absolutely certain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

493
00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.293
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason for that is that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>social hierarchies are probably more </v>

494
00:26:07.821 --> 00:26:08.654
<v Speaker 1>like chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social hierarchies then they are like </v>

495
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:10.873
<v Speaker 1>honorable social hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Bonobos are kind of a strange </v>

496
00:26:13.881 --> 00:26:14.714
<v Speaker 1>breed of chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you know about </v>

497
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:16.874
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Bonobos are extraordinarily </v>

498
00:26:19.731 --> 00:26:20.564
<v Speaker 1>sexual and they use sex pretty much as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard means of communication and </v>

499
00:26:25.621 --> 00:26:27.720
<v Speaker 1>tension reduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

500
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of sex between the females</v>
<v Speaker 1>learnable troops and they,</v>

501
00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.223
<v Speaker 1>the use of sex seems to bond them </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in a way that keeps male </v>

502
00:26:36.891 --> 00:26:39.230
<v Speaker 1>aggression under control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting.</v>

503
00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:41.600
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the chimps,</v>

504
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:42.434
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental hierarchy is male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although there's a female dominance </v>

505
00:26:46.441 --> 00:26:47.280
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy as well.</v>

506
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.000
<v Speaker 1>And some females can certainly be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant than some males,</v>

507
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.190
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental structure seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be male.</v>

508
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.473
<v Speaker 1>And then I would also say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's probably dependent to some </v>

509
00:26:57.391 --> 00:27:02.391
<v Speaker 1>degree in the primate community and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>other social animals on other factors.</v>

510
00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:04.620
<v Speaker 1>So we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

511
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:06.720
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

512
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:07.733
<v Speaker 1>the gender that has the highest level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone tends to be the dominant </v>

513
00:27:11.251 --> 00:27:13.230
<v Speaker 1>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in hyenas,</v>

514
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.380
<v Speaker 1>the females have larger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have higher levels of testosterone.</v>

515
00:27:16.381 --> 00:27:17.214
<v Speaker 1>There are actually bigger and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive than the males in the price </v>

516
00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:19.854
<v Speaker 1>they pay for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is that they have to give birth </v>

517
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:23.640
<v Speaker 1>through structured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very much like a penis,</v>

518
00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:24.474
<v Speaker 1>which is not the world's most pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and might account for the </v>

519
00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:29.670
<v Speaker 1>hyenas temper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

520
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.920
<v Speaker 1>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in human beings,</v>

521
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:32.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

522
00:27:32.911 --> 00:27:36.240
<v Speaker 1>you see sexual dimorphism men are </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly bigger than women.</v>

523
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's also generally characteristic</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

524
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.073
<v Speaker 1>of creatures that have a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy that's tilted towards </v>

525
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.453
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>

526
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And then the other factor seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

527
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.440
<v Speaker 1>human beings have their be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their infants are infants have very,</v>

528
00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:53.161
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

529
00:27:53.161 --> 00:27:55.740
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long periods of dependence.</v>

530
00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:01.160
<v Speaker 1>And it's very difficult to maneuver your</v>
<v Speaker 1>way doing anything really,</v>

531
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.480
<v Speaker 1>especially anything that has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition and power.</v>

532
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.420
<v Speaker 1>If you're taking care of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.000
<v Speaker 1>one infant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone three.</v>

534
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.720
<v Speaker 1>And so it seems to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>that those are all valid reasons why the</v>

535
00:28:21.031 --> 00:28:21.864
<v Speaker 1>primary power structures among human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have typically be male and why </v>

536
00:28:25.261 --> 00:28:26.094
<v Speaker 1>they're represented as masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I thought there are other reasons </v>

537
00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:31.530
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause this is a multifaceted phenomenon.</v>

538
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:32.873
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about human females is that </v>

539
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.673
<v Speaker 1>they're selective maters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now chimp females are not selective </v>

540
00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:41.694
<v Speaker 1>majors and what that means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant males still have most of the </v>

541
00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:45.174
<v Speaker 1>offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason for that apparently is </v>

542
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.360
<v Speaker 1>because they chase the subordinate males</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from sexually receptive females.</v>

543
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.493
<v Speaker 1>Although this sexually receptive females</v>
<v Speaker 1>will sneak off behind a rock somewhere </v>

544
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.393
<v Speaker 1>and mate with a subordinate male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as long as the dominant male is </v>

545
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:02.124
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability of that is quite low so </v>

546
00:29:03.661 --> 00:29:06.120
<v Speaker 1>that the female chimps aren't sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>selective.</v>

547
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.373
<v Speaker 1>Whereas human females have concealed </v>
<v Speaker 1>ovulation so that no one knows when </v>

548
00:29:10.561 --> 00:29:13.500
<v Speaker 1>they're at their most fertile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're selective maters.</v>

549
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:14.603
<v Speaker 1>And women in every society virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ever been studied have a typical </v>

550
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.833
<v Speaker 1>pattern of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that if you look at a female </v>

551
00:29:21.601 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy and you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>male dominance hierarchy,</v>

552
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:28.590
<v Speaker 1>the females will mate across and up </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies and the males will</v>

553
00:29:28.591 --> 00:29:29.424
<v Speaker 1>mate across and down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which works fine both genders because </v>

554
00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:35.130
<v Speaker 1>their interests align.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

555
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:41.210
<v Speaker 1>but it also means that in all likelihood</v>
<v Speaker 1>that women had exerted tremendous sexual</v>

556
00:29:41.681 --> 00:29:45.130
<v Speaker 1>selection pressure on men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might be part of the reason,</v>

557
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.230
<v Speaker 1>many of the many reasons that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

558
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:47.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

559
00:29:47.831 --> 00:29:48.664
<v Speaker 1>the theory is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the common ancestor between </v>

560
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:52.570
<v Speaker 1>chimps and humans was a lot more like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>champ,</v>

561
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.490
<v Speaker 1>a modern champ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then like a modern human.</v>

562
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:55.893
<v Speaker 1>So for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've undergone a lot more </v>

563
00:29:57.821 --> 00:30:00.820
<v Speaker 1>transformation in the last 7 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years then chimps have.</v>

564
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.910
<v Speaker 1>And one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one possible reason for that,</v>

565
00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's a highly probable </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

566
00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:09.220
<v Speaker 1>is that sexual selection operated lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more viciously,</v>

567
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.810
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among humans.</v>

568
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.913
<v Speaker 1>It's operated to the point where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have twice as many female ancestors as </v>

569
00:30:16.331 --> 00:30:18.130
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>

570
00:30:18.131 --> 00:30:19.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can't be possible,</v>

571
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:20.224
<v Speaker 1>but here's how it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only every second Manhattan </v>

572
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.240
<v Speaker 1>children at Agile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

573
00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:28.000
<v Speaker 1>all women had one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now of course that isn't what happened,</v>

574
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 1>but on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened.</v>

575
00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:30.723
<v Speaker 1>So the proportion of men who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely childless in any given </v>

576
00:30:35.201 --> 00:30:38.530
<v Speaker 1>generation is far higher than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion of women who are.</v>

577
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:39.873
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see an element of expandability in </v>

578
00:30:41.771 --> 00:30:45.400
<v Speaker 1>males,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's typical across the biological</v>

579
00:30:45.401 --> 00:30:46.234
<v Speaker 1>community because you don't need as many</v>
<v Speaker 1>males as you need females in order to </v>

580
00:30:48.761 --> 00:30:50.530
<v Speaker 1>keep the population moving forward.</v>

581
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:51.933
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that happens as a </v>

582
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:55.240
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>

583
00:30:55.241 --> 00:30:56.074
<v Speaker 1>is that males are more behaviorally </v>
<v Speaker 1>variable and variable across a lot of </v>

584
00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:00.814
<v Speaker 1>dimensions than females are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a plus because they're more </v>

585
00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:06.430
<v Speaker 1>variable on the upside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a negative because they're</v>

586
00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:07.264
<v Speaker 1>more prevalent on the downside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now there's substantial argument </v>

587
00:31:10.421 --> 00:31:12.700
<v Speaker 1>about that in relationship to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

588
00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:16.540
<v Speaker 1>what the actual implications are of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>for human beings.</v>

589
00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:17.623
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one potential implication is that </v>

590
00:31:19.871 --> 00:31:24.871
<v Speaker 1>although women and men have equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq is the standard deviation is slightly</v>

591
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:26.134
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that there are more males </v>

592
00:31:28.961 --> 00:31:32.110
<v Speaker 1>who are intellectually impaired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also more males who are four</v>

593
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:34.570
<v Speaker 1>and five standard deviations above the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

594
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need much of a difference in,</v>

595
00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:37.623
<v Speaker 1>in standard deviation in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce radical differences at the </v>

596
00:31:41.111 --> 00:31:42.970
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

597
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example,</v>

598
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.100
<v Speaker 1>males are more aggressive than females </v>
<v Speaker 1>among humans,</v>

599
00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.090
<v Speaker 1>but the effect is only about half a </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard deviation.</v>

600
00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:57.010
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take two females,</v>

601
00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.860
<v Speaker 1>a female and a male random lead from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

602
00:31:59.861 --> 00:32:03.070
<v Speaker 1>and you were trying to guess who was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>more aggressive of the two,</v>

603
00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:04.940
<v Speaker 1>most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

604
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:09.760
<v Speaker 1>about 60% of the time the male would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more aggressive than the female,</v>

605
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.740
<v Speaker 1>but 40% of the time it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>reversed.</v>

606
00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:12.191
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

607
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:13.750
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of overlap.</v>

608
00:32:13.751 --> 00:32:18.751
<v Speaker 1>But then here's the rub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say just for example,</v>

609
00:32:18.821 --> 00:32:22.150
<v Speaker 1>that among the population of men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women combined,</v>

610
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:27.220
<v Speaker 1>only the most aggressive person out of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred ends up in jail.</v>

611
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:28.953
<v Speaker 1>Those are all men because that tilt </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards aggression is enough so that if </v>

612
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:35.140
<v Speaker 1>you go way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way out on the distribution,</v>

613
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.170
<v Speaker 1>the only people who are that extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our men,</v>

614
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 1>even though the population isn't that </v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

615
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.820
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a massive debate in the,</v>

616
00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:45.003
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant literature about the potential </v>

617
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:48.254
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that for things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive function because there's some </v>

618
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:54.400
<v Speaker 1>indication as well that men are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitively specialized,</v>

619
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.540
<v Speaker 1>but women are more cognitively robust.</v>

620
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.750
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter.</v>

621
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:00.973
<v Speaker 1>But what does matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does matter is the fact of this </v>

622
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:04.303
<v Speaker 1>permanent dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the dominance hierarchy also has </v>

623
00:33:06.381 --> 00:33:07.214
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the male dominance hierarchy also has </v>

624
00:33:09.051 --> 00:33:11.750
<v Speaker 1>another feature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we already said that,</v>

625
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:12.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on average men are half as likely to </v>

626
00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:16.034
<v Speaker 1>leave offspring as women are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that all </v>

627
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:21.120
<v Speaker 1>things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

628
00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:23.893
<v Speaker 1>this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to make this into a </v>

629
00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:27.183
<v Speaker 1>circular argument because I could say </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the more successful males that </v>

630
00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:32.360
<v Speaker 1>leave offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you'd say,</v>

631
00:33:32.361 --> 00:33:35.030
<v Speaker 1>well that's a definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian definition of success.</v>

632
00:33:35.031 --> 00:33:37.430
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean Darwinian success.</v>

633
00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:39.123
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean is that if you look in the </v>

634
00:33:41.031 --> 00:33:41.864
<v Speaker 1>modern world for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you try to predict number of </v>

635
00:33:45.471 --> 00:33:48.500
<v Speaker 1>available sexual partners for given </v>
<v Speaker 1>mail,</v>

636
00:33:48.501 --> 00:33:52.700
<v Speaker 1>your best predictive measure of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>income.</v>

637
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.960
<v Speaker 1>And the best predictive measure of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is intelligence and conscientiousness.</v>

638
00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:58.483
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that males orient</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in groups and then they </v>

639
00:34:02.931 --> 00:34:07.580
<v Speaker 1>compete and then women peel off the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

640
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:11.630
<v Speaker 1>and so the women are in a position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment on men.</v>

641
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.600
<v Speaker 1>And the judgment is the judgment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

642
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a Darwinian perspective,</v>

643
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:19.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we think of nature,</v>

644
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:22.160
<v Speaker 1>we think of like a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on who you are.</v>

645
00:34:22.161 --> 00:34:22.994
<v Speaker 1>But like if you're an environmentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of a French impressionists </v>

646
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:25.940
<v Speaker 1>landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

647
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:27.523
<v Speaker 1>forgetting that nature is also malarial </v>
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes and cancer and all those and </v>

648
00:34:30.801 --> 00:34:31.634
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats infected with bubonic plague and </v>

649
00:34:32.961 --> 00:34:35.300
<v Speaker 1>all those other lovely things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

650
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:37.183
<v Speaker 1>but from a Darwinian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can define nature much more </v>

651
00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:45.150
<v Speaker 1>straightforwardly and more accurately as</v>
<v Speaker 1>that which selects now,</v>

652
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:46.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear a lot about natural selection </v>

653
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.573
<v Speaker 1>and natural selection basically assumes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are a random distribution of </v>

654
00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:58.520
<v Speaker 1>alterations in genetic structure in any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any population,</v>

655
00:34:58.521 --> 00:34:59.600
<v Speaker 1>in any generation.</v>

656
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.033
<v Speaker 1>And some of those random alterations </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be more suited to that particular </v>

657
00:35:04.701 --> 00:35:08.420
<v Speaker 1>environment suited being they'll live </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll reproduce.</v>

658
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:09.613
<v Speaker 1>And genetic transformation takes place </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the millennia as the organism </v>

659
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.530
<v Speaker 1>chases the landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

660
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.790
<v Speaker 1>But Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

661
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Darwin who is an unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent person,</v>

662
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.840
<v Speaker 1>was also very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interested in sexual selection.</v>

663
00:35:26.841 --> 00:35:27.674
<v Speaker 1>And as far as Darwin was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual selection was just as powerful a </v>

664
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:34.250
<v Speaker 1>force in modifying genetic structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modifying them,</v>

665
00:35:34.251 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 1>driving evolution as um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural selection.</v>

666
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way have been very </v>
<v Speaker 1>underplayed by biologists.</v>

667
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only started to switch </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe in the last,</v>

668
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I would say it hasn't switched that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

669
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.000
<v Speaker 1>but it only really started to switch </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably in about the last 25 years.</v>

670
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:52.163
<v Speaker 1>And that's because the idea of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection makes things a hell of a lot </v>

671
00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:57.050
<v Speaker 1>more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

672
00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.790
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

673
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:01.860
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

674
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:04.230
<v Speaker 1>in the standard Darwinian account of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution,</v>

675
00:36:04.231 --> 00:36:05.820
<v Speaker 1>there's no place for mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

676
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no place for a creator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no place for teleology.</v>

677
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:12.330
<v Speaker 1>And teleology is something moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards an end goal.</v>

678
00:36:12.331 --> 00:36:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your thing is if sexual selection is</v>

679
00:36:17.011 --> 00:36:17.844
<v Speaker 1>operative and if consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient than mine has been operating </v>

680
00:36:23.521 --> 00:36:26.580
<v Speaker 1>through sexual selection and as long as </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been sexual selection,</v>

681
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you think,</v>

682
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.900
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have any choice?</v>

683
00:36:30.901 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you make any choice in who your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner will be?</v>

684
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.070
<v Speaker 1>A sexual partner will be an answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as well.</v>

685
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:41.040
<v Speaker 1>It's hardly random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make a choice.</v>

686
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.840
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

687
00:36:42.841 --> 00:36:43.674
<v Speaker 1>if you take 60 people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say if you took 60 women and you </v>

688
00:36:46.081 --> 00:36:46.914
<v Speaker 1>ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you showed them a bunch of man and you </v>

689
00:36:48.151 --> 00:36:50.550
<v Speaker 1>asked them to rank them in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their attractiveness,</v>

690
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.890
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be fairly consistent </v>
<v Speaker 1>rankings.</v>

691
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:53.761
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

692
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:58.200
<v Speaker 1>we know what makes up attractive facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>features for women and for men you,</v>

693
00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:59.490
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to determine that.</v>

694
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.610
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you take 60 faces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

695
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:03.623
<v Speaker 1>you average the features so you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the average person because the </v>

696
00:37:07.561 --> 00:37:08.394
<v Speaker 1>average person is more like immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the average person and the </v>

697
00:37:12.391 --> 00:37:13.224
<v Speaker 1>average person has perfectly symmetrical</v>
<v Speaker 1>features that are nicely shaped and </v>

698
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:17.610
<v Speaker 1>fairly big eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

699
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.290
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>

700
00:37:19.291 --> 00:37:19.921
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

701
00:37:19.921 --> 00:37:21.990
<v Speaker 1>they're very nice looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very attractive.</v>

702
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.243
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>central human form in the sense that </v>

703
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:28.163
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find attractive and we see this in </v>

704
00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:31.770
<v Speaker 1>other species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

705
00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:34.860
<v Speaker 1>there are butterflies who won't mate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with another butterfly if it's,</v>

706
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:35.993
<v Speaker 1>if it's like a 16th of an inch out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetry because then it's not a </v>

707
00:37:39.601 --> 00:37:41.370
<v Speaker 1>butterfly of that type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

708
00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:45.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's how people think too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the more you deviate from the average</v>

709
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:46.703
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less canonically human you appear </v>

710
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.660
<v Speaker 1>and the less attractive that you appear.</v>

711
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.351
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

712
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:53.184
<v Speaker 1>we're chasing this ideal in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an emergent property of the </v>

713
00:37:56.071 --> 00:37:58.320
<v Speaker 1>nature of our species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

714
00:37:59.100 --> 00:37:59.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain physical </v>

715
00:38:00.961 --> 00:38:02.560
<v Speaker 1>characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

716
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.730
<v Speaker 1>wide shoulders in men and narrow waist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women.</v>

717
00:38:05.731 --> 00:38:06.564
<v Speaker 1>It's waist to hip ratio is a very common</v>
<v Speaker 1>marker of beauty across cultures and </v>

718
00:38:10.261 --> 00:38:12.240
<v Speaker 1>across body types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough.</v>

719
00:38:12.241 --> 00:38:13.074
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take federal women and heavier </v>

720
00:38:15.661 --> 00:38:16.494
<v Speaker 1>women and you get men to rate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness of the women within that </v>

721
00:38:20.011 --> 00:38:20.844
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heavy women and the light women who </v>

722
00:38:22.471 --> 00:38:23.304
<v Speaker 1>have a hip waist to hip ratio of about </v>
<v Speaker 1>0.68 are the ones that are judged most </v>

723
00:38:26.041 --> 00:38:26.874
<v Speaker 1>attractive physically and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that actually correlates by the way </v>

724
00:38:30.421 --> 00:38:31.254
<v Speaker 1>with fertility because this abdominal </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat in a young woman is a sign of ill </v>

725
00:38:35.201 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 1>health and also a mark or a decreased </v>
<v Speaker 1>likelihood of conception.</v>

726
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Now none of this is operating co </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously,</v>

727
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's deeply wired into us.</v>

728
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:48.421
<v Speaker 1>It's part of our immediate perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it still does indicate that there is</v>

729
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:49.834
<v Speaker 1>an ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a platonic ideal lurking at the </v>

730
00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:56.140
<v Speaker 1>back of our minds against whom we </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare everyone that we meet.</v>

731
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.660
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the nature of that plot?</v>

732
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Platonic ideal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very,</v>

733
00:39:01.571 --> 00:39:03.790
<v Speaker 1>very complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

734
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I would say that I would say that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

735
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.400
<v Speaker 1>you could almost literally claim that</v>

736
00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.673
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

737
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:17.530
<v Speaker 1>well you can certainly claim that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal male is represented mythology as a</v>

738
00:39:19.521 --> 00:39:22.370
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

739
00:39:22.371 --> 00:39:24.140
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually what mythologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

740
00:39:24.141 --> 00:39:26.540
<v Speaker 1>It's about representing ideal patterns </v>
<v Speaker 1>of behavior.</v>

741
00:39:26.541 --> 00:39:29.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's hardly surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

742
00:39:29.001 --> 00:39:34.001
<v Speaker 1>if you go to a movie and it's a romance </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's the main lead character that</v>

743
00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:35.443
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to fall in love with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to be the kind of person </v>

744
00:39:38.091 --> 00:39:39.950
<v Speaker 1>that would fall in love with that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of person,</v>

745
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:45.370
<v Speaker 1>then he's going to act out of particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>a particular pattern of behavior and the</v>

746
00:39:46.161 --> 00:39:48.230
<v Speaker 1>pattern of behavior is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable.</v>

747
00:39:48.231 --> 00:39:49.640
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be,</v>

748
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:53.000
<v Speaker 1>he's going to move forward and explore </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not hide in cower.</v>

749
00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.253
<v Speaker 1>And the probability that is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative is very high and the </v>

750
00:39:56.151 --> 00:39:58.480
<v Speaker 1>probability that he's going to be good </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking and strong,</v>

751
00:39:58.481 --> 00:39:59.314
<v Speaker 1>it's very high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those are architectural features </v>

752
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:07.040
<v Speaker 1>and those aren't all the architectural </v>
<v Speaker 1>features because those are in some sense</v>

753
00:40:07.041 --> 00:40:10.970
<v Speaker 1>those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the self evident once.</v>

754
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.193
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are also evaluating each other </v>

755
00:40:13.941 --> 00:40:17.240
<v Speaker 1>for such things as intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and character.</v>

756
00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:18.903
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

757
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.673
<v Speaker 1>you could say in some sense the men are </v>
<v Speaker 1>competing to be the best man and the </v>

758
00:40:24.501 --> 00:40:25.334
<v Speaker 1>women are watching the male competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take the man who wins on the </v>

759
00:40:28.491 --> 00:40:31.070
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that he wouldn't win if </v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't the best map.</v>

760
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent strategy,</v>

761
00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because why not outsource the problem </v>

762
00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:39.790
<v Speaker 1>you let the men sorted out while exists </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cognitive,</v>

763
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:40.703
<v Speaker 1>to cognitively complex to compute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say that the male dominance </v>

764
00:40:43.611 --> 00:40:45.320
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy is equivalent to the stock </v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

765
00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:46.993
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly equivalent to the stock </v>
<v Speaker 1>market is the mitten you'd like the </v>

766
00:40:48.951 --> 00:40:49.784
<v Speaker 1>stocks or stocks are always competing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with one another and with every other </v>

767
00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:56.210
<v Speaker 1>commodity for primacy of price and </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

768
00:40:56.211 --> 00:40:59.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happens with </v>
<v Speaker 1>male competition.</v>

769
00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:02.870
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that we've just </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered in my lab,</v>

770
00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.060
<v Speaker 1>this is Caitlin burtons work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very cool.</v>

771
00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:06.283
<v Speaker 1>We took a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were trying to understand the </v>

772
00:41:08.301 --> 00:41:12.860
<v Speaker 1>fundamental substructure of conservatism</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus liberalism and we're,</v>

773
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:16.580
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to speak in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism because that's how we,</v>

774
00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.530
<v Speaker 1>that's how we construed the data.</v>

775
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:19.363
<v Speaker 1>Although we could have done the reverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were going to construe liberalism </v>

776
00:41:21.141 --> 00:41:25.160
<v Speaker 1>and what we did was we took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a bunch of people to sit down and</v>

777
00:41:25.161 --> 00:41:25.994
<v Speaker 1>write down statements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought that conservatives versus </v>

778
00:41:28.221 --> 00:41:30.590
<v Speaker 1>liberals would disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know?</v>

779
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I think we had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how many statements,</v>

780
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:33.733
<v Speaker 1>300 something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have a lot of people generate </v>

781
00:41:35.841 --> 00:41:39.620
<v Speaker 1>them and take them from news items and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth because we didn't want any bias</v>

782
00:41:39.621 --> 00:41:41.930
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the initial questions step,</v>

783
00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:43.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

784
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:48.050
<v Speaker 1>or we didn't want to buy us that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the actual world.</v>

785
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:52.520
<v Speaker 1>So we have many people do this and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we gave these questions too many,</v>

786
00:41:52.521 --> 00:41:56.090
<v Speaker 1>many people online in a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stages.</v>

787
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.193
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we extracted those out that seemed to </v>

788
00:42:00.711 --> 00:42:04.310
<v Speaker 1>best fit the data and that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then assess them for the utility and</v>

789
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:07.280
<v Speaker 1>predicting things like party membership </v>
<v Speaker 1>or voting behavior.</v>

790
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:09.890
<v Speaker 1>And so we got a good structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes a lot of sense.</v>

791
00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 1>And what we found with regards to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism was,</v>

792
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an ethnocentrism factor.</v>

793
00:42:16.821 --> 00:42:17.654
<v Speaker 1>It was the third week is factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be associated with in </v>

794
00:42:20.091 --> 00:42:22.490
<v Speaker 1>group preference versus outgroup </v>
<v Speaker 1>derogation.</v>

795
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.520
<v Speaker 1>So those are anti-immigrant people </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>

796
00:42:25.521 --> 00:42:26.354
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>

797
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.150
<v Speaker 1>they're leather ethnocentric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

798
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:31.760
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the simplest way to,</v>

799
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.810
<v Speaker 1>that's the simplest way to explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next block that,</v>

800
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.360
<v Speaker 1>the second smallest factor was basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious traditionalism.</v>

801
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:42.583
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of this was done with </v>

802
00:42:43.791 --> 00:42:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

803
00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.160
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a variety of reasons.</v>

804
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.160
<v Speaker 1>And that was really where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist Christians nested,</v>

805
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>

806
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:51.140
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everyone.</v>

807
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.233
<v Speaker 1>That was not only a factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't only a factor made up a </v>

808
00:42:55.851 --> 00:42:58.790
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist Christian beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they loaded ha ha.</v>

809
00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.673
<v Speaker 1>Heavily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were people who weren't for stem </v>

810
00:43:01.551 --> 00:43:02.390
<v Speaker 1>cell research.</v>

811
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.940
<v Speaker 1>They were antiabortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were anti gay marriage.</v>

812
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they were pro traditional,</v>

813
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:13.600
<v Speaker 1>which is how they see themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the largest factor was what was</v>

814
00:43:14.451 --> 00:43:17.990
<v Speaker 1>a factor that we call masculine </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

815
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:19.603
<v Speaker 1>And it was more characteristic of men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what it basically consisted of was </v>

816
00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:27.050
<v Speaker 1>an attitude that winners win and losers </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose.</v>

817
00:43:27.051 --> 00:43:29.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's just how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there it was,</v>

818
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:30.620
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

819
00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:33.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the men who the personality predictors,</v>

820
00:43:33.261 --> 00:43:35.960
<v Speaker 1>one of them was extroverted </v>
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness for example.</v>

821
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.840
<v Speaker 1>These were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are hunting and,</v>

822
00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:41.180
<v Speaker 1>and the right to own firearms also </v>
<v Speaker 1>loaded on this factor.</v>

823
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:46.360
<v Speaker 1>But it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was masculine competitiveness I think</v>

824
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:49.160
<v Speaker 1>is the best way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

825
00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:52.203
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

826
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.113
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good illustration of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of individual attitude that makes </v>

827
00:43:56.121 --> 00:43:56.954
<v Speaker 1>you more likely to attempt to climb up </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies and dominate them </v>

828
00:44:00.231 --> 00:44:01.640
<v Speaker 1>from the top down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

829
00:44:01.641 --> 00:44:02.474
<v Speaker 1>And that's not necessarily something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be associated with factors </v>

830
00:44:04.611 --> 00:44:06.830
<v Speaker 1>like compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

831
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.600
<v Speaker 1>and then we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

832
00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:10.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

833
00:44:10.551 --> 00:44:12.000
<v Speaker 1>you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

834
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:12.973
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you that because you can see</v>
<v Speaker 1>how these proclivities emerge and </v>

835
00:44:15.351 --> 00:44:18.530
<v Speaker 1>manifest themselves in all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas of behavior.</v>

836
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.930
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you something else that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting about,</v>

837
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.020
<v Speaker 1>about men and violence.</v>

838
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.753
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

839
00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can the story straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

840
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.520
<v Speaker 2>it's been a while since I told it.</v>

841
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:39.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this interesting phenomenon </v>

842
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 1>that it's very characteristic of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

843
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.063
<v Speaker 1>of societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe pretty much everywhere it's </v>

844
00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:49.644
<v Speaker 1>being studied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can calculate an index called </v>

845
00:44:53.251 --> 00:44:54.084
<v Speaker 1>the Gini Coefficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Gini Coefficient is a number that </v>

846
00:44:57.151 --> 00:45:00.840
<v Speaker 1>represents how much inequality of income</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

847
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:01.674
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a given geographical area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could calculate a Gini </v>

848
00:45:04.531 --> 00:45:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Coefficient for a street or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

849
00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:08.383
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an area in a city or a city or a state </v>

850
00:45:10.321 --> 00:45:12.120
<v Speaker 1>or a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it at all those levels.</v>

851
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.553
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

852
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:15.390
<v Speaker 1>what you find is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

853
00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.480
<v Speaker 1>you always hear this idea that poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes crime.</v>

854
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:22.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a classic left wing idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's wrong.</v>

855
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.560
<v Speaker 1>It's seriously wrong and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly wrong.</v>

856
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:29.130
<v Speaker 1>And it's d definitively wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

857
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:32.490
<v Speaker 1>so there's no argument about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already been established.</v>

858
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.713
<v Speaker 1>What causes crime?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially aggressive crime is relative </v>

859
00:45:35.971 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 1>poverty and relative poverty is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing as poverty at all.</v>

860
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It's seriously not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poverty is when you don't have enough to</v>

861
00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:44.304
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relative poverty is when the guy next </v>

862
00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:48.720
<v Speaker 1>door has a much better car than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

863
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.273
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of relative poverty in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States and there's some </v>

864
00:45:52.471 --> 00:45:53.304
<v Speaker 1>absolute poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even the absolute poverty in the </v>

865
00:45:55.351 --> 00:45:56.184
<v Speaker 1>United States is nothing like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute poverty say in places like </v>

866
00:45:58.531 --> 00:46:03.090
<v Speaker 1>India or in sub Saharan Africa where </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute poverty means you have nothing.</v>

867
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:04.643
<v Speaker 1>Now what's really interesting about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gini Coefficient is that if you go to </v>

868
00:46:09.031 --> 00:46:11.550
<v Speaker 1>places where everyone roughly speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

869
00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.370
<v Speaker 1>is poor say by national standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

870
00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:16.283
<v Speaker 1>I think South Dakota was often used as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an example or maybe one of the maritime </v>

871
00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:22.500
<v Speaker 1>provinces like Newfoundland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's,</v>

872
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.010
<v Speaker 1>where there's low average income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty flat distribution.</v>

873
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.653
<v Speaker 1>There's almost no crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you go to places where the </v>

874
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:34.560
<v Speaker 1>everyone's rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's almost no crime.</v>

875
00:46:34.561 --> 00:46:35.394
<v Speaker 1>But if you go places where there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor people and moderately well off </v>

876
00:46:39.331 --> 00:46:43.470
<v Speaker 1>people and rich people and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution is really steep,</v>

877
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.333
<v Speaker 1>then the rate of aggressive behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>among young men and it's usually within </v>

878
00:46:48.031 --> 00:46:50.060
<v Speaker 1>their own ethnic group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to spa,</v>

879
00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.870
<v Speaker 1>skyrocketed out of control.</v>

880
00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:53.183
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that seems to be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the dominance hierarchy is too steep </v>

881
00:46:57.061 --> 00:46:57.894
<v Speaker 1>than the young men have no likelihood of</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbing to a dominant position while </v>

882
00:47:02.281 --> 00:47:03.114
<v Speaker 1>playing the standard social game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what they do is turn to </v>

883
00:47:06.151 --> 00:47:07.470
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression to,</v>

884
00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:10.590
<v Speaker 1>to make their mark on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it works too.</v>

885
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:13.050
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing is that make no </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake about it.</v>

886
00:47:13.051 --> 00:47:13.884
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking for status in a place </v>

887
00:47:15.451 --> 00:47:18.060
<v Speaker 1>where status is hard to achieve and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the meanest,</v>

888
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:18.923
<v Speaker 1>toughest guy around then and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>around a bunch of people who like you </v>

889
00:47:23.041 --> 00:47:23.874
<v Speaker 1>don't have much money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to benefit from that </v>

890
00:47:25.861 --> 00:47:27.840
<v Speaker 1>status if it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

891
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Would that be a part of the reason why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I know the,</v>

892
00:47:32.931 --> 00:47:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I think the violent crime rate in the U </v>
<v Speaker 1>S is higher than it is in Canada.</v>

893
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Would that be part of the reason that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

894
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

895
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:40.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

896
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:42.880
<v Speaker 1>you can make a real conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument for making sure that,</v>

897
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:44.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conservatives are very anti income </v>

898
00:47:46.061 --> 00:47:46.894
<v Speaker 1>distribution and we figured that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the guys that have this male </v>

899
00:47:49.391 --> 00:47:50.710
<v Speaker 1>independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

900
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 1>they identify with this male </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence factor.</v>

901
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.093
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be distributing </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources to people who are down in the </v>

902
00:47:56.501 --> 00:47:57.334
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy because they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want them down in the dominance </v>

903
00:47:59.321 --> 00:48:00.154
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want there to be a difference </v>

904
00:48:01.031 --> 00:48:04.720
<v Speaker 1>between the people on talk and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the bottom so that they can be</v>

905
00:48:04.721 --> 00:48:07.990
<v Speaker 1>the people on talk so that it increases </v>
<v Speaker 1>the relative attractiveness.</v>

906
00:48:07.991 --> 00:48:08.824
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a perfectly logical game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they presume that while the rules are </v>

907
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:13.384
<v Speaker 1>set up and like every man can go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do as fast in the winner wins and the </v>

908
00:48:17.141 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 1>loser loses.</v>

909
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.633
<v Speaker 1>And that's just how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And don't ask me to fix it because I </v>

910
00:48:21.221 --> 00:48:22.380
<v Speaker 1>don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

911
00:48:22.381 --> 00:48:23.800
<v Speaker 1>and it'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>besides that it's,</v>

912
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:24.933
<v Speaker 1>I don't find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it distasteful to attempt to fix </v>

913
00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:28.600
<v Speaker 1>it more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

914
00:48:28.601 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a moral issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just an intellectual issue.</v>

915
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:34.660
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

916
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:35.643
<v Speaker 1>you can make a case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however you can make a case from the </v>

917
00:48:37.961 --> 00:48:38.794
<v Speaker 1>conservative point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to say beliefs </v>

918
00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:45.730
<v Speaker 1>and religious traditionalism and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to maintain social stability that</v>

919
00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:49.270
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't let income distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>become two unequal.</v>

920
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:50.223
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the big things your society </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to do is to make sure that that </v>

921
00:48:53.261 --> 00:48:55.810
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get out of hand because it tends</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out of hand.</v>

922
00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:56.644
<v Speaker 1>It tends towards a few people having </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and almost everyone else </v>

923
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:02.050
<v Speaker 1>having nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural in a sense,</v>

924
00:49:02.051 --> 00:49:05.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a natural consequence of economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>progression,</v>

925
00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:07.570
<v Speaker 1>which is actually something that marks </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out,</v>

926
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:11.770
<v Speaker 1>although an Italian named Burrito and </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured it out at approximately the same</v>

927
00:49:11.771 --> 00:49:12.604
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think with a lot more conceptual </v>

928
00:49:14.471 --> 00:49:15.304
<v Speaker 1>clarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more unequal you let your </v>

929
00:49:18.011 --> 00:49:21.010
<v Speaker 1>society get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the higher the probability of of death,</v>

930
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:23.260
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking through through violent</v>
<v Speaker 1>causes.</v>

931
00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:25.030
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

932
00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:29.500
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm telling you why it is that,</v>

933
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:30.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men want to climb the dominant Turk and </v>

934
00:49:32.141 --> 00:49:34.330
<v Speaker 1>the reason they want to call them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies because that's how</v>

935
00:49:34.331 --> 00:49:35.350
<v Speaker 1>they get access to women,</v>

936
00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.013
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>familiar and yet familiar and the </v>

937
00:49:44.451 --> 00:49:45.460
<v Speaker 3>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

938
00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.560
<v Speaker 3>so it seems like we all want it within </v>
<v Speaker 3>the structure,</v>

939
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.820
<v Speaker 3>but we don't want the rule to apply to </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves.</v>

940
00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:52.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

941
00:49:52.651 --> 00:49:53.484
<v Speaker 1>we have this contradictory problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to be protected by the </v>

942
00:49:55.961 --> 00:49:56.794
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we want to advance our position </v>

943
00:49:57.881 --> 00:50:01.870
<v Speaker 1>within it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means what that should mean.</v>

944
00:50:01.871 --> 00:50:02.704
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the definition of civilized </v>

945
00:50:04.721 --> 00:50:05.554
<v Speaker 1>behavior is that you're allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>advance your position within the </v>

946
00:50:08.351 --> 00:50:11.260
<v Speaker 1>structure as long as you don't disrupt </v>
<v Speaker 1>it negatively.</v>

947
00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think most people do do that.</v>

948
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.410
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people in,</v>

949
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.433
<v Speaker 1>in civilized countries do that so </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively that it's an absolutely </v>

950
00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:21.693
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand how or why it ever </v>

951
00:50:25.571 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 1>got established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a psychopath will,</v>

952
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:31.700
<v Speaker 1>he climbed the ladder and cut the rungs </v>
<v Speaker 1>off underneath them fundamentally.</v>

953
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he doesn't care.</v>

954
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:35.060
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even care if the damn thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintains itself.</v>

955
00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.473
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's perfectly willing to have it </v>

956
00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:40.480
<v Speaker 1>destroyed after he's exhausted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

957
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:41.323
<v Speaker 1>But if everyone acted like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even if a fairly substantial </v>

958
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:47.720
<v Speaker 1>percentage of people acted like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing would come to a halt.</v>

959
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Virtually like in no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

960
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.820
<v Speaker 1>so mean.</v>

961
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Why</v>
<v Speaker 1>c you might hear,</v>

962
00:50:59.001 --> 00:51:01.340
<v Speaker 1>here's the reason likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

963
00:51:01.341 --> 00:51:04.790
<v Speaker 1>cause one of the things we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about was masculine violence.</v>

964
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing about masculine violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it only tends to emerge in situations</v>

965
00:51:08.871 --> 00:51:09.704
<v Speaker 1>where there does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there don't seem to be any other </v>

966
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:16.550
<v Speaker 1>reasonably viable means of advancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>

967
00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:19.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's not reasonable to say that men </v>
<v Speaker 1>are aggressive.</v>

968
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:22.730
<v Speaker 1>You can say that on average men are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive than women.</v>

969
00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:28.130
<v Speaker 1>And you can also say that if that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put men in a situation where they</v>

970
00:51:28.131 --> 00:51:31.880
<v Speaker 1>have no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they can see status differences,</v>

971
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.940
<v Speaker 1>but they have no means of moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

972
00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:36.673
<v Speaker 1>that they're likely to turn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression as a way of establishing </v>

973
00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:40.873
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can say that that's the </v>

974
00:51:42.471 --> 00:51:44.690
<v Speaker 1>reason for that is because it makes them</v>
<v Speaker 1>more attractive.</v>

975
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.640
<v Speaker 1>What the fundamental reason</v>

976
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:52.930
<v Speaker 4>I read this article was about how a </v>
<v Speaker 4>polygamous societies are more Marlin.</v>

977
00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

978
00:51:55.950 --> 00:52:00.800
<v Speaker 4>Like when one guy has two wives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean 50% of the population.</v>

979
00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:03.130
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

980
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:04.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

981
00:52:04.761 --> 00:52:05.594
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary psychology explanation </v>

982
00:52:07.441 --> 00:52:10.980
<v Speaker 1>for the pathology of polygamy is that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you let it establish itself,</v>

983
00:52:10.981 --> 00:52:12.280
<v Speaker 1>then the men get ultraviolet.</v>

984
00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:14.170
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so would you say that</v>

985
00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:18.803
<v Speaker 1>many people have said that and yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can make a strong case for </v>

986
00:52:21.961 --> 00:52:22.794
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the fundamental reason is </v>

987
00:52:23.791 --> 00:52:25.860
<v Speaker 1>the one that you just pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

988
00:52:25.861 --> 00:52:27.720
<v Speaker 1>the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

989
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:31.440
<v Speaker 1>would you rather have one woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>or die,</v>

990
00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:35.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or sorry,</v>

991
00:52:35.131 --> 00:52:36.680
<v Speaker 1>that's not quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you rather no,</v>

992
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:39.070
<v Speaker 1>that's not quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not quite right would you,</v>

993
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:39.933
<v Speaker 1>it's more like would you be willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>limit yourself to one partner or have a </v>

994
00:52:43.921 --> 00:52:47.090
<v Speaker 1>shot at many partners but a much higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of dying.</v>

995
00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

996
00:52:49.681 --> 00:52:53.580
<v Speaker 1>some guys will take that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take the high risk approach,</v>

997
00:52:53.581 --> 00:52:54.414
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now if this doesn't eliminate the </v>

998
00:52:56.851 --> 00:52:57.684
<v Speaker 1>difference in individual differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>determining who is going to be </v>

999
00:53:00.781 --> 00:53:01.614
<v Speaker 1>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what'll happen is that as the </v>

1000
00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Gini Coefficient pressure rises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more aggressive men,</v>

1001
00:53:08.131 --> 00:53:11.850
<v Speaker 1>the men who are more aggressive by </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature will get more aggressive first.</v>

1002
00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:12.803
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could imagine there is a </v>

1003
00:53:13.351 --> 00:53:15.750
<v Speaker 1>threshold phenomenon in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1004
00:53:15.751 --> 00:53:16.584
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should tell you as well is the </v>

1005
00:53:17.851 --> 00:53:18.684
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the Gini </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coefficient and male on male homicide </v>

1006
00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:22.673
<v Speaker 1>isn't like 0.2 or 0.3 which is about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation that you'd get if you were </v>

1007
00:53:26.941 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 1>predicting something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using personality.</v>

1008
00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:33.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like 0.8 or 0.9 it's like it eats </v>
<v Speaker 1>up all of it.</v>

1009
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:37.590
<v Speaker 1>It's the explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a huge effect.</v>

1010
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:38.371
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

1011
00:53:38.371 --> 00:53:40.290
<v Speaker 1>it's so big and effected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could basically say,</v>

1012
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:41.430
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we figured that out.</v>

1013
00:53:41.431 --> 00:53:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Although psychologists never know when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they figured anything out in.</v>

1014
00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:48.420
<v Speaker 1>They keep endlessly retesting it over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over and over because you know,</v>

1015
00:53:48.421 --> 00:53:50.280
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how to bring our science </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a store,</v>

1016
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:54.330
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't accept the Gini </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coefficient aggression down,</v>

1017
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:55.164
<v Speaker 1>it's like you might as well throw the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of social sciences out the window </v>

1018
00:53:56.941 --> 00:54:01.050
<v Speaker 1>because the effect is unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

1019
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:03.620
<v Speaker 2>What you go play areas take place.</v>

1020
00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:06.860
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it at any level of analysis.</v>

1021
00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.350
<v Speaker 1>You can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it by county,</v>

1022
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:12.650
<v Speaker 1>you can do it by city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it by state and you can do it</v>

1023
00:54:12.651 --> 00:54:15.110
<v Speaker 1>by country and it works on all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

1024
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Predicted aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bet.</v>

1025
00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:19.611
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1026
00:54:19.611 --> 00:54:20.444
<v Speaker 1>and that's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the methodologically </v>

1027
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:27.430
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated studies have done exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to ensure that while to ensure that</v>

1028
00:54:27.891 --> 00:54:31.520
<v Speaker 1>it's actually this phenomena rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>other factors that might be operative in</v>

1029
00:54:31.521 --> 00:54:32.354
<v Speaker 1>that particular geographical area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So countries with a higher gr Gini </v>

1030
00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:37.183
<v Speaker 1>Coefficient or more violent and cities </v>
<v Speaker 1>within that country that have a higher </v>

1031
00:54:39.561 --> 00:54:42.950
<v Speaker 1>than average Gini Coefficient for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>country are more violent on average.</v>

1032
00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:45.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very robust,</v>

1033
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:46.880
<v Speaker 1>robust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robust finding.</v>

1034
00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:49.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1035
00:54:49.611 --> 00:54:51.850
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're good.</v>

1036
00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.753
<v Speaker 1>We're going to say for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument that you've got the male </v>

1037
00:54:56.211 --> 00:54:59.810
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy and it's represented</v>
<v Speaker 1>as masculine.</v>

1038
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.460
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you've said,</v>

1039
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:02.503
<v Speaker 1>he thought that women carried an image </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Matt men in their unconscious and </v>

1040
00:55:06.621 --> 00:55:07.454
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought that the image that women </v>

1041
00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:12.980
<v Speaker 1>carried of men in their unconscious was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of men,</v>

1042
00:55:12.981 --> 00:55:16.460
<v Speaker 1>not an individual matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called that the animus.</v>

1043
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Whereas he believed that the image that </v>
<v Speaker 1>women image of women that men carried in</v>

1044
00:55:22.251 --> 00:55:23.084
<v Speaker 1>their collective unconscious was of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single woman and he called that the </v>

1045
00:55:25.851 --> 00:55:27.230
<v Speaker 1>anima.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm just,</v>

1046
00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.093
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you that like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to justify it or even </v>

1047
00:55:31.071 --> 00:55:31.904
<v Speaker 1>discuss it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just want you to keep that in the </v>

1048
00:55:33.141 --> 00:55:34.590
<v Speaker 1>back of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1049
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:37.003
<v Speaker 1>so I guess part of the reason that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are telling me that come to think of it </v>

1050
00:55:40.791 --> 00:55:41.624
<v Speaker 1>is that I think it may provide some </v>
<v Speaker 1>insight into why the idea of the </v>

1051
00:55:45.561 --> 00:55:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchy has become such a well </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted notion.</v>

1052
00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.113
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is an architectural notion </v>

1053
00:55:52.161 --> 00:55:53.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's a one sided architectural </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion.</v>

1054
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back to sexual selection.</v>

1055
00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:57.643
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

1056
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:01.743
<v Speaker 1>we already talked about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologists perhaps were uncomfortable </v>

1057
00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:05.494
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of sexual selection </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it brings a non random factor </v>

1058
00:56:08.951 --> 00:56:10.870
<v Speaker 1>into evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1059
00:56:10.871 --> 00:56:11.704
<v Speaker 1>seriously nonrandom random factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to go back as far as </v>

1060
00:56:15.281 --> 00:56:16.114
<v Speaker 1>you can in history to where there was no</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice on the part of the organism to </v>

1061
00:56:21.701 --> 00:56:24.520
<v Speaker 1>attribute evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural selection alone.</v>

1062
00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:27.250
<v Speaker 1>And you have to go a long ways back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>

1063
00:56:27.251 --> 00:56:31.000
<v Speaker 1>even butterflies are perfectly capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of distinguishing between a high quality</v>

1064
00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:34.630
<v Speaker 1>butterfly partner in butterfly terms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the low quality butterfly partner.</v>

1065
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:38.170
<v Speaker 1>And you know that that insects have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>around for a very,</v>

1066
00:56:38.171 --> 00:56:39.004
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have no idea what that actually </v>

1067
00:56:43.301 --> 00:56:46.690
<v Speaker 1>means is that we have no idea what rule </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice has made in,</v>

1068
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:50.620
<v Speaker 1>in the evolutionary process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one thing that you can infer is that</v>

1069
00:56:50.621 --> 00:56:51.454
<v Speaker 1>the reason that human beings are the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are now and not like art chimp </v>

1070
00:56:55.060 --> 00:57:00.060
<v Speaker 1>slash human ancestor is because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual selection process got started and</v>

1071
00:57:00.881 --> 00:57:02.260
<v Speaker 1>it was intense.</v>

1072
00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:05.650
<v Speaker 1>And so as a consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here we are.</v>

1073
00:57:05.651 --> 00:57:06.161
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1074
00:57:06.161 --> 00:57:07.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's,</v>

1075
00:57:07.691 --> 00:57:11.830
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard in some sense and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people who failed and that's,</v>

1076
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:12.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking twice as many men as </v>

1077
00:57:14.591 --> 00:57:17.650
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1078
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:21.460
<v Speaker 1>so then that also raises the question </v>
<v Speaker 1>like who exactly,</v>

1079
00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:23.650
<v Speaker 1>who's responsible for the male dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>arc?</v>

1080
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Cause you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's male competitiveness,</v>

1081
00:57:25.961 --> 00:57:26.980
<v Speaker 1>but you could also say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1082
00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:29.230
<v Speaker 1>well it's an inevitable function of </v>
<v Speaker 1>female selection.</v>

1083
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:30.743
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not an argument that you hear </v>

1084
00:57:32.021 --> 00:57:32.854
<v Speaker 1>very often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's a very difficult </v>

1085
00:57:35.081 --> 00:57:37.450
<v Speaker 1>argument to escape from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that leads us to our next</v>

1086
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:40.300
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to say,</v>

1087
00:57:40.301 --> 00:57:43.360
<v Speaker 1>well the masculine dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is represented as masculine.</v>

1088
00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call that the great father </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the time being.</v>

1089
00:57:45.941 --> 00:57:49.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's the permanent dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of men.</v>

1090
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:51.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It moves through history.</v>

1091
00:57:51.341 --> 00:57:55.720
<v Speaker 1>It's different men all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like the men slot in and out as</v>

1092
00:57:55.721 --> 00:57:56.554
<v Speaker 1>they are born and die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the structure itself stays intact </v>

1093
00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:02.470
<v Speaker 1>across forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always there.</v>

1094
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:04.930
<v Speaker 1>It's been there at least for millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1095
00:58:04.931 --> 00:58:07.480
<v Speaker 1>So for our purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just call it permanent.</v>

1096
00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a permanent part of the experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a big part of it.</v>

1097
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:13.840
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as culture it gets more and more</v>

1098
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:17.103
<v Speaker 1>covers larger and larger expanses of </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory and gets more and more </v>

1099
00:58:19.391 --> 00:58:22.240
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an ever larger part of reality.</v>

1100
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:23.763
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of us spend almost all our time </v>

1101
00:58:27.341 --> 00:58:28.174
<v Speaker 1>coping with the dominance hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost none of our time combating </v>

1102
00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:33.131
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1103
00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:36.520
<v Speaker 1>you get wet and today you get wet for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little while and that's it,</v>

1104
00:58:36.521 --> 00:58:37.354
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most of the problems that you would </v>

1105
00:58:38.861 --> 00:58:39.694
<v Speaker 1>face in a purely natural environments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're so distant from them that </v>

1106
00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:44.643
<v Speaker 1>you can hardly even imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even imagine what it would be </v>

1107
00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:49.000
<v Speaker 1>like in some sense to be in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment like that.</v>

1108
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:50.463
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1109
00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:55.850
<v Speaker 3>caution is meant to be compared with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for example,</v>

1110
00:58:59.011 --> 00:59:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Jersey resonated with women and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like some,</v>

1111
00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:04.560
<v Speaker 3>some sort of competitive fitness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>women with sandy worse from,</v>

1112
00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:07.890
<v Speaker 3>so was driving</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>

1113
00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:09.013
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way I would answer that question </v>

1114
00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:12.883
<v Speaker 1>is two fold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question was what drives women </v>

1115
00:59:15.561 --> 00:59:17.870
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move to the top of the hierarchy?</v>

1116
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:21.263
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's worth discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if anybody objects to what I'm going </v>

1117
00:59:25.761 --> 00:59:26.840
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then please do.</v>

1118
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1119
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:31.040
<v Speaker 1>dishing the cell does receive truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1120
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:31.874
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to figure this out and </v>

1121
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:33.764
<v Speaker 1>this is what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is I think they're male </v>

1122
00:59:36.651 --> 00:59:38.540
<v Speaker 1>and female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dominic's archies both exist,</v>

1123
00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 1>but they're different and that females </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete with each other intensely,</v>

1124
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:44.083
<v Speaker 1>but they don't compete for the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and they don't compete the same </v>

1125
00:59:46.731 --> 00:59:51.320
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me tell you a little story.</v>

1126
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:55.280
<v Speaker 1>This is a bit of a divergence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an interesting point.</v>

1127
00:59:55.281 --> 00:59:56.091
<v Speaker 1>And one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1128
00:59:56.091 --> 00:59:58.940
<v Speaker 1>one of the questions I've always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked in this class is because I'm going</v>

1129
00:59:58.941 --> 00:59:59.774
<v Speaker 1>to lay out a hero story for you and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental hero archetype and the hero </v>

1130
01:00:03.741 --> 01:00:07.070
<v Speaker 1>is masculine in mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the women always ask,</v>

1131
01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:08.420
<v Speaker 1>well what about the role of the woman?</v>

1132
01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's like it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex,</v>

1133
01:00:10.281 --> 01:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>which of course all you women already </v>
<v Speaker 1>know because it is very,</v>

1134
01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:14.300
<v Speaker 1>very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1135
01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.790
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1136
01:00:16.791 --> 01:00:17.624
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was a question that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been asked before the </v>

1137
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>invention of the birth control pill </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we know what the table,</v>

1138
01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:27.080
<v Speaker 1>we know what the archetypal female is </v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to that.</v>

1139
01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>It's the Virgin Mary with with child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's virgin with child,</v>

1140
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:35.420
<v Speaker 1>which means like it means that the unit </v>
<v Speaker 1>for woman is woman with child.</v>

1141
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's woman with a child.</v>

1142
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:43.450
<v Speaker 1>And well that's obvious why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as you become a woman in</v>

1143
01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:47.210
<v Speaker 1>most societies you have a child before </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were a girl.</v>

1144
01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:48.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1145
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>that's in some sense that's irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1146
01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:55.010
<v Speaker 1>in terms of your destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

1147
01:00:55.011 --> 01:00:55.844
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1148
01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>what's your architectural pattern if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a mother?</v>

1149
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:01.603
<v Speaker 1>While the way it looks to me is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two archetypes for personal </v>

1150
01:01:06.771 --> 01:01:09.110
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the personal path,</v>

1151
01:01:09.111 --> 01:01:11.420
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the hero.</v>

1152
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:13.303
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>explores the unknown and discover </v>

1153
01:01:16.011 --> 01:01:19.400
<v Speaker 1>something of value and brings it back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and distributes it to the community.</v>

1154
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1155
01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.380
<v Speaker 1>it's probably predicated on a hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1156
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:25.723
<v Speaker 1>platform because we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our bodies are hunting platforms </v>

1157
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1158
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one theory about what men did,</v>

1159
01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.053
<v Speaker 1>which is a very probable theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they went out and hunted for </v>

1160
01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>meat and chimps like meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll eat it whenever they can.</v>

1161
01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:40.550
<v Speaker 1>And although they're not very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters,</v>

1162
01:01:40.551 --> 01:01:41.384
<v Speaker 1>but they will definitely eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And human beings are so good at hunting </v>

1163
01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.530
<v Speaker 1>that we probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1164
01:01:45.531 --> 01:01:47.630
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we probably wiped out the mammoth.</v>

1165
01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>And when human beings came into North </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

1166
01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:51.913
<v Speaker 1>there was as many different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>large animals in North America as there </v>

1167
01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>was an Africa and human beings killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

1168
01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.490
<v Speaker 1>And that was just with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1169
01:01:58.491 --> 01:02:03.491
<v Speaker 1>like they didn't have our notion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologically sophisticated weapons.</v>

1170
01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:07.910
<v Speaker 1>It was bows and arrows and clubs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spears and nonetheless,</v>

1171
01:02:07.911 --> 01:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>like they got rid of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1172
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:14.120
<v Speaker 1>large cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant beavers,</v>

1173
01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.730
<v Speaker 1>mammoths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1174
01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:18.471
<v Speaker 1>we're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1175
01:02:18.471 --> 01:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous.</v>

1176
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1177
01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>but then there's another archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>

1178
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's the maternal archetype </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense.</v>

1179
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:29.783
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about human males is that </v>

1180
01:02:31.741 --> 01:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>they're quite maternal by comparison to </v>
<v Speaker 1>other animals.</v>

1181
01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:36.834
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the mother bear doesn't have them </v>

1182
01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>mail there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The board,</v>

1183
01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>he said bores and sounds with bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is anyways,</v>

1184
01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:46.043
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep the cubs away from the mail </v>

1185
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>because he'll kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1186
01:02:48.811 --> 01:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>not all males will be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but many will,</v>

1187
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.290
<v Speaker 1>they don't have any filial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1188
01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.060
<v Speaker 1>attachment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the case for many,</v>

1189
01:03:00.061 --> 01:03:02.340
<v Speaker 1>but not all complex mammals.</v>

1190
01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:03.323
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pair bonding on a permanent basis is </v>

1191
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:09.900
<v Speaker 1>relatively rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but joint provision of children,</v>

1192
01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:13.403
<v Speaker 1>that's exceedingly rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And men are pretty good at taking care </v>

1193
01:03:16.021 --> 01:03:16.890
<v Speaker 1>of children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1194
01:03:16.891 --> 01:03:17.724
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say they're not as good at </v>

1195
01:03:18.301 --> 01:03:19.134
<v Speaker 1>taking care of infants as women are </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't have the full range </v>

1196
01:03:21.451 --> 01:03:26.451
<v Speaker 1>of resources at hand and they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're,</v>

1197
01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.590
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they have the same kind of</v>

1198
01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:34.070
<v Speaker 1>immediate intuitive understanding of or </v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction to babies that men have.</v>

1199
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:35.813
<v Speaker 1>I think that switches around the age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>two or two and a half when the kids can </v>

1200
01:03:39.961 --> 01:03:40.794
<v Speaker 1>engage in rough and tumble play because </v>
<v Speaker 1>men are much more likely to engage in </v>

1201
01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play with children than</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are.</v>

1202
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.453
<v Speaker 1>And rough and tumble play seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that civilizes </v>

1203
01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:52.470
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because,</v>

1204
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:54.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you have to learn</v>

1205
01:03:54.451 --> 01:03:55.284
<v Speaker 1>when you're a child is what actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurts you and what can be ignored and </v>

1206
01:03:59.341 --> 01:04:00.174
<v Speaker 1>what actually hurts someone else and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what can be ignored and the best way to </v>

1207
01:04:02.731 --> 01:04:04.260
<v Speaker 1>learn that as in rough and tumble play.</v>

1208
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing with a kid,</v>

1209
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:10.650
<v Speaker 1>they get more and more excited than they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do more and more crazy things until they</v>

1210
01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:13.230
<v Speaker 1>do something that either hurts them or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or hurts you.</v>

1211
01:04:13.231 --> 01:04:14.280
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1212
01:04:14.281 --> 01:04:15.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1213
01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.140
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1214
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:18.270
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a dance in a sense.</v>

1215
01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:19.104
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're wrestling with a little kid </v>

1216
01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:23.820
<v Speaker 1>and you have to let them win fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently because otherwise they don't,</v>

1217
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.013
<v Speaker 1>they don't continue the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell him that because if </v>

1218
01:04:26.851 --> 01:04:28.350
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the game is going well,</v>

1219
01:04:28.351 --> 01:04:29.184
<v Speaker 1>they're laughing with insane delight </v>
<v Speaker 1>because kids just love rough and tumble </v>

1220
01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:33.960
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1221
01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:35.340
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they love crazy things.</v>

1222
01:04:35.341 --> 01:04:36.174
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can throw them in the air and catch </v>

1223
01:04:36.901 --> 01:04:38.780
<v Speaker 1>them and they think that's just great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1224
01:04:38.781 --> 01:04:39.614
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but partly what you're doing is you're </v>

1225
01:04:40.561 --> 01:04:41.394
<v Speaker 1>extending their body in all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways in getting them to learn in an </v>

1226
01:04:44.641 --> 01:04:45.474
<v Speaker 1>embodied sense where the limits of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where their limits are and where the </v>

1227
01:04:48.871 --> 01:04:49.950
<v Speaker 1>limits of other people are.</v>

1228
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:52.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's embodied in children who </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't had that man.</v>

1229
01:04:52.831 --> 01:04:54.960
<v Speaker 1>They're just so awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

1230
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.183
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might have some hypothetical sense </v>

1231
01:04:57.391 --> 01:05:01.290
<v Speaker 1>of how to interact with another person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have an embodied sense of</v>

1232
01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:02.124
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can't tell the difference </v>

1233
01:05:02.971 --> 01:05:04.620
<v Speaker 1>between what hurts them and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

1234
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:06.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause often a young child,</v>

1235
01:05:06.811 --> 01:05:07.830
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're startled,</v>

1236
01:05:07.831 --> 01:05:10.050
<v Speaker 1>they'll start to cry and then you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1237
01:05:10.051 --> 01:05:10.471
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1238
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:12.030
<v Speaker 1>that didn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll notice,</v>

1239
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:13.080
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't hurt.</v>

1240
01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:13.914
<v Speaker 1>And they'll stop crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they haven't had their limits </v>

1241
01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:20.020
<v Speaker 1>tested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll cry at anything unexpected,</v>

1242
01:05:20.021 --> 01:05:20.854
<v Speaker 1>even if it doesn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not good because if you cry </v>

1243
01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.620
<v Speaker 1>under all conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you'll make friends</v>

1244
01:05:26.621 --> 01:05:27.454
<v Speaker 1>when you're three is like zero because </v>
<v Speaker 1>another kid will start playing with you </v>

1245
01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>and maybe play rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you burst into tears,</v>

1246
01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several times the person,</v>

1247
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>the kid is just going to go somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>else and find a different playmate,</v>

1248
01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say you're just a baby,</v>

1249
01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.550
<v Speaker 1>which is roughly exactly accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly.</v>

1250
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly accurate.</v>

1251
01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:48.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

1252
01:05:48.881 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm back to the architectural </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

1253
01:05:52.451 --> 01:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>I think really the way to think about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that for men,</v>

1254
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.553
<v Speaker 1>the hero archetype is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the archetype that's dominant and in </v>

1255
01:05:59.321 --> 01:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>the forefront and the maternal archetype</v>
<v Speaker 1>is his subordinate.</v>

1256
01:06:03.101 --> 01:06:05.920
<v Speaker 1>And in the background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in inside their own psyches.</v>

1257
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with women it's reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So each of the genders can play the role</v>

1258
01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:12.334
<v Speaker 1>of the other gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a tilt in each of them </v>

1259
01:06:13.691 --> 01:06:16.060
<v Speaker 1>towards the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

1260
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards gender,</v>

1261
01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I would say towards typical human gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>normative behavior.</v>

1262
01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social constructionist believed that</v>

1263
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.633
<v Speaker 1>no such thing exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those people are so pathological </v>

1264
01:06:29.561 --> 01:06:31.960
<v Speaker 1>that even considering what they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say is a mistake.</v>

1265
01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:33.243
<v Speaker 1>So they act as if people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they act as if there is no biology and </v>

1266
01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.820
<v Speaker 1>everything's cultural and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1267
01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:42.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not right now.</v>

1268
01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:46.240
<v Speaker 1>What biology means in practice and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do about it.</v>

1269
01:06:46.241 --> 01:06:49.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to think of all these differences as</v>

1270
01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:50.134
<v Speaker 1>socially height differences between men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women are not socially constructed </v>

1271
01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.753
<v Speaker 1>and they they're relevant and the upper </v>
<v Speaker 1>body strength differences between men </v>

1272
01:06:57.971 --> 01:07:00.610
<v Speaker 1>and women are not socially constructed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're relevant to,</v>

1273
01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:02.123
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I was wondering </v>

1274
01:07:03.701 --> 01:07:04.534
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you guys can help me clarify this </v>

1275
01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:06.724
<v Speaker 1>or tell me where I'm not thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this property and if you think there's </v>

1276
01:07:10.211 --> 01:07:11.710
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm missing something,</v>

1277
01:07:11.711 --> 01:07:12.544
<v Speaker 1>letting me know.</v>

1278
01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.780
<v Speaker 1>One of the things my daughter said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she watched my,</v>

1279
01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:20.470
<v Speaker 1>my son one day have a fight with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>best friend.</v>

1280
01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:21.820
<v Speaker 1>It was a physical fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1281
01:07:21.821 --> 01:07:22.654
<v Speaker 1>and so his best friend did something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that my son didn't regard it as </v>

1282
01:07:25.781 --> 01:07:29.440
<v Speaker 1>appropriate and so he hit him and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a fight and then you know,</v>

1283
01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.090
<v Speaker 1>three days later they were friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1284
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:36.220
<v Speaker 1>And my daughter said to me that she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very annoyed by that,</v>

1285
01:07:36.221 --> 01:07:37.054
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't the fight exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they could have a </v>

1286
01:07:39.551 --> 01:07:40.384
<v Speaker 1>fight and then they were friends again </v>
<v Speaker 1>three days later because she said that </v>

1287
01:07:42.281 --> 01:07:45.970
<v Speaker 1>that option wasn't available to women </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

1288
01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.150
<v Speaker 1>And the option is the option that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>men have is,</v>

1289
01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:50.043
<v Speaker 1>well if you get out of handle just Saki </v>
<v Speaker 1>one and then we'll have established </v>

1290
01:07:53.261 --> 01:07:56.980
<v Speaker 1>where the boundaries of of civilized </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior begin and end.</v>

1291
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:58.263
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm talking to someone who self </v>

1292
01:08:02.591 --> 01:08:05.710
<v Speaker 1>confident and masculine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplished,</v>

1293
01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:08.890
<v Speaker 1>there's always an undercurrent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential violence.</v>

1294
01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:12.790
<v Speaker 1>It's an undercurrent and that's actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>an undercurrent of respect,</v>

1295
01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:16.550
<v Speaker 1>which means like there's things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do to each other in a civilized way.</v>

1296
01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:19.820
<v Speaker 1>But there are rules that if you break </v>
<v Speaker 1>like all hell's gonna break loose.</v>

1297
01:08:19.821 --> 01:08:20.654
<v Speaker 1>And one of the consequences of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't right now the typical </v>

1298
01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:30.230
<v Speaker 1>bullying pattern for women in high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school and junior highs is reputation,</v>

1299
01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:34.970
<v Speaker 1>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm wondering what does,</v>

1300
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:35.833
<v Speaker 1>what are the implications for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct of behavior if there is no </v>

1301
01:08:40.311 --> 01:08:43.340
<v Speaker 1>recourse to aggression to solve disputes</v>

1302
01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.750
<v Speaker 1>cause they don't get solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1303
01:08:48.751 --> 01:08:49.584
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to analyze what it means to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say no to someone cause no means </v>

1304
01:08:52.471 --> 01:08:53.304
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1305
01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:58.310
<v Speaker 1>No means while if you tell a child know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're basically telling the child.</v>

1306
01:08:58.591 --> 01:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue doing that,</v>

1307
01:09:01.501 --> 01:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>something you don't like will happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1308
01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:05.910
<v Speaker 1>And then if you're civilized at saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1309
01:09:05.911 --> 01:09:06.744
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you say no a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times and then instead of devaluing the </v>

1310
01:09:11.491 --> 01:09:12.810
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you do,</v>

1311
01:09:12.811 --> 01:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>if you just said it over and over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred times with no consequences,</v>

1312
01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>you take action that's nonverbal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you might do is</v>

1313
01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:24.840
<v Speaker 1>remove the child from the situation or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might put them on the steps or maybe</v>

1314
01:09:24.841 --> 01:09:26.340
<v Speaker 1>you put them on the steps and they run </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

1315
01:09:26.341 --> 01:09:29.070
<v Speaker 1>So you have to hold them on the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>

1316
01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:33.810
<v Speaker 1>the point to the child is there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>limits and if you exceed them,</v>

1317
01:09:33.811 --> 01:09:34.644
<v Speaker 1>you will be physically control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if there's no option for physical </v>

1318
01:09:38.431 --> 01:09:41.190
<v Speaker 1>control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

1319
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the answer to that.</v>

1320
01:09:44.551 --> 01:09:45.384
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what women do about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also don't know what men do about </v>

1321
01:09:47.821 --> 01:09:48.654
<v Speaker 1>that in relationship to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was watching something the other </v>

1322
01:09:51.091 --> 01:09:52.920
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was this,</v>

1323
01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:58.550
<v Speaker 1>I posted it on my twitter account as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an example of animus possession.</v>

1324
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.300
<v Speaker 1>So this a woman and a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're having a dispute on the street.</v>

1325
01:10:03.301 --> 01:10:04.134
<v Speaker 1>It was a political dispute and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular woman was like the way she </v>

1326
01:10:07.231 --> 01:10:12.231
<v Speaker 1>was behaving towards this particular man</v>
<v Speaker 1>was such that had she been a man and had</v>

1327
01:10:12.751 --> 01:10:15.540
<v Speaker 1>he been a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have definitely hit her because</v>

1328
01:10:15.541 --> 01:10:16.374
<v Speaker 1>she was right in his face and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>cursing at him and swearing and calling </v>

1329
01:10:19.591 --> 01:10:22.110
<v Speaker 1>them an idiot and like really like being</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper aggressive.</v>

1330
01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Of course he couldn't do anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1331
01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:25.283
<v Speaker 1>So then I was watching that and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking just exactly what are you </v>

1332
01:10:27.511 --> 01:10:28.344
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do in a situation like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're screwed no matter what </v>

1333
01:10:31.111 --> 01:10:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

1334
01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:33.460
<v Speaker 1>If you're on the male side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can't eat,</v>

1335
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.433
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you certainly can't intervene </v>

1336
01:10:35.641 --> 01:10:36.474
<v Speaker 1>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're dead in the water </v>

1337
01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:38.003
<v Speaker 1>instant instantly in your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eyes of society and in the woman's </v>

1338
01:10:41.731 --> 01:10:44.430
<v Speaker 1>eyes instantly if you move past the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundary,</v>

1339
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:48.800
<v Speaker 1>if you leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's no glory.</v>

1340
01:10:48.801 --> 01:10:50.250
<v Speaker 1>And running away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

1341
01:10:50.251 --> 01:10:51.084
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly is supposed to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what supposed to happen </v>

1342
01:10:56.221 --> 01:10:58.860
<v Speaker 1>in a situation like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens,</v>

1343
01:10:58.861 --> 01:10:59.694
<v Speaker 1>what will happen over time is that man </v>
<v Speaker 1>just won't put themselves in those </v>

1344
01:11:01.651 --> 01:11:02.484
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what the male would have to do </v>

1345
01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:10.011
<v Speaker 1>in that situation is behave like a woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a female dominance hierarchies.</v>

1346
01:11:11.611 --> 01:11:16.611
<v Speaker 1>So he stands there and takes it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards it goes off and bad smell,</v>

1347
01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.150
<v Speaker 1>bad mouth search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social circle of uh Huh.</v>

1348
01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:23.641
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1349
01:11:23.641 --> 01:11:24.474
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely not seen as an </v>

1350
01:11:25.591 --> 01:11:30.050
<v Speaker 1>admirable form of behavior among men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

1351
01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's an admirable form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

1352
01:11:31.831 --> 01:11:32.664
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1353
01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.640
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1354
01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean aggression is often not </v>
<v Speaker 1>admirable,</v>

1355
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.990
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's fine.</v>

1356
01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:41.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you take away emotion like it,</v>

1357
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:42.773
<v Speaker 3>when someone's acting aggressively </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards you and you've reserved your </v>

1358
01:11:44.851 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 3>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gives them a lot less to feed off of.</v>

1359
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:51.900
<v Speaker 3>And that ends up taking power away in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar way that aggression does because</v>

1360
01:11:51.901 --> 01:11:56.490
<v Speaker 3>people react aggressively and they want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to feed back.</v>

1361
01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:57.810
<v Speaker 3>That gives them more.</v>

1362
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1363
01:11:59.070 --> 01:11:59.903
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it be a real victory for her if </v>

1364
01:12:00.871 --> 01:12:02.340
<v Speaker 1>she would've got slapped?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1365
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.750
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it would have,</v>

1366
01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:06.510
<v Speaker 1>it would have proved everything she said</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly.</v>

1367
01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:06.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1368
01:12:06.961 --> 01:12:07.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1369
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:09.780
<v Speaker 3>But when you dismiss power is gone.</v>

1370
01:12:09.970 --> 01:12:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have all the power.</v>

1371
01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1372
01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably effective strategy for us.</v>

1373
01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:19.960
<v Speaker 1>A street con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a street confrontation like that,</v>

1374
01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so sure how well it would work </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1375
01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:24.760
<v Speaker 1>in a prolonged competition inside a </v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

1376
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1377
01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:30.370
<v Speaker 1>The short hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1378
01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:31.060
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1379
01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth of the matter is,</v>

1380
01:12:32.621 --> 01:12:34.990
<v Speaker 1>is that men have no idea how to treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

1381
01:12:34.991 --> 01:12:38.830
<v Speaker 1>If they're in male power hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no idea how to treat them.</v>

1382
01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's because we have no idea how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

1383
01:12:41.141 --> 01:12:44.950
<v Speaker 1>No one has any idea how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only been happening in any,</v>

1384
01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounce since for about,</v>

1385
01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:50.773
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1386
01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:53.030
<v Speaker 1>on a societal level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1387
01:12:53.031 --> 01:12:54.960
<v Speaker 1>probably since the mid seventies you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1388
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:56.930
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's three generations,</v>

1389
01:12:56.931 --> 01:12:59.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a drop in the bucket and it's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1390
01:12:59.301 --> 01:13:01.880
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to sort out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1391
01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:03.523
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that I'm thinking </v>

1392
01:13:04.071 --> 01:13:04.904
<v Speaker 1>about these sorts of things is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been very interested in the fact </v>

1393
01:13:08.031 --> 01:13:08.864
<v Speaker 1>that male men are doing very badly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>junior high and high school and they're </v>

1394
01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.340
<v Speaker 1>bailing out of the universities like </v>
<v Speaker 1>math.</v>

1395
01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:14.443
<v Speaker 1>Like at the rate it's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be almost no men in most </v>

1396
01:13:16.521 --> 01:13:18.830
<v Speaker 1>disciplines within 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

1397
01:13:18.831 --> 01:13:21.230
<v Speaker 1>you can tell that even in this class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1398
01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:23.960
<v Speaker 1>although it's funny because on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos,</v>

1399
01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I w I look at the gender distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>for viewing and it's 80% male,</v>

1400
01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.320
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1401
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:30.400
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1402
01:13:30.401 --> 01:13:32.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure exactly why that is,</v>

1403
01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.350
<v Speaker 1>but in lots of fields it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 80 20 women already.</v>

1404
01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.620
<v Speaker 1>And so I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see why that won't.</v>

1405
01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:42.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it will accelerate as we move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward rather than slowing down.</v>

1406
01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:44.990
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1407
01:13:44.991 --> 01:13:49.370
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to sexual selection and,</v>

1408
01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:53.180
<v Speaker 1>and the power hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1409
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.903
<v Speaker 1>from a Darwinian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you might do is </v>

1410
01:13:59.761 --> 01:14:01.530
<v Speaker 1>call whatever's selects nature.</v>

1411
01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:04.953
<v Speaker 1>And so when we think of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you think about nature from a </v>

1412
01:14:07.781 --> 01:14:11.080
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't ever think about humans as,</v>

1413
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:13.390
<v Speaker 1>as agents of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1414
01:14:13.391 --> 01:14:17.140
<v Speaker 1>We tend to conceive of the human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>as something that stands against nature,</v>

1415
01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:18.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a mythology.</v>

1416
01:14:18.701 --> 01:14:21.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like the human being against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural world.</v>

1417
01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:21.874
<v Speaker 1>It's a very common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very common plot in movies and in </v>

1418
01:14:24.311 --> 01:14:27.040
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's man against nature,</v>

1419
01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:32.041
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we tend to think of those as separate</v>

1420
01:14:32.561 --> 01:14:33.460
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1421
01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>if women do the selection among human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

1422
01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:45.420
<v Speaker 1>at least they do the intense selection </v>
<v Speaker 1>than women are nature for men.</v>

1423
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:48.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what the archetype </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1424
01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.473
<v Speaker 1>It's mother nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Mother Nature has a very vicious </v>

1425
01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:55.960
<v Speaker 1>element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the vicious element of Mother Nature</v>

1426
01:14:55.961 --> 01:14:59.020
<v Speaker 1>is rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can be maternal rejection,</v>

1427
01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:00.100
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1428
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:02.860
<v Speaker 1>certainly something that causes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of trauma.</v>

1429
01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:04.330
<v Speaker 1>But it can also be</v>

1430
01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.090
<v Speaker 1>the more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most fundamental form of rejection,</v>

1431
01:15:09.091 --> 01:15:09.924
<v Speaker 1>which is which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the most fundamental form of </v>

1432
01:15:11.731 --> 01:15:14.840
<v Speaker 1>rejection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sexual rejection because it,</v>

1433
01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:20.150
<v Speaker 1>it means that you are judged as </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically I'm worthy,</v>

1434
01:15:20.161 --> 01:15:24.570
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's other reasons why.</v>

1435
01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:25.780
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1436
01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you this because I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to puzzle out what you see in </v>

1437
01:15:29.671 --> 01:15:30.504
<v Speaker 1>mythology quite clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the dominance hierarchy is </v>

1438
01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:36.450
<v Speaker 1>represented as male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So culture is male and nature is female.</v>

1439
01:15:36.451 --> 01:15:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the hell would nature be female?</v>

1440
01:15:38.281 --> 01:15:38.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1441
01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:42.240
<v Speaker 1>well I've given you one reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's the primary reason.</v>

1442
01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:43.433
<v Speaker 1>There's other reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because nature is also seen as that </v>

1443
01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:48.930
<v Speaker 1>which produces natural forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1444
01:15:48.931 --> 01:15:51.270
<v Speaker 1>women produce natural forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1445
01:15:51.330 --> 01:15:54.780
<v Speaker 1>that's a logical association.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

1446
01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.330
<v Speaker 2>what's the other one that was about,</v>

1447
01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.153
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can leave it at that for the time </v>

1448
01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:07.624
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now let me show you how I think that </v>

1449
01:16:11.261 --> 01:16:12.190
<v Speaker 1>that's represented.</v>

1450
01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:24.063
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the way the world is </v>

1451
01:16:26.321 --> 01:16:28.840
<v Speaker 1>structured when you consider it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place of action.</v>

1452
01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:34.300
<v Speaker 1>So the world has a place of action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has characters not like the elements are</v>

1453
01:16:34.301 --> 01:16:36.500
<v Speaker 1>characters and the characters are </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged in,</v>

1454
01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:40.330
<v Speaker 1>in dramatic behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1455
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:45.280
<v Speaker 1>and there are classes of characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>

1456
01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.840
<v Speaker 1>this is a reasonably comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>classification of dramatic characters.</v>

1457
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.540
<v Speaker 1>And we'll start from the inside and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1458
01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:56.740
<v Speaker 1>And you can think of any of these as </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary by the way.</v>

1459
01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.470
<v Speaker 1>And you'll see that reflected in </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of mythology.</v>

1460
01:16:59.471 --> 01:17:00.304
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes the maternal is primary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the culture is primary and </v>

1461
01:17:03.791 --> 01:17:06.670
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual's primary.</v>

1462
01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:07.953
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because these three </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are irreducibly primary in that </v>

1463
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:15.230
<v Speaker 1>from uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of consciousness.</v>

1464
01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:18.140
<v Speaker 1>In that to be conscious there has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1465
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.233
<v Speaker 1>But if you're conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have evolved within a </v>

1466
01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:25.460
<v Speaker 1>culture and that culture is necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>nested in the natural world.</v>

1467
01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:29.090
<v Speaker 1>And so wherever there's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all three.</v>

1468
01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:33.140
<v Speaker 1>And the individual is also the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without the individual,</v>

1469
01:17:33.141 --> 01:17:35.570
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be any separation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature and culture.</v>

1470
01:17:35.571 --> 01:17:36.404
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual consciousness is the </v>

1471
01:17:38.241 --> 01:17:39.074
<v Speaker 1>generator of the entire structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can say that about any of the </v>

1472
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:42.614
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the architectural son cause </v>

1473
01:17:45.711 --> 01:17:49.130
<v Speaker 1>the hero tends to be masculine and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a,</v>

1474
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:53.390
<v Speaker 1>that character has a positive element </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a negative element.</v>

1475
01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:57.200
<v Speaker 1>And the positive element is the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good person.</v>

1476
01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.940
<v Speaker 1>And the negative element is the bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1477
01:17:59.510 --> 01:18:00.343
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the architectural </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of those are like the </v>

1478
01:18:04.161 --> 01:18:07.610
<v Speaker 1>savior and Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically,</v>

1479
01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:08.563
<v Speaker 1>there are portrayals like that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually every system of mythology and </v>

1480
01:18:12.531 --> 01:18:13.364
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems to me that in some sense </v>

1481
01:18:15.561 --> 01:18:16.394
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was probably under the </v>

1482
01:18:17.631 --> 01:18:18.464
<v Speaker 1>influence of the zero astrons develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most articulated representation of </v>

1483
01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:27.590
<v Speaker 1>good versus evil at the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

1484
01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.513
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you can identify two </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental characters in the Christian </v>

1485
01:18:34.751 --> 01:18:35.710
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1486
01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:36.544
<v Speaker 1>that play out these rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're seen as eternally </v>

1487
01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:40.750
<v Speaker 1>adversaries locked in battle across </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1488
01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:42.393
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the battle it takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in the natural world about what </v>

1489
01:18:45.001 --> 01:18:45.834
<v Speaker 1>takes place in the cultural world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the battle takes place within as </v>

1490
01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:49.024
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1491
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1492
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:51.163
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see that reflected in </v>

1493
01:18:51.711 --> 01:18:54.190
<v Speaker 1>stories all the time because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's so,</v>

1494
01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.470
<v Speaker 1>it's so frequently the case that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1495
01:18:57.471 --> 01:19:00.500
<v Speaker 1>the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the superhero has his nemesis,</v>

1496
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:01.363
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the guy that he's </v>

1497
01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:02.624
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily well matched with who </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually tests his wits and whose </v>

1498
01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:07.933
<v Speaker 1>motivation is essentially destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you see that with Batman and the </v>

1499
01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:11.654
<v Speaker 1>joker for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you see it with Sherlock Holmes and </v>

1500
01:19:13.851 --> 01:19:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Moriarty or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's always,</v>

1501
01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:19.160
<v Speaker 1>there's always this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pairing is pairing.</v>

1502
01:19:19.161 --> 01:19:19.994
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because I think there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the archetipal realms of human </v>

1503
01:19:23.811 --> 01:19:27.830
<v Speaker 1>decision making or something like are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you working to make things better or are</v>

1504
01:19:27.831 --> 01:19:28.664
<v Speaker 1>you working to make things worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you possessed by resentment and </v>

1505
01:19:30.801 --> 01:19:33.770
<v Speaker 1>hatred so that you want things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerate and burn?</v>

1506
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Or are you hopeful and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1507
01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:37.873
<v Speaker 1>and capable of manifesting faith in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future so that you're working to make </v>

1508
01:19:40.971 --> 01:19:44.000
<v Speaker 1>things better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a battle in everyone,</v>

1509
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:47.330
<v Speaker 1>in their own psyches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a battle in culture.</v>

1510
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.210
<v Speaker 1>There's a battle every year between </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two fundamental perspectives.</v>

1511
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:52.243
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the archetipal son is the son of the </v>

1512
01:19:55.371 --> 01:19:58.190
<v Speaker 1>great farther in the great father </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents two things.</v>

1513
01:19:58.191 --> 01:19:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interior,</v>

1514
01:19:58.990 --> 01:19:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Neri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny.</v>

1515
01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.930
<v Speaker 1>So there's the hero in the adversary at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual level.</v>

1516
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1517
01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.080
<v Speaker 1>And at the social level there's order </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tyranny.</v>

1518
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:10.210
<v Speaker 1>And so roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>

1519
01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.610
<v Speaker 1>See that the wise king or the Desk Bach </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the desk bod is someone who tries to</v>

1520
01:20:14.611 --> 01:20:15.444
<v Speaker 1>eat his own sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a fairly common </v>

1521
01:20:17.101 --> 01:20:19.230
<v Speaker 1>mythological trope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1522
01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:24.231
<v Speaker 1>you're under the thumb of a desperate </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're not allowed really either to</v>

1523
01:20:24.451 --> 01:20:25.284
<v Speaker 1>be hero or adversary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just a cog in the structure of </v>

1524
01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:32.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the social world.</v>

1525
01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:37.020
<v Speaker 1>So that's despotism on the orderly side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1526
01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.630
<v Speaker 1>culture is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're sitting in right now.</v>

1527
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is social order that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>encapsulates us.</v>

1528
01:20:43.501 --> 01:20:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Everything about it is social order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>

1529
01:20:45.621 --> 01:20:49.230
<v Speaker 1>there are rows there roughly linear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1530
01:20:49.231 --> 01:20:50.064
<v Speaker 1>everyone's in their place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows exactly what to do were </v>

1531
01:20:52.141 --> 01:20:54.750
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably well protected from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1532
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:57.510
<v Speaker 1>from virtually anything you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly imagine.</v>

1533
01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.880
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1534
01:20:59.881 --> 01:21:03.330
<v Speaker 1>we're in our father's living room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

1535
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:07.170
<v Speaker 1>And in that living room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a safe space.</v>

1536
01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should've never said that.</v>

1537
01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.133
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a well protected space in which </v>

1538
01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:14.244
<v Speaker 1>people are able to play and explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that one of the </v>

1539
01:21:19.231 --> 01:21:23.130
<v Speaker 1>functions that fathers play in a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're playing,</v>

1540
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.083
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're fulfilling their function </v>

1541
01:21:25.501 --> 01:21:26.334
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what they do is put a perimeter </v>

1542
01:21:27.931 --> 01:21:30.770
<v Speaker 1>around the territory so that inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall,</v>

1543
01:21:30.771 --> 01:21:32.130
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's safe.</v>

1544
01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.233
<v Speaker 1>And inside the safe walls the children </v>
<v Speaker 1>can play and explore and in their </v>

1545
01:21:36.241 --> 01:21:38.910
<v Speaker 1>playing and exploring and they developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own individuality.</v>

1546
01:21:39.450 --> 01:21:42.270
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep the darkness at bay and you can</v>

1547
01:21:42.271 --> 01:21:43.104
<v Speaker 1>certainly see that that's what children </v>
<v Speaker 1>want because as soon as you put them in </v>

1548
01:21:45.421 --> 01:21:47.640
<v Speaker 1>a dark room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they say is,</v>

1549
01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:48.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come chase the monsters away out from </v>

1550
01:21:51.121 --> 01:21:51.960
<v Speaker 1>underneath the bed.</v>

1551
01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:53.213
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be thinking that if they </v>

1552
01:21:54.841 --> 01:21:55.674
<v Speaker 1>hadn't had an extraordinary long </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history of being chased by </v>

1553
01:21:59.761 --> 01:22:02.220
<v Speaker 1>monsters in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1554
01:22:02.490 --> 01:22:05.610
<v Speaker 1>and there are monsters in the dark and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows that,</v>

1555
01:22:05.611 --> 01:22:08.850
<v Speaker 1>which is why you tell your children not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go play at night after you know,</v>

1556
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.090
<v Speaker 1>after it's dark even now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1557
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:17.220
<v Speaker 1>so order and tyranny are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the representations of culture.</v>

1558
01:22:17.221 --> 01:22:18.054
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a constant interplay </v>

1559
01:22:20.191 --> 01:22:25.191
<v Speaker 1>between those two because you can never </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell exactly when order has gone too far</v>

1560
01:22:25.201 --> 01:22:27.540
<v Speaker 1>and become tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1561
01:22:27.541 --> 01:22:29.220
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can never tell really when,</v>

1562
01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:33.030
<v Speaker 1>when there's so little order that while </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next thing happens,</v>

1563
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:33.864
<v Speaker 1>which is the emergence of chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos is the great mother and it's </v>

1564
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:42.780
<v Speaker 1>creative and destructive and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature itself.</v>

1565
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:45.780
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then on outside,</v>

1566
01:22:45.781 --> 01:22:46.614
<v Speaker 1>the very outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the most complicated </v>

1567
01:22:47.761 --> 01:22:51.390
<v Speaker 1>category of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's the dragon of chaos.</v>

1568
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:54.630
<v Speaker 1>And it represents something that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to conceptualize,</v>

1569
01:22:54.631 --> 01:22:55.464
<v Speaker 1>but it's the UN configured substructure </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being that gives rise to these other </v>

1570
01:23:02.341 --> 01:23:03.174
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Donald Rumsfeld at point made a very </v>

1571
01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:06.970
<v Speaker 1>famous comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It become,</v>

1572
01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:09.210
<v Speaker 1>it became famous because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>

1573
01:23:09.211 --> 01:23:10.990
<v Speaker 1>it fits in architectural structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1574
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 1>there are known unknowns and unknown </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknowns.</v>

1575
01:23:14.770 --> 01:23:15.603
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dragon of chaos is the unknown </v>

1576
01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.270
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1577
01:23:19.450 --> 01:23:21.790
<v Speaker 1>it's so unknown that you don't even know</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there,</v>

1578
01:23:21.791 --> 01:23:24.400
<v Speaker 1>but it can write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise its head at any given point.</v>

1579
01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:28.060
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that leaps out of you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the darkness.</v>

1580
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:29.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it Zika?</v>

1581
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Is that the new virus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Zika virus.</v>

1582
01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:33.424
<v Speaker 1>It's like no one saw it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely new manifestation of </v>

1583
01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:37.533
<v Speaker 1>of being and so known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unknown's you can make plans to </v>

1584
01:23:41.291 --> 01:23:42.124
<v Speaker 1>circumvent unknown unknown's they </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're completely unpredictable and </v>

1585
01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:49.210
<v Speaker 1>what's so interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it's so bloody complicated</v>

1586
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:50.103
<v Speaker 1>because you really have to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things differently to grasp what this </v>

1587
01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:54.094
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

1588
01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:00.423
<v Speaker 1>This is part of the reason that I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble with the section of this course </v>

1589
01:24:02.561 --> 01:24:05.260
<v Speaker 1>on alchemy because it's so complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's okay.</v>

1590
01:24:05.261 --> 01:24:07.540
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of it this way.</v>

1591
01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:13.690
<v Speaker 1>What is the unknown made up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty weird question.</v>

1592
01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:15.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll,</v>

1593
01:24:15.621 --> 01:24:16.454
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to walk you through it and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't get very far with this because </v>

1594
01:24:18.551 --> 01:24:19.384
<v Speaker 1>we'll have to do it 15 or 20 times I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think before it starts to become </v>

1595
01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.580
<v Speaker 1>something that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can grapple with.</v>

1596
01:24:25.230 --> 01:24:28.780
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's September 11th,</v>

1597
01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:30.310
<v Speaker 1>2011 in the twin towers have just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen.</v>

1598
01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2001 yes,</v>

1599
01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:35.140
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nine 11 alright.</v>

1600
01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:39.280
<v Speaker 1>What's emerged?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happened?</v>

1601
01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:41.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one answer to that is that the tower is </v>

1602
01:24:42.341 --> 01:24:44.530
<v Speaker 1>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's in very,</v>

1603
01:24:44.531 --> 01:24:49.531
<v Speaker 1>very poor answer because that was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown unknown,</v>

1604
01:24:50.110 --> 01:24:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it traumatize people.</v>

1605
01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:54.123
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone even in Toronto walked around </v>

1606
01:24:55.121 --> 01:24:56.770
<v Speaker 1>in shock for about two days after that.</v>

1607
01:24:56.770 --> 01:24:57.603
<v Speaker 1>And the reason was for that was that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know what felt the buildings </v>

1608
01:25:01.571 --> 01:25:02.404
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is the buildings aren't </v>

1609
01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.280
<v Speaker 1>isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not some abandoned building</v>

1610
01:25:07.281 --> 01:25:08.114
<v Speaker 1>standing out there in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>field in a barren wasteland in the </v>

1611
01:25:11.081 --> 01:25:14.260
<v Speaker 1>middle of an abandoned country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't buildings.</v>

1612
01:25:14.261 --> 01:25:15.094
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're only buildings at the most </v>

1613
01:25:16.241 --> 01:25:18.070
<v Speaker 1>superficial level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1614
01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:21.370
<v Speaker 1>they had 5,000 people in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 5,000 people died.</v>

1615
01:25:21.371 --> 01:25:22.204
<v Speaker 1>If I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of those people were </v>

1616
01:25:26.201 --> 01:25:27.034
<v Speaker 1>networked out with all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and they were networked at </v>

1617
01:25:29.531 --> 01:25:31.450
<v Speaker 1>multiple levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were family members,</v>

1618
01:25:31.451 --> 01:25:35.530
<v Speaker 1>but they were also elements in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial and economic machine.</v>

1619
01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.640
<v Speaker 1>And then and in the political machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what,</v>

1620
01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.740
<v Speaker 1>what was hit was of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the buildings,</v>

1621
01:25:44.741 --> 01:25:48.190
<v Speaker 1>but the economic and political system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>

1622
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:49.263
<v Speaker 1>And of course the people who took the </v>
<v Speaker 1>towers down weren't trying to knock </v>

1623
01:25:53.111 --> 01:25:55.690
<v Speaker 1>buildings down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you saw happening.</v>

1624
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.823
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to knock down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things the buildings were invisibly </v>

1625
01:25:59.681 --> 01:26:01.900
<v Speaker 1>related to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might ask,</v>

1626
01:26:01.901 --> 01:26:04.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were those buildings related to?</v>

1627
01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's a simpler question to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse the question and say,</v>

1628
01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:09.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what weren't they related to?</v>

1629
01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:13.400
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatized in the aftermath was because</v>

1630
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:14.503
<v Speaker 1>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when our bodies in some sense answered </v>

1631
01:26:17.211 --> 01:26:19.730
<v Speaker 1>that question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer was,</v>

1632
01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:20.983
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those buildings were probably attached </v>

1633
01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:23.744
<v Speaker 1>to everything in every possible way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so God only knows what's going to </v>

1634
01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:31.130
<v Speaker 1>come leaping out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

1635
01:26:31.131 --> 01:26:34.730
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you see the buildings </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall?</v>

1636
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:39.530
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you see the buildings fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually blinds you to what's happening.</v>

1637
01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:43.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like as a very peripheral </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the actual event,</v>

1638
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:44.930
<v Speaker 1>because you could also say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1639
01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:47.150
<v Speaker 1>it was a psychological event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1640
01:26:47.151 --> 01:26:48.980
<v Speaker 1>it echoed inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1641
01:26:48.981 --> 01:26:49.850
<v Speaker 1>you don't see that.</v>

1642
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:51.860
<v Speaker 1>You feel it and you don't really know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means,</v>

1643
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.903
<v Speaker 1>but it puts a wave of uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a radical wave of uncertainty into </v>

1644
01:26:56.121 --> 01:26:57.740
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1645
01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.220
<v Speaker 1>And not only the present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the future for sure.</v>

1646
01:27:01.221 --> 01:27:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Because things took a vicious turn after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and almost immediately,</v>

1647
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:05.743
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole political system readjusted </v>

1648
01:27:06.771 --> 01:27:09.080
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became much more authoritarian.</v>

1649
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:10.723
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>airports became like little fascist in </v>

1650
01:27:12.321 --> 01:27:13.970
<v Speaker 1>enclaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was for me,</v>

1651
01:27:13.971 --> 01:27:16.580
<v Speaker 1>it went for many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could hardly go into an airport.</v>

1652
01:27:16.581 --> 01:27:20.990
<v Speaker 1>It just drove me crazy to be lined up </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and then subject to search by,</v>

1653
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:22.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faceless.</v>

1654
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:25.783
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are faceless representations of </v>

1655
01:27:28.161 --> 01:27:30.290
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the paranoid state.</v>

1656
01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.153
<v Speaker 1>It's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a horrible thing to have to </v>

1657
01:27:32.901 --> 01:27:33.734
<v Speaker 1>encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bloody horrible thing to train </v>

1658
01:27:34.881 --> 01:27:38.480
<v Speaker 1>people to get accustomed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really dangerous to train people to</v>

1659
01:27:38.481 --> 01:27:41.540
<v Speaker 1>accept that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a way worse consequence.</v>

1660
01:27:41.541 --> 01:27:42.374
<v Speaker 1>I think that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the buildings falling down on </v>

1661
01:27:43.731 --> 01:27:44.780
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1662
01:27:44.781 --> 01:27:47.600
<v Speaker 1>so that was one thing that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else happened?</v>

1663
01:27:47.601 --> 01:27:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 4 trillion,</v>

1664
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.863
<v Speaker 1>the $1 trillion surplus that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>projected by the Clintons at the end of </v>

1665
01:27:55.641 --> 01:27:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Bill Clinton's presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the,</v>

1666
01:27:58.490 --> 01:27:59.323
<v Speaker 1>the prediction for the next 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the economy was moving along so </v>

1667
01:28:02.541 --> 01:28:06.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the US government was going to have</v>

1668
01:28:06.021 --> 01:28:08.720
<v Speaker 1>a $1 trillion surplus over the next 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1669
01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:13.900
<v Speaker 1>turned into a $4 trillion deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that happened while,</v>

1670
01:28:14.991 --> 01:28:17.330
<v Speaker 1>and then we got tangled up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even worse in the Middle East.</v>

1671
01:28:17.331 --> 01:28:18.164
<v Speaker 1>And of course that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think is probably got worse as </v>

1672
01:28:21.951 --> 01:28:23.390
<v Speaker 1>time's gone on rather than better.</v>

1673
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:25.550
<v Speaker 1>And we have no idea where that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to end.</v>

1674
01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:26.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1675
01:28:26.721 --> 01:28:27.554
<v Speaker 1>Russia is involved now and Russia </v>
<v Speaker 1>rattled nuclear weapons at Turkey the </v>

1676
01:28:30.411 --> 01:28:31.640
<v Speaker 1>other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1677
01:28:31.641 --> 01:28:32.474
<v Speaker 1>even though Turkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their largest trading partner and a </v>

1678
01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:35.990
<v Speaker 1>member of NATO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1679
01:28:35.991 --> 01:28:36.824
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a million refugees flooded into Europe </v>

1680
01:28:39.261 --> 01:28:41.900
<v Speaker 1>and God only knows what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen as a consequence of that.</v>

1681
01:28:41.901 --> 01:28:45.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not like the people who planted</v>

1682
01:28:45.171 --> 01:28:47.840
<v Speaker 1>the bomb didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like here's what they thought.</v>

1683
01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:50.420
<v Speaker 1>They thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1684
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:51.643
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the second greatest power on </v>

1685
01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:53.894
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they waited into Afghanistan </v>

1686
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:58.340
<v Speaker 1>and they got tangled up in a terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 1>war and how poof,</v>

1687
01:28:58.341 --> 01:28:59.174
<v Speaker 1>10 years later they didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe could do the same thing </v>

1688
01:29:01.921 --> 01:29:03.960
<v Speaker 1>to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1689
01:29:03.961 --> 01:29:07.560
<v Speaker 1>well who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could.</v>

1690
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean they certainly read their </v>
<v Speaker 1>response to the nine 11 disaster was a,</v>

1691
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.863
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more expensive than the disaster </v>

1692
01:29:16.711 --> 01:29:17.544
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

1693
01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:18.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's quite </v>

1694
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:21.263
<v Speaker 1>horrifying is that here's one statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody flew in the aftermath of nine 11 </v>

1695
01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:27.593
<v Speaker 1>for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like airplane flight bookings were way </v>

1696
01:29:30.311 --> 01:29:31.144
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More people died in car accidents </v>

1697
01:29:33.661 --> 01:29:36.330
<v Speaker 1>because of not flying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then were killed in the bombings.</v>

1698
01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:37.953
<v Speaker 1>And no one ever noticed that cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are being killed on the highway </v>

1699
01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.441
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1700
01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:43.050
<v Speaker 1>So it's like it's background noise as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as we're concerned.</v>

1701
01:29:43.051 --> 01:29:44.250
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1702
01:29:44.251 --> 01:29:48.360
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good example of how not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only do you know what the event,</v>

1703
01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:49.253
<v Speaker 1>not know what the event is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even tell who the event </v>

1704
01:29:51.301 --> 01:29:52.134
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's your apprehension of that </v>

1705
01:29:56.340 --> 01:30:00.420
<v Speaker 1>when it occurs that paralyzes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the dragon of chaos,</v>

1706
01:30:00.421 --> 01:30:02.490
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an unknown unknown.</v>

1707
01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:03.773
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the multiple levels of reality </v>

1708
01:30:07.351 --> 01:30:08.184
<v Speaker 1>that exists around you are all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden altered in an incomprehensible </v>

1709
01:30:12.061 --> 01:30:12.894
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

1710
01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:14.250
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1711
01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:18.360
<v Speaker 1>what happened was the alteration of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

1712
01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.673
<v Speaker 1>that is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that you can only perceive it </v>

1713
01:30:22.111 --> 01:30:26.340
<v Speaker 1>essentially as the explosion in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>building and the consequent collapse.</v>

1714
01:30:26.341 --> 01:30:28.230
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the nine,</v>

1715
01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trick twin towers were brought down.</v>

1716
01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:34.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's such a low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of what happened,</v>

1717
01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:39.630
<v Speaker 1>that it barely begins to describe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>

1718
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.800
<v Speaker 1>And so it's that invisible background of</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex interrelationships,</v>

1719
01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:46.674
<v Speaker 1>like a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex melody that's always going </v>

1720
01:30:48.781 --> 01:30:50.850
<v Speaker 1>on around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as long as it works,</v>

1721
01:30:50.851 --> 01:30:51.684
<v Speaker 1>you don't even notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is it manifests itself as </v>

1722
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:59.000
<v Speaker 1>predictable and desirable order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can understand,</v>

1723
01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:01.290
<v Speaker 1>which is the reason we have predictable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and desirable.</v>

1724
01:31:01.291 --> 01:31:02.124
<v Speaker 1>Our order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This room is configured so that you can </v>

1725
01:31:04.261 --> 01:31:05.094
<v Speaker 1>walk into it without being afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that it's a </v>

1726
01:31:08.101 --> 01:31:10.680
<v Speaker 1>radically simplified version of reality.</v>

1727
01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:12.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see that.</v>

1728
01:31:12.511 --> 01:31:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even got padded walls,</v>

1729
01:31:14.401 --> 01:31:17.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's to stop the sound bouncing so</v>

1730
01:31:17.191 --> 01:31:18.520
<v Speaker 1>that it won't annoy you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1731
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's warm,</v>

1732
01:31:20.101 --> 01:31:21.420
<v Speaker 1>it's comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1733
01:31:21.421 --> 01:31:24.060
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it fades into the background.</v>

1734
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Everyone here is civilized beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

1735
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:27.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1736
01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:30.780
<v Speaker 1>you hear about the radical individualism</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the west.</v>

1737
01:31:30.781 --> 01:31:31.614
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the nonsense I've ever heard </v>

1738
01:31:33.091 --> 01:31:36.130
<v Speaker 1>that's gotta to be the most nonsensical </v>
<v Speaker 1>were so bloody obedient that it's,</v>

1739
01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:37.123
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Edmonton at three o'clock </v>

1740
01:31:40.201 --> 01:31:41.034
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and watch pedestrians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will stop at the don't walk light </v>

1741
01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:49.580
<v Speaker 1>and wait until it turns green.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the roads are wide and so they,</v>

1742
01:31:49.591 --> 01:31:51.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still the case.</v>

1743
01:31:51.031 --> 01:31:52.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

1744
01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.380
<v Speaker 1>How's it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's you think you're an individual?</v>

1745
01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm not complaining about it.</v>

1746
01:31:57.660 --> 01:31:58.493
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an amazing thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know we can really zip cars to our </v>

1747
01:32:00.671 --> 01:32:01.504
<v Speaker 1>cities because people don't run out into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the streets and get </v>

1748
01:32:04.181 --> 01:32:05.014
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stay where they're supposed to and </v>

1749
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.053
<v Speaker 1>so it's incredibly efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're so being well behaved that </v>

1750
01:32:10.511 --> 01:32:12.840
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beyond you.</v>

1751
01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:15.940
<v Speaker 1>If you think about us as chimpanzees </v>
<v Speaker 1>with clothes,</v>

1752
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:17.103
<v Speaker 1>you know we're doing pretty damn well </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we set up our environment so that </v>

1753
01:32:20.261 --> 01:32:21.094
<v Speaker 1>they're so simplified that we never have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to encounter this multi dimensional </v>

1754
01:32:25.630 --> 01:32:29.920
<v Speaker 1>layered reality of patterns that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving around,</v>

1755
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:34.240
<v Speaker 1>moving around us all the time and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually makes up reality.</v>

1756
01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 1>That's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

1757
01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:36.993
<v Speaker 1>that's what the world is made out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a way different way of thinking </v>

1758
01:32:39.611 --> 01:32:41.470
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then to think about the world is made up</v>

1759
01:32:41.471 --> 01:32:43.690
<v Speaker 1>say of Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think that way,</v>

1760
01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:44.620
<v Speaker 1>you just think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1761
01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.410
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like marbles in space,</v>

1762
01:32:47.411 --> 01:32:48.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1763
01:32:48.970 --> 01:32:49.803
<v Speaker 1>and of course Adam's ours marbles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows that and god only knows </v>

1764
01:32:53.231 --> 01:32:53.740
<v Speaker 1>what they are.</v>

1765
01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:57.280
<v Speaker 1>But that's still the image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the metaphor of reality.</v>

1766
01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:02.700
<v Speaker 1>But that's not what reality is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an insanely pattern orchestra of,</v>

1767
01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:07.360
<v Speaker 1>of phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what it is.</v>

1768
01:33:07.361 --> 01:33:08.194
<v Speaker 1>And then if what happens is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this little orderly sub compartment </v>

1769
01:33:12.041 --> 01:33:14.200
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're in a box and the box is</v>

1770
01:33:14.201 --> 01:33:15.650
<v Speaker 1>inside a box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well let's think about it.</v>

1771
01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:17.530
<v Speaker 1>You're in a box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1772
01:33:17.710 --> 01:33:19.780
<v Speaker 1>this box is in the building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a box.</v>

1773
01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:22.600
<v Speaker 1>The building is in the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a box.</v>

1774
01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:24.790
<v Speaker 1>The universities in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a box.</v>

1775
01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:26.800
<v Speaker 1>The city is in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the province.</v>

1776
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:27.783
<v Speaker 1>That's a box that it's in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's covered by the American </v>

1777
01:33:31.031 --> 01:33:32.260
<v Speaker 1>nuclear umbrella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1778
01:33:32.261 --> 01:33:33.094
<v Speaker 1>And then it's embedded in this immense </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of individual rights and </v>

1779
01:33:36.341 --> 01:33:37.174
<v Speaker 1>freedoms that have manifested themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of the political and economic </v>

1780
01:33:40.151 --> 01:33:40.984
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of that's going on around you </v>

1781
01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:48.370
<v Speaker 1>and people are working like mad crazily </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep all of those boxes intact.</v>

1782
01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:52.930
<v Speaker 1>And here you are sitting and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what you see around you is reality.</v>

1783
01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:54.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1784
01:33:54.131 --> 01:33:54.964
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a lot of people making that </v>

1785
01:33:57.401 --> 01:34:00.550
<v Speaker 1>this reality so simple that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to think about it.</v>

1786
01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:03.160
<v Speaker 1>You can come in here and think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

1787
01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:04.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like hours at a time and like you </v>

1788
01:34:06.881 --> 01:34:09.580
<v Speaker 1>don't get eaten by a crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

1789
01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:10.473
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one comes running through here </v>

1790
01:34:11.831 --> 01:34:12.664
<v Speaker 1>pillaging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course the crocodile eating </v>

1791
01:34:15.491 --> 01:34:16.324
<v Speaker 1>and the pillaging were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common occurrences in our </v>

1792
01:34:18.581 --> 01:34:19.980
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1793
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:20.833
<v Speaker 1>I mean for lots of our ancestors going </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to get water from the local river </v>

1794
01:34:23.711 --> 01:34:27.220
<v Speaker 1>was a life or death mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1795
01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:29.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine having to get water from</v>

1796
01:34:29.651 --> 01:34:30.484
<v Speaker 1>a crocodile infested stream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when that's where the lions </v>

1797
01:34:33.551 --> 01:34:34.930
<v Speaker 1>are hanging out too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1798
01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:39.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's ordered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the positive element of order.</v>

1799
01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Now you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>students say this a lot.</v>

1800
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:42.423
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so constrained within all these </v>

1801
01:34:43.691 --> 01:34:46.330
<v Speaker 1>boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's destroying my individuality.</v>

1802
01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:48.340
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the tear radical.</v>

1803
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1804
01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.920
<v Speaker 1>it's pathetic in some sense because God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1805
01:34:51.921 --> 01:34:54.760
<v Speaker 1>and you're so privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just beyond comprehension.</v>

1806
01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:55.900
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1807
01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.720
<v Speaker 1>but having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is also the case and,</v>

1808
01:34:58.721 --> 01:34:59.550
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has,</v>

1809
01:34:59.550 --> 01:35:00.383
<v Speaker 1>the case has to be made that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do have to sacrifice your potential </v>

1810
01:35:04.730 --> 01:35:08.090
<v Speaker 1>to cultural norms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is it.</v>

1811
01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:12.020
<v Speaker 1>You can argue that that's destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it really is disruptive.</v>

1812
01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Like creative people don't fit very well</v>
<v Speaker 1>into nested boxes.</v>

1813
01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:15.973
<v Speaker 1>And in order for them to fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to do damage in some sense to </v>

1814
01:35:18.561 --> 01:35:22.220
<v Speaker 1>their psyches because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally</v>

1815
01:35:24.910 --> 01:35:25.743
<v Speaker 1>made to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't their natural environment </v>

1816
01:35:27.881 --> 01:35:30.430
<v Speaker 1>boxes within boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they might say,</v>

1817
01:35:30.431 --> 01:35:31.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being oppressed.</v>

1818
01:35:31.601 --> 01:35:32.141
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1819
01:35:32.141 --> 01:35:35.470
<v Speaker 1>of course you're being oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're in 50 boxes,</v>

1820
01:35:35.471 --> 01:35:37.960
<v Speaker 1>that's going to constrain your freedoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of movement.</v>

1821
01:35:37.961 --> 01:35:38.794
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you should be somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>grateful for the fact that the box is </v>

1822
01:35:40.781 --> 01:35:42.040
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

1823
01:35:42.041 --> 01:35:43.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even notice them.</v>

1824
01:35:43.570 --> 01:35:47.410
<v Speaker 1>The boxes are so effective that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even notice them.</v>

1825
01:35:47.411 --> 01:35:50.170
<v Speaker 1>You can even criticize them and and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>

1826
01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:51.183
<v Speaker 1>you don't because maybe they could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and not quite as rigid and so </v>

1827
01:35:53.471 --> 01:35:54.304
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know the criticism is the </v>

1828
01:35:57.521 --> 01:36:00.280
<v Speaker 1>criticism is justified but you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep both of the,</v>

1829
01:36:01.330 --> 01:36:04.480
<v Speaker 1>both of the representations in mind at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

1830
01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:05.793
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your culture is the wise king and the </v>

1831
01:36:07.151 --> 01:36:10.600
<v Speaker 1>desk bought at the same time and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate that sort of thing because,</v>

1832
01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:15.340
<v Speaker 1>and you know our rational minds and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>logical and our,</v>

1833
01:36:15.341 --> 01:36:16.174
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our history of logical intellectual </v>

1834
01:36:17.951 --> 01:36:18.784
<v Speaker 1>thinking has forced us to assume that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing can't be itself and its opposite </v>

1835
01:36:23.051 --> 01:36:23.980
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>

1836
01:36:24.490 --> 01:36:27.760
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about very large scale categories,</v>

1837
01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:29.493
<v Speaker 1>things are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they are and they're opposite at </v>

1838
01:36:31.601 --> 01:36:32.434
<v Speaker 1>the same time because culture is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wise king and the tyrant and that means </v>

1839
01:36:36.371 --> 01:36:37.204
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to adjust your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior in relationship to it because </v>

1840
01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.480
<v Speaker 1>you never know if you're talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wise king or the tyrant,</v>

1841
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:46.940
<v Speaker 1>you know and you'll feel that if you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>your taxes or if you have to deal with,</v>

1842
01:36:47.110 --> 01:36:49.810
<v Speaker 1>say you have to deal with the university</v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy in some way.</v>

1843
01:36:49.811 --> 01:36:50.644
<v Speaker 1>It's like you know you're a number and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're just annoying like </v>

1844
01:36:53.861 --> 01:36:54.694
<v Speaker 1>patients in a hospital because hospitals</v>
<v Speaker 1>would read a lot better if they didn't </v>

1845
01:36:57.401 --> 01:37:00.550
<v Speaker 1>have any patients in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you know when you feel that of</v>

1846
01:37:00.551 --> 01:37:01.384
<v Speaker 1>course whenever you're in a very complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy it's like you're </v>

1847
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:07.450
<v Speaker 1>exchangeable and that's very annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

1848
01:37:07.451 --> 01:37:10.180
<v Speaker 1>while here you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to criticize,</v>

1849
01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.060
<v Speaker 1>this is also a very complex form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral behavior.</v>

1850
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:14.343
<v Speaker 1>You have to criticize with gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that students </v>

1851
01:37:19.121 --> 01:37:21.070
<v Speaker 1>should really be taught in university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1852
01:37:21.071 --> 01:37:24.130
<v Speaker 1>because the opposite of gratitude is </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment.</v>

1853
01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:28.180
<v Speaker 1>And there is nothing that's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological than resentment.</v>

1854
01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.193
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that comes close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment in terms of its capacity to </v>

1855
01:37:32.471 --> 01:37:35.380
<v Speaker 1>produce misery is arrogance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those things are often,</v>

1856
01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:37.750
<v Speaker 1>it's arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment,</v>

1857
01:37:37.751 --> 01:37:40.300
<v Speaker 1>and deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like that's the evil triad.</v>

1858
01:37:40.301 --> 01:37:42.550
<v Speaker 1>You get all those three things going in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

1859
01:37:42.551 --> 01:37:44.950
<v Speaker 1>and boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be in rough shape very,</v>

1860
01:37:44.951 --> 01:37:48.130
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then</v>

1861
01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:53.410
<v Speaker 2>let's take a break</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 15 minutes,</v>

1862
01:37:53.411 --> 01:37:54.244
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
