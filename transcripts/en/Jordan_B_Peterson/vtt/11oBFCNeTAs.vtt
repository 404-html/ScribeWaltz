1
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if any other personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>course in North America talks about</v>

2
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Vince Wanger and boss anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>

3
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>But I think their ideas are extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and so I'm going to talk</v>

4
00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>they were influenced very much by Martin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger who was one of the 20th</v>

6
00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:37.321
<v Speaker 1>century's greatest philosophers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say probably this school of,</v>

7
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.260
<v Speaker 1>this is part of the phenomenological</v>
<v Speaker 1>school was more influenced directly by a</v>

8
00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 1>philosopher than any other school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just to reiterate,</v>

9
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:48.260
<v Speaker 1>cause you might keep wondering why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I discussed so many philosophers in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

11
00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:56.311
<v Speaker 1>It's because</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychology in particular is</v>

12
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>not strictly a scientific enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's oriented towards</v>

13
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.960
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell,</v>

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that there's any way of</v>

15
00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:10.210
<v Speaker 1>getting around that and that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're trying to do as a clinical</v>

16
00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and perhaps what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do with your own life is to</v>

17
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:14.830
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to live properly.</v>

18
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Now you can construe that as the absence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of illness,</v>

19
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about as close as you get to a</v>

20
00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:26.020
<v Speaker 1>scientific model of living well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have any illnesses.</v>

21
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:30.340
<v Speaker 1>But even the idea of illness is an idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not precisely scientific.</v>

22
00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

23
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 1>it's an amalgam of scientific concepts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ethical concepts.</v>

24
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>So there's no escaping it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're in the domain of ethics or</v>

25
00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're in what is more or less a</v>

26
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:46.060
<v Speaker 1>philosophical domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also if you're a scientist,</v>

27
00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>if you're a scientist who's interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in personality,</v>

28
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.660
<v Speaker 1>it's also something you have to grapple</v>
<v Speaker 1>with conceptually because people live</v>

29
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.570
<v Speaker 1>within an ethic and the ethics</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures their perceptions.</v>

30
00:01:55.571 --> 00:01:58.150
<v Speaker 1>And so even to study human beings as</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects,</v>

31
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>you still have to take into account they</v>
<v Speaker 1>ensconced themselves within a value</v>

32
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:04.090
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to understand what that</v>

33
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:05.590
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

34
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:08.680
<v Speaker 1>it's easier and more straightforward</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to get right to the root of the</v>

35
00:02:08.681 --> 00:02:09.520
<v Speaker 1>matter to begin with.</v>

36
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 1>And these people also had insanely</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting ideas.</v>

37
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 1>They're really useful to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this,</v>

38
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I would say maybe these th the</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy that underpins this might be</v>

39
00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 1>the most complex of all the philosophies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to,</v>

40
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.450
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really saying something</v>

41
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:27.370
<v Speaker 1>because there's no shortage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity.</v>

42
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Say a noon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Oh and it's,</v>

43
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:34.360
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to portray what these people were up to.</v>

44
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I started by telling you when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed rogers a little bit,</v>

45
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:42.310
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the f the phenomenologists were</v>

46
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:47.311
<v Speaker 1>interested in the fact that people live</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a self defined perceptual world.</v>

47
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be one way of thinking about</v>

48
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.284
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

49
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the way to,</v>

50
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 1>to start to conceptualize what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means is to consider for a moment,</v>

51
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>just consider for a moment how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>things there are in this room that you</v>

52
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>might look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is there's an</v>

53
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of them depending on how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to scale your perceptions.</v>

54
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 1>You could spend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were a painter,</v>

55
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>you could spend a month painting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>tile,</v>

56
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>painting representation of that tile</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's infinitely complex to get</v>

57
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>the colors right to get the patterns</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

58
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>There's no end to it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because to make a representation that</v>

59
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>was accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have to be as detailed as the</v>

60
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>thing itself that's crazily detailed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

61
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>but you don't concentrate on that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

62
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>So you think you're surrounded by an</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of potential things to</v>

63
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>apprehend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't the world you live in.</v>

64
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>The world you live in is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very constrained subset of those things.</v>

65
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>And part of the question is then what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of that constrained subset?</v>

66
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what you inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes up your experience.</v>

67
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>And also how is it related to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the infinitely complex objects that</v>

68
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>are around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what these people were</v>

69
00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're in this perceptual frame.</v>

70
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the design by the way,</v>

71
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the existential frame or the</v>

72
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological frame because you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it nearly as perception</v>

73
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>because it contains also all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you experience subjectively,</v>

74
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>the emotions and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the f and the quality that you know,</v>

75
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.370
<v Speaker 1>call Leah is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an element of being that say</v>

76
00:04:22.371 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>philosophers are scientists of</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness have a particularly</v>

77
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>difficult time with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like it's the quality of pain.</v>

78
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't seem reduceable to a set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective facts or the quality of color</v>

79
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>or the quality of beauty or the quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of love or the quality of sorrow.</v>

80
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Those things seem your reduceable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree in and of themselves.</v>

81
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is pain made of?</v>

82
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even seem like a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

83
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you decompose the neurological</v>

84
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 1>circuits that are involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of pain?</v>

85
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to ask what pain consists of her</v>

86
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>compose is composed of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what beauty is composed of or love</v>

87
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>seems to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong with that,</v>

88
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 1>with the formulation of that question</v>
<v Speaker 1>because those things sort of manifest</v>

89
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 1>themself as raw facts of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so their constituent elements of,</v>

90
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your field of experience,</v>

91
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:14.160
<v Speaker 1>you're phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal logical frame or this das</v>

92
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the way that that heidegger</v>

93
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.280
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it.</v>

94
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.280
<v Speaker 1>That's big there with you at the center</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the center of your what realm of</v>

95
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

96
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 1>now here's some characteristics of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>data side.</v>

97
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 1>The thing that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that makes up you the past and</v>

98
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:37.790
<v Speaker 1>the present are implicit in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

100
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 1>say you have a particular emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>response to something,</v>

101
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:45.760
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a negative emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

102
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this very frequently with</v>

103
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>arguments with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're having an argument with someone</v>

104
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 1>you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a family member.</v>

105
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it's the same damn fight</v>

106
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 1>you've had with your mother 50 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

107
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>well that's interesting because what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>means is that all of those 50 times that</v>

108
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 1>you fought with your mother are implicit</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this fight.</v>

109
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>So although it's taking place right here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now the past is shaped it,</v>

110
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>and if you wanted to investigate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight come completely,</v>

111
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to get to the bottom of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire train of interactions you've had</v>

112
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>with your mother.</v>

113
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 1>So it's implicit in your current,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your current and your current</v>

114
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

115
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>But the future's implicit in it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what you're doing right now,</v>

116
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>it's as if the future is folded up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're experiencing right now and</v>

117
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 1>it unfolds as you interact with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason that it's conditional</v>

118
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:42.221
<v Speaker 1>to some degree on you and your past is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's your past and you that are</v>

119
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 1>determining the actions that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>undertake right now that determine how</v>

120
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 1>the future is going to unfold around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

121
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

122
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 1>not completely obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have complete control</v>

123
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:57.431
<v Speaker 1>over how things unfold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you seem to have some ability to</v>

124
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>determine how things unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the ways I've sort of</v>

125
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize the phenomenological</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint,</v>

126
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one way of thinking about it,</v>

127
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that instead of thinking,</v>

128
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 1>and it does mean you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reconceptualize your idea of of objects,</v>

129
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 1>like an object seems like a unit</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional thing.</v>

130
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.050
<v Speaker 1>In some sense it's an object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most of the things that people</v>

131
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 1>interact with aren't like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>

132
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

133
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

134
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you're writing the m cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to go to medical school,</v>

135
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:30.740
<v Speaker 1>you've written the Mcat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the envelope in the mail,</v>

136
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.710
<v Speaker 1>it tells you what your score is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hold the envelope.</v>

137
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.530
<v Speaker 1>What are you holding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

138
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:38.480
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it from an objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

139
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 1>it's an envelope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

140
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just a little piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

141
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a rectangle of paper,</v>

142
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what you're holding at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

143
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 1>That's not what that thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you see it,</v>

144
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's not what it is at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even,</v>

145
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 1>and you know that your body knows that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're shaking.</v>

146
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.041
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

147
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 1>what are you scared of the envelope?</v>

148
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

149
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.750
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you see it as an envelope</v>
<v Speaker 1>is only an indication of just how narrow</v>

150
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 1>your perceptions actually are because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a portal,</v>

151
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a portal through which you're going</v>

152
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 1>to walk into one of two worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in which you're in medical school</v>

153
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.810
<v Speaker 1>and the other in which you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also actually contains the past,</v>

154
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>which is really strange because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

155
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already know what the past is.</v>

156
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:21.800
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

157
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that score is in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>determines what your past was.</v>

158
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that too.</v>

159
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:30.350
<v Speaker 1>You go watch a movie and a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things happen in the movie and then</v>

160
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 1>something twisted happens at the end and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden everything that you</v>

161
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:39.350
<v Speaker 1>thought about the movie was a wrong and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole new path for the movie pops into</v>

162
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:40.460
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

163
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>are you a premed student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a valid premed student?</v>

164
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the score will determine whether or not</v>

165
00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:49.400
<v Speaker 1>you were very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange.</v>

166
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Because you think of the past is fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you think of the things</v>

167
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 1>that you're interacting with as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you see and they're not,</v>

168
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 1>and your body is smarter than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way smarter than that because it</v>

169
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 1>responds to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say this is sort of a Rogerian</v>

170
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body is more likely to respond to</v>

171
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 1>what the thing actually is than how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you see it.</v>

172
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

173
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 1>so the past is implicit in the current</v>
<v Speaker 1>being and the future is implicit in the</v>

174
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 1>current being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the past and the future sort of</v>

175
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 1>folded up inside it and you can unfold</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and take a look at them.</v>

176
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from a classic scientific</v>

177
00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:36.530
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the world of independently</v>

178
00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:38.870
<v Speaker 1>existing objects and there's the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>of subjects.</v>

179
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And the subject is really in a secondary</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the object because the</v>

180
00:09:44.211 --> 00:09:47.540
<v Speaker 1>objective world is what's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that the</v>

181
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:52.040
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were concerned about that is that well,</v>

182
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.840
<v Speaker 1>you run into this problem again of</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how it is that you define the</v>

183
00:09:56.841 --> 00:09:57.860
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because</v>

184
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.660
<v Speaker 1>just as the envelope with the scores in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't be reduced to the paper.</v>

185
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.930
<v Speaker 1>So the object that you're interacting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with only reveals what it is as a</v>

186
00:10:11.931 --> 00:10:14.030
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the way that you interact</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

187
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.750
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take a complex object like</v>

188
00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:18.920
<v Speaker 1>another person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

189
00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:21.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you are?</v>

190
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.410
<v Speaker 1>While a huge part of that is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>depend on exactly how I interact with</v>

191
00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:28.700
<v Speaker 1>you because you could be a raging beast</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I interacted with you one way and you</v>

192
00:10:28.701 --> 00:10:30.290
<v Speaker 1>could be a perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

193
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.210
<v Speaker 1>cooperative entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

194
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.540
<v Speaker 1>that was very pleasant if I interacted</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you the other way and another way.</v>

195
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.810
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think of what you're</v>

196
00:10:38.811 --> 00:10:41.690
<v Speaker 1>interacting with is something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really multifaceted,</v>

197
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Speaker 1>truly multifaceted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

198
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:44.960
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

199
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.320
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to determine what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is,</v>

200
00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:52.130
<v Speaker 1>is that what it is manifested itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>only in accordance with how you behave</v>

201
00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:54.920
<v Speaker 1>towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually the case with even</v>

202
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.150
<v Speaker 1>even objects that you reduce right down</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their constituent elements.</v>

203
00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:02.210
<v Speaker 1>So you might say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about subatomic particles.</v>

204
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most objective thing there is,</v>

205
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that whether they're a wave</v>

206
00:11:07.131 --> 00:11:09.860
<v Speaker 1>or a particle depends on the way you set</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the experiment.</v>

207
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make quantum analogies,</v>

208
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.050
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is that the object</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very,</v>

209
00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:18.710
<v Speaker 1>very complicated thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even defining what it is means</v>

210
00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:22.040
<v Speaker 1>that you have to adopt a frame of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reference with regards to it and you</v>

211
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.620
<v Speaker 1>undertake only some procedures and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

212
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.320
<v Speaker 1>So when you're defining an object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even scientifically,</v>

213
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.330
<v Speaker 1>you actually don't find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>define the object.</v>

214
00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:32.750
<v Speaker 1>What you say is here's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>multidimensional entity.</v>

215
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.960
<v Speaker 1>If you approach it in this manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the procedure,</v>

216
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.823
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The methods,</v>

217
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.910
<v Speaker 1>if you approach it in this manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will manifest that set of traits.</v>

218
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.420
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that there's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of other traits that it could</v>

219
00:11:44.421 --> 00:11:47.510
<v Speaker 1>manifest just as well if you treated it</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different way.</v>

220
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.150
<v Speaker 1>And so the object itself is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that it's,</v>

221
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 1>it's not something easily reducible to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single set of properties.</v>

222
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to one of my students</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday had a pretty smart thing to</v>

223
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:02.740
<v Speaker 1>say about images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about deep images,</v>

224
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sorts that you might see in a really</v>

225
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:08.920
<v Speaker 1>high quality museum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe they're voted offs 15th century</v>

226
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.550
<v Speaker 1>or 16th Century Renaissance</v>
<v Speaker 1>masterpieces.</v>

227
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.210
<v Speaker 1>They're inexhaustible to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why they're in museums and</v>

228
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 1>people go look at them decade after</v>
<v Speaker 1>decade.</v>

229
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because</v>

230
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.400
<v Speaker 1>every time you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're different.</v>

231
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 1>You go in one week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at it,</v>

232
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.240
<v Speaker 1>you see something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go in the next week,</v>

233
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:29.650
<v Speaker 1>you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see something else.</v>

234
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's partly because you're bringing</v>

235
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:37.150
<v Speaker 1>something entirely different to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation and the image is complicated</v>

236
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:40.300
<v Speaker 1>enough to allow it to reflect something</v>
<v Speaker 1>new to you.</v>

237
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Depending on the stance you take in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to it and lots of things</v>

238
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:45.490
<v Speaker 1>are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of things.</v>

239
00:12:45.491 --> 00:12:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I'd like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A book you read when you were 16 is</v>

240
00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 1>going to be an entirely different book</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you read it.</v>

241
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 1>When you're 35 say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the book's the same.</v>

242
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you define the book</v>

243
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.030
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't even obvious where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book is.</v>

244
00:12:58.031 --> 00:12:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

245
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:00.760
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on my shelf in the library.</v>

246
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:01.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

247
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.700
<v Speaker 1>that's a chunk of paper that's on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelf in the library where exactly the</v>

248
00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 1>book is.</v>

249
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.430
<v Speaker 1>That's a much more difficult question</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

250
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.850
<v Speaker 1>to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it depends on how you define the</v>

251
00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:15.280
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So without a subject,</v>

252
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:19.030
<v Speaker 1>nothing at all would exist to confront</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects and to imagine them as such.</v>

253
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This implies that every object,</v>

254
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:25.480
<v Speaker 1>everything objective in barely merely in</v>
<v Speaker 1>being merely objectifies by the subject</v>

255
00:13:25.481 --> 00:13:28.300
<v Speaker 1>is the most subjective thing possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

256
00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you also know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

257
00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:33.760
<v Speaker 1>when you're in an argument with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you know it's you know it's you.</v>

258
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you being biased or are you,</v>

259
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:39.460
<v Speaker 1>are you looking at the situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrectly?</v>

260
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 1>The person you're arguing with is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to convince you that it trying to</v>

261
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:44.560
<v Speaker 1>convince you that it's your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could think,</v>

262
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made me angry.</v>

263
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

264
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.490
<v Speaker 1>An interesting statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know as if you could do that,</v>

265
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:54.580
<v Speaker 1>but it does seem that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were being provocative while you're</v>

266
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:56.050
<v Speaker 1>just too sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

267
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.150
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are we going to settle that?</v>

268
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a continual argument and that that</v>

269
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:06.520
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to do with the crazy entangled</v>

270
00:14:06.521 --> 00:14:09.910
<v Speaker 1>dynamic between subjective perception</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our objective perception.</v>

271
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.920
<v Speaker 1>I've showed you this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think this is a pretty good</v>

272
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.920
<v Speaker 1>schematic representation of what's meant</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Das side.</v>

273
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.380
<v Speaker 1>And this is a complicated little</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagram,</v>

274
00:14:22.381 --> 00:14:24.510
<v Speaker 1>although it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diagram itself is quite simple,</v>

275
00:14:24.511 --> 00:14:25.500
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

276
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.060
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it,</v>

277
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:31.470
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated on the following</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions is that you need to narrow</v>

278
00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:35.700
<v Speaker 1>down your world and what you're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrowing it down from let's say an</v>

279
00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:39.870
<v Speaker 1>infinite set of possibilities to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>finite set of manageable possibilities.</v>

280
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.630
<v Speaker 1>And you do that a bunch of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly merely you can't,</v>

281
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.620
<v Speaker 1>your senses aren't acute enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>detect everything.</v>

282
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 1>So pure stupidity in some sense stops</v>
<v Speaker 1>you from being overwhelmed.</v>

283
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't have eyes in the back of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

284
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have to worry about all</v>

285
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 1>those things you're not looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind you.</v>

286
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.190
<v Speaker 1>But then it's far more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't handle that full</v>

287
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 1>complexity.</v>

288
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.110
<v Speaker 1>So there's a continual narrowing process</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you exist inside that narrowed</v>

289
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I look at you like that,</v>

290
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.680
<v Speaker 1>there's not a hell of a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between that and looking at</v>

291
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:15.710
<v Speaker 1>you like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really see these people.</v>

292
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I can tell their people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I can see your face.</v>

293
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I've got just about all of it right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

294
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's a very narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

295
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 1>you're moving your eyes around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabiting this constant narrow space.</v>

296
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.713
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

297
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 1>what's that space?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that space you inhabit consist</v>

298
00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 1>of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

299
00:15:33.951 --> 00:15:36.020
<v Speaker 1>that's dazzle and that space that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabit.</v>

300
00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:37.970
<v Speaker 1>And so we could say it's something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

301
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:42.140
<v Speaker 1>You have implicit in that perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense of where you are and what you're</v>

302
00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 1>doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the perception and then in the</v>

303
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:49.910
<v Speaker 1>perception as well is what you're aiming</v>
<v Speaker 1>at because you're not just sitting here</v>

304
00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:52.580
<v Speaker 1>passively or you'd be asleep or you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

305
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.090
<v Speaker 1>You're sitting here doing nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know physically,</v>

306
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.330
<v Speaker 1>but you have an aim in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the aim is what you're pointing your</v>

307
00:15:59.331 --> 00:16:01.970
<v Speaker 1>eyes at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The aim is what's structuring your</v>

308
00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:06.170
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aim is what's revealing that part</v>

309
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:08.720
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that is being revealed to you,</v>

310
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.050
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the revelation of the world.</v>

311
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.470
<v Speaker 1>It also structures your emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also primes your behaviors.</v>

312
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:18.440
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a goal.</v>

313
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a motivation.</v>

314
00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:21.060
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

315
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more than that.</v>

316
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:25.250
<v Speaker 1>It's all of that at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of what your personality is,</v>

317
00:16:25.251 --> 00:16:28.670
<v Speaker 1>but you see the phenomenologists don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really think about personality.</v>

318
00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:31.820
<v Speaker 1>They think about the manifestation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your reality.</v>

319
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that you're the center of a reality</v>

320
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.660
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you constitute that reality.</v>

321
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.720
<v Speaker 1>But all your elements of experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute that reality.</v>

322
00:16:41.721 --> 00:16:43.200
<v Speaker 1>And so it's something like it's simple.</v>

323
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Its element is something like where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

324
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.770
<v Speaker 1>where you're going and the embodied</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions you undertake to relate those</v>

325
00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:53.960
<v Speaker 1>two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would include your eye movements.</v>

326
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Cause of course perception is an active</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>

327
00:16:56.931 --> 00:16:59.930
<v Speaker 1>You are shaking your eyes back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably rapidly.</v>

328
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

329
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.850
<v Speaker 1>if you can make your eyes stand still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can do with great</v>

330
00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:08.090
<v Speaker 1>concentration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything we'll black out because you</v>

331
00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:11.420
<v Speaker 1>have to move your eyes back and forth so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the light hits different cells</v>

332
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:15.500
<v Speaker 1>because the cells get exhausted and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stop reporting.</v>

333
00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:20.501
<v Speaker 1>So you're just whipping your eyes back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and forth in micro micro way constantly.</v>

334
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.470
<v Speaker 1>And as well as moving them around</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily and involuntarily.</v>

335
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.290
<v Speaker 1>So even perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his perception is a lot more like</v>

336
00:17:27.291 --> 00:17:30.680
<v Speaker 1>feeling things out with your fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when you're using your ears or your</v>

337
00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:33.890
<v Speaker 1>eyes very active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no passive perception.</v>

338
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a motor act to perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that motor act is determined by</v>

339
00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:40.640
<v Speaker 1>your hierarchy of values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it.</v>

340
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 1>So another way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also how the past and the future</v>

341
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:47.720
<v Speaker 1>implicit in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a very active perception is</v>

342
00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 1>determined by your entire value</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

343
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's implicit inside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's folded up inside of it.</v>

344
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.270
<v Speaker 1>You can tell that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if something violates it,</v>

345
00:17:57.271 --> 00:17:59.550
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe an argument with someone,</v>

346
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 1>because people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good to think about people as the</v>

347
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 1>thing you interact with the most as as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the canonical object because they're so</v>

348
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:08.280
<v Speaker 1>damn complicated and they get in the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

349
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And when someone gets in the way of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>

350
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious what they're</v>

351
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:15.870
<v Speaker 1>interfering with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be the little micro routine</v>

352
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:18.180
<v Speaker 1>that you're undertaking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

353
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:21.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe you go home and you make a nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner and the person you're making it</v>

354
00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:23.280
<v Speaker 1>for is all rude about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

355
00:18:23.281 --> 00:18:25.620
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly are they getting in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of?</v>

356
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're certainly getting the way in the</v>

357
00:18:30.581 --> 00:18:34.780
<v Speaker 1>way of your expectations of having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice emotional time for the next hour,</v>

358
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.940
<v Speaker 1>but you have no idea how indicative that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is of some serious flaw in you or them</v>

359
00:18:39.941 --> 00:18:43.660
<v Speaker 1>or the relationship or the situation or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you've conducted your whole life</v>

360
00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.850
<v Speaker 1>or the way they've conducted their whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

361
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.930
<v Speaker 1>And all of that's packed in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like the unconscious of the</v>

362
00:18:49.931 --> 00:18:51.880
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more,</v>

363
00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:52.840
<v Speaker 1>it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

364
00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same conceptualization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another way of looking at the same</v>

365
00:18:56.531 --> 00:18:57.970
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

366
00:18:58.910 --> 00:18:59.560
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

367
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the two people we're going to talk</v>

368
00:19:01.291 --> 00:19:05.790
<v Speaker 1>about most are made our boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was influenced by Martin</v>

369
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a great philosopher,</v>

370
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:12.590
<v Speaker 1>taken to task often because he turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to be tangled up with the Nazis more</v>

371
00:19:12.661 --> 00:19:14.910
<v Speaker 1>than he should have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Husserl.</v>

372
00:19:14.911 --> 00:19:17.640
<v Speaker 1>That's Edmund Husserl who was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

373
00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:18.421
<v Speaker 1>mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Martin,</v>

374
00:19:18.421 --> 00:19:20.960
<v Speaker 1>heidegger's teacher that's living being</v>
<v Speaker 1>swagger.</v>

375
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.340
<v Speaker 1>And they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of these two people were influenced</v>

376
00:19:23.341 --> 00:19:24.650
<v Speaker 1>both by Freud and Yung.</v>

377
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's one of been swaggers claims.</v>

378
00:19:29.241 --> 00:19:31.850
<v Speaker 1>I love this claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a cool idea and I think</v>

379
00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:34.640
<v Speaker 1>there's neurological support for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neuropsychological support,</v>

380
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:39.320
<v Speaker 1>what we perceive our first and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not impressions of taste,</v>

381
00:19:39.321 --> 00:19:39.981
<v Speaker 1>tone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smeller,</v>

382
00:19:39.981 --> 00:19:42.140
<v Speaker 1>touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even things or objects,</v>

383
00:19:42.141 --> 00:19:45.950
<v Speaker 1>but meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's an interesting idea because</v>

384
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.100
<v Speaker 1>your claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

385
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been said that every person is an</v>

386
00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:53.900
<v Speaker 1>unconscious exponents of some great</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher's presuppositions.</v>

387
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly the way you think about the way</v>

388
00:19:56.811 --> 00:19:59.210
<v Speaker 1>you perceive is that there are objects</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

389
00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.090
<v Speaker 1>You see the objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about the objects,</v>

390
00:20:02.091 --> 00:20:04.970
<v Speaker 1>you evaluate the objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you decide how to act on the objects,</v>

391
00:20:04.971 --> 00:20:07.610
<v Speaker 1>and then you act right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from,</v>

392
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:08.810
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

393
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.730
<v Speaker 1>object sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception,</v>

394
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.140
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognition,</v>

395
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.790
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>

396
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.690
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly not the way it works because</v>

397
00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.750
<v Speaker 1>you're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that you interact with the world</v>

398
00:20:20.751 --> 00:20:22.160
<v Speaker 1>exists at multiple levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

399
00:20:22.161 --> 00:20:24.500
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have reflexes.</v>

400
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.120
<v Speaker 1>So if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

401
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.670
<v Speaker 1>if I poke you hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll react like that.</v>

402
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.740
<v Speaker 1>He'll jerk back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that you do that without thinking.</v>

403
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:38.770
<v Speaker 1>That's part of a neurological circuit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very deeply embedded and that's</v>

404
00:20:39.021 --> 00:20:40.970
<v Speaker 1>virtually automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's reflexive,</v>

405
00:20:40.971 --> 00:20:43.250
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't require conscious perception</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

406
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 1>It's too slow for starters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have multiple layers,</v>

407
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.050
<v Speaker 1>there's multiple levels of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the world.</v>

408
00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:53.350
<v Speaker 1>And at one level you're seeing objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about them,</v>

409
00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:56.080
<v Speaker 1>you're planning what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're doing all sorts of other</v>

410
00:20:56.081 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 1>things that are way faster than that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things that are way slower at the</v>

411
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:01.520
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what,</v>

412
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.920
<v Speaker 1>what Ben Weighing Wanger claims is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see in the world,</v>

413
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:08.020
<v Speaker 1>our meanings and that.</v>

414
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's the meaning detection first and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the object recognition second.</v>

415
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a hell of a claim that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

416
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but there's definitely levels of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system that operate in that</v>

417
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:19.570
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

418
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.170
<v Speaker 1>here's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have blindsight there,</v>

419
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.240
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their core visual cortex is damaged.</v>

420
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.700
<v Speaker 1>They can't see objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they think they're blind.</v>

421
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.110
<v Speaker 1>But if you show them an angry face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll manifest a change in the skin</v>

422
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 1>conductance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll orient and it means that the</v>

423
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:40.420
<v Speaker 1>eyes are still mapping the face onto the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amygdala and the Amygdala is mapping the</v>

424
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:44.650
<v Speaker 1>pattern onto the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No object perception pattern,</v>

425
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.300
<v Speaker 1>pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern,</v>

426
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.960
<v Speaker 1>no object perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the meaning is what's,</v>

427
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.290
<v Speaker 1>what's the meaning is what's being</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived first and foremost,</v>

428
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.190
<v Speaker 1>you have to perceive meetings first</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you actually want to stay alive.</v>

429
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.180
<v Speaker 1>That's the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the world is full of these things</v>

430
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:04.030
<v Speaker 1>that have meanings to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are relevant to your survival and</v>

431
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.670
<v Speaker 1>what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're perceiving first is the</v>

432
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:09.220
<v Speaker 1>relevance of the pattern to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>survival.</v>

433
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.760
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that you can conceptualize</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as a set of objects.</v>

434
00:22:12.761 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty new idea technically</v>

435
00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:16.871
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

436
00:22:16.871 --> 00:22:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Because technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't really start to conceive the</v>

437
00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:25.390
<v Speaker 1>world as subject in an objective world</v>
<v Speaker 1>until we really formalized science.</v>

438
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science was implicit long before it</v>

439
00:22:27.821 --> 00:22:30.520
<v Speaker 1>became explicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't become explicit until</v>

440
00:22:30.521 --> 00:22:34.450
<v Speaker 1>about 500 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you react to meanings.</v>

441
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.060
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Babies.</v>

442
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.480
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have two surfaces and you put a</v>

443
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:44.020
<v Speaker 1>piece of glass between them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're elevated and you put an eight</v>

444
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 1>month old baby on one surface or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can crawl,</v>

445
00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:50.860
<v Speaker 1>the baby can crawl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it won't crawl across the space.</v>

446
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.890
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's sees a hole and we'll walk.</v>

447
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Won't crawl across it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what it sees.</v>

448
00:22:57.071 --> 00:23:00.640
<v Speaker 1>It sees a place to fall off direct.</v>

449
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.010
<v Speaker 1>That's direct perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I see this,</v>

450
00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:07.330
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my eyes see that as a pattern.</v>

451
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.500
<v Speaker 1>That patterns on my retina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's propagated through my optic nerve.</v>

452
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.730
<v Speaker 1>It's propagated into my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's propagated on to my motor cortex</v>

453
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.560
<v Speaker 1>and the propagation is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that right?</v>

454
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So I can pick it up and as soon as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I look at that,</v>

455
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.390
<v Speaker 1>this is implicit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's implicit in the perception.</v>

456
00:23:28.391 --> 00:23:30.490
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why do you see that at the size and</v>

457
00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:32.890
<v Speaker 1>resolution you see it at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

458
00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that you see it that way has</v>
<v Speaker 1>this implicit in it and is it that you</v>

459
00:23:37.721 --> 00:23:39.490
<v Speaker 1>see the object and match your hand to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

460
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.390
<v Speaker 1>It's that matching your hand to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is part of the perception of the object.</v>

461
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.360
<v Speaker 1>It's what gives the object meaning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you see actually you perceive the</v>

462
00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:48.560
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the object.</v>

463
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.970
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the perception and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't not see the meaning of the object</v>

464
00:23:52.971 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 1>while you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a scientist,</v>

465
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:58.550
<v Speaker 1>you can sort of separate the out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>object from its meaning.</v>

466
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:02.000
<v Speaker 1>That's actually what science does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tears the object away from its</v>

467
00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:06.220
<v Speaker 1>meaning and then of course there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing meaningful left and so sorry and</v>

468
00:24:06.221 --> 00:24:08.540
<v Speaker 1>sands up value free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's because of the meaning has</v>

469
00:24:08.541 --> 00:24:11.750
<v Speaker 1>been torn out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's technical reasons for doing</v>

470
00:24:11.751 --> 00:24:14.090
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Ben swingers point is don't kid</v>

471
00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:15.590
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the meaning first.</v>

472
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Watch the trade taller towers fall.</v>

473
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.750
<v Speaker 1>What did you see</v>

474
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.211
<v Speaker 1>while you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

475
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:24.560
<v Speaker 1>you saw the towers fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

476
00:24:24.561 --> 00:24:26.840
<v Speaker 1>why are you in shock for two days</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards then?</v>

477
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the towers aren't,</v>

478
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:33.170
<v Speaker 1>what are the towers exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as they're standing and</v>

479
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:36.230
<v Speaker 1>operating their towers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they fall,</v>

480
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.710
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're the beginning of the next</v>

481
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.640
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

482
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everyone was in shock for three</v>

483
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:50.021
<v Speaker 1>days because what they saw was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>indeterminate meaning of that event and</v>

484
00:24:50.871 --> 00:24:52.940
<v Speaker 1>it opened all sorts of gateways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

485
00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:54.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the towers fell.</v>

486
00:24:54.831 --> 00:24:57.230
<v Speaker 1>There's gateways open everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what's going on.</v>

487
00:24:57.231 --> 00:24:58.550
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what's going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>

488
00:24:58.551 --> 00:25:02.150
<v Speaker 1>We don't know where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's direct perception mapped onto</v>

489
00:25:02.151 --> 00:25:03.170
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

490
00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:06.680
<v Speaker 1>you're in shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the meaning first and while you</v>

491
00:25:06.681 --> 00:25:09.770
<v Speaker 1>constrain it down to well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you so upset while the towers</v>

492
00:25:09.771 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 1>fell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's the best you can do for</v>

493
00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:13.360
<v Speaker 1>a verbal utterance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

494
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.740
<v Speaker 1>it's what your perceptual systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>reported to you,</v>

495
00:25:15.741 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 1>but God only knows what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still don't really know what it meant</v>

496
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 1>that they fell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now most things have put themselves back</v>

497
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:25.130
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

498
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.120
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

499
00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:31.700
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean that what you see</v>

500
00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:35.180
<v Speaker 1>first is the meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really tricky question</v>

501
00:25:35.181 --> 00:25:37.010
<v Speaker 1>because he might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

502
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:40.070
<v Speaker 1>that's when you get back to the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what constitutes real.</v>

503
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 1>So I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

504
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:46.340
<v Speaker 1>you've evolved to see the meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then we might ask,</v>

505
00:25:46.341 --> 00:25:48.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've evolved to see the meaning and</v>

506
00:25:48.891 --> 00:25:51.260
<v Speaker 1>that's kept you alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything more real than the</v>

507
00:25:51.261 --> 00:25:53.150
<v Speaker 1>meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's somebody who's a</v>

508
00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:54.230
<v Speaker 1>materialist would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

509
00:25:54.231 --> 00:25:55.970
<v Speaker 1>the object is more real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no,</v>

510
00:25:55.971 --> 00:26:00.200
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you define real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be that the most real thing</v>

511
00:26:00.201 --> 00:26:04.340
<v Speaker 1>about the visual cliff is that that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling off place and that it's</v>

512
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:06.200
<v Speaker 1>secondary description has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

513
00:26:06.201 --> 00:26:08.210
<v Speaker 1>an object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hole or something like that.</v>

514
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.000
<v Speaker 1>That's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something you paint over top of</v>

515
00:26:11.001 --> 00:26:13.700
<v Speaker 1>the primary reality and so</v>

516
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.550
<v Speaker 1>well here's the and here's the practical</v>
<v Speaker 1>application of it.</v>

517
00:26:18.551 --> 00:26:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Or at least one of the things that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think is practical.</v>

518
00:26:20.771 --> 00:26:23.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have experiences that did differ</v>

519
00:26:23.561 --> 00:26:26.440
<v Speaker 1>in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it high quality meaning you</v>

520
00:26:26.441 --> 00:26:28.240
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get engaged and engrossed in</v>

521
00:26:28.241 --> 00:26:30.730
<v Speaker 1>something and you're happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that you're happy,</v>

522
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.590
<v Speaker 1>it's that you're engaged and engrossed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

523
00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:34.540
<v Speaker 1>You would do it again even though it</v>
<v Speaker 1>might take,</v>

524
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.660
<v Speaker 1>take effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell that where you are is</v>

525
00:26:37.661 --> 00:26:39.250
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

526
00:26:39.251 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens in that situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're in a pia jetty and place</v>

527
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 1>where many of the games that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing are stacked sort of isomorphic</v>

528
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Lee on top of one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the experience of meaning is the</v>

529
00:26:51.271 --> 00:26:55.860
<v Speaker 1>fact that you're playing the small game</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly nested inside a larger game.</v>

530
00:26:55.861 --> 00:26:58.260
<v Speaker 1>You're playing it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nested inside a larger game,</v>

531
00:26:58.261 --> 00:27:00.450
<v Speaker 1>you're playing it properly to et cetera.</v>

532
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 1>All the way out past is balanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>future is balanced,</v>

533
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:09.080
<v Speaker 1>everything is stacked up and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>report coming from your being telling</v>

534
00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:11.970
<v Speaker 1>you that that's why you're engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might say,</v>

535
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:13.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's real.</v>

536
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's more real than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange thing because if you</v>

537
00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:21.510
<v Speaker 1>think that meaning is separate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>secondary from the real objective world,</v>

538
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:27.080
<v Speaker 1>then the reality is the object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't obvious that the reality is</v>

539
00:27:27.151 --> 00:27:28.710
<v Speaker 1>the object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly,</v>

540
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.490
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not how we act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not how we perceive,</v>

541
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.050
<v Speaker 1>and so did we evolve to perceive</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality?</v>

542
00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you mean by</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived.</v>

543
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Perceived might mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did we evolve mechanisms that allowed us</v>

544
00:27:43.321 --> 00:27:46.920
<v Speaker 1>to survive in the face of that reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

545
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Is that what's real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What enables you to survive in the face</v>

546
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:52.890
<v Speaker 1>of reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a definition.</v>

547
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfectly reasonable definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you can come up with a better</v>

548
00:27:56.611 --> 00:27:57.300
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

549
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Meanings are primary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that brings up,</v>

550
00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.100
<v Speaker 1>that brings up a strange issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what determines the meaning of what</v>

551
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:06.690
<v Speaker 1>it is that you're perceiving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

552
00:28:06.691 --> 00:28:10.620
<v Speaker 1>this is where been swagger and boss</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree.</v>

553
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Then Wagner says it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the a priori ontological structure,</v>

554
00:28:16.201 --> 00:28:18.720
<v Speaker 1>the world design or matrix of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

555
00:28:18.721 --> 00:28:20.670
<v Speaker 1>so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

556
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:25.500
<v Speaker 1>you have a particular history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological and cultural and individual</v>

557
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.250
<v Speaker 1>and you're viewing the world through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lens of that,</v>

558
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.120
<v Speaker 1>of that set of particular already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost as if you're behind a</v>

559
00:28:33.121 --> 00:28:37.320
<v Speaker 1>curtain and the curtain has certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>holes in it and you can see through the</v>

560
00:28:37.321 --> 00:28:41.010
<v Speaker 1>holes in the curtain and the curtain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>your construction.</v>

561
00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:45.600
<v Speaker 1>So the curtain with the holes determines</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see.</v>

562
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boss would say no.</v>

563
00:28:47.251 --> 00:28:49.470
<v Speaker 1>It's the opposite in in a very strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

564
00:28:49.471 --> 00:28:54.120
<v Speaker 1>It's that the meaning of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself to you more or less of</v>

565
00:28:54.121 --> 00:28:59.121
<v Speaker 1>its own accord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a tougher one to explain.</v>

566
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Disclosure of meaning boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revelation of the object,</v>

567
00:29:04.501 --> 00:29:06.870
<v Speaker 1>the emergent emergence of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon,</v>

568
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.020
<v Speaker 1>the numinous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very word phenomena is derived from</v>

569
00:29:10.021 --> 00:29:13.770
<v Speaker 1>famous thigh to shine forth to appear to</v>
<v Speaker 1>unveil itself,</v>

570
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.990
<v Speaker 1>to come out of concealment or darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

571
00:29:15.991 --> 00:29:18.510
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see someone beautiful,</v>

572
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:24.830
<v Speaker 1>your perception or is it your perception</v>
<v Speaker 1>or does the beauty exist?</v>

573
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.070
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference between Vince</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wanger and boss has been swagger would</v>

574
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:29.904
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

575
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.000
<v Speaker 1>the reason that that thing appears to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you as beautiful is because of the way</v>

576
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:35.040
<v Speaker 1>you're filtering it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and boss would say,</v>

577
00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:38.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beauty is in Hay inheres in the</v>

578
00:29:38.551 --> 00:29:43.551
<v Speaker 1>object itself and manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's forth and so I really liked this</v>

579
00:29:43.871 --> 00:29:44.790
<v Speaker 1>concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

580
00:29:44.791 --> 00:29:47.830
<v Speaker 1>this cannot concept of phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're phenomenologists</v>

581
00:29:47.831 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 1>famous die means to shine forth from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the phenomenological perspective,</v>

582
00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:54.610
<v Speaker 1>you pursue those things that shine</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

583
00:29:55.330 --> 00:30:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Now remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of a parallel idea.</v>

584
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it's a parallel of union</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

585
00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.560
<v Speaker 1>You remember in Harry Potter that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're playing quidditch,</v>

586
00:30:05.561 --> 00:30:09.070
<v Speaker 1>he's always chasing the snitch and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember how if,</v>

587
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:12.610
<v Speaker 1>if I've got this correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quidditch is basically two games at the</v>

588
00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:13.510
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

589
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 1>There's the standard game and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the game that the seekers play.</v>

590
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got that right.</v>

591
00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.050
<v Speaker 1>What happens if the secret gets the</v>
<v Speaker 1>snitch?</v>

592
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Game's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

593
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.250
<v Speaker 1>They win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>

594
00:30:24.251 --> 00:30:26.390
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has a brilliant imagination that a</v>

595
00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:29.890
<v Speaker 1>woman rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that in every game</v>

596
00:30:29.891 --> 00:30:31.630
<v Speaker 1>there's two games going on at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

597
00:30:31.631 --> 00:30:34.750
<v Speaker 1>There's the ordinary game and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game that the seekers play and the</v>

598
00:30:34.751 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 1>secrets chase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that shines out and that's</v>

599
00:30:38.231 --> 00:30:41.470
<v Speaker 1>what that little thing is the snitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a round circle with wings.</v>

600
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old,</v>

601
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:44.230
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old symbol.</v>

602
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol of what?</v>

603
00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:50.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol of reality before it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fractionated into its parts.</v>

604
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to say it anymore</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly than that.</v>

605
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a symbol of what?</v>

606
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Managing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things that move forward to</v>

607
00:30:57.911 --> 00:31:02.320
<v Speaker 1>make you curious and you were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what was common among all the</v>

608
00:31:02.321 --> 00:31:06.070
<v Speaker 1>things that made you curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing that Harry Potter is chasing,</v>

609
00:31:06.071 --> 00:31:08.050
<v Speaker 1>that's a symbol of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's golden,</v>

610
00:31:08.051 --> 00:31:10.720
<v Speaker 1>like the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it flits around and attracts your</v>

611
00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:13.720
<v Speaker 1>attention and it's always moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're seeking,</v>

612
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:17.170
<v Speaker 1>you chase it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the phenomenological idea.</v>

613
00:31:17.171 --> 00:31:19.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the disclosure of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

614
00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:21.790
<v Speaker 1>well when you're curious about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

615
00:31:21.791 --> 00:31:24.280
<v Speaker 1>why are you curious about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

616
00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.000
<v Speaker 1>is it calling to you or is it something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're interpreting?</v>

617
00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's both.</v>

618
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the way to resolve this</v>
<v Speaker 1>puzzle.</v>

619
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.080
<v Speaker 1>It's that there isn't a perceiving</v>
<v Speaker 1>entity without a structure and your</v>

620
00:31:38.081 --> 00:31:41.800
<v Speaker 1>structure has been evolving itself for</v>
<v Speaker 1>three and a half billion years.</v>

621
00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:44.260
<v Speaker 1>There's no perceiving entity without a</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

622
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:48.430
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's being perceived also</v>

623
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.400
<v Speaker 1>shines forth with its own potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation.</v>

624
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 1>And you need to think of it both ways at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

625
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.340
<v Speaker 1>But the curiosity issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>

626
00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:57.550
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

627
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:02.110
<v Speaker 1>because curiosity pulls you forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not random.</v>

628
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't really control it,</v>

629
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's not random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your curiosity is random,</v>

630
00:32:08.591 --> 00:32:11.860
<v Speaker 1>your schizophrenia and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that technically because one</v>

631
00:32:11.861 --> 00:32:15.250
<v Speaker 1>of the things that happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia is that the mechanisms</v>

632
00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:19.120
<v Speaker 1>that establish relevance become</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologized and they see meaning</v>

633
00:32:19.121 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 1>everywhere randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly why they generate</v>

634
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:26.350
<v Speaker 1>delusions because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the incoherent manifestation of meaning</v>

635
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.860
<v Speaker 1>calls out for a representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They develop a paranoid delusion if</v>

636
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:31.690
<v Speaker 1>they're intelligent enough to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything together,</v>

637
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:36.150
<v Speaker 1>but so you're curious and something</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulls you forward will you can,</v>

638
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.290
<v Speaker 1>you can interact with the curiosity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can follow it,</v>

639
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.820
<v Speaker 1>but you can't really direct it.</v>

640
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.690
<v Speaker 1>The question is where is it taking you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that little ball,</v>

641
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:49.970
<v Speaker 1>that was a manifestation of what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greeks referred to Greeks.</v>

642
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're curious is Roman and Greek God,</v>

643
00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:55.490
<v Speaker 1>we're curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spirit Mercurius is this thing.</v>

644
00:32:55.491 --> 00:32:58.160
<v Speaker 1>It's the messenger of the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the winged messenger of the gods.</v>

645
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.380
<v Speaker 1>It flits around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

646
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:03.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the curiosity pulls you forward to where</v>

647
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:05.660
<v Speaker 1>while to whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever it wants to take you.</v>

648
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a union idea as well.</v>

649
00:33:07.881 --> 00:33:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Is that your curiosity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is like the manifestation of yourself to</v>

650
00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:13.820
<v Speaker 1>the ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

651
00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:14.780
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

652
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:18.650
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing that you could be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future calling you forward.</v>

653
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very strange ideas.</v>

654
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

655
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 1>when you start to understand that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in control of what makes you</v>

656
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:31.340
<v Speaker 1>interested in things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole world shifts around on you.</v>

657
00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Because the question is if you're not in</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of that,</v>

658
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.110
<v Speaker 1>what the Hell is directing it?</v>

659
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.350
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not you.</v>

660
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not under your control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not random.</v>

661
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 1>It's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dynamic.</v>

662
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:49.130
<v Speaker 1>It has an orientation towards something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the union self or that's the</v>

663
00:33:49.131 --> 00:33:51.260
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

664
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.550
<v Speaker 1>very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you this already.</v>

665
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 1>See there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an old representation of very</v>

666
00:33:57.261 --> 00:33:59.480
<v Speaker 1>old representation of the snitch right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

667
00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Now this is old symbol a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got this dragon of chaos here.</v>

668
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.240
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like an octopus as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That twist and its tail refers to</v>

669
00:34:08.241 --> 00:34:11.360
<v Speaker 1>infinity dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost always have an infinite tail like</v>

670
00:34:11.361 --> 00:34:13.250
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got the claws of a bird,</v>

671
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:16.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe a bird of prey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body of an animal and the head of a</v>

672
00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:19.910
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then down here you see it's got the</v>

673
00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:22.490
<v Speaker 1>sun up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sort of aiming at upward towards</v>

674
00:34:22.491 --> 00:34:25.790
<v Speaker 1>the sudden this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then down here is this thing called</v>

675
00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:26.750
<v Speaker 1>the round chaos.</v>

676
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:29.840
<v Speaker 1>It's an old l chemical system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look that dragon is</v>

677
00:34:29.841 --> 00:34:33.140
<v Speaker 1>fertilizing this and that has potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

678
00:34:33.141 --> 00:34:35.780
<v Speaker 1>it's like an egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's full of potential.</v>

679
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.370
<v Speaker 1>And so it's matter and spirit at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

680
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:42.860
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

681
00:34:42.861 --> 00:34:46.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a representation of that which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're exploring because you could say,</v>

682
00:34:46.371 --> 00:34:48.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that you're exploring sort of</v>

683
00:34:48.201 --> 00:34:50.900
<v Speaker 1>a constructivist idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you explore something new,</v>

684
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.200
<v Speaker 1>what you generate from the exploration</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

685
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.320
<v Speaker 1>because as you explore it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learned things that changes you.</v>

686
00:34:57.321 --> 00:34:59.630
<v Speaker 1>So you generate psyche out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration,</v>

687
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.540
<v Speaker 1>that spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he also generate the world out of</v>

688
00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:04.130
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing to begin with,</v>

689
00:35:04.131 --> 00:35:08.090
<v Speaker 1>his psyche and world at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what this thing represents</v>

690
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's what Harry Potter is chasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes him a seeker.</v>

691
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Very strange ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to tell you a dream and it</v>

692
00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:19.580
<v Speaker 1>was a dream I had when I was working on</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas and I'm going to tell you</v>

693
00:35:19.581 --> 00:35:20.750
<v Speaker 1>the dream for two reasons.</v>

694
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.980
<v Speaker 1>One is because it bears directly on</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas and two because while we</v>

695
00:35:24.981 --> 00:35:29.120
<v Speaker 1>just covered psychoanalytic thought and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you how a dream can work</v>

696
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:32.120
<v Speaker 1>because it's not easy to find a dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can interpret in a way that's</v>

697
00:35:32.121 --> 00:35:36.020
<v Speaker 1>public that makes sense because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually so tightly defined contextually</v>

698
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:40.350
<v Speaker 1>you can them in the therapeutic context</v>
<v Speaker 1>context cause you know so much about the</v>

699
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:43.230
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to pull that out and make</v>

700
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 1>it meaningful outside of that context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this dream works.</v>

701
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was dreaming,</v>

702
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I was dreaming that there was a small</v>
<v Speaker 1>object,</v>

703
00:35:50.731 --> 00:35:54.150
<v Speaker 1>it was a circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sphere about this big and it was</v>

704
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:57.480
<v Speaker 1>floating on top of the Atlantic Ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>

705
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:01.530
<v Speaker 1>I had a kind of a bird's eye view of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was following it along like maybe,</v>

706
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a drone would follow behind an</v>

707
00:36:03.271 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 1>object and it was floating and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really zipping along,</v>

708
00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:06.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

709
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fast.</v>

710
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And then the scene shifted to a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>

711
00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:16.110
<v Speaker 1>They were sitting inside a room full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>television monitors and they were</v>

712
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:17.940
<v Speaker 1>watching this thing move across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>

713
00:36:17.941 --> 00:36:19.980
<v Speaker 1>And so it was here and then there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

714
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.530
<v Speaker 1>it had four hurricanes beside it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one here,</v>

715
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.450
<v Speaker 1>one here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one here and one here.</v>

716
00:36:24.451 --> 00:36:26.400
<v Speaker 1>So it was in the center of four</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurricanes.</v>

717
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.630
<v Speaker 1>So whatever it was was like some bloody</v>
<v Speaker 1>potent thing was zipping across the,</v>

718
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.460
<v Speaker 1>it was zipping across the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the scientists got a hold of it,</v>

719
00:36:35.461 --> 00:36:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I guess in the scene shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was in a museum,</v>

720
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:41.280
<v Speaker 1>like an old Victorian museum and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

721
00:36:41.281 --> 00:36:46.281
<v Speaker 1>this ball was now inside a wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine a would stand with a glass</v>

722
00:36:46.921 --> 00:36:49.890
<v Speaker 1>case on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was inside the glass case and it was</v>

723
00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:51.720
<v Speaker 1>floating and it was sort of pulsing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

724
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.350
<v Speaker 1>And so inside the room there was Stephen</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawking</v>

725
00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.350
<v Speaker 1>and the American president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who it was.</v>

726
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.060
<v Speaker 1>He was sort of faceless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Steven,</v>

727
00:37:03.061 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 1>I thought Stephen Hawking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

728
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Disembodied intellect that Stephen</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawking.</v>

729
00:37:08.501 --> 00:37:11.340
<v Speaker 1>So that's what that meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the president,</v>

730
00:37:11.341 --> 00:37:15.150
<v Speaker 1>well he's just dissemble of order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this thing,</v>

731
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.840
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was that was surrounded by</v>
<v Speaker 1>these winds had been placed into a</v>

732
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:20.060
<v Speaker 1>category system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

733
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:22.260
<v Speaker 1>It's in a museum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was boxed in.</v>

734
00:37:22.261 --> 00:37:25.950
<v Speaker 1>It had been conceptualized in</v>
<v Speaker 1>categorized partly by disembodied</v>

735
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Speaker 1>intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was Stephen Hawking and partly by</v>

736
00:37:28.321 --> 00:37:31.290
<v Speaker 1>social order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a bin Swinger boss thing</v>

737
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:33.900
<v Speaker 1>going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing pulses and is alive.</v>

738
00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:38.901
<v Speaker 1>So it's got its own power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also encapsulated in a category</v>

739
00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:41.730
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a third person observer in there.</v>

740
00:37:41.731 --> 00:37:43.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just seeing this.</v>

741
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 1>So that was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next thing that happened,</v>

742
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.660
<v Speaker 1>oh he has one of them described the</v>
<v Speaker 1>features of the room.</v>

743
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.870
<v Speaker 1>It's walls were seven feet thick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want this thing going</v>

744
00:37:51.871 --> 00:37:54.990
<v Speaker 1>anywhere and it was made out of titanium</v>
<v Speaker 1>dioxide.</v>

745
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.340
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is that?</v>

746
00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a paint,</v>

747
00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a paint substance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also what the hall of the</v>

748
00:38:00.181 --> 00:38:02.480
<v Speaker 1>starship enterprise is made out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

749
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.850
<v Speaker 1>so my dream was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the hardest substance there</v>

750
00:38:05.851 --> 00:38:07.980
<v Speaker 1>is as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's titanium dioxide.</v>

751
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:11.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not getting out of that box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The walls were designed to permanently</v>

752
00:38:11.971 --> 00:38:13.200
<v Speaker 1>constrain the object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

753
00:38:13.201 --> 00:38:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Now the next thing that happened was</v>
<v Speaker 1>this object was,</v>

754
00:38:15.451 --> 00:38:17.790
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell it was kind of alive and</v>

755
00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:20.490
<v Speaker 1>it kept shifting around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at one point it turned into a</v>

756
00:38:20.491 --> 00:38:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Chrysalis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cocoon.</v>

757
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.600
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell does that mean?</v>

758
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.660
<v Speaker 1>And then so it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned into a cocoon.</v>

759
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.510
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if you've seen it</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chrysalis when it's just about to hatch,</v>

760
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it twitches around day.</v>

761
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.840
<v Speaker 1>It's alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>

762
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.720
<v Speaker 1>So they're very strange things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end it turned itself</v>

763
00:38:37.721 --> 00:38:39.850
<v Speaker 1>into a pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a mirror show on pipe.</v>

764
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.710
<v Speaker 1>And I thought then it reformed itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do his fear and just shot right out</v>

765
00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:45.544
<v Speaker 1>of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

766
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:49.090
<v Speaker 1>like the walls weren't even there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just decided it was gone.</v>

767
00:38:49.091 --> 00:38:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was gone.</v>

768
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.720
<v Speaker 1>And I woke up and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

769
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:56.110
<v Speaker 1>What the hell does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took me forever to figure this out.</v>

770
00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.530
<v Speaker 1>So then about two years after</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing this dream,</v>

771
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I was reading Dante's inferno in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ninth Canto,</v>

772
00:39:02.981 --> 00:39:06.790
<v Speaker 1>a messenger from God appears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Dante goes down into hell.</v>

773
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:10.090
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dante is attempt to describe.</v>

774
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:13.780
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so imagine that you go to a bad</v>

775
00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:15.370
<v Speaker 1>place psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

776
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.550
<v Speaker 1>So your life has collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's terrible.</v>

777
00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.610
<v Speaker 1>But then you're trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you did wrong and how you're to</v>

778
00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:22.444
<v Speaker 1>blame for it.</v>

779
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:27.430
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do is a descent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a descent into your own foolishness and</v>

780
00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:29.950
<v Speaker 1>stupidity level by level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by level.</v>

781
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Dante was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain.</v>

782
00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:35.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what that hell was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Levels of catastrophe.</v>

783
00:39:35.441 --> 00:39:37.030
<v Speaker 1>And there's something right at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>

784
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And he found that it was betrayal that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was at the bottom.</v>

785
00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:44.650
<v Speaker 1>So in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading that and there's a line in</v>

786
00:39:44.651 --> 00:39:47.170
<v Speaker 1>there that made me remember the stream</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I tried to figure out the stream</v>

787
00:39:47.171 --> 00:39:48.010
<v Speaker 1>for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

788
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the ninth count to a messenger</v>
<v Speaker 1>from God appears in hell to open the</v>

789
00:39:52.361 --> 00:39:54.850
<v Speaker 1>gate of Disse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is barring the divinely ordained</v>

790
00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:58.270
<v Speaker 1>with a virtual in Dante.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The approach of this messenger,</v>

791
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.490
<v Speaker 1>an angel ms proceeded by a great storm</v>
<v Speaker 1>described in the following manner.</v>

792
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly they're broke on the dirty</v>
<v Speaker 1>swell of the dark marsh,</v>

793
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:11.260
<v Speaker 1>a squall of terrible sound that sent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremor through both shores of hell as</v>

794
00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:13.180
<v Speaker 1>sound as if to continence of air.</v>

795
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:18.190
<v Speaker 1>One frigid and one scorching clashed</v>
<v Speaker 1>head on in a war of wins that strips the</v>

796
00:40:18.191 --> 00:40:21.160
<v Speaker 1>forest bare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ripped off whole boughs and blew them</v>

797
00:40:21.161 --> 00:40:25.480
<v Speaker 1>helter skelter along the range of dust</v>
<v Speaker 1>it raised before making the beasts and</v>

798
00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:29.410
<v Speaker 1>shepherds run for shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was like a herald of the arrival</v>

799
00:40:29.411 --> 00:40:31.390
<v Speaker 1>of this messenger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very powerful scene.</v>

800
00:40:31.391 --> 00:40:34.180
<v Speaker 1>And I thought about this dream with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing with the four storms.</v>

801
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.800
<v Speaker 1>So the pipe thing that really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really,</v>

802
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:42.790
<v Speaker 1>that took me forever to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I find the remembered this painting</v>

803
00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:45.070
<v Speaker 1>by an agreed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a pipe,</v>

804
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

805
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means is the representation is</v>

806
00:40:54.031 --> 00:40:56.610
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is a very famous painting,</v>

807
00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The representation is not the thing.</v>

808
00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the perception is not the thing.</v>

809
00:41:03.151 --> 00:41:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the dream was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get at.</v>

810
00:41:04.831 --> 00:41:08.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that was so powerful and so</v>

811
00:41:08.851 --> 00:41:12.420
<v Speaker 1>capable of transforming could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>encapsulated temporarily within a</v>

812
00:41:12.421 --> 00:41:14.790
<v Speaker 1>conceptual system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But whenever it decided to leave,</v>

813
00:41:14.791 --> 00:41:19.440
<v Speaker 1>it was just going to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what it was referring to was the</v>

814
00:41:19.441 --> 00:41:23.070
<v Speaker 1>potential that there is inside objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

815
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:25.620
<v Speaker 1>and it's such a complicated thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain,</v>

816
00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.020
<v Speaker 1>nobody knew what cell phones were going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

817
00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.830
<v Speaker 1>You make the cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you know what it is,</v>

818
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:35.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knew what the birth control pill</v>

819
00:41:35.061 --> 00:41:36.860
<v Speaker 1>was going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make it,</v>

820
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:39.290
<v Speaker 1>you think you know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea what it is.</v>

821
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to do some of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it will do and it's going to</v>

822
00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:44.720
<v Speaker 1>do a bunch of things you have no idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

823
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's because the things are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex than they look.</v>

824
00:41:48.651 --> 00:41:52.220
<v Speaker 1>They're multidimensional and they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say a life exactly,</v>

825
00:41:52.221 --> 00:41:56.930
<v Speaker 1>but they have an intrinsic complexity</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tends to unfold across time and</v>

826
00:41:56.931 --> 00:42:00.440
<v Speaker 1>it's only somewhat predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have things under your</v>

827
00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:03.230
<v Speaker 1>control and in your grasp to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>limited degree,</v>

828
00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 1>but at any point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the switch and the Yin Yang</v>

829
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:07.400
<v Speaker 1>symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At any time,</v>

830
00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:11.240
<v Speaker 1>chaos can collapse into order or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>order can collapse into chaos.</v>

831
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:12.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's what that dream meant.</v>

832
00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Another painting by him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Greek trying to express the same</v>

833
00:42:17.651 --> 00:42:18.484
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

834
00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:20.560
<v Speaker 1>All men in suits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all uniform,</v>

835
00:42:20.561 --> 00:42:22.930
<v Speaker 1>all thinking the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same haircuts,</v>

836
00:42:22.931 --> 00:42:27.010
<v Speaker 1>completely socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blinded by their own perceptions.</v>

837
00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.590
<v Speaker 1>That's us because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

838
00:42:29.591 --> 00:42:32.440
<v Speaker 1>your perceptions aluminate and bring you</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

839
00:42:32.441 --> 00:42:36.670
<v Speaker 1>It's yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also constrain to equal degree.</v>

840
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:42.200
<v Speaker 1>I dreamed much later about a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a very cool image too.</v>

841
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:46.380
<v Speaker 1>You know that image that I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it Da Vinci or Michelangelo of the</v>

842
00:42:46.381 --> 00:42:48.770
<v Speaker 1>manned inscribed in the square?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inside the circle.</v>

843
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a very famous image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it was like that,</v>

844
00:42:51.141 --> 00:42:56.141
<v Speaker 1>except it was a cube but not a square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a kind of a faceless</v>

845
00:42:56.601 --> 00:42:58.700
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a mannequin inside this</v>

846
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:01.880
<v Speaker 1>cube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was suspended about two feet off</v>

847
00:43:01.881 --> 00:43:05.750
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the front wall it was like</v>

848
00:43:05.751 --> 00:43:08.210
<v Speaker 1>wallpaper designs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was these little squares about</v>

849
00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:11.900
<v Speaker 1>this big and they were Mandela's square</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a circle inside them.</v>

850
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.310
<v Speaker 1>And then inside the circle there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little snake tail that was out and the</v>

851
00:43:16.311 --> 00:43:19.730
<v Speaker 1>whole wall was covered with the snake</v>
<v Speaker 1>tails and the person,</v>

852
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.580
<v Speaker 1>when the person walked forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall would move forward.</v>

853
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:23.900
<v Speaker 1>And when he moved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked backwards,</v>

854
00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:27.740
<v Speaker 1>the wall would move backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always this far away and he could</v>

855
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.620
<v Speaker 1>reach out and pull any of those snakes</v>
<v Speaker 1>into being.</v>

856
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.680
<v Speaker 1>And so that was another dream of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same sort of idea.</v>

857
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 1>What do you have in front of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A world of objects?</v>

858
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:37.483
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

859
00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:42.880
<v Speaker 1>you have a world of potential in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you and you can interact with any</v>

860
00:43:42.881 --> 00:43:45.580
<v Speaker 1>aspect of that potential and while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing so,</v>

861
00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:46.620
<v Speaker 1>you realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

862
00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:50.050
<v Speaker 1>you pull something into being that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have been there before and what</v>

863
00:43:50.051 --> 00:43:53.050
<v Speaker 1>you see in front of you is a a wall of</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

864
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.110
<v Speaker 1>The potential is not infinite because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're constrained,</v>

865
00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

866
00:43:58.421 --> 00:44:01.030
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll do you just fine.</v>

867
00:44:01.031 --> 00:44:05.200
<v Speaker 1>It's more potential than you could ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>need and so the dream see dreams.</v>

868
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Dreams are at the forefront of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get there before you.</v>

869
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:16.430
<v Speaker 1>The creative imagination is at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forefront of thinking.</v>

870
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.010
<v Speaker 1>It's trying to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think that you're moving out into</v>

871
00:44:19.011 --> 00:44:22.670
<v Speaker 1>the unknown to gather new information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what gets there first is the</v>

872
00:44:22.671 --> 00:44:25.850
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's what Piaget said about</v>

873
00:44:25.851 --> 00:44:28.220
<v Speaker 1>children as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine at first,</v>

874
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you can represent it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech and dream is part of that</v>

875
00:44:32.071 --> 00:44:34.920
<v Speaker 1>imaginative process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what artists are doing.</v>

876
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:39.930
<v Speaker 1>They're take going out into the unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>and representing it imaginatively and</v>

877
00:44:39.931 --> 00:44:40.141
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

878
00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:42.480
<v Speaker 1>what does that painting mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While if the artists knew that,</v>

879
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:45.000
<v Speaker 1>he'd just write it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

880
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.440
<v Speaker 1>The art is beyond what's what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulable otherwise it's not art.</v>

881
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the artists and the dream,</v>

882
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:54.240
<v Speaker 1>they're out on the frontier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

883
00:44:54.241 --> 00:44:57.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the open imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're conceptualizing new</v>

884
00:44:57.631 --> 00:45:00.150
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dream in the imagination can bring</v>

885
00:45:00.151 --> 00:45:02.700
<v Speaker 1>you places that you don't even know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go.</v>

886
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:04.590
<v Speaker 1>And it's a mystery too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

887
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I figured this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

888
00:45:06.481 --> 00:45:10.560
<v Speaker 1>It was as if the figuring out manifested</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself inside me because that's the</v>

889
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:11.820
<v Speaker 1>experience in a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

890
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:14.670
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dreamed this up.</v>

891
00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:18.840
<v Speaker 1>You feel I had a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did that come from?</v>

892
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Springs out of the unknown and offer</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to you.</v>

893
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Man's option to respond to this claim or</v>
<v Speaker 1>to choose not to do seems to be the very</v>

894
00:45:30.151 --> 00:45:34.200
<v Speaker 1>core of human freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's pathology has conceptualized by</v>

895
00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:37.950
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting way of thinking</v>

896
00:45:37.951 --> 00:45:40.740
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Existential guilt and fear as debt to</v>

897
00:45:40.741 --> 00:45:42.330
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

898
00:45:42.331 --> 00:45:45.210
<v Speaker 1>so there's this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an existential idea that you</v>

899
00:45:45.211 --> 00:45:48.600
<v Speaker 1>have some problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have some problems in your</v>

900
00:45:48.601 --> 00:45:49.434
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

901
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:54.090
<v Speaker 1>the part of the design is the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that you have to address</v>

902
00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:56.760
<v Speaker 1>those problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part and parcel of the way that</v>

903
00:45:56.761 --> 00:45:58.590
<v Speaker 1>human beings manifest themselves in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

904
00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:01.890
<v Speaker 1>So part of your pathology would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure to bear,</v>

905
00:46:01.891 --> 00:46:05.370
<v Speaker 1>the responsibility for your being and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sense that you have a debt to</v>

906
00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and according to the phenomenologists</v>

907
00:46:07.861 --> 00:46:11.280
<v Speaker 1>that's built right into the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being failure to shoulder</v>

908
00:46:11.281 --> 00:46:13.770
<v Speaker 1>existential burden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>results in neurotic,</v>

909
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:17.010
<v Speaker 1>guilt and fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a remarkable conceptualization,</v>

910
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 1>unpaid debt to existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clean up your room.</v>

911
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.081
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

912
00:46:22.081 --> 00:46:24.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a good place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

913
00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
