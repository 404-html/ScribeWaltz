00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.360
<v Speaker 1>So here's a brief note to tomorrow's </v>
<v Speaker 1>student demonstrators.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.493
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a demonstration plan for </v>

3
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call it a rally and teaching,</v>

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Sydney Smith Hall,</v>

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>that's 100 St George Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto,</v>

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>479 people are interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred and 32 people are going in.</v>

7
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>1,100 people have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have had this missive shared with them.</v>

8
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>And so this is the call to action </v>
<v Speaker 1>released by people who are planning the,</v>

9
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rally.</v>

10
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>And I'm addressing that for a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

11
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm only going to,</v>

12
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stick to one very briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who are putting out this call</v>

13
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>to action say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have said the following,</v>

14
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:44.574
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto professor and </v>

15
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:47.034
<v Speaker 1>practicing psychologist has released the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of a plan three part video series </v>

16
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 1>of attacking political correctness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>academia.</v>

17
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>And this video he declares this proud </v>
<v Speaker 1>unwillingness to call transgender people</v>

18
00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>by any pronouns he does not believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>apply to them.</v>

19
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.623
<v Speaker 1>His disbelief in the very existence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>non binary people and his belief that </v>

20
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:06.370
<v Speaker 1>any attempts to challenge him or anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else on these points,</v>

21
00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>amount to Marxist fash fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:09.984
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I would say is that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not regard any of those three </v>

23
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>statements about what I said as accurate</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of what I said,</v>

24
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.903
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have time at the moment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do a detailed refutation of them point </v>

25
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:21.894
<v Speaker 1>by point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to have to make this very </v>

26
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:23.844
<v Speaker 1>straightforward and simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't disbelieve in the existence of </v>

27
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>non binary people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:31.254
<v Speaker 1>Do you want me to say that again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously people who don't fit into </v>

29
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>standard binary categories of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

30
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.253
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however you decide to construe that </v>

31
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>broadly or narrowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously those people exist.</v>

32
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.003
<v Speaker 1>I never said they didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I said instead was that biological </v>

33
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity and gender expression do</v>

34
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>not vary independently and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>vary independently.</v>

35
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.653
<v Speaker 1>And we'll just leave it at that for now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't have enough time to go </v>

36
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>into the rest of it all the way will in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

37
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:03.114
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going out tomorrow to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstration because you want to </v>

38
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.653
<v Speaker 1>indicate your discomfort with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>disbelief in the very existence of non </v>

39
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>binary people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well just stay home.</v>
