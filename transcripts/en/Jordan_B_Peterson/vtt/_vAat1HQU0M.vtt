00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.163
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to you today about a </v>

2
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:10.161
<v Speaker 1>book that I'm publishing in January of </v>
<v Speaker 1>2018 it's called 12 rules for life,</v>

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>an antidote to chaos and it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be published by Penguin Random House.</v>

4
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.063
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you how it came about </v>
<v Speaker 1>first and then I'll describe the book's </v>

5
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>contents and then I'm going to read you </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of it.</v>

6
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.383
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2012 I did a Canadian Broadcasting </v>

7
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Corporation program called say no to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

8
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.753
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that program I critique the idea </v>

9
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>that happiness was the proper goal of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

10
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>claiming it's dead,</v>

11
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.530
<v Speaker 1>that it's much more useful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective,</v>

12
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.723
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even for producing happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look for meaning and responsibility </v>

13
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

14
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I received the following email as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence.</v>

15
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.423
<v Speaker 1>Dear Dr. Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your comments on the CBC program say no </v>

16
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:07.104
<v Speaker 1>to happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're both thought provoking and </v>

17
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:09.264
<v Speaker 1>challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had me asking bigger questions and </v>

18
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 1>that has always tremendously appealing.</v>

19
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.083
<v Speaker 1>To be perfectly honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some aspects were harder for me to </v>

20
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>understand that others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was left wanting to know more.</v>

21
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.743
<v Speaker 1>Have you considered writing a book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a general rather than academic </v>

22
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>reader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a literary agent and Co owner at the</v>

23
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.473
<v Speaker 1>Cook Agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have experienced with academics </v>

24
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>interested in writing for a broad </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>

25
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.613
<v Speaker 1>working with them to remove the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scaffolding that required an academic </v>

26
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>writing and helping to make their work </v>
<v Speaker 1>more accessible.</v>

27
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>We specialize in selling authors to </v>
<v Speaker 1>international markets and developing the</v>

28
00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:45.474
<v Speaker 1>writing careers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find out more about us at www </v>

29
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>dot cooke agency dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ca.</v>

30
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 1>I look forward to hearing from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sally harding.</v>

31
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 1>So a literary agent represents an author</v>
<v Speaker 1>and attempts to market their books.</v>

32
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>And so there they can be extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful people and in return for that,</v>

33
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:07.554
<v Speaker 1>they get a percentage of the book's </v>
<v Speaker 1>profits and that's how they make their </v>

34
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

35
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.813
<v Speaker 1>So it's a difficult job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially now because the market for </v>

36
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:19.701
<v Speaker 1>books is while very complicated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly restricted,</v>

37
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I would say to a few extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful authors.</v>

38
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.293
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sally got Ahold of me and I had thought </v>

39
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:28.284
<v Speaker 1>about for a long time about writing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more popular version of my first book </v>

40
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:33.534
<v Speaker 1>called maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually produced almost a </v>

41
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>complete manuscript.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

42
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.023
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it a,</v>

44
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>a simplified version or I wouldn't say </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplified exactly more.</v>

45
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Well I tried to make it more accessible </v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't,</v>

46
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>it was never really happy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really felt that it,</v>

47
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>that it got its legs underneath the tie </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose.</v>

48
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.293
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's because I was </v>

49
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>duplicating something that I'd already </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

50
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.093
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking very hard about what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do about this and how I might approach </v>

51
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:03.994
<v Speaker 1>it because sally was interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it might be a good thing to </v>

52
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>try to write a book for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a more general audience.</v>

53
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.723
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked for awhile and we discussed a </v>

54
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:21.540
<v Speaker 1>few ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was back in 2012 and uh,</v>

55
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned to her that I had written </v>
<v Speaker 1>something for quora,</v>

56
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.803
<v Speaker 1>which is an</v>

57
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.930
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.033
<v Speaker 1>website obviously where anybody can post</v>
<v Speaker 1>any question and anyone can answer it </v>

59
00:03:34.411 --> 00:03:39.411
<v Speaker 1>and then the questions are voted on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a chorus quite interesting I would say.</v>

60
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.943
<v Speaker 1>And I had written a variety of out just </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I was playing around with it and </v>

61
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.953
<v Speaker 1>some of them as it always is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tracked it much more attention than </v>

62
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:50.490
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.383
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

64
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.110
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

65
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.943
<v Speaker 1>somebody posted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a young guy posted this </v>

66
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:55.734
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the most valuable things </v>

67
00:03:56.941 --> 00:04:00.510
<v Speaker 1>everyone should know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I answered it.</v>

68
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.433
<v Speaker 1>I listed as it was 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>42 rules to live by and some of them </v>

69
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:06.294
<v Speaker 1>were kind of amusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought some of them were dead </v>

70
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.840
<v Speaker 1>serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>

71
00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:14.841
<v Speaker 1>it became very popular on Quora and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>of now it has 174,000 views and 2,500 up</v>

72
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.124
<v Speaker 1>votes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes it one of chorus most pop </v>

73
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.100
<v Speaker 1>popular answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's,</v>

74
00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:25.620
<v Speaker 1>it was soon after I posted it and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

75
00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:26.454
<v Speaker 1>well people really like those rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was something about them that </v>

76
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:31.134
<v Speaker 1>appealed to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what if I write a book based on the </v>

77
00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Speaker 1>rules?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll read you the rules.</v>

78
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you'll find them interesting.</v>

79
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not do things that you hate.</v>

80
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

81
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.493
<v Speaker 1>Which I think is a variant of telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth because you have to act out </v>

82
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>the truth as well as telling it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act so that you can tell the truth about</v>

83
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>how you act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's obviously related to the first to</v>

84
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>pursue what is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what is expedient.</v>

85
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.613
<v Speaker 1>If you have to choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the one who does things instead of </v>

86
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>the one who is seen to do things.</v>

87
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

88
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.713
<v Speaker 1>Pay Attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume that the person you are </v>

89
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>listening to might know something you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to know.</v>

90
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Listen to them hard enough so that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will share it with you.</v>

91
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Plan and work diligently to maintain the</v>
<v Speaker 1>romance in your relationships.</v>

92
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

93
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Be careful who you share good news with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be careful who you share bad news with.</v>

94
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Make at least one thing better every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single place you go.</v>

95
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

96
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Imagine who you could be and then aimed </v>
<v Speaker 1>singlemindedly at that.</v>

97
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Do not allow yourself to become arrogant</v>
<v Speaker 1>or resentful.</v>

98
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

99
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Try to make one room in your house is </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful as possible.</v>

100
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

101
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Compare yourself to who you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>

102
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.103
<v Speaker 1>not to who someone else's today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Work as hard as you possibly can on at </v>

103
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:05.891
<v Speaker 1>least one thing and see what happens if </v>
<v Speaker 1>old memories still make you cry,</v>

104
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.640
<v Speaker 1>right them down carefully and completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain your connections with people.</v>

105
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Do not carelessly denigrate social </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions are artistic achievement.</v>

106
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

107
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Treat yourself as if you were someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are responsible for helping.</v>

108
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.573
<v Speaker 1>Ask someone to do you a small favor so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he or she can ask you to do one in </v>

109
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:30.074
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make friends with people who want the </v>

110
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:33.794
<v Speaker 1>best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not try to rescue someone who does </v>

111
00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:42.450
<v Speaker 1>not want to be rescued and be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful about rescuing someone who does</v>

112
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well done is insignificant.</v>

113
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

114
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Set your house in perfect order before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you criticize the world.</v>

115
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Dress like the person you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Precise in your speech.</v>

116
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Stand up straight with your shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

117
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

118
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.463
<v Speaker 1>Don't avoid something frightening if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>stands in your way and don't do </v>

119
00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 1>unnecessarily dangerous things.</v>

120
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.110
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

121
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how to let your children do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that makes you dislike them?</v>

122
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Do not transform your wife into a maid.</v>

123
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

124
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Do not hide unwanted things in the fog.</v>

125
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

126
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Notice that opportunity lurks where </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility has been abdicated.</v>

127
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

128
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Read something written by someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

129
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Pet a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you encounter what on the street.</v>

130
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Don't bother children when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>skateboarding.</v>

131
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

132
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't let bullies get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write a letter.</v>

133
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.063
<v Speaker 1>The government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you see something that needs fixing </v>

134
00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.763
<v Speaker 1>and propose a solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that what you do not yet know </v>

135
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.133
<v Speaker 1>is more important than what you already </v>
<v Speaker 1>know and be grateful in spite of your </v>

136
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:12.921
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those were the 40 odd rules and uh,</v>

137
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.360
<v Speaker 1>people were pretty happy with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then something odd happened.</v>

138
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:19.194
<v Speaker 1>So a friend of mine as a novelist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gregg Hurwitz and Greg wrote a book </v>

139
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:25.990
<v Speaker 1>that's become very popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

140
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>called orphan x.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the characters in that book,</v>

141
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:29.754
<v Speaker 1>the female lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say off and on again wrote </v>

142
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.520
<v Speaker 1>romance interest for the main character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>posted these rules on her fridge.</v>

143
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.890
<v Speaker 1>And so they were peppered throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

144
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>So that was kind of an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

145
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then because they were so popular on</v>

146
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Quora,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk to sally about the possibility of</v>

147
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.320
<v Speaker 1>turning them into a book.</v>

148
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And so my original vision was to write </v>
<v Speaker 1>42 short essays.</v>

149
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.743
<v Speaker 1>I thought that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to call the book 42 which I </v>

150
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 1>thought was quite funny because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the answer to life,</v>

151
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:09.771
<v Speaker 1>the universe and everything from Douglas</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adams was 42 a computer calculated that.</v>

152
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:14.160
<v Speaker 1>So I thought it would be amusing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write a book called 42 that,</v>

153
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contained answers to life,</v>

154
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:19.620
<v Speaker 1>the universe and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I started writing the book,</v>

155
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.483
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned out that I had more to say </v>

156
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:27.210
<v Speaker 1>about each of the rules than I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally envisioned.</v>

157
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.450
<v Speaker 1>And so I first cut it down to 25 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote some essays and then I cut it down</v>

158
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:37.080
<v Speaker 1>to 16 and it was still too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I cut it down to 12,</v>

159
00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 1>which turned out to be a good thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways because if you write a book,</v>

160
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.943
<v Speaker 1>you should write way more than you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to publish and then cut because </v>

161
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 1>that way you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're only left with what's best.</v>

162
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.700
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote for about three years.</v>

163
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.581
<v Speaker 1>While,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

164
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:56.880
<v Speaker 1>it's more than that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's almost five years because I</v>

165
00:10:56.881 --> 00:10:57.714
<v Speaker 1>just finished the book in September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it took about four or five years to </v>

166
00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:02.604
<v Speaker 1>write and I was riding pretty regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm going to do is read to you a </v>

167
00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:09.450
<v Speaker 1>little bit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the book here</v>

168
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.173
<v Speaker 1>that's a galley copy and a galley copy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a preprint of a book so that you can </v>

169
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.390
<v Speaker 1>get some sense of what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got some nice illustrations in it,</v>

170
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I think by this comic book author named </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethan Van Scriber.</v>

171
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of a rough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

172
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.043
<v Speaker 1>on the chapter three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat yourself like someone you are </v>

173
00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:37.590
<v Speaker 1>responsible for helping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethan is a comic book artist.</v>

174
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:38.453
<v Speaker 1>He's done a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a great illustrator and he put my </v>

175
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>kids in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each one of my kids.</v>

176
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 1>I have two kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them in each illustration sort of</v>

177
00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:51.750
<v Speaker 1>contemplating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the complexities of life,</v>

178
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's how you might describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

179
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 1>So that's one illustration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you another one.</v>

180
00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.253
<v Speaker 1>So that's my son Julian there looking up</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the great statue of David and that's </v>

181
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:06.640
<v Speaker 1>part and the David of course is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspirational statue.</v>

182
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:07.474
<v Speaker 1>It's a representation of what you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be and that's real three make friends </v>

183
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>with people who want the best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I'm going to read that,</v>

184
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.040
<v Speaker 1>some of that to you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The each chapter,</v>

185
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.870
<v Speaker 1>each rule is divided into subsections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small sub chapters let's say.</v>

186
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:25.290
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll read you one of those.</v>

187
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 1>You'll get some sense of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rule three,</v>

188
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.470
<v Speaker 1>make friends with people who want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best for you.</v>

189
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.373
<v Speaker 1>The old hometown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the town I grew up in had been scraped </v>

190
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:42.610
<v Speaker 1>only 50 years earlier out of the endless</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat northern prairie.</v>

191
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Fairview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alberta was part of the frontier and had</v>

192
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:47.974
<v Speaker 1>the cowboy bars to prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Hudson's Bay company department </v>

193
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:54.400
<v Speaker 1>store on Main Street still bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>beaver,</v>

194
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:57.490
<v Speaker 1>wolf and coyote first directly from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>local troppers.</v>

195
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:03.090
<v Speaker 1>3000 people lived there 400 miles away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the nearest city cable TV,</v>

196
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.960
<v Speaker 1>video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Internet did not exist.</v>

197
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.760
<v Speaker 1>It was no easy matter to stay innocently</v>
<v Speaker 1>amused at fairview,</v>

198
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.103
<v Speaker 1>particularly during the five months of </v>
<v Speaker 1>winter when long stretches of 40 below </v>

199
00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:20.680
<v Speaker 1>days and even colder nights where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>norm,</v>

200
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 1>the world's a different place when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold like that.</v>

201
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.960
<v Speaker 1>The drugs in our town ended their sad </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives early.</v>

202
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.333
<v Speaker 1>They passed out in snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Banks at three in the morning froze to </v>

203
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:33.874
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't go outside casually when it's </v>

204
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:37.054
<v Speaker 1>40 below on first breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arid desert air constricts your </v>

205
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:46.540
<v Speaker 1>lungs ice forms on your eyelashes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they stick together.</v>

206
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.213
<v Speaker 1>Long hair wet from the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freezes solid and then stands on and </v>

207
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>wraith like of its own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later in a warm house when it thaws bone</v>

208
00:13:57.131 --> 00:14:02.131
<v Speaker 1>dry charged with electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children only put their tongues on steel</v>

209
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:03.694
<v Speaker 1>playground equipment once</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoked from house chimneys doesn't rise </v>

210
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.143
<v Speaker 1>defeated by the cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It drifts downwards and collects like </v>

211
00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:18.271
<v Speaker 1>fog on snow covered rooftops in yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cars must be plugged in at night.</v>

212
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.463
<v Speaker 1>Their engines warmed by block heaters or</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil will not flow through them in the </v>

213
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:29.281
<v Speaker 1>morning and they won't start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they won't anyways.</v>

214
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:30.933
<v Speaker 1>Then you turn the engine over </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointlessly until the starter clatters </v>

215
00:14:33.491 --> 00:14:34.324
<v Speaker 1>and fall silent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you remove the frozen battery from </v>

216
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:42.541
<v Speaker 1>the car loosening bolts with stiffening </v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers in the intense cold and bring it</v>

217
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:43.504
<v Speaker 1>into the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sits there sweating for hours until </v>

218
00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:48.214
<v Speaker 1>it warms enough to hold a decent charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to see out of the back </v>

219
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:54.260
<v Speaker 1>window of your car either.</v>

220
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:59.570
<v Speaker 1>It silver in November and stays that way</v>
<v Speaker 1>until may scraping it off,</v>

221
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:03.530
<v Speaker 1>just dampens the upholstery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that freezes too</v>

222
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.400
<v Speaker 1>late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One night going to visit a friend,</v>

223
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.263
<v Speaker 1>I sat for two hours on the edge of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>passenger seat in a 1970 dodge </v>

224
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:13.094
<v Speaker 1>challenger jammed up against the stick </v>
<v Speaker 1>shift using a vodka soaked rag to keep </v>

225
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:19.094
<v Speaker 1>the inside of the front windshield clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of the driver because the car </v>

226
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 1>heater had quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stopping wasn't an option.</v>

227
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 1>There was nowhere to stop and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell on house cats,</v>

228
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.203
<v Speaker 1>felines and fairview had short ears and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tails because they had lost the tips of </v>

229
00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:40.370
<v Speaker 1>both to frostbite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came to resemble Arctic foxes,</v>

230
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:45.400
<v Speaker 1>which evolved those features to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>proactively with the intense cold.</v>

231
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.580
<v Speaker 1>One day our cat got outside and no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed.</v>

232
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.420
<v Speaker 1>We found him later for frozen fast to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cold,</v>

233
00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:54.680
<v Speaker 1>hard concrete.</v>

234
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.430
<v Speaker 1>It's no lasting damage except to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>pride.</v>

235
00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.833
<v Speaker 1>Fairview cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're also at great risk in the winter </v>

236
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.270
<v Speaker 1>from cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not for the reasons you think.</v>

237
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.680
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't automobile sliding on icy </v>
<v Speaker 1>roads and running them over.</v>

238
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:10.603
<v Speaker 1>Only loser cats died that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was cars parked immediately after </v>

239
00:16:15.081 --> 00:16:15.914
<v Speaker 1>being driven that were dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A frigid cat might think highly of </v>

240
00:16:19.221 --> 00:16:22.160
<v Speaker 1>climbing up under such a vehicle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting on.</v>

241
00:16:22.161 --> 00:16:22.994
<v Speaker 1>It's still warm engine block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if the driver decided to use </v>

242
00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:31.640
<v Speaker 1>the car again before the engine cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and the cat departed?</v>

243
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.463
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say that heat seeking house </v>
<v Speaker 1>pets and rapidly rotating radiator fans </v>

244
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.833
<v Speaker 1>do not coexist happily</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we were so far north that </v>

245
00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:47.990
<v Speaker 1>bitterly cold winters were very dark by </v>
<v Speaker 1>December.</v>

246
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:53.110
<v Speaker 1>The son didn't rise until 10:00 AM we </v>
<v Speaker 1>trudge to school in the pitch black.</v>

247
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.590
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't much lighter when we walked </v>
<v Speaker 1>home just before the early sunset.</v>

248
00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.790
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't much for young people to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fairview even in the summer.</v>

249
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:07.450
<v Speaker 1>But the winters were worse than your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends mattered more than anything.</v>

250
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's a little section of 12 rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>for life.</v>

251
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:16.820
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you what the rules are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A foreword was written by Norman Doidge.</v>

252
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.923
<v Speaker 1>He comments a little bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political turmoil that surrounded me </v>

253
00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:22.244
<v Speaker 1>over the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the book itself is very </v>

254
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:28.670
<v Speaker 1>apolitical with the exception of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chapter on Skateboarding,</v>

255
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I go into the battle,</v>

256
00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:32.834
<v Speaker 1>the ongoing polarizing battle between I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say the radical left and everyone </v>

257
00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:37.304
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

258
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:41.090
<v Speaker 1>but other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a political book.</v>

259
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.440
<v Speaker 1>So the table of contents include rule </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

260
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.080
<v Speaker 1>stand up straight with your shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

261
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a bit of a story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>centers on lobsters to a large degree.</v>

262
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

263
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:54.804
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what proclivity for talking about </v>

264
00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:02.451
<v Speaker 1>lobsters rule to treat yourself like </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone you are responsible for helping.</v>

265
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.170
<v Speaker 1>That's something that people don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well because they're not very happy</v>

266
00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:08.370
<v Speaker 1>with themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often.</v>

267
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.013
<v Speaker 1>Rule three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make friends with people who want the </v>

268
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 1>best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the chapter I already read that.</v>

269
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.613
<v Speaker 1>I read the first part of that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about trying to organize your life so </v>

270
00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:22.614
<v Speaker 1>that you're surrounded by people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>support you when you're trying to do </v>

271
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:27.234
<v Speaker 1>what's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important rule for compare </v>

272
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:31.944
<v Speaker 1>yourself to who you were yesterday and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not too who someone else is today have </v>

273
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.030
<v Speaker 1>because if you're comparing yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else,</v>

274
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:40.283
<v Speaker 1>I mean first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know very much about the life </v>

275
00:18:42.691 --> 00:18:44.490
<v Speaker 1>of the person you're comparing yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

276
00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:48.600
<v Speaker 1>You don't know and it it no what across </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of its dimensions and second,</v>

277
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.960
<v Speaker 1>people are very different and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparing yourself to someone else,</v>

278
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.110
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of useful I guess when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

279
00:18:55.111 --> 00:18:57.990
<v Speaker 1>but as you get older and more singular </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more particular,</v>

280
00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:01.140
<v Speaker 1>it becomes increasingly less useful.</v>

281
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.453
<v Speaker 1>Better to compare yourself to a previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of yourself and work for </v>

282
00:19:05.191 --> 00:19:09.450
<v Speaker 1>improvement in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rule Five,</v>

283
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.900
<v Speaker 1>do not let your children do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes you dislike them.</v>

284
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 1>That's probably going to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial chapter.</v>

285
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:20.841
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a chapter about discipline and love</v>

286
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.990
<v Speaker 1>and respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's probably right.</v>

287
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Rural six set your house in perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>order before you criticize the world.</v>

288
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a rough chapter,</v>

289
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:33.480
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

290
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to explain the mindset behind</v>

291
00:19:37.381 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 1>people like the columbine high school </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooters,</v>

292
00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:44.250
<v Speaker 1>and so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a harsh chapter.</v>

293
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.533
<v Speaker 1>Rule seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue what is meaningful and not what </v>

294
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:48.744
<v Speaker 1>is expedient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Expedient is what works in the short </v>

295
00:19:51.511 --> 00:19:54.030
<v Speaker 1>term expedience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's easy,</v>

296
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.710
<v Speaker 1>meaningful instead is what sustains you </v>
<v Speaker 1>through tragedy.</v>

297
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's say rule eight tell the truth or </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least don't lie.</v>

298
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

299
00:20:05.701 --> 00:20:09.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to tell the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>because who knows about the truth,</v>

300
00:20:09.031 --> 00:20:12.930
<v Speaker 1>but you can learn not to say things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know to be false.</v>

301
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.200
<v Speaker 1>And if you stop saying things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know to be false,</v>

302
00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:17.034
<v Speaker 1>then your life will improve the lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's simplifies it and it puts you into </v>

303
00:20:20.571 --> 00:20:21.404
<v Speaker 1>alignment with reality and you should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in alignment with reality because </v>

304
00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:26.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more of it than there is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>

305
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.583
<v Speaker 1>Rule nine assume that the person you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to might know something you </v>

306
00:20:32.821 --> 00:20:35.610
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one because,</v>

307
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:36.743
<v Speaker 1>and this is even true when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with people that don't like you </v>

308
00:20:39.061 --> 00:20:43.140
<v Speaker 1>because they may offer you criticisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are valid.</v>

309
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many that aren't too of course,</v>

310
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 1>because maybe they're just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take you down a bit.</v>

311
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:52.890
<v Speaker 1>But if you get a criticism that is valid</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can fix that error,</v>

312
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:54.094
<v Speaker 1>let's say that'll stop you from running </v>
<v Speaker 1>nose first into walls and that's </v>

313
00:20:57.731 --> 00:21:02.731
<v Speaker 1>generally a handy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rule 10 be precise in your speech.</v>

314
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you have to be exacting in the way </v>

315
00:21:06.491 --> 00:21:07.324
<v Speaker 1>that you described things and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you think because otherwise you </v>

316
00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:10.774
<v Speaker 1>live in the fog and you won't get what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should out of life or what you need </v>

317
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:18.760
<v Speaker 1>out of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by need I mean what will sustain you</v>

318
00:21:18.761 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 1>so that you don't become bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful.</v>

319
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Rule 11 do not bother children when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're skateboarding.</v>

320
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.873
<v Speaker 1>So that chapter's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say our society's hyper </v>

321
00:21:31.901 --> 00:21:32.734
<v Speaker 1>concerned with safety and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental antagonism to exploratory </v>

322
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.130
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially among boys.</v>

323
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Rural 12 pet a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you encounter one on the street.</v>

324
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's about trying to orient </v>

325
00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:50.674
<v Speaker 1>yourself towards life so that even when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the middle of a crisis or a </v>

326
00:21:54.311 --> 00:21:55.144
<v Speaker 1>tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find bits and pieces of </v>

327
00:21:58.841 --> 00:21:59.674
<v Speaker 1>experience that are positive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustaining so that you can stay </v>

328
00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:10.180
<v Speaker 1>positively oriented towards your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence and towards existence itself.</v>

329
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.350
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the book</v>

330
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 1>and it's coming out January 23rd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

331
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:20.643
<v Speaker 1>although it's available for </v>
<v Speaker 1>preorder@amazon.com or amazon.ca and </v>

332
00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.540
<v Speaker 1>several other places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put links in the,</v>

333
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:29.763
<v Speaker 1>in the video description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to figure out how to </v>

334
00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Orient Yourself in the midst of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos that constitutes life,</v>

335
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.733
<v Speaker 1>then you might find some of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wrote in 12 rules for life </v>

336
00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:43.354
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I hope that that was interesting and </v>

337
00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:48.910
<v Speaker 1>a good bye for now.</v>
