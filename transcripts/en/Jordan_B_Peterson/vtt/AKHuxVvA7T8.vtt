1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.333
<v Speaker 1>So back in February,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I received the following letter from a </v>

2
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:10.740
<v Speaker 1>student at Linfield college and </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to its website</v>

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>with campuses in Mcminnville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portland,</v>

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.653
<v Speaker 1>and a prestigious online program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Linfield college is a premier choice in </v>

5
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:23.160
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific northwest for a high quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional liberal arts education.</v>

6
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.583
<v Speaker 1>Want to learn more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact us for details about her degree </v>

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.420
<v Speaker 1>and certificate program offerings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A student there who I won't name</v>

8
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>sent me the followup letter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dear Dr Peterson.</v>

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm an undergraduate student and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Linfield college in Mcminnville,</v>

10
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:41.964
<v Speaker 1>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The international students for Liberty </v>

11
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.473
<v Speaker 1>Conference recently granted me a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>sum to organize pro liberty events on </v>

12
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>campus with an emphasis on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of free speech.</v>

13
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.873
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing to ask you if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting speaking invitations at this </v>

14
00:00:56.641 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>time and if you're scheduled sometime </v>
<v Speaker 1>between now and may,</v>

15
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>would allow it to help narrow down my </v>
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>

16
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.903
<v Speaker 1>I would like to offer you $1,500 and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>invitation to speak here this spring </v>

17
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>semester.</v>

18
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Your travel and accommodation costs will</v>
<v Speaker 1>also be covered.</v>

19
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I perceived Linfield as an institution </v>
<v Speaker 1>at an ideological crossroads.</v>

20
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.403
<v Speaker 1>I feel it is my responsibility to pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most effective voice possible for </v>

21
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:23.724
<v Speaker 1>helping linfield chart a course that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will ensure its future as a place of </v>

22
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>reason and academic integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After listening to many of your lectures</v>

23
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:31.824
<v Speaker 1>and interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe your message is ideal for our </v>

24
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:34.584
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honest and productive argumentation is </v>

25
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:38.184
<v Speaker 1>one of your specialties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Linfield would greatly benefit from </v>

26
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>being introduced to your ideas on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

27
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>We're a small college of roughly 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>students situated in quiet wine country.</v>

28
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.183
<v Speaker 1>Your work continues to have a deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on my personal and intellectual </v>

29
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be honored to hear from you.</v>

30
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for your time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>

31
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.203
<v Speaker 1>So after considering it for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agreed to come and speak at Linfield </v>

32
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>College.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On March 18th,</v>

33
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I received a note from an invitation </v>
<v Speaker 1>student,</v>

34
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>the inviting students who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good morning Dr Peterson.</v>

35
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I would be overjoyed to confirm a date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we went about doing that</v>

36
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>on April seventh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He replied to me again to update me.</v>

37
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>He said the talk will be held in Ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>Auditorium in Melrose Halt April 24th,</v>

38
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.653
<v Speaker 1>beginning at 7:00 PM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm referring to the events simply as a </v>

39
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.064
<v Speaker 1>talk with Jordan Peterson because his </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking style allows for a lot of </v>

40
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>fluidity in topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

41
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>the core theme to the event is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of freedom of speech,</v>

42
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.070
<v Speaker 1>especially in higher education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the administration slash student</v>

43
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>government have began to fret about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for people to feel open,</v>

44
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>offended,</v>

45
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>and oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Close quote by Peterson's talk.</v>

46
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>It's more pushback than I expected at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Linfield.</v>

47
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a cause for concern.</v>

48
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.463
<v Speaker 1>I'm fighting hard to keep their worries </v>
<v Speaker 1>at bay and there's a very supportive </v>

49
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>group of students and community members </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have my back free speech.</v>

50
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.543
<v Speaker 1>We'll win on April 17th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The following article appeared in </v>

51
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>student newspaper</v>

52
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Kenny Neal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>editor in chief.</v>

53
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It's called hate symbol on ball riles </v>
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>

54
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.170
<v Speaker 1>The linfield young Americans for liberty</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>

55
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.680
<v Speaker 1>free speech ball outside of Walker Hall </v>
<v Speaker 1>on April Twelfth,</v>

56
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:34.783
<v Speaker 1>received attention from students and </v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty when a student drew pepe the </v>

57
00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:37.964
<v Speaker 1>frog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has recently been appropriated by </v>

58
00:03:39.561 --> 00:03:40.394
<v Speaker 1>white supremacist groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Linfield college posted the picture of </v>

59
00:03:43.551 --> 00:03:44.384
<v Speaker 1>the ball when it's instagram account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was later removed because of the </v>

60
00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:47.564
<v Speaker 1>frogs association with alt right groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as it was pointed out that the </v>

61
00:03:51.111 --> 00:03:54.290
<v Speaker 1>photo included the image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the instagram post was removed.</v>

62
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.760
<v Speaker 1>President Thomas Heli set the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech ball event.</v>

63
00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.773
<v Speaker 1>The first event in this freely at series</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Linfield encouraged students to </v>

64
00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:04.304
<v Speaker 1>express themselves by writing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing on the ball to promote free </v>

65
00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:10.220
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pepe the frog is a popular Internet meme</v>

66
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.353
<v Speaker 1>that is often appeared in humorous ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Anti Defamation League has listed </v>

67
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.110
<v Speaker 1>pepe the frog on its hate symbols </v>
<v Speaker 1>database.</v>

68
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.903
<v Speaker 1>I only heard about it secondhand and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that it is a place for free </v>

69
00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:24.620
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in all reality,</v>

70
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.510
<v Speaker 1>it was certainly done in very poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>taste.</v>

71
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Junior John Christianson set according </v>
<v Speaker 1>to its website,</v>

72
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.520
<v Speaker 1>the a mission is to open quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify,</v>

73

<v Speaker 1>train,</v>

74
00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.750
<v Speaker 1>and mobilize youth activists committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to winning on principle.</v>

75
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Our goal is to cast the leaders of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow and reclaim the policies,</v>

76
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.320
<v Speaker 1>candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and direction of our government.</v>

77
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Post quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a member of Y,</v>

78
00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:50.360

<v Speaker 1>the frog on the ball,</v>

79
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.960
<v Speaker 1>but asked to remain on identified open </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

80
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.650
<v Speaker 1>I knew the person who drew happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't draw it to be negative.</v>

81
00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.840
<v Speaker 1>He drew it to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Close quote,</v>

82
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.210
<v Speaker 1>senior Parker Wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a member of y,</v>

83
00:05:02.211 --> 00:05:05.150
<v Speaker 1>a l sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He continued.</v>

84
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.450
<v Speaker 1>We understand some groups appropriated </v>
<v Speaker 1>the image,</v>

85
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.550
<v Speaker 1>but any image can be appropriated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wells set his goals with the free speech</v>

86
00:05:13.641 --> 00:05:14.474
<v Speaker 1>ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where to get people thinking about the </v>

87
00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:19.370
<v Speaker 1>rights to free expression and to bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>more attention to the y a l group.</v>

88
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.643
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that it's necessary to set </v>

89
00:05:23.721 --> 00:05:24.554
<v Speaker 1>limits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think this cartoon fraud is </v>

90
00:05:26.181 --> 00:05:27.014
<v Speaker 1>a limit to set for free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it unfortunate that people can </v>

91
00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.390
<v Speaker 1>enjoy this event because of the frog </v>
<v Speaker 1>image</v>

92
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.963
<v Speaker 1>as a part of it's speak freely.</v>

93
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.490

<v Speaker 1>April 24th.</v>

94
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.930
<v Speaker 1>The group is also showing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary the red pill on Tuesday,</v>

<v Speaker 1>open quote.</v>

98
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.593
<v Speaker 1>I find both the invitation of Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson and the screening of the </v>

99
00:05:55.941 --> 00:05:56.774
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the red by the young Americans for </v>

100
00:05:58.491 --> 00:05:59.324
<v Speaker 1>Liberty Club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely problematic problematic </v>

101
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:02.684
<v Speaker 1>because neither peterson northern film </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be promoting dialogues about </v>

102
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.014
<v Speaker 1>gendered inclusions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather be promoting a dangerous and </v>

103
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.284
<v Speaker 1>offensive logic of gendered exclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr [inaudible] continued promotion of </v>

104
00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:16.534
<v Speaker 1>such exclusionary practices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatly threatened safe spaces for our </v>

105
00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:20.374
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staff and faculty who belong to </v>

106
00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:26.260
<v Speaker 1>marginalized groups and violates our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethos of upholding mutual respect on our</v>

107
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:31.261
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president's diversity committee will</v>

108
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:32.174
<v Speaker 1>hold a discussion at 5:30 PM on Monday </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the pioneer reading room titled Free </v>

109
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is and what it is,</v>

110
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:41.330
<v Speaker 1>not the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll examine free speech and members of</v>

111
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>the Linfield community or encouraged to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attend.</v>

112
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's the end of that newspaper </v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on April 19th I received a letter from </v>

118
00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:09.244
<v Speaker 1>the student who'd organized my car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said things have gotten nuclear this </v>

119
00:07:13.961 --> 00:07:14.794
<v Speaker 1>email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one I'm going to read to you was </v>

120
00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:17.614
<v Speaker 1>just sent to all of Lynnfield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the stipulations they are </v>

121
00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:24.880
<v Speaker 1>referring to is the contract which they </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejected because it was a day late.</v>

122
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.433
<v Speaker 1>Our Club is currently looking for space </v>
<v Speaker 1>in downtown in Mcminnville to hold </v>

123
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Peterson's stark and step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The media is likely getting involved.</v>

124
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry for this insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tried very hard to keep things simple</v>

125
00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:38.854
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here is the letter sent out to the </v>

126
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.280
<v Speaker 1>entire community</v>

127
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.463
<v Speaker 1>linfield community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am writing on behalf of the Linfield </v>

128
00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 1>cabinet as officer in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what President Kelly is out.</v>

129
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I want to let the Linfield community </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that the Aas,</v>

130
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:57.134
<v Speaker 1>Llc Associated Students of Linfield </v>
<v Speaker 1>College has determined it will not fun </v>

131
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.043
<v Speaker 1>Dr Jordan Peterson's appearance next </v>
<v Speaker 1>week because stipulations for the event </v>

132
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:08.000
<v Speaker 1>were not met by the requester,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young Americans for liberty.</v>

133
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Since the authorization parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not satisfied.</v>

134
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 1>The college will not host the event on </v>
<v Speaker 1>April 24.</v>

135
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.413
<v Speaker 1>Among the stipulations was that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>event was to be a private linfield </v>

136
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:23.801
<v Speaker 1>college only event by his own tweet </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday to 107,000 followers.</v>

137
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson indicates he would be open </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

138
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.790
<v Speaker 1>violating more safe spaces soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Linfield College,</v>

139
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.713
<v Speaker 1>close quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>likeminded supporters from outside or </v>

140
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:40.721
<v Speaker 1>community have responded affirmatively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our policy on anti harassment protection</v>

141
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 1>and academic freedom states that open </v>
<v Speaker 1>quotes,</v>

142
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.213
<v Speaker 1>anti harassment policies are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>intended to limit the free exchange of </v>

143
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>opinions or the vigorous debate over </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

144
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimidation,</v>

145
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploitation,</v>

146
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.053
<v Speaker 1>and the use or threat of force are </v>
<v Speaker 1>incompatible with the preservation of </v>

147
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:01.344
<v Speaker 1>this freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The letter continues based on the </v>

148
00:09:05.141 --> 00:09:05.974
<v Speaker 1>speaker's own words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This event no longer presents the </v>

149
00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:11.380
<v Speaker 1>possibility of academic inquiry within </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Linfield community.</v>

150
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Our policy is clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Open quote,</v>

151
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.303
<v Speaker 1>harassment and intimidation preclude the</v>
<v Speaker 1>very possibility for maintaining an </v>

152
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.470
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere of academic freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We cannot welcome speakers,</v>

153
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.423
<v Speaker 1>witness stipulations for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearances are not mapped and who </v>

154
00:09:26.831 --> 00:09:27.664
<v Speaker 1>attend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who intend to violate the safety of our </v>

155
00:09:30.881 --> 00:09:33.160
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Respectfully,</v>

156
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Susan at Kipp and hand.</v>

157
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote a letter to Susan Agora </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chippenham.</v>

158
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Now you understand that by this time the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flights had been arranged,</v>

159
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:48.390
<v Speaker 1>the accommodation had been arranged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was in place,</v>

160
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 1>and of course they had known about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>

161
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.283
<v Speaker 1>Dear Susan,</v>

162
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:54.853
<v Speaker 1>I received a copy of your letter to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Linfield community this morning as well </v>

163
00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:01.460
<v Speaker 1>as an indication that my long scheduled </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk at Linfield has been canceled.</v>

164
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.923
<v Speaker 1>That is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose except that the plane tickets </v>

165
00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:05.774
<v Speaker 1>have been booked and the hotel </v>
<v Speaker 1>reservations have been made as well as </v>

166
00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:11.300
<v Speaker 1>three days taken out of my schedule at </v>
<v Speaker 1>my expense.</v>

167
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.191
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

168
00:10:13.191 --> 00:10:14.024
<v Speaker 1>Are Treating me and the student group </v>
<v Speaker 1>who invited me in a manner that is </v>

169
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.560
<v Speaker 1>absolutely reprehensible as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardly and underhanded.</v>

170
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:22.993
<v Speaker 1>I have made arrangements to come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lynnfield which is extremely distant </v>

171
00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:28.460
<v Speaker 1>from me and that was the way in good </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith.</v>

172
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.343
<v Speaker 1>Now you cancel it with a plethora of </v>
<v Speaker 1>specious reasons including your anti </v>

173
00:10:34.521 --> 00:10:35.354
<v Speaker 1>harassment policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I have harassed no one nor </v>

174
00:10:37.581 --> 00:10:38.930
<v Speaker 1>intimidated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploited,</v>

175
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:39.973
<v Speaker 1>or threaten force had I not previously </v>
<v Speaker 1>received notice of the controversy </v>

176
00:10:44.271 --> 00:10:46.640
<v Speaker 1>around my arrival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in my opinion,</v>

177
00:10:46.641 --> 00:10:47.474
<v Speaker 1>unwarranted.</v>

178
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I would not have tweeted my intent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>open quote violate safe spaces,</v>

179
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.233
<v Speaker 1>close quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a satirical comment in case it </v>

180
00:10:55.941 --> 00:10:56.774
<v Speaker 1>needs to be said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you were looking for any </v>

181
00:10:58.671 --> 00:11:01.730
<v Speaker 1>excuse no matter how trivial to cancel </v>
<v Speaker 1>this event.</v>

182
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.493
<v Speaker 1>You also note that open quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this event no longer presents the </v>

183
00:11:07.131 --> 00:11:11.780
<v Speaker 1>possibility of academic inquiry within </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Linfield community close quote,</v>

184
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I might point out that Lynnfield is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>college not a community,</v>

185
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.980
<v Speaker 1>and that ideas need to be discussed in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>

186
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.410
<v Speaker 1>You also state that open quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti harassment policies are intended to</v>

187
00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:28.130
<v Speaker 1>limit the free exchange of opinions or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the vigorous debate over ideas,</v>

188
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.580
<v Speaker 1>close quote and then proceed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly that.</v>

189
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.440
<v Speaker 1>You also mentioned that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>received support from open quote,</v>

190
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.493
<v Speaker 1>likeminded supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close quote from outside of your </v>

191
00:11:39.621 --> 00:11:40.454
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hardly surprising or </v>

192
00:11:42.231 --> 00:11:44.840
<v Speaker 1>informative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that they were likeminded.</v>

193
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.130
<v Speaker 1>You also suggest that because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract was delayed one day,</v>

194
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.083
<v Speaker 1>that constitutes sufficient grounds for </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancellation even though you knew well </v>

195
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:54.544
<v Speaker 1>that the event was booked and finalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's such delays are by no means </v>

196
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 1>unheard of in such situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might also note that a guest invited</v>

197
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:03.004
<v Speaker 1>to your college might expect to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated with a modicum of consideration </v>

198
00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:09.520
<v Speaker 1>and respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I plan to do.</v>

199
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.283
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make a video tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning at the latest reading this </v>

200
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:14.884
<v Speaker 1>letter on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explaining that by invitation has been </v>

201
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:21.100
<v Speaker 1>revoked what that means for me and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of the reasons given.</v>

202
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.910
<v Speaker 1>I will also read this letter of response</v>
<v Speaker 1>from me.</v>

203
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.690
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be watched by about 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewers,</v>

204
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.360
<v Speaker 1>many of whom I imagine will be linfield </v>
<v Speaker 1>alumni,</v>

205
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.253
<v Speaker 1>supporters and students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm perfectly willing to see what they </v>

206
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 1>all have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we can let the dust settle where it</v>

207
00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 1>may sincerely.</v>

208
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Dr Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor of psychology,</v>

209
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.493
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I received absolutely nothing in </v>

210
00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:48.520
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

211
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.363
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even have the decency to send </v>

212
00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:54.670
<v Speaker 1>me a notification explaining their </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationale.</v>

213
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was treated as far as I'm concerned</v>

214
00:12:57.701 --> 00:12:58.920
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>

215
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it unprofessionally and leave</v>

216
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 1>it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the story now?</v>

217
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.160
<v Speaker 1>The organizing students tried to book an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative venue.</v>

218
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.270
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have enough money to rent a </v>
<v Speaker 1>suitable theater or lecture hall.</v>

219
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.613
<v Speaker 1>I told them that they could use my </v>
<v Speaker 1>honorarium to pay for the space which </v>

220
00:13:18.191 --> 00:13:19.024
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The yamhill valley news registered </v>

221
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.353
<v Speaker 1>Dotcom posted this update April 20th off</v>

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.773
<v Speaker 1>So on with the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can figure out what I think of </v>

233
00:14:15.231 --> 00:14:18.530
<v Speaker 1>the linfield administrators who pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stunt on your own.</v>

234
00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for watching.</v>

235
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.620
<v Speaker 3>Members of the community</v>
<v Speaker 3>community for liberty,</v>

236
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.323
<v Speaker 3>other organizations that support this </v>
<v Speaker 3>events in those who travel to get here </v>

237
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.610
<v Speaker 3>along with the people on the live </v>
<v Speaker 3>stream.</v>

238
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.123
<v Speaker 3>My name is Lucas Carter and I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president of the linkage chapter of </v>

239
00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:49.971
<v Speaker 3>young Americans for liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Vice President Keeper Smith Been.</v>

240
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 3>You've been in the coordinator market </v>
<v Speaker 3>grills</v>

241
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.750
<v Speaker 3>in Secretary Alton Ramsey who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>handling tonight's a live stream.</v>

242
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

243
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.423
<v Speaker 3>So we're the team that organized this to</v>
<v Speaker 3>ensure that liberty wants a night </v>

244
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 3>judging by this parallel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we accomplished that,</v>

245
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.370
<v Speaker 3>but first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a couple of technical things to get</v>

246
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.370
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either way,</v>

247
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.383
<v Speaker 3>we're all doing a live stream because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>received support from all over the </v>

248
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:38.534
<v Speaker 3>nation and I mean all over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're asking to stay off the white </v>

249
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:43.604
<v Speaker 3>bike please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all our friends and families can </v>

250
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.800
<v Speaker 3>enjoy this live stream without any </v>
<v Speaker 3>hiccups.</v>

251
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>secondly,</v>

252
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:56.590
<v Speaker 3>we do have a donation bucket in the back</v>
<v Speaker 3>to help cover a Jordan Peterson's travel</v>

253
00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:57.494
<v Speaker 3>expenses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now my goal is a $750 in any </v>

254
00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:04.130
<v Speaker 3>excess funds will go towards his </v>
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>

255
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.033
<v Speaker 3>So moving on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can talk a little about the club when </v>

256
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.000
<v Speaker 3>keiffer nice story of this club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back in February,</v>

257
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.760
<v Speaker 3>we didn't know what to expect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have a vision.</v>

258
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.360
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given recent political events,</v>

259
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.970
<v Speaker 3>not just the</v>
<v Speaker 3>splits,</v>

260
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.363
<v Speaker 3>many people are afraid to speak out over</v>
<v Speaker 3>years of aspects to how was the club as </v>

261
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Dr Nate Libertarian values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's engage the public in the community</v>

262
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.640
<v Speaker 3>and like open free the bait for the sake</v>
<v Speaker 3>of intellectual advancements,</v>

263
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.780
<v Speaker 3>being able to debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to reach conclusions with St,</v>

264
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.733
<v Speaker 3>t in respect to one another's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to think leadership that just </v>

265
00:16:57.021 --> 00:16:57.854
<v Speaker 3>introduced all the hard work towards it </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards accomplishing this goal that we </v>

266
00:17:02.561 --> 00:17:05.510
<v Speaker 3>truly believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally,</v>

267
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.720
<v Speaker 3>I was the best next semester as chapter </v>
<v Speaker 3>President Keeper Smith era.</v>

268
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.250
<v Speaker 3>Take over next semester after I </v>
<v Speaker 3>graduates.</v>

269
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.391
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more importantly,</v>

270
00:17:17.391 --> 00:17:20.240
<v Speaker 3>there was something I need to address to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lingo community</v>

271
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.890
<v Speaker 3>on behalf of the club</v>
<v Speaker 3>on behalf of the club in the leadership.</v>

272
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.383
<v Speaker 3>I like to take this time to publicly </v>
<v Speaker 3>apologize for eating unintended harm </v>

273
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.210
<v Speaker 3>that has occurred over these past two </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>

274
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 3>It is not within the clubs with tensions</v>
<v Speaker 3>degenerate any arm or create environment</v>

275
00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:47.900
<v Speaker 3>where people feel unsafe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just want to make that clear.</v>

276
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.213
<v Speaker 3>We want people be more movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's our intention and I'm also going </v>

277
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:56.780
<v Speaker 3>to ask the public to not raising it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pitchforks at my school.</v>

278
00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:58.803
<v Speaker 3>I love my school early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I didn't move all the way out here </v>

279
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.440
<v Speaker 3>more to just to like trash anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love my school.</v>

280
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:10.380
<v Speaker 3>And beyond that situation behind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scenes is a lot more complex than what's</v>

281
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:15.381
<v Speaker 3>been released to the public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cloud itself has made mistakes too and I</v>

282
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 3>just got to say thank you for </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooperation in these matters.</v>

283
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.430
<v Speaker 3>Now I'd like to introduce the main </v>
<v Speaker 3>coordinator of this events.</v>

284
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 3>He has done far more work than any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

285
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he spoke with Pearson for an advance.</v>

286
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.450
<v Speaker 3>He spoke with the media who found this </v>
<v Speaker 3>venue last minute.</v>

287
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.343
<v Speaker 3>Such a beautiful venue by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He handled most of the paperwork and </v>

288
00:18:37.981 --> 00:18:39.710
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of another note.</v>

289
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Please welcome event coordinator Parker </v>
<v Speaker 3>Wells.</v>

290
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.820
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

291
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.793
<v Speaker 5>Hello everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a senior at college and I'm </v>

292
00:18:59.201 --> 00:19:01.890
<v Speaker 5>overjoyed to see a third response,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

293
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.860
<v Speaker 5>considering ms dot Dubay had some major </v>
<v Speaker 5>complications just last week.</v>

294
00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.460
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's overwhelming.</v>

295
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.780
<v Speaker 5>The response has been so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so positive here.</v>

296
00:19:10.781 --> 00:19:12.720
<v Speaker 5>So thank you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

297
00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.420
<v Speaker 5>I have to express my gratitude to </v>
<v Speaker 5>students for liberty young Americans,</v>

298
00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:19.300
<v Speaker 5>for liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for students who are unsure about how to</v>

299
00:19:19.301 --> 00:19:20.134
<v Speaker 5>get involved on your college campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I highly recommend the network of </v>

300
00:19:23.801 --> 00:19:24.634
<v Speaker 5>liberty minded organizations because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've been very supportive throughout </v>

301
00:19:26.891 --> 00:19:31.180
<v Speaker 5>this whole whole thank you to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lastly,</v>

302
00:19:31.181 --> 00:19:36.181
<v Speaker 5>I like to frame tonight's talk as an </v>
<v Speaker 5>opportunity for us to open our minds and</v>

303
00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:42.550
<v Speaker 5>make an honest effort at understanding </v>
<v Speaker 5>each each other and on that note all the</v>

304
00:19:43.481 --> 00:19:47.950
<v Speaker 5>way from the University of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Please welcome Dr Jordan Peterson.</v>

305
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:53.110
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you burt,</v>

306
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:16.030
<v Speaker 4>and also thank you for your persistence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first thing I'd like to say is that</v>

307
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:28.430
<v Speaker 4>Parker told me can 10 minutes before the</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk that he has very much enjoyed going</v>

308
00:20:30.991 --> 00:20:31.824
<v Speaker 4>to linfield college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I just had had the opportunity to </v>

309
00:20:35.341 --> 00:20:39.570
<v Speaker 4>stroll through absolutely spectacularly </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful lakes.</v>

310
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.140
<v Speaker 4>Looks like everyone's dream of a classic</v>
<v Speaker 4>Liberal Arts College,</v>

311
00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:48.141
<v Speaker 4>and so he wanted me to let everyone know</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's had a great time in Europe.</v>

312
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.840
<v Speaker 5>He didn't want to bring any disrepute on</v>
<v Speaker 5>colleges,</v>

313
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.753
<v Speaker 5>so I thought I'd end up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's important to know that it's easy </v>

314
00:20:57.491 --> 00:21:01.330
<v Speaker 5>for things to be made black and white </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's simple,</v>

315
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:04.140
<v Speaker 5>but certainly things are the least bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>simple.</v>

316
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.673
<v Speaker 5>It's useful to keep that in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm going to start this by reading </v>

317
00:21:11.441 --> 00:21:15.250
<v Speaker 5>you something that I wrote specifically </v>
<v Speaker 5>for this talk.</v>

318
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:16.953
<v Speaker 5>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always want to do something different </v>

319
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.583
<v Speaker 5>in each talk because one of the previous</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk and part of the reason that you </v>

320
00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:30.940
<v Speaker 5>talk is to get things clear in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>mind.</v>

321
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 5>It's a good way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the best way of thinking.</v>

322
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.150
<v Speaker 5>So I suppose in some sense it's opens a </v>
<v Speaker 5>poll.</v>

323
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.340
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

324
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:43.303
<v Speaker 5>It's what I hope to cover tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what I'm going to do is read you the </v>

325
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:46.114
<v Speaker 5>outline first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's an outline and then I'm </v>

326
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:48.994
<v Speaker 5>going to go through it line by line and </v>
<v Speaker 5>see if I can clarify to us and also to </v>

327
00:21:53.741 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 5>beat what I mean.</v>

328
00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.173
<v Speaker 5>So I'm going to orient the talk tonight </v>
<v Speaker 5>around the ethics of free speech we've </v>

329
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.650
<v Speaker 5>talked about about or thought a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

330
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.513
<v Speaker 5>let's say the right to free speech and </v>
<v Speaker 5>something you might want to also </v>

331
00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:13.264
<v Speaker 5>consider the obligation to free speech </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I actually think it's deeper </v>

332
00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:20.830
<v Speaker 5>than a right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're obligated to speak freely</v>

333
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:22.023
<v Speaker 5>because otherwise people don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>benefit of your whatever wisdom you </v>

334
00:22:26.321 --> 00:22:31.190
<v Speaker 5>possess and at least you possess the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wisdom of your own experience.</v>

335
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:36.100
<v Speaker 5>At the very least you have that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's as valid as a form of truth,</v>

336
00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:36.934
<v Speaker 5>as any other form of truth and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>often a truth that can be usefully </v>

337
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:44.630
<v Speaker 5>communicated to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's to the communities benefit.</v>

338
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:45.543
<v Speaker 5>You say what your experience has taught </v>
<v Speaker 5>because there isn't anyone who has </v>

339
00:22:50.081 --> 00:22:50.914
<v Speaker 5>experience like you and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that I've learned from being a </v>

340
00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:55.204
<v Speaker 5>clinical psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would say more specifically from </v>

341
00:22:57.071 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 5>being a very careful listener,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that if you listen to people and they</v>

342
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:04.000
<v Speaker 5>can talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they tell you the most amazing things.</v>

343
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.290
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

344
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:06.183
<v Speaker 5>my typical week I work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even today I was speaking to four </v>

345
00:23:11.771 --> 00:23:12.604
<v Speaker 5>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're supporters of mine online and I </v>

346
00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.253
<v Speaker 5>beat some of the and I had four </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversations that were just absolutely </v>

347
00:23:22.781 --> 00:23:27.700
<v Speaker 5>profound and it's so interesting because</v>
<v Speaker 5>if people are allowed,</v>

348
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:28.623
<v Speaker 5>encouraged to express themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's something that you could do by </v>

349
00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:37.111
<v Speaker 5>listening to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they open up and they were there as it's</v>

350
00:23:37.601 --> 00:23:38.434
<v Speaker 5>as interesting as a Dostoevsky know </v>
<v Speaker 5>people's actual lights are </v>

351
00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:42.334
<v Speaker 5>extraordinarily interesting and and </v>
<v Speaker 5>important that they can speak freely </v>

352
00:23:46.731 --> 00:23:47.564
<v Speaker 5>about them because then they can tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>you all the things they know that you </v>

353
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:52.670
<v Speaker 5>don't know and then you get to know them</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's such a good deal.</v>

354
00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:55.550
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

355
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.033
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to tell you some things that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>believe to be true and constitute the </v>

356
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.333
<v Speaker 5>back of his talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the first thing is that life is </v>

357
00:24:08.771 --> 00:24:09.604
<v Speaker 5>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I would say that this is an </v>

358
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:14.564
<v Speaker 5>attempt to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is my attempt to reconcile the </v>

359
00:24:18.281 --> 00:24:22.390
<v Speaker 5>existence of multiple transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 5>virtues.</v>

360
00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.573
<v Speaker 5>Transcended virtues are the lights that </v>
<v Speaker 5>guide you through your life essentially </v>

361
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:28.983
<v Speaker 5>that the principles by which it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessary to live if you're going to </v>

362
00:24:33.741 --> 00:24:38.741
<v Speaker 5>have a life that's meaningful and </v>
<v Speaker 5>profound and beneficial,</v>

363
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.180
<v Speaker 5>and there are multiple transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 5>values.</v>

364
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.400
<v Speaker 5>It isn't clear how they relate to one </v>
<v Speaker 5>another,</v>

365
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.233
<v Speaker 5>and</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is my attempt to understand how </v>

366
00:24:51.171 --> 00:24:56.171
<v Speaker 5>they relate to so I started with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>truth that I believe to be supreme,</v>

367
00:24:56.691 --> 00:24:57.524
<v Speaker 5>which is that life is suffering and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>that love is the desire to see </v>

368
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.620
<v Speaker 5>unnecessary suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ameliorated</v>

369
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.373
<v Speaker 5>and the truth is the handmaiden of law</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the dialogue is the pathway to </v>

370
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:20.160
<v Speaker 5>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then humility</v>

371
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:27.260
<v Speaker 5>is recognition of personal insufficiency</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the willingness to learn</v>

372
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.533
<v Speaker 5>and then to learn is to die voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 5>and be born again in great ways and </v>

373
00:25:35.861 --> 00:25:36.694
<v Speaker 5>small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So speech must be untrammeled so that </v>

374
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:48.730
<v Speaker 5>dialogue can take place</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that we can all humbly learn.</v>

375
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.970
<v Speaker 5>So the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>concert law,</v>

376
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.960
<v Speaker 5>so that suffering can be ameliorated</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that we can all stumble forward,</v>

377
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:05.120
<v Speaker 5>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the Kingdom of God.</v>

378
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:09.290
<v Speaker 5>So I'll try to unpack that.</v>

379
00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.573
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the idea that light is </v>

380
00:26:13.601 --> 00:26:17.860
<v Speaker 5>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This comes as no surprise to anyone</v>

381
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.450
<v Speaker 5>in my estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's two reasons for that.</v>

382
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:28.120
<v Speaker 5>One seems to have to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure of being itself,</v>

383
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:29.703
<v Speaker 5>and by that I mean</v>
<v Speaker 5>there seems to be something about </v>

384
00:26:35.651 --> 00:26:36.484
<v Speaker 5>limitation that's required for existence</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's a difficult notion to make </v>

385
00:26:41.171 --> 00:26:42.004
<v Speaker 5>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can tell you a little story about </v>

386
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.330
<v Speaker 5>what I call him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My son was young when he was three years</v>

387
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:49.750
<v Speaker 5>old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

388
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:56.540
<v Speaker 5>I thought he was a remarkable creature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought Saint Nicholas,</v>

389
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.090
<v Speaker 5>my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something remarkable.</v>

390
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:01.260
<v Speaker 5>Have little kids.</v>

391
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.160
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>

392
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.993
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

393
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.140
<v Speaker 5>they're a little beacons of enthusiasm </v>
<v Speaker 5>and wonder.</v>

394
00:27:09.141 --> 00:27:09.974
<v Speaker 5>I suppose it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although it takes great effort to care </v>

395
00:27:13.191 --> 00:27:14.024
<v Speaker 5>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they repaid you partly by their </v>

396
00:27:17.241 --> 00:27:18.074
<v Speaker 5>enthusiasm and partly by the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they looked at the world as if it's a </v>

397
00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:28.150
<v Speaker 5>new thing and that allows you to do the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same thing when you're around them.</v>

398
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.510
<v Speaker 5>So they refresh the world for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

399
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.130
<v Speaker 5>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a great thing.</v>

400
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:35.120
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

401
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:36.643
<v Speaker 5>if you're a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that sprite Info your </v>

402
00:27:39.921 --> 00:27:43.040
<v Speaker 5>children is that they're vulnerable.</v>

403
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.943
<v Speaker 5>That's part of the burden of </v>
<v Speaker 5>responsibility that's associated with </v>

404
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:51.063
<v Speaker 5>being a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you might think about that </v>

405
00:27:53.411 --> 00:27:54.244
<v Speaker 5>vulnerability as a well as a liability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suppose that's one way of thinking </v>

406
00:27:58.421 --> 00:28:00.550
<v Speaker 5>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then I thought,</v>

407
00:28:00.551 --> 00:28:03.880
<v Speaker 5>well that's an interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at it that it's only a liability</v>

408
00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.310
<v Speaker 5>because maybe you would like your child </v>
<v Speaker 5>not to be vulnerable.</v>

409
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:11.380
<v Speaker 5>But then I thought that through and</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the practical map price close.</v>

410
00:28:13.511 --> 00:28:14.440
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

411
00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.910
<v Speaker 5>because I was worried,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

412
00:28:15.911 --> 00:28:16.744
<v Speaker 5>he'd go up the street and the car would </v>
<v Speaker 5>go into the playground and some bully </v>

413
00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.300
<v Speaker 5>would knock them over a dog bite up or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that,</v>

414
00:28:22.301 --> 00:28:23.134
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and of course little kids are always </v>

415
00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.730
<v Speaker 5>backing themselves and falling down the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stairs and that kind of thing.</v>

416
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.280
<v Speaker 5>And</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

417
00:28:30.281 --> 00:28:31.114
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would you have to do to have a </v>

418
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.130
<v Speaker 5>little being that didn't have those </v>
<v Speaker 5>problems?</v>

419
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.410
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought you could.</v>

420
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.080
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a superhuman intelligence.</v>

421
00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:43.914
<v Speaker 5>That would be a start.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could be 20 feet tall instead of </v>

422
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.273
<v Speaker 5>three feet tall and he can be encased in</v>
<v Speaker 5>titanium and know he could be made him </v>

423
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:54.443
<v Speaker 5>vulnerable or at near invulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the problem with that is that you </v>

424
00:28:58.021 --> 00:29:02.710
<v Speaker 5>have to replace what he was piece by </v>
<v Speaker 5>piece until there was nothing left.</v>

425
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:04.303
<v Speaker 5>And so that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was partly when I realized because </v>

426
00:29:08.761 --> 00:29:11.400
<v Speaker 5>realizations like this of course unfold </v>
<v Speaker 5>over time,</v>

427
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.520
<v Speaker 5>that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you deeply care for someone,</v>

428
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.190
<v Speaker 5>you don't care for them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Despite their vulnerability.</v>

429
00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:21.600
<v Speaker 5>You care for them with the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 5>that their vulnerability as an intrinsic</v>

430
00:29:21.601 --> 00:29:22.434
<v Speaker 5>part of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You care for the remarkable fact of </v>

431
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:26.394
<v Speaker 5>their weakness and specificity just as </v>
<v Speaker 5>much as you care for them for whatever </v>

432
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.100
<v Speaker 5>abilities they bring to bear whatever </v>
<v Speaker 5>capacities they have.</v>

433
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.173
<v Speaker 5>And so to love someone is to Simmel </v>
<v Speaker 5>tediously accept their vulnerability as </v>

434
00:29:40.891 --> 00:29:41.724
<v Speaker 5>a valid part of their feeding and that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a necessary thing to do in life because </v>

435
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:50.730
<v Speaker 5>life is suffering and but without,</v>
<v Speaker 5>without,</v>

436
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.990
<v Speaker 5>without the vulnerability that brings </v>
<v Speaker 5>suffering,</v>

437
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:57.610
<v Speaker 5>then there doesn't seem to be any </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility of individual existence.</v>

438
00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:58.443
<v Speaker 5>And so to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems that in order for us to exist </v>

439
00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:04.810
<v Speaker 5>as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in some real sense,</v>

440
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.003
<v Speaker 5>we have to be limited in precisely the </v>
<v Speaker 5>manner that we are limited in the Ba in </v>

441
00:30:09.671 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 5>some sense requires that limitation and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that vulnerability.</v>

442
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:16.050
<v Speaker 5>There is an old idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember where I read it.</v>

443
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:20.020
<v Speaker 5>It was many years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was from Jewish commentary on</v>

444
00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:23.500
<v Speaker 5>the Torah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a Zen Koan almost.</v>

445
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:24.523
<v Speaker 5>The question was what does it being with</v>
<v Speaker 5>the classical attributes of God </v>

446
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.420
<v Speaker 5>omniscient,</v>
<v Speaker 5>omnipotent and omnipresence?</v>

447
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.650
<v Speaker 5>What does it feel like now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very interesting question because</v>

448
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:38.020
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously the obvious answer is,</v>

449
00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:38.890
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing,</v>

450
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:40.383
<v Speaker 5>but that's the wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The right answer is to be like that </v>

451
00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:44.014
<v Speaker 5>blacks limitation and the commentator </v>
<v Speaker 5>was putting that argument forward as a </v>

452
00:30:48.461 --> 00:30:49.294
<v Speaker 5>justification for the creation of man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I thought that was a spectacularly </v>

453
00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:53.973
<v Speaker 5>brilliant insight that there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that something that lacks </v>

454
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.350
<v Speaker 5>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blacks max lack itself.</v>

455
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.490
<v Speaker 5>And I read something about something </v>
<v Speaker 5>written by Kierkegaard where he said the</v>

456
00:31:06.491 --> 00:31:07.324
<v Speaker 5>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said that he knew himself as someone </v>

457
00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:11.584
<v Speaker 5>who was never going to be able to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>life easy for people in the way the </v>

458
00:31:14.001 --> 00:31:14.834
<v Speaker 5>great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the great inventors of the late 19th </v>

459
00:31:16.121 --> 00:31:20.290
<v Speaker 5>century had been things increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 5>easy for people and so that his task was</v>

460
00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:21.124
<v Speaker 5>going to be to determine how was he </v>
<v Speaker 5>could make life more difficult for </v>

461
00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:28.780
<v Speaker 5>people and he knew he would be thanked </v>
<v Speaker 5>as one of the benefactors of the age for</v>

462
00:31:28.781 --> 00:31:32.280
<v Speaker 5>doing precisely that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tempted to,</v>

463
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:33.873
<v Speaker 5>I suppose lay a heavy moral burden on </v>
<v Speaker 5>his readers and he knew that that was </v>

464
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:44.520
<v Speaker 5>perhaps not something that people would </v>
<v Speaker 5>appreciate immediately,</v>

465
00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:45.574
<v Speaker 5>but perhaps on reflection they would </v>
<v Speaker 5>find that that was exactly what they </v>

466
00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:48.874
<v Speaker 5>wanted and one of the things that speak </v>
<v Speaker 5>very remarkable to me as I've been </v>

467
00:31:54.071 --> 00:31:59.071
<v Speaker 5>speaking to people recently is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I think that I'm doing something</v>

468
00:31:59.111 --> 00:32:02.050
<v Speaker 5>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to lay a burden on people and</v>

469
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:06.750
<v Speaker 5>by all appearances I'm trying to lay a </v>
<v Speaker 5>burden on me.</v>

470
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.100
<v Speaker 5>At least that's who's responding to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

471
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.570
<v Speaker 5>look at this audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it must be 95 percent.</v>

472
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.850
<v Speaker 5>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very interesting to me,</v>

473
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.033
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's something about about </v>

474
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.023
<v Speaker 5>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's associated with the transcendence </v>

475
00:32:24.761 --> 00:32:29.761
<v Speaker 5>of suffering and it's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessary for life to proceed properly,</v>

476
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.153
<v Speaker 5>so life is suffering because we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>vulnerable and it's also suffering I </v>

477
00:32:37.681 --> 00:32:42.590
<v Speaker 5>would say because we're evil and I've </v>
<v Speaker 5>tried to define evil.</v>

478
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.610
<v Speaker 5>There's the tragic part of life is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fact that our,</v>

479
00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:50.223
<v Speaker 5>our vulnerability is built in and we we </v>
<v Speaker 5>have psychological problems or physical </v>

480
00:32:54.351 --> 00:32:59.030
<v Speaker 5>problems and we all die and that's part </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the structure of existence.</v>

481
00:32:59.031 --> 00:32:59.864
<v Speaker 5>It's the same structure that brain is </v>
<v Speaker 5>about tornadoes and hurricanes and </v>

482
00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.930
<v Speaker 5>earthquakes and natural catastrophes of </v>
<v Speaker 5>all types.</v>

483
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:06.764
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the impartial brutality of reality </v>

484
00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:13.970
<v Speaker 5>and that contributes greatly to human </v>
<v Speaker 5>suffering.</v>

485
00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:16.130
<v Speaker 5>Probably would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>

486
00:33:16.131 --> 00:33:18.170
<v Speaker 5>it also be a precondition for being </v>
<v Speaker 5>itself,</v>

487
00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:19.004
<v Speaker 5>but then there's the other kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>suffering that we bring the corner </v>

488
00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:22.623
<v Speaker 5>herself and I would categorize that </v>
<v Speaker 5>under the heading of malevolence and </v>

489
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:32.840
<v Speaker 5>malevolence is the desire to break,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to increase suffering in some sense,</v>

490
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 5>for the sake of suffering itself.</v>

491
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.233
<v Speaker 5>It's like an art form.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the best way to </v>

492
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.410
<v Speaker 5>conceptualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something is authentic.</v>

493
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.400
<v Speaker 5>It's the same aesthetic that drove the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Nazis to put that up.</v>

494
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.770
<v Speaker 5>Terrible Jill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about gates of Auschwitz,</v>

495
00:33:45.771 --> 00:33:46.604
<v Speaker 5>which was that work with make you free,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and of course the freedom that is being </v>

496
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:55.160
<v Speaker 5>offered it in the Nazi camps was death </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that was great,</v>

497
00:33:55.550 --> 00:34:00.350
<v Speaker 5>terrible joke and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very malevolent spirit that would</v>

498
00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.193
<v Speaker 5>dare to joke in that manner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's the spirit that we all have </v>

499
00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.343
<v Speaker 5>attended because there's part of each of</v>
<v Speaker 5>us that because of the suffering that </v>

500
00:34:08.301 --> 00:34:09.134
<v Speaker 5>life entails is bitter about existence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would wish in some sense to see it </v>

501
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:18.670
<v Speaker 5>eradicated and something I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 5>reading those great play faust.</v>

502
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.133
<v Speaker 5>He as a character in there </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mephistopheles who's sort of the </v>

503
00:34:24.111 --> 00:34:26.240
<v Speaker 5>intellectual version of Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suppose,</v>

504
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:28.143
<v Speaker 5>and hurt the has mephistopheles attempt </v>
<v Speaker 5>to explain the reason for his existence </v>

505
00:34:32.721 --> 00:34:34.430
<v Speaker 5>or at least the reason for his modem.</v>

506
00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.180
<v Speaker 5>Ba in memphis softly says memphis golf </v>
<v Speaker 5>means basically says,</v>

507
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:39.980
<v Speaker 5>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That hasn't say this twice,</v>

508
00:34:39.981 --> 00:34:40.814
<v Speaker 5>that because the existence is </v>
<v Speaker 5>characterized by such dreadful </v>

509
00:34:43.761 --> 00:34:44.594
<v Speaker 5>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be better if it never existed </v>

510
00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:48.200
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what he's bringing.</v>

511
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.310
<v Speaker 5>Working to bring about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that struck me in a very</v>

512
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:58.930
<v Speaker 5>deep manner because I had recognized by </v>
<v Speaker 5>that time that life was difficult enough</v>

513
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:01.963
<v Speaker 5>so that it was challenging to walk </v>
<v Speaker 5>through it without becoming embittered </v>

514
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.260
<v Speaker 5>and resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

515
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:12.320
<v Speaker 5>and and then to become arrogant because </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that,</v>

516
00:35:12.321 --> 00:35:14.970
<v Speaker 5>and then to become a judge of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because of that,</v>

517
00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.093
<v Speaker 5>if you ever wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course you do what is going through </v>

518
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:19.874
<v Speaker 5>the minds of people who do such things </v>
<v Speaker 5>as shoot up elementary school's full of </v>

519
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.333
<v Speaker 5>schoolchildren knowing the things that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>just described is very useful in </v>

520
00:35:28.041 --> 00:35:33.041
<v Speaker 5>developing some understanding because </v>
<v Speaker 5>the people who do that are resentful and</v>

521
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.610
<v Speaker 5>bitter and the brooded upon it for well </v>
<v Speaker 5>not hours,</v>

522
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.490
<v Speaker 5>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>months and years,</v>

523
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.630
<v Speaker 5>and they conclude that existence itself </v>
<v Speaker 5>is evil and that it should be.</v>

524
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:43.883
<v Speaker 5>It should be taken revenge upon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way that you take revenge on </v>

525
00:35:47.791 --> 00:35:52.670
<v Speaker 5>existence most precisely is to find the </v>
<v Speaker 5>most innocent people and punish them the</v>

526
00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.580
<v Speaker 5>most.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dreadful,</v>

527
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:59.030
<v Speaker 5>and that's the motive behind shooting </v>
<v Speaker 5>elementary school kids in a playground.</v>

528
00:35:59.701 --> 00:36:03.420
<v Speaker 5>Let's say that's a very dark place to </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

529
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.340
<v Speaker 5>but that's a place that people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfectly capable of going up.</v>

530
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.543
<v Speaker 5>The terrible thing is that we have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>motivation to go there and you can make </v>

531
00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:14.304
<v Speaker 5>a rational case for going there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't make it the proper </v>

532
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:20.340
<v Speaker 5>place to go and that brings me to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>second point,</v>

533
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:24.480
<v Speaker 5>which is that love is the desire to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>unnecessary suffering.</v>

534
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:25.343
<v Speaker 5>Ameliorated lob is a very difficult word</v>
<v Speaker 5>to use because in some sense it's been </v>

535
00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.810
<v Speaker 5>most today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know such a commonplace.</v>

536
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.063
<v Speaker 5>If you're attempting to affect virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the first thing you do is speak </v>

537
00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:43.260
<v Speaker 5>about love and it's very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 5>speak about love without feeling.</v>

538
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:48.070
<v Speaker 5>I would say self contempt really because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a word that's misused so bad.</v>

539
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:53.640
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to offer a technical definition</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it and then put it into relationship,</v>

540
00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:57.960
<v Speaker 5>into proper relationship with what I </v>
<v Speaker 5>already discussed.</v>

541
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:00.563
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if hatred is the desire to CPA </v>

542
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.273
<v Speaker 5>eliminated because of its catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that blog is the desire to see being </v>

543
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.553
<v Speaker 5>developed elevated maybe even because of</v>
<v Speaker 5>that suffering and to say that the </v>

544
00:37:15.331 --> 00:37:16.164
<v Speaker 5>proper orientation in life is to work </v>
<v Speaker 5>diligently for the alleviation of </v>

545
00:37:20.821 --> 00:37:25.530
<v Speaker 5>unnecessary suffering and to make that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the core element of your being,</v>

546
00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.830
<v Speaker 5>your actual aim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you need a name,</v>

547
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.870
<v Speaker 5>everyone needs an aid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're we're,</v>

548
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:31.920
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

549
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:36.510
<v Speaker 5>we're creatures who are evolved to aim </v>
<v Speaker 5>or hunters for that matter,</v>

550
00:37:36.511 --> 00:37:40.600
<v Speaker 5>and we need a target to a map.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not ever oriented properly without</v>

551
00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.240
<v Speaker 5>name and then he might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

552
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.553
<v Speaker 5>why not choose a name that is everything</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you could possibly wanted to be an </v>

553
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:52.890
<v Speaker 5>and I would say that that is what you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to do because first of all,</v>

554
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.460
<v Speaker 5>being miserable and vulnerable and </v>
<v Speaker 5>subject to catastrophe of decay.</v>

555
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:03.870
<v Speaker 5>It's easy to see st and to self contempt</v>
<v Speaker 5>and misery,</v>

556
00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:04.704
<v Speaker 5>self-conscious misery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think the only way out of that as </v>

557
00:38:07.681 --> 00:38:08.514
<v Speaker 5>to</v>
<v Speaker 5>voluntarily shoulder a burden that the </v>

558
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:14.263
<v Speaker 5>shouldering out brand students some </v>
<v Speaker 5>respect for your own existence and so </v>

559
00:38:18.121 --> 00:38:19.500
<v Speaker 5>then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

560
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.453
<v Speaker 5>the way forward confidently is to find </v>
<v Speaker 5>the biggest load that you can possibly </v>

561
00:38:25.921 --> 00:38:29.590
<v Speaker 5>lift and then lifted and then walk </v>
<v Speaker 5>forward with it because they had.</v>

562
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:34.930
<v Speaker 5>You can see that there's something to </v>
<v Speaker 5>you that transcends your vulnerability.</v>

563
00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.293
<v Speaker 5>It knows the world and works against the</v>
<v Speaker 5>very terrible problems of suffering to </v>

564
00:38:44.361 --> 00:38:47.330
<v Speaker 5>the level that might drive you to </v>
<v Speaker 5>despair to begin with.</v>

565
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:52.340
<v Speaker 5>And so when I'm working with my clinical</v>
<v Speaker 5>clients,</v>

566
00:38:52.341 --> 00:38:54.710
<v Speaker 5>and I think when I'm speaking to people </v>
<v Speaker 5>in general,</v>

567
00:38:54.711 --> 00:38:56.120
<v Speaker 5>when I'm properly oriented,</v>

568
00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:03.200
<v Speaker 5>this is the development of thought that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was originally laid down in part by Carl</v>

569
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.033
<v Speaker 5>Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he was deeply influenced by by his </v>

570
00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:10.640
<v Speaker 5>Christian background.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a very famous psychologist and he</v>

571
00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:11.483
<v Speaker 5>said that when you treat people in </v>
<v Speaker 5>therapies with unconditional positive </v>

572
00:39:14.711 --> 00:39:15.544
<v Speaker 5>regard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I would say that that's unknowable </v>

573
00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:20.913
<v Speaker 5>formulation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's erroneous because that isn't </v>

574
00:39:22.991 --> 00:39:23.824
<v Speaker 5>exactly in my estimation what you should</v>
<v Speaker 5>do with people and I don't think it's </v>

575
00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:28.234
<v Speaker 5>what I do with people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do I do with people is to try to </v>

576
00:39:30.371 --> 00:39:31.204
<v Speaker 5>find the part of the striving towards </v>
<v Speaker 5>the light and that would like being </v>

577
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:35.914
<v Speaker 5>itself to be elevated and unknowable and</v>
<v Speaker 5>suffering ameliorating especially the </v>

578
00:39:39.521 --> 00:39:40.354
<v Speaker 5>unnecessary suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then form an alliance with that and </v>

579
00:39:43.001 --> 00:39:45.340
<v Speaker 5>communicate with that and encourage </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

580
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:46.203
<v Speaker 5>Which is what I think you do to people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you love and you can't do that if </v>

581
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:50.584
<v Speaker 5>there's bitterness in your heart because</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's actually the part that you want </v>

582
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:53.783
<v Speaker 5>to destroy.</v>

583
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:58.380
<v Speaker 5>If you're bitter as the story of Cain </v>
<v Speaker 5>and Abel tells us</v>

584
00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:00.773
<v Speaker 5>in a carer in a terribly brief period of</v>
<v Speaker 5>time the terrible power you replaced </v>

585
00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:11.410
<v Speaker 5>contempt for being and resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 5>hatred with,</v>

586
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:12.813
<v Speaker 5>with law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's the desire to see the good </v>

587
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.193
<v Speaker 5>flourish in you and others,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't mean the good and that </v>

588
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:26.390
<v Speaker 5>smarmy and contemptible manner that it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>often presented.</v>

589
00:40:26.771 --> 00:40:27.604
<v Speaker 5>I'd been good as the combination of </v>
<v Speaker 5>brilliant awareness and courage and </v>

590
00:40:32.981 --> 00:40:33.814
<v Speaker 5>strength that it really is</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would wish to bring forward at </v>

591
00:40:38.871 --> 00:40:39.704
<v Speaker 5>everyone to encourage and everyone if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you were oriented properly in the world </v>

592
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.863
<v Speaker 5>and to seek that kind of orientation is </v>
<v Speaker 5>to ground yourself in love instead of </v>

593
00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.200
<v Speaker 5>Mephistophelean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Patriot and</v>

594
00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.253
<v Speaker 6>and</v>

595
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.073
<v Speaker 5>you have nothing better to do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might as well do the best that you </v>

596
00:40:59.351 --> 00:41:02.350
<v Speaker 5>have to do because when you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>lose,</v>

597
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:03.363
<v Speaker 5>you're going to lose everything anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in the process of preparing to use </v>

598
00:41:08.111 --> 00:41:08.944
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might as well risk everything you </v>

599
00:41:11.141 --> 00:41:16.141
<v Speaker 5>have doing the best thing that you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibly conceive of and there's no loss</v>

600
00:41:16.621 --> 00:41:19.520
<v Speaker 5>in that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing but gain.</v>

601
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.760
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing but gain for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 5>around you if you do that,</v>

602
00:41:22.761 --> 00:41:27.410
<v Speaker 5>and so why would you not do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Except for bitterness and resentment?</v>

603
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:33.290
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps luck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lack of confidence perhaps because you</v>

604
00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:36.240
<v Speaker 5>haven't been encouraged properly and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's too bad.</v>

605
00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:44.130
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot different than being </v>
<v Speaker 5>empowered by the way to be encouraged.</v>

606
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:45.733
<v Speaker 5>It's a much better word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then I wrote the truth is the </v>

607
00:41:50.931 --> 00:41:55.340
<v Speaker 5>handmaiden of love and what I meant by </v>
<v Speaker 5>that because I've always wondered</v>

608
00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:57.733
<v Speaker 5>knowing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>truth in love or perhaps the cardinal </v>

609
00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:05.254
<v Speaker 5>virtues,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the proper way of </v>

610
00:42:06.851 --> 00:42:07.684
<v Speaker 5>conceptualizing the relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it seems to me that truth has to be </v>

611
00:42:10.811 --> 00:42:13.990
<v Speaker 5>oriented towards something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It needs a context.</v>

612
00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:18.100
<v Speaker 5>There's no such thing as not in the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I'm thinking of truth.</v>

613
00:42:18.101 --> 00:42:22.840
<v Speaker 5>There's no such thing as context free </v>
<v Speaker 5>truth up in the moral domain,</v>

614
00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:23.693
<v Speaker 5>not in the domain of action,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's the talking about truth in </v>

615
00:42:28.121 --> 00:42:28.954
<v Speaker 5>action.</v>

616
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:36.630
<v Speaker 5>Truth is the handmaiden of law bicycles </v>
<v Speaker 5>because having orienting yourself to the</v>

617
00:42:36.641 --> 00:42:38.830
<v Speaker 5>highest good that you could conceive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>

618
00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.260
<v Speaker 5>like Japan or wishing on the star and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Oak Hill.</v>

619
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:49.300
<v Speaker 5>Then you speak truth with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>orientation in mind.</v>

620
00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:55.740
<v Speaker 5>Having the faith,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suppose that because B is good,</v>

621
00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:58.083
<v Speaker 5>articulating its nature as clearly as </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible is the best way of continuing </v>

622
00:43:03.131 --> 00:43:06.220
<v Speaker 5>to encourage that good to spring </v>
<v Speaker 5>forward.</v>

623
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:12.190
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise you're presuming if you use </v>
<v Speaker 5>deceit and falsehood,</v>

624
00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.053
<v Speaker 5>that being is essentially corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 5>because otherwise you wouldn't have to </v>

625
00:43:17.921 --> 00:43:20.980
<v Speaker 5>falsify it in order to operate in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

626
00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.680
<v Speaker 5>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

627
00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:24.573
<v Speaker 5>you could make the courageous assumption</v>
<v Speaker 5>that being is good despite I suppose </v>

628
00:43:30.281 --> 00:43:34.780
<v Speaker 5>some evidence to the contrary and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>take the great risk of speaking truth in</v>

629
00:43:34.781 --> 00:43:35.614
<v Speaker 5>relationship to that under the </v>
<v Speaker 5>assumption that whatever speaking truth </v>

630
00:43:40.421 --> 00:43:43.330
<v Speaker 5>produces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's oriented properly,</v>

631
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:45.430
<v Speaker 5>is good.</v>

632
00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:49.980
<v Speaker 5>You have to make decisions like that in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your life.</v>

633
00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:53.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can give you a</v>

634
00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:56.423
<v Speaker 5>simple example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suppose awhile back I was speaking at </v>

635
00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:01.043
<v Speaker 5>mcmaster university and there were a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of protesters there and that made me </v>

636
00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:08.044
<v Speaker 5>nervous because you never know when </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone is going to do something </v>

637
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.753
<v Speaker 5>unforgivably stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so far I've been fortunate that in </v>

638
00:44:16.381 --> 00:44:20.940
<v Speaker 5>the controversies that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 5>embroiled in that no one has done that.</v>

639
00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:26.210
<v Speaker 5>They've pushed the edges of that but.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they haven't done it and truly thank</v>

640
00:44:27.541 --> 00:44:31.110
<v Speaker 5>God for that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but having said that,</v>

641
00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:36.930
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't upset by the presence of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>protesters because I couldn't tell if in</v>

642
00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:39.180
<v Speaker 5>fact they were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a good thing or a bad thing.</v>

643
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.030
<v Speaker 5>It could be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't be a bad thing.</v>

644
00:44:42.031 --> 00:44:46.680
<v Speaker 5>It was a consequence of what I had been </v>
<v Speaker 5>speaking up and that's what happened.</v>

645
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:47.963
<v Speaker 5>And so I thought there was no reason not</v>
<v Speaker 5>to let that play itself out because the </v>

646
00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.710
<v Speaker 5>end of the story has not yet been </v>
<v Speaker 5>reached.</v>

647
00:44:55.711 --> 00:45:00.540
<v Speaker 5>And the meaning of the events could not </v>
<v Speaker 5>yet be specified.</v>

648
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes in your family,</v>

649
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:04.643
<v Speaker 5>if you tell someone the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't mean I hope I've coined </v>

650
00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:10.140
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean black truths,</v>

651
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's white lies.</v>

652
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:17.360
<v Speaker 5>It's in a way that I with to preserve a </v>
<v Speaker 5>higher moral virtue,</v>

653
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:20.540
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you continue to get lower moral virtue.</v>

654
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:21.503
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps you don't tell a child dying of </v>

655
00:45:23.011 --> 00:45:23.844
<v Speaker 5>cancer that they're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know because it depends very </v>

656
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:28.160
<v Speaker 5>much on the particulars of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>

657
00:45:28.161 --> 00:45:31.710
<v Speaker 5>But you can understand that you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>mixed motives in a situation like that.</v>

658
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:32.993
<v Speaker 5>You can also speak black truths and </v>
<v Speaker 5>black truth is when you say something </v>

659
00:45:36.031 --> 00:45:36.864
<v Speaker 5>that's normally true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're using it as a weapon for </v>

660
00:45:38.401 --> 00:45:39.234
<v Speaker 5>another purpose and that's the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's that's really more a more </v>

661
00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:44.154
<v Speaker 5>profound an evil lie than any other one </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can possibly manage because </v>

662
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.020
<v Speaker 5>you're using the truth in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 5>corrupts.</v>

663
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:53.850
<v Speaker 5>It corrupts the truth itself and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>really reprehensible,</v>

664
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:58.020
<v Speaker 5>but barring the use of the block truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

665
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:01.550
<v Speaker 5>if within your family you say what you </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean,</v>

666
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.670
<v Speaker 5>say what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That can often cause tremendous upheaval</v>

667
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

668
00:46:07.861 --> 00:46:12.861
<v Speaker 5>because many relationships are cobbled </v>
<v Speaker 5>together by various alliances of willful</v>

669
00:46:13.951 --> 00:46:18.520
<v Speaker 5>blindness and things left unspoken and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a very bad longterm strategy.</v>

670
00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:20.043
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen people who are embroiled in </v>

671
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:24.743
<v Speaker 5>the death throes of a relationship that </v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps a crew 100,000 lies over its </v>

672
00:46:30.061 --> 00:46:33.010
<v Speaker 5>course and became so unstable because of</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

673
00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:33.913
<v Speaker 5>there is no hope for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Each of those lives was a forced stole </v>

674
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:39.173
<v Speaker 5>opportunity to address something </v>
<v Speaker 5>difficult with truth that was for gone </v>

675
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:44.003
<v Speaker 5>and all that does is make those unsolved</v>
<v Speaker 5>problems accumulate and multiply and </v>

676
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:54.850
<v Speaker 5>they eventually take over and attack and</v>
<v Speaker 5>generally when you're least expected.</v>

677
00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:56.183
<v Speaker 5>And so if you speak the truth in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>family cautiously and carefully and </v>

678
00:47:02.881 --> 00:47:07.881
<v Speaker 5>knowing that it could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will cause a that conflict,</v>

679
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.433
<v Speaker 5>but it's conceivable that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>least amount about people in conflict </v>

680
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:17.603
<v Speaker 5>that could exist to make things right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I believe that that is the case and </v>

681
00:47:24.221 --> 00:47:28.890
<v Speaker 5>that one of the things that I tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are too agreeable,</v>

682
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.093
<v Speaker 5>let's say I don't like to cause conflict</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I actually don't like to cause </v>

683
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:36.760
<v Speaker 5>conflict because I'm more agreeable than</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should be.</v>

684
00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:39.603
<v Speaker 5>Is that the ethical requirement to tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>the truth trumps any desire to avoid </v>

685
00:47:44.591 --> 00:47:46.870
<v Speaker 5>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's partly because</v>

686
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:52.040
<v Speaker 5>you only forestall the conflict and </v>
<v Speaker 5>magnified.</v>

687
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:57.390
<v Speaker 5>There's no escaping it and it's better </v>
<v Speaker 5>to engage in directly when it first with</v>

688
00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:01.200
<v Speaker 5>the necessity first arises then to </v>
<v Speaker 5>forestall.</v>

689
00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:02.123
<v Speaker 5>And so for people who are only too </v>
<v Speaker 5>willing to make peace at the expense of </v>

690
00:48:07.361 --> 00:48:08.194
<v Speaker 5>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say I try to encourage them to </v>

691
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:13.384
<v Speaker 5>generate conflict by telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I would say inevitably that has </v>

692
00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:24.901
<v Speaker 5>nothing but beneficial medium to </v>
<v Speaker 5>longterm consequences in their life,</v>

693
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:29.800
<v Speaker 5>even though it exposes them to more </v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict in the short term.</v>

694
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:35.430
<v Speaker 5>It also alleviates their resentment </v>
<v Speaker 5>because if someone has made me resentful</v>

695
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:40.390
<v Speaker 5>or if you become resentful because of </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's actions,</v>

696
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.793
<v Speaker 5>then there's only two real reasons why.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One is that you should pull up your </v>

697
00:48:47.171 --> 00:48:48.004
<v Speaker 5>socks and quit complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Quit whining because you're being </v>

698
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:57.990
<v Speaker 5>required to shoulder responsibility or </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're being oppressed and tyrannized by</v>

699
00:48:58.211 --> 00:49:03.211
<v Speaker 5>someone who doesn't know where their </v>
<v Speaker 5>proper limits are and in the former case</v>

700
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:07.780
<v Speaker 5>that you should get your act together </v>
<v Speaker 5>and in the latter case,</v>

701
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.900
<v Speaker 5>you should stand up and stop that person</v>
<v Speaker 5>from encroaching upon you</v>

702
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.880
<v Speaker 5>so you speak truth in your family.</v>

703
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.713
<v Speaker 5>Let's say perhaps even to yourself at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the risk of conflict and often severe </v>

704
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:26.730
<v Speaker 5>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the ultimate goal is to bring peace.</v>

705
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:28.023
<v Speaker 5>It's paradoxical because</v>
<v Speaker 5>we often don't think of a piece of </v>

706
00:49:31.751 --> 00:49:34.360
<v Speaker 5>something that's reached in conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that is precisely,</v>

707
00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:35.194
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why we value free speech because the </v>

708
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:38.284
<v Speaker 5>wisdom of humanity and the wisest people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we know that would include those </v>

709
00:49:41.831 --> 00:49:42.664
<v Speaker 5>people who were intelligent enough to </v>
<v Speaker 5>follow this country on the principles </v>

710
00:49:46.001 --> 00:49:46.834
<v Speaker 5>that is found on knew that whatever </v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict free speech might produce pale </v>

711
00:49:52.601 --> 00:49:53.434
<v Speaker 5>in comparison to the conflict that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>generated by tyranny and repression of </v>

712
00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.193
<v Speaker 5>exchange of opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so it's never a matter of picking a </v>

713
00:50:02.171 --> 00:50:05.500
<v Speaker 5>safe path because there's no such thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a safe path.</v>

714
00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:06.603
<v Speaker 5>It's only a matter of picking the path </v>
<v Speaker 5>that produces the least catastrophe </v>

715
00:50:09.851 --> 00:50:14.740
<v Speaker 5>possible and it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an inviolable principle,</v>

716
00:50:14.741 --> 00:50:15.574
<v Speaker 5>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and also the fundamental principle of </v>

717
00:50:16.931 --> 00:50:17.764
<v Speaker 5>Western civilization that speech freely </v>
<v Speaker 5>exchanged is the best pathway to peace </v>

718
00:50:23.801 --> 00:50:24.634
<v Speaker 5>and redemption that we have identified </v>
<v Speaker 5>and so it should remain untrammeled </v>

719
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.830
<v Speaker 5>under all circumstances possible.</v>

720
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:34.723
<v Speaker 5>Subject to very infrequent restraints of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sort that are already encapsulated </v>

721
00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.600
<v Speaker 5>in law such that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

722
00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:45.560
<v Speaker 5>you cannot incite someone to criminal </v>
<v Speaker 5>activity</v>

723
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:54.320
<v Speaker 5>humility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dialogue is the pathway.</v>

724
00:50:54.321 --> 00:50:56.960
<v Speaker 5>You can truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

725
00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:57.853
<v Speaker 5>I understand that you have to understand</v>
<v Speaker 5>why we fake and the reason we think is </v>

726
00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:06.373
<v Speaker 5>for the same reason that animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including us act and the reason that </v>

727
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:14.480
<v Speaker 5>animals act is so that they can survive </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the world.</v>

728
00:51:14.481 --> 00:51:17.030
<v Speaker 5>They do things so that they can survive </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the world,</v>

729
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:21.770
<v Speaker 5>but the problem with doing things in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

730
00:51:21.771 --> 00:51:26.771
<v Speaker 5>the problem with acting in the world is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can act in a manner that causes</v>

731
00:51:28.071 --> 00:51:28.904
<v Speaker 5>the substation of your Ba.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can act in a manner that gets you </v>

732
00:51:31.101 --> 00:51:31.934
<v Speaker 5>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can act in a manner that makes you </v>

733
00:51:33.261 --> 00:51:34.094
<v Speaker 5>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can make a mistake and you pay for </v>

734
00:51:36.111 --> 00:51:37.990
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's the danger of acting.</v>

735
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:43.060
<v Speaker 5>So human beings have replaced near </v>
<v Speaker 5>acting with thinking and what you do.</v>

736
00:51:43.581 --> 00:51:48.581
<v Speaker 5>What you think is you produced variance </v>
<v Speaker 5>of yourself and you walk them through an</v>

737
00:51:48.591 --> 00:51:49.424
<v Speaker 5>imaginary time and a place and you know </v>
<v Speaker 5>what happens to those imaginary </v>

738
00:51:53.331 --> 00:51:54.164
<v Speaker 5>variants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As they act out those particular </v>

739
00:51:57.111 --> 00:51:57.944
<v Speaker 5>patterns of behavior and you know which </v>
<v Speaker 5>ones get into trouble at which ones </v>

740
00:52:00.681 --> 00:52:01.514
<v Speaker 5>succeed and you let the ones that get </v>
<v Speaker 5>into trouble die and you let ones that </v>

741
00:52:05.061 --> 00:52:05.894
<v Speaker 5>succeed grip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hold of your behavior and act them out </v>

742
00:52:07.701 --> 00:52:08.534
<v Speaker 5>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a brilliant innovation you might </v>

743
00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:16.211
<v Speaker 5>say on the part of our ancestors to grow</v>
<v Speaker 5>cognitive resources,</v>

744
00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:19.453
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated enough to produce variance</v>
<v Speaker 5>of ourselves in a fictional space so </v>

745
00:52:24.771 --> 00:52:27.350
<v Speaker 5>that our thoughts could die instead of </v>
<v Speaker 5>us,</v>

746
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:32.420
<v Speaker 5>and so that's why we fail so that our </v>
<v Speaker 5>thoughts can die instead of us,</v>

747
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:38.290
<v Speaker 5>and then the reason that we speak is to </v>
<v Speaker 5>learn from other people's thoughts,</v>

748
00:52:39.111 --> 00:52:39.944
<v Speaker 5>but more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's that thinking individually is a </v>

749
00:52:45.981 --> 00:52:48.680
<v Speaker 5>very limited process because you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>ignorant,</v>

750
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:53.420
<v Speaker 5>which means you don't know everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>and not only that bias in many,</v>

751
00:52:53.421 --> 00:52:56.930
<v Speaker 5>many ways your bias by what you know and</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you don't know.</v>

752
00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:01.250
<v Speaker 5>You're biased by what assumed you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>biased by how you deceive yourself.</v>

753
00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:05.360
<v Speaker 5>You're biased by your temperament and </v>
<v Speaker 5>your locale at your and your position in</v>

754
00:53:05.361 --> 00:53:06.194
<v Speaker 5>history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of these things make you a very </v>

755
00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:12.100
<v Speaker 5>limited observer of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so I think as you like,</v>

756
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:13.773
<v Speaker 5>you can never think sufficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what we do because of that is </v>

757
00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:18.794
<v Speaker 5>taught.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so if I talk and I'm speaking </v>

758
00:53:21.651 --> 00:53:22.484
<v Speaker 5>truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which means I'm telling you how things </v>

759
00:53:24.741 --> 00:53:25.574
<v Speaker 5>appear to be to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that does not mean that I possess the </v>

760
00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:29.334
<v Speaker 5>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that means that I am saying as in an </v>

761
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:35.220
<v Speaker 5>articulate manner as I possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how things appear to me,</v>

762
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.113
<v Speaker 5>that you can tell me how things appear </v>
<v Speaker 5>to you and I could listen to you and </v>

763
00:53:39.211 --> 00:53:40.044
<v Speaker 5>maybe you can tell me some things about </v>
<v Speaker 5>how things appear that I don't already </v>

764
00:53:42.601 --> 00:53:43.434
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's such a good deal because the </v>

765
00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:50.070
<v Speaker 5>purpose of thinking is to let our </v>
<v Speaker 5>thoughts die instead of us.</v>

766
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:53.340
<v Speaker 5>And if you can kill one of my thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's stupid,</v>

767
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:57.450
<v Speaker 5>then I don't have to act it out and die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's like a really good deal.</v>

768
00:53:57.451 --> 00:53:58.284
<v Speaker 5>And so the reason that we engage in </v>
<v Speaker 5>dialogue is so that we can take our </v>

769
00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:04.213
<v Speaker 5>thoughts that protect us from our own </v>
<v Speaker 5>mortality and improve them and perhaps </v>

770
00:54:08.101 --> 00:54:11.370
<v Speaker 5>improve the morale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's just no loss in that.</v>

771
00:54:11.371 --> 00:54:15.660
<v Speaker 5>And so what that means in some senses </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can view everyone who disagrees</v>

772
00:54:15.661 --> 00:54:18.000
<v Speaker 5>with you as a source of potential </v>
<v Speaker 5>wisdom.</v>

773
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:20.190
<v Speaker 5>Because if you talk to someone who </v>
<v Speaker 5>agrees with you,</v>

774
00:54:20.191 --> 00:54:22.990
<v Speaker 5>all you're going to find out is what you</v>
<v Speaker 5>already know.</v>

775
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:23.873
<v Speaker 5>You already know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you talk to someone who doesn't </v>

776
00:54:26.191 --> 00:54:27.024
<v Speaker 5>agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe one out of 10 things they say or </v>

777
00:54:30.151 --> 00:54:32.640
<v Speaker 5>maybe one out of 100 things of God only </v>
<v Speaker 5>knows,</v>

778
00:54:32.641 --> 00:54:34.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

779
00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.710
<v Speaker 5>maybe there is wise is you and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>perverse way.</v>

780
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:37.883
<v Speaker 5>You can discuss something with them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll tell you something you never </v>

781
00:54:40.561 --> 00:54:41.394
<v Speaker 5>really thought of before and that'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>just make some potentially miserable </v>

782
00:54:45.811 --> 00:54:46.644
<v Speaker 5>event in your life that much less likely</v>
<v Speaker 5>and how good for you can that possibly </v>

783
00:54:50.101 --> 00:54:52.810
<v Speaker 5>be in like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do believe that I've learned that.</v>

784
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:53.783
<v Speaker 5>I've talked to you a great variety of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and I don't care if people agree </v>

785
00:54:57.001 --> 00:54:58.020
<v Speaker 5>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

786
00:54:58.021 --> 00:54:58.854
<v Speaker 5>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find it more interesting if they </v>

787
00:55:00.451 --> 00:55:01.284
<v Speaker 5>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't try to convince people </v>

788
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:07.970
<v Speaker 5>because I don't believe that I have any </v>
<v Speaker 5>right to determine their destiny.</v>

789
00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:11.490
<v Speaker 5>And I don't want to be turned in their </v>
<v Speaker 5>destiny because I don't know what's best</v>

790
00:55:11.491 --> 00:55:12.324
<v Speaker 5>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I do listen to all sorts of </v>

791
00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:20.540
<v Speaker 5>strange and unlikely people and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>tell me things that I don't know all the</v>

792
00:55:20.581 --> 00:55:24.030
<v Speaker 5>time and now it's just a spectacularly </v>
<v Speaker 5>good deal.</v>

793
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:24.953
<v Speaker 5>And I decided a long time ago that one </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the fundamental choices you make in </v>

794
00:55:28.441 --> 00:55:29.274
<v Speaker 5>life is whether your</v>
<v Speaker 5>in love with what you know or in love </v>

795
00:55:34.861 --> 00:55:35.694
<v Speaker 5>with what we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I would say there's a lot more of </v>

796
00:55:38.371 --> 00:55:40.800
<v Speaker 5>what you don't know that there is what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

797
00:55:40.801 --> 00:55:41.634
<v Speaker 5>And so it would be better to be in love </v>
<v Speaker 5>with what you don't know because you </v>

798
00:55:45.301 --> 00:55:49.500
<v Speaker 5>don't know so much that if you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>make friends with what you don't know,</v>

799
00:55:49.501 --> 00:55:51.780
<v Speaker 5>then you're going to be continually </v>
<v Speaker 5>enlightened.</v>

800
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:57.120
<v Speaker 5>And to be enlightened is to be engaged </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the process of being enlightened.</v>

801
00:55:57.150 --> 00:56:01.950
<v Speaker 5>Not to be enlightened in any final sense</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's just not possible.</v>

802
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:06.080
<v Speaker 5>So it's to act in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 5>continually in you.</v>

803
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:07.003
<v Speaker 5>And a huge part of that is humility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's another word that's very </v>

804
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:14.330
<v Speaker 5>difficult to use.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say like love because it's,</v>

805
00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:17.340
<v Speaker 5>it's another word that's been both to </v>
<v Speaker 5>death in some sense.</v>

806
00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:21.810
<v Speaker 5>And it sounds like kind of cringing </v>
<v Speaker 5>cowardice,</v>

807
00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:26.950
<v Speaker 5>limitation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's not what it means.</v>

808
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:27.813
<v Speaker 5>What it means is that you know that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there isn't enough to you and you can </v>

809
00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:35.350
<v Speaker 5>tell if there isn't enough to you </v>
<v Speaker 5>because your life isn't everything.</v>

810
00:56:35.351 --> 00:56:37.210
<v Speaker 5>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the arrogance,</v>

811
00:56:37.211 --> 00:56:38.044
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If your wife has everything you could </v>

812
00:56:39.191 --> 00:56:40.024
<v Speaker 5>imagine it to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well then perhaps you don't need </v>

813
00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:43.533
<v Speaker 5>humility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but since you're life is not everything </v>

814
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:46.233
<v Speaker 5>you could imagine it to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're deeply wrong about a lot of </v>

815
00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.460
<v Speaker 5>space,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so since you're wrong,</v>

816
00:56:51.461 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 5>then you should be looking around for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the opportunity to correct those errors.</v>

817
00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:56.733
<v Speaker 5>Because why wouldn't you accept to </v>
<v Speaker 5>protect your territory and that </v>

818
00:57:01.001 --> 00:57:01.834
<v Speaker 5>territory by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give them the existence of your own </v>

819
00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:05.283
<v Speaker 5>suffering is insufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so why are you playing to it so </v>

820
00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:12.160
<v Speaker 5>desperately?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't provide what you need or what</v>

821
00:57:12.161 --> 00:57:12.994
<v Speaker 5>you want and a transformation of it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the expansion and up and the refiguring </v>

822
00:57:17.831 --> 00:57:20.860
<v Speaker 5>of it might be everything that you could</v>
<v Speaker 5>possibly want.</v>

823
00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:21.693
<v Speaker 5>And so then you start to envision </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself instead of as the holder of a </v>

824
00:57:26.111 --> 00:57:26.944
<v Speaker 5>piece of territory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the person who is attempting to </v>

825
00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:31.954
<v Speaker 5>expand their capacity to act within all </v>
<v Speaker 5>sorts of territories and exposure to </v>

826
00:57:37.331 --> 00:57:41.350
<v Speaker 5>more people into more viewpoints,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially with those people are telling</v>

827
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.273
<v Speaker 5>you the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which they will do if you actually </v>

828
00:57:44.621 --> 00:57:45.454
<v Speaker 5>listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you can have your cake and eat it </v>

829
00:57:48.551 --> 00:57:50.530
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a great deal.</v>

830
00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.393
<v Speaker 5>And it's another way of reducing </v>
<v Speaker 5>unnecessary suffering in the world by </v>

831
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:56.103
<v Speaker 5>certainly reducing suffering and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps learning to be how to be a </v>

832
00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:01.953
<v Speaker 5>greater use to people around you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which again seems to be nothing but for </v>

833
00:58:05.771 --> 00:58:06.604
<v Speaker 5>the good.</v>

834
00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:11.373
<v Speaker 5>So humility is recognition of personal </v>
<v Speaker 5>insufficiency and the willingness to </v>

835
00:58:15.221 --> 00:58:16.054
<v Speaker 5>learn in order to overcome the </v>
<v Speaker 5>insufficiency and then to learn is to </v>

836
00:58:19.001 --> 00:58:23.170
<v Speaker 5>die voluntarily and be born again in </v>
<v Speaker 5>great ways in small.</v>

837
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:28.230
<v Speaker 5>That's an archetypal idea at the basis </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Western civilization is the idea that</v>

838
00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:30.213
<v Speaker 5>the logos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the capacity for truthful </v>

839
00:58:32.471 --> 00:58:33.304
<v Speaker 5>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is somehow associated with the act of </v>

840
00:58:36.581 --> 00:58:37.414
<v Speaker 5>death and rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there is multiple ways of </v>

841
00:58:41.201 --> 00:58:44.890
<v Speaker 5>interpreting that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And because I'm a psychologist,</v>

842
00:58:44.891 --> 00:58:45.724
<v Speaker 5>I tend to interpret it psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't claim that the psychological </v>

843
00:58:49.061 --> 00:58:53.110
<v Speaker 5>interpretation exhausts the concept </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I don't believe it does,</v>

844
00:58:53.111 --> 00:58:58.111
<v Speaker 5>but you see you are a certain way and </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of that way is an error.</v>

845
00:58:59.051 --> 00:59:03.130
<v Speaker 5>And then when you learn them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an error has taken place.</v>

846
00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:07.510
<v Speaker 5>You have to let go of the conceptions </v>
<v Speaker 5>that produced that error and that can be</v>

847
00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:09.520
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very painful.</v>

848
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:12.880
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you may have entered into a relationship</v>

849
00:59:12.881 --> 00:59:15.740
<v Speaker 5>that was pathological and you know it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>about analytical.</v>

850
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:16.583
<v Speaker 5>What you're hooked into it in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your emotions are hooked into it and </v>

851
00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:21.650
<v Speaker 5>you've configured your life around it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then in order to move forward,</v>

852
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.693
<v Speaker 5>you have to let go of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to admit to all the errors </v>

853
00:59:24.801 --> 00:59:25.634
<v Speaker 5>you've made through the time was wasted </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you have to allow a large part of </v>

854
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.233
<v Speaker 5>himself to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say you experienced in grief and </v>

855
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:38.411
<v Speaker 5>misery and sorrow and and and anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 5>and sleepless nights and all of that.</v>

856
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:42.850
<v Speaker 5>But it's better than dying completely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what?</v>

857
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:47.870
<v Speaker 5>What that indicates is that every time </v>
<v Speaker 5>you learned something large or small,</v>

858
00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:53.060
<v Speaker 5>the part that was in the era prior to </v>
<v Speaker 5>obtaining that bit of information has to</v>

859
00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.490
<v Speaker 5>deteriorating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>disappeared.</v>

860
00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:57.413
<v Speaker 5>There's pain associated with that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then there's the possibility for </v>

861
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.633
<v Speaker 5>growth and transformation and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>most fundamental decisions that human </v>

862
01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:06.644
<v Speaker 5>beings made in their lives is whether or</v>
<v Speaker 5>not they're going to identify with what </v>

863
01:00:09.621 --> 01:00:10.454
<v Speaker 5>they are or with what they could be and </v>
<v Speaker 5>if they identify with what they could </v>

864
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:15.223
<v Speaker 5>be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they have to continually let what </v>

865
01:00:16.431 --> 01:00:21.431
<v Speaker 5>they are die so what they could come </v>
<v Speaker 5>forward and so to learn is to dive.</v>

866
01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:23.443
<v Speaker 5>Voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to be born again in great ways and </v>

867
01:00:25.341 --> 01:00:30.341
<v Speaker 5>small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then I wrote,</v>

868
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:33.523
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>speech must be untrammeled so that </v>

869
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:41.650
<v Speaker 5>dialogue can take place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think of the discussions that I've had</v>

870
01:00:42.391 --> 01:00:43.224
<v Speaker 5>with my wife and my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but primarily with my wife who's a very </v>

871
01:00:49.501 --> 01:00:51.350
<v Speaker 5>honest person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

872
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:57.310
<v Speaker 5>I've been married for 28 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've known her for 45 years and I'm 55.</v>

873
01:01:00.781 --> 01:01:01.614
<v Speaker 5>It's a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'd been friends with very long time </v>

874
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:08.890
<v Speaker 5>and when she first came to be with me 30</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago,</v>

875
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.083
<v Speaker 5>I was learning to some of the things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I've talked to you about tonight </v>

876
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.930
<v Speaker 5>and I told her that if we were going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be together</v>

877
01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:22.350
<v Speaker 5>that she would have to tell the truth </v>
<v Speaker 5>because if you didn't tell the truth and</v>

878
01:01:22.351 --> 01:01:23.184
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't know who she was and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't know where we were and I </v>

879
01:01:26.401 --> 01:01:27.234
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't be able to solve any problems </v>
<v Speaker 5>and neither would she because we'd be </v>

880
01:01:29.551 --> 01:01:32.220
<v Speaker 5>living a fictional relationship with one</v>
<v Speaker 5>another.</v>

881
01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:37.140
<v Speaker 5>That struck me as a very bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so she took that to heart.</v>

882
01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:38.423
<v Speaker 5>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would also say it's like the more </v>

883
01:01:40.111 --> 01:01:45.111
<v Speaker 5>honest person than me</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not claiming claiming to be</v>

884
01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.880
<v Speaker 5>morally virtuous at any particular.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm aware why multitude of faults,</v>

885
01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:58.660
<v Speaker 5>but the fact she has ripped so tightly </v>
<v Speaker 5>onto the truth means that if I ever have</v>

886
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.400
<v Speaker 5>a problem that I can talk to her and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>know what she thinks.</v>

887
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:06.610
<v Speaker 5>She doesn't tell me that she's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've learned that you know,</v>

888
01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.210
<v Speaker 5>because to tell someone the truth does </v>
<v Speaker 5>not mean to play that you're correct.</v>

889
01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.373
<v Speaker 5>It only is to claim that you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 5>to communicate the way things look to </v>

890
01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 5>you as clearly as possible and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're open to the of correction,</v>

891
01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:21.373
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if someone can tell you how </v>

892
01:02:22.711 --> 01:02:25.210
<v Speaker 5>you're wrong precisely exactly how </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're wrong,</v>

893
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.093
<v Speaker 5>that's such a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If someone is willing to tell you the </v>

894
01:02:27.991 --> 01:02:28.824
<v Speaker 5>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you have the possibility of </v>

895
01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:31.014
<v Speaker 5>learning from them and then you have two</v>
<v Speaker 5>grades instead of one and that's a good </v>

896
01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:37.650
<v Speaker 5>deal and that's actually the spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 5>purpose of marriage,</v>

897
01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:38.484
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is to produce a union between two </v>

898
01:02:40.531 --> 01:02:41.364
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's predicated upon the truth so that </v>

899
01:02:42.901 --> 01:02:43.734
<v Speaker 5>the information flow between the kid </v>
<v Speaker 5>maximize and so that they can both be </v>

900
01:02:47.071 --> 01:02:47.904
<v Speaker 5>elevated above the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the the restrictions of their own </v>

901
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:58.200
<v Speaker 5>solitary bias existence and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>facilitates.</v>

902
01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:03.690
<v Speaker 5>That produces the proper environment for</v>
<v Speaker 5>children because then the child children</v>

903
01:03:03.691 --> 01:03:05.690
<v Speaker 5>don't face the father or the mother.</v>

904
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:06.543
<v Speaker 5>They faced the union of the father and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the mother and that's an inviolable </v>

905
01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:14.970
<v Speaker 5>forest and the children will attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 5>play one person off against the other.</v>

906
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.440
<v Speaker 5>Because they're tricky because they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>human and they're full of trouble.</v>

907
01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.880
<v Speaker 5>They're very good at poking and prodding</v>
<v Speaker 5>and manipulating and invest in,</v>

908
01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:25.403
<v Speaker 5>but they want to hit a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want to hit a wall that doesn't </v>

909
01:03:27.301 --> 01:03:28.134
<v Speaker 5>move because that makes them secure and </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a relationship that's based </v>

910
01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.174
<v Speaker 5>on truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you can talk about how it is that </v>

911
01:03:35.341 --> 01:03:37.380
<v Speaker 5>you should meet with your children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

912
01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:38.243
<v Speaker 5>and you can agree upon it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then when the children push the </v>

913
01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:41.124
<v Speaker 5>limits as they inevitably will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't find something spongy and </v>

914
01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:49.130
<v Speaker 5>dictate and eat a find something that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>strong and sturdy and it's a wall and of</v>

915
01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:52.620
<v Speaker 5>course they can't move through the wall </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's frustrating,</v>

916
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:53.454
<v Speaker 5>but then they're protected by the wall </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that stops them from being anxious </v>

917
01:03:57.450 --> 01:03:59.490
<v Speaker 5>beyond their capacity to bear.</v>

918
01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:00.803
<v Speaker 5>And so that structure that's brought </v>
<v Speaker 5>about by truthful communication builds </v>

919
01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:04.974
<v Speaker 5>the walls around children that allow </v>
<v Speaker 5>them to play freely and expand </v>

920
01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:10.620
<v Speaker 5>themselves and exist properly in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

921
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:16.010
<v Speaker 5>And so speech must be untraveled so that</v>
<v Speaker 5>dialogue can take place.</v>

922
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:18.090
<v Speaker 5>It's the only.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you talk to me,</v>

923
01:04:18.091 --> 01:04:21.290
<v Speaker 5>I want to know what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't say I don't agree with it.</v>

924
01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:22.163
<v Speaker 5>If you disagree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to fight with every bit of </v>

925
01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:30.450
<v Speaker 5>power at my disposal to determine who is</v>
<v Speaker 5>correct.</v>

926
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:31.463
<v Speaker 5>Well simultaneously recognizing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's possible that it's you and not me </v>

927
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.153
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not going to risk undergoing the</v>
<v Speaker 5>small or large death that I have to </v>

928
01:04:41.701 --> 01:04:42.534
<v Speaker 5>undergo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I find out that you're right without </v>

929
01:04:44.611 --> 01:04:45.444
<v Speaker 5>being convinced that you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm learned to hit him with </v>

930
01:04:47.671 --> 01:04:52.320
<v Speaker 5>everything I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but part of that is also a quote that if</v>

931
01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:53.243
<v Speaker 5>I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will provide me with a better </v>

932
01:04:54.571 --> 01:04:58.650
<v Speaker 5>argument than the one I already have and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that will make me better armed when I go</v>

933
01:04:58.651 --> 01:05:03.030
<v Speaker 5>out into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there's utility in neat,</v>

934
01:05:03.031 --> 01:05:08.031
<v Speaker 5>defeated by a skillful opponent and my </v>
<v Speaker 5>wife is precisely that sort of opponent.</v>

935
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.233
<v Speaker 5>Also has the addition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>remarkable talent of being able to </v>

936
01:05:11.821 --> 01:05:15.540
<v Speaker 5>string together a list,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a vicious insults,</v>

937
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:16.403
<v Speaker 5>one after the other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one I have ever encountered in my </v>

938
01:05:18.791 --> 01:05:19.624
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

939
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:28.150
<v Speaker 5>It's quite comical because sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 5>when we're embroiled in conflict,</v>

940
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.050
<v Speaker 5>she'll start to do that and say </v>
<v Speaker 5>something so outrageous,</v>

941
01:05:32.051 --> 01:05:36.940
<v Speaker 5>so absolutely beyond the Pale that he'll</v>
<v Speaker 5>make me laugh and crack up,</v>

942
01:05:36.941 --> 01:05:37.774
<v Speaker 5>and then of course that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>useful because if there is something </v>

943
01:05:40.901 --> 01:05:41.734
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous about quieting and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>always brings to mind and when she does </v>

944
01:05:46.091 --> 01:05:46.924
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then I'm reminded why I liked her so </v>

945
01:05:48.071 --> 01:05:48.904
<v Speaker 5>much back then and still do because it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>something to see someone with that kind </v>

946
01:05:52.391 --> 01:05:55.450
<v Speaker 5>of at spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that solar array for that,</v>

947
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:57.063
<v Speaker 5>so speech must be untrammeled so that </v>
<v Speaker 5>dialogue can take place so that we can </v>

948
01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:03.430
<v Speaker 5>all humbly learn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>

949
01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:04.264
<v Speaker 5>That's the other element of humility is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that humility is a precondition for </v>

950
01:06:06.971 --> 01:06:08.350
<v Speaker 5>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

951
01:06:08.351 --> 01:06:11.980
<v Speaker 5>and you have to be open to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility that you don't know what you</v>

952
01:06:11.981 --> 01:06:13.180
<v Speaker 5>need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>

953
01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:14.014
<v Speaker 5>It's not that you don't know everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>because obviously you don't know </v>

954
01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:18.400
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's more specific than that is that</v>

955
01:06:18.401 --> 01:06:21.040
<v Speaker 5>you may not know what you need to know.</v>

956
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:23.740
<v Speaker 5>Sometime in your life was going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>piece of information.</v>

957
01:06:23.741 --> 01:06:24.574
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty sure it'll be in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>negotiation or maybe in a medical </v>

958
01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:31.860
<v Speaker 5>decision or or maybe relationship </v>
<v Speaker 5>decision or an art or in a,</v>

959
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:33.510
<v Speaker 5>in a complex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a,</v>

960
01:06:33.511 --> 01:06:34.344
<v Speaker 5>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a complex tense situation with </v>

961
01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:40.810
<v Speaker 5>urgency and danger and you'll need a </v>
<v Speaker 5>tool and then in there or things will go</v>

962
01:06:40.811 --> 01:06:45.811
<v Speaker 5>badly for you and you won't have it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because there was an opportunity at some</v>

963
01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:46.834
<v Speaker 5>point in your life where have you been </v>
<v Speaker 5>slightly more humbled you would have </v>

964
01:06:49.481 --> 01:06:50.314
<v Speaker 5>learned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would have learned how to formulate </v>

965
01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:56.860
<v Speaker 5>and and utilize that tool right then and</v>
<v Speaker 5>there and you didn't,</v>

966
01:06:56.861 --> 01:06:58.010
<v Speaker 5>and that left you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

967
01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:04.140
<v Speaker 5>and the thing is that your most powerful</v>
<v Speaker 5>arms are your words by any,</v>

968
01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:10.950
<v Speaker 5>by any measure and the opportunity that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to sharpen your capacity to use</v>

969
01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:16.861
<v Speaker 5>your words through dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why space is cannot be safe for</v>

970
01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.970
<v Speaker 5>any length of time.</v>

971
01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.273
<v Speaker 5>It's because of the safer the space is </v>
<v Speaker 5>made now that more dangerous the space </v>

972
01:07:23.161 --> 01:07:23.994
<v Speaker 5>is made in the future and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that people are unwilling to </v>

973
01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:29.163
<v Speaker 5>understand it because they don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>face the fundamental truth that life is </v>

974
01:07:31.961 --> 01:07:34.060
<v Speaker 5>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no real escape from it,</v>

975
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.313
<v Speaker 5>and so they make artificial spaces where</v>
<v Speaker 5>people could delude themselves </v>

976
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:41.650
<v Speaker 5>temporarily into naive again that life </v>
<v Speaker 5>can be made safe,</v>

977
01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:45.270
<v Speaker 5>would in fact the best you could do is </v>
<v Speaker 5>arm people to move forward in the past.</v>

978
01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.113
<v Speaker 5>When you do that is to test them with </v>
<v Speaker 5>combat at every opportunity that you </v>

979
01:07:49.421 --> 01:07:50.254
<v Speaker 5>have to do that with the most carefully </v>
<v Speaker 5>crafted arguments at your disposal and </v>

980
01:07:53.921 --> 01:07:56.980
<v Speaker 5>to teach them to stand up and defend </v>
<v Speaker 5>their thoughts so that when they entered</v>

981
01:07:56.981 --> 01:07:57.814
<v Speaker 5>the real world and they're challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they know how to stand up forthrightly </v>

982
01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.760
<v Speaker 5>instead of crying and running home.</v>

983
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Thank</v>

984
01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:23.440
<v Speaker 5>so that we can all humbling so that </v>
<v Speaker 5>truth conserved love.</v>

985
01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:27.500
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the goal is to</v>

986
01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.790
<v Speaker 5>inform yourself and that's a good word </v>
<v Speaker 5>to inform yourself.</v>

987
01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:35.624
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's of course the short form of </v>

988
01:08:37.221 --> 01:08:38.054
<v Speaker 5>information and I really liked that word</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it breaks into in formation and </v>

989
01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:45.620
<v Speaker 5>something information is formed </v>
<v Speaker 5>properly.</v>

990
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:46.431
<v Speaker 5>Ambien,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the order.</v>

991
01:08:46.431 --> 01:08:48.800
<v Speaker 5>It's information,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

992
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:53.810
<v Speaker 5>It's everything is aligned and moving in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same way like an army of information</v>

993
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.760
<v Speaker 5>and so if you expose yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 5>information,</v>

994
01:08:56.810 --> 01:09:01.810
<v Speaker 5>you get informed and we put yourself </v>
<v Speaker 5>information and then your crystalline in</v>

995
01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:06.950
<v Speaker 5>your structure and and and and difficult</v>
<v Speaker 5>to contend with and that's what you want</v>

996
01:09:06.951 --> 01:09:08.930
<v Speaker 5>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing to be.</v>

997
01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:09.973
<v Speaker 5>And you do that by</v>
<v Speaker 5>learning humbling and that once you are </v>

998
01:09:15.411 --> 01:09:20.030
<v Speaker 5>in Toronto than your capacity to speak </v>
<v Speaker 5>properly and to formulate your arguments</v>

999
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:20.864
<v Speaker 5>and to negotiate and to formulate </v>
<v Speaker 5>problems and to formulate solutions and </v>

1000
01:09:25.041 --> 01:09:28.280
<v Speaker 5>to seek consensus makes you powerful </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough.</v>

1001
01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:32.240
<v Speaker 5>Not so much that tragedy stays away from</v>
<v Speaker 5>you because it can't,</v>

1002
01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:33.083
<v Speaker 5>but so that when tragedy does come along</v>
<v Speaker 5>and perhaps even when malevolence comes </v>

1003
01:09:37.191 --> 01:09:38.024
<v Speaker 5>along that you'll be maximally prepared </v>
<v Speaker 5>for it and we'll be able to deal with </v>

1004
01:09:41.151 --> 01:09:41.984
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is what you have to do as a human </v>

1005
01:09:43.191 --> 01:09:45.920
<v Speaker 5>being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because there is in fact no avoiding it.</v>

1006
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 5>And so what you do with someone that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>love as you make them strong,</v>

1007
01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:50.893
<v Speaker 5>you do not tell them that the world's </v>
<v Speaker 5>safe and that they're secure and that </v>

1008
01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:59.480
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing there to get the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because there is everything there to get</v>

1009
01:09:59.481 --> 01:10:00.314
<v Speaker 5>the</v>

1010
01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.393
<v Speaker 5>and so the best you can do is strengthen</v>
<v Speaker 5>them and that's what a college is </v>

1011
01:10:05.891 --> 01:10:09.700
<v Speaker 5>supposed to do and that's where the </v>
<v Speaker 5>university is supposed to do and I would</v>

1012
01:10:09.701 --> 01:10:13.540
<v Speaker 5>say that the colleges and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>universities are increasingly failing on</v>

1013
01:10:13.541 --> 01:10:14.374
<v Speaker 5>both of those fronts and it might be </v>
<v Speaker 5>said that that's isolated only to the </v>

1014
01:10:18.161 --> 01:10:18.994
<v Speaker 5>colleges and universities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we should remember that those are </v>

1015
01:10:21.341 --> 01:10:22.174
<v Speaker 5>the storehouses of our cultural </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowledge and the generators of the new </v>

1016
01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:27.124
<v Speaker 5>leaders and if the university's falter </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's particularly true of the </v>

1017
01:10:30.191 --> 01:10:31.024
<v Speaker 5>humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then that falter and undermines the </v>

1018
01:10:33.011 --> 01:10:36.250
<v Speaker 5>entire culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps the entire civilization,</v>

1019
01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:37.203
<v Speaker 5>and I do believe that we are in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>process of doing precisely that now and </v>

1020
01:10:42.011 --> 01:10:47.011
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that what I did six months</v>
<v Speaker 5>ago and the creating of these two little</v>

1021
01:10:47.561 --> 01:10:48.394
<v Speaker 5>videos complaining about a rather </v>
<v Speaker 5>obscure piece of legislation in the </v>

1022
01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:52.714
<v Speaker 5>rather tiny and insignificant country </v>
<v Speaker 5>would have the track that the attention </v>

1023
01:10:57.430 --> 01:11:00.430
<v Speaker 5>that it did attract.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it was only about pronouns.</v>

1024
01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:04.180
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly not only about pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

1025
01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:09.040
<v Speaker 5>it's not about pronouns at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the truth can serve low.</v>

1026
01:11:09.041 --> 01:11:09.874
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1027
01:11:13.210 --> 01:11:14.580
<v Speaker 2>well you want to articulate</v>

1028
01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:17.280
<v Speaker 5>yourself and you want to be information </v>
<v Speaker 5>so that</v>

1029
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:21.660
<v Speaker 5>you can formulate your existence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You</v>

1030
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:24.083
<v Speaker 5>generate your narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could take your position in the </v>

1031
01:11:26.221 --> 01:11:27.054
<v Speaker 5>world forthrightly and and with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>capacity to intimidate when necessary </v>

1032
01:11:32.041 --> 01:11:35.460
<v Speaker 5>and with the capacity to be a monster </v>
<v Speaker 5>when necessary,</v>

1033
01:11:35.461 --> 01:11:36.294
<v Speaker 5>have to be civilized and unnecessary and</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was nothing in that that making </v>

1034
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:41.213
<v Speaker 5>yourself sharper or improve to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself sharper is to carry a sharper </v>

1035
01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:49.410
<v Speaker 5>sort.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course in these days with the highest</v>

1036
01:11:49.411 --> 01:11:53.610
<v Speaker 5>virtue is harmlessness message like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>seems positive reverse,</v>

1037
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.473
<v Speaker 5>but it's completely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is why I think my talks attracts </v>

1038
01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:00.780
<v Speaker 5>men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that a woman who hates,</v>

1039
01:12:00.781 --> 01:12:04.020
<v Speaker 5>he wants to castrate you and make you </v>
<v Speaker 5>safe that way,</v>

1040
01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:04.883
<v Speaker 5>but a woman who loves you and wants to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make you incredibly powerful and wise </v>

1041
01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:08.873
<v Speaker 5>because then your housekeeper </v>
<v Speaker 5>destruction is regulated in that manner </v>

1042
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.133
<v Speaker 5>and you're still good for something and </v>
<v Speaker 5>so that would be the optimal solution </v>

1043
01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:20.010
<v Speaker 5>rather than merely weakening and </v>
<v Speaker 5>destroying.</v>

1044
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:24.000
<v Speaker 5>And I think we've had plenty of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've had more than enough,</v>

1045
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:29.390
<v Speaker 5>and I know as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but women who have their souls intact,</v>

1046
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:34.500
<v Speaker 5>I would rather have monstrous man who </v>
<v Speaker 5>were civilized and cringing milk sops,</v>

1047
01:12:34.501 --> 01:12:36.360
<v Speaker 5>who were harmless but good for nothing.</v>

1048
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1049
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:51.570
<v Speaker 5>Most women already have enough children </v>
<v Speaker 5>to take care of.</v>

1050
01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:01.380
<v Speaker 5>So the truth conserved love so that </v>
<v Speaker 5>suffering can be ameliorated.</v>

1051
01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:03.740
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously that's the goal.</v>

1052
01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.613
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1053
01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:05.453
<v Speaker 5>I hear people all the time who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>possessed by a certain nihilism of </v>

1054
01:13:08.911 --> 01:13:13.911
<v Speaker 5>spirit and that's not surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The understructure of the foundations of</v>

1055
01:13:13.951 --> 01:13:14.784
<v Speaker 5>our cultural to be severely assaulted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say there were under tremendous </v>

1056
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:23.850
<v Speaker 5>assault.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a process that has been unfolding</v>

1057
01:13:23.851 --> 01:13:27.450
<v Speaker 5>for very many years perhaps since the </v>
<v Speaker 5>development of empirical science,</v>

1058
01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.880
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is one of the contributing factors</v>

1059
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.950
<v Speaker 5>because it's undermined our faith in </v>
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>

1060
01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:36.160
<v Speaker 5>in our traditional religious viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was structure our,</v>

1061
01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:39.600
<v Speaker 5>our moral behaviors or decisions about </v>
<v Speaker 5>value.</v>

1062
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:40.913
<v Speaker 5>There's many other reasons why the </v>
<v Speaker 5>foundations upon which Western </v>

1063
01:13:44.491 --> 01:13:47.750
<v Speaker 5>civilization rests are under assault.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1064
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:51.410
<v Speaker 5>and because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's easy to be uncertain and to say,</v>

1065
01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:53.340
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the meaning of life?</v>

1066
01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:56.310
<v Speaker 5>There is nothing to life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's rolling,</v>

1067
01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.353
<v Speaker 5>rolling significant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's nothing but suffering and </v>

1068
01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:03.050
<v Speaker 5>why should I do anything in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 5>all?</v>

1069
01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:04.980
<v Speaker 5>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1070
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:05.873
<v Speaker 5>we can take that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Part of that is a fundamental truth is </v>

1071
01:14:08.371 --> 01:14:11.890
<v Speaker 5>that the fact that life is suffering is </v>
<v Speaker 5>a meeting.</v>

1072
01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:16.160
<v Speaker 5>It's a meeting that no amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>rational argumentation we'll,</v>

1073
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will,</v>

1074
01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:19.840
<v Speaker 5>will rescue you from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

1075
01:14:19.841 --> 01:14:24.220
<v Speaker 5>the more nihilistic you come,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more the fact that life is suffering</v>

1076
01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:27.850
<v Speaker 5>becomes self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost as if he was trying to teach</v>

1077
01:14:27.851 --> 01:14:30.610
<v Speaker 5>you something and it is trying to teach </v>
<v Speaker 5>you something.</v>

1078
01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.473
<v Speaker 5>It's trying to teach you that you cannot</v>
<v Speaker 5>argue with your way of suffering and so </v>

1079
01:14:34.811 --> 01:14:36.790
<v Speaker 5>then you might as well do something </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

1080
01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:38.170
<v Speaker 5>And then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1081
01:14:38.171 --> 01:14:41.080
<v Speaker 5>that's where you can find the meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very straightforward.</v>

1082
01:14:41.081 --> 01:14:44.770
<v Speaker 5>There's suffering in the world and much </v>
<v Speaker 5>of it is aborad and,</v>

1083
01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:45.830
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1084
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.990
<v Speaker 5>and unacceptable to anyone who attends </v>
<v Speaker 5>to it.</v>

1085
01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:55.050
<v Speaker 5>Anyone looks at it and the right answer </v>
<v Speaker 5>to a child who's,</v>

1086
01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:02.360
<v Speaker 5>who's been beaten and abused is not</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's going to care in a million years.</v>

1087
01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.180
<v Speaker 5>But what can I do to stop that right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now?</v>

1088
01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.033
<v Speaker 5>And the nihilistic response that </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything is insignificant means that </v>

1089
01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:14.500
<v Speaker 5>the pain of children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1090
01:15:14.501 --> 01:15:15.334
<v Speaker 5>is insignificant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that seems to be to me close enough </v>

1091
01:15:19.391 --> 01:15:22.450
<v Speaker 5>to self evidently wrong so that it's an </v>
<v Speaker 5>argument.</v>

1092
01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:23.284
<v Speaker 5>15 just be dispensed with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I might say to people who are </v>

1093
01:15:26.681 --> 01:15:27.514
<v Speaker 5>wondering where to look for the meaning </v>
<v Speaker 5>in their life is to take the self </v>

1094
01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:34.270
<v Speaker 5>evident phenomena of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of phenomenon,</v>

1095
01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:35.493
<v Speaker 5>of suffering seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to orient themselves as rapidly as </v>

1096
01:15:38.561 --> 01:15:39.394
<v Speaker 5>possible towards its amelioration and to</v>
<v Speaker 5>work diligently towards that and for a </v>

1097
01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:44.794
<v Speaker 5>number of years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then to reevaluate the wife at the </v>

1098
01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:50.410
<v Speaker 5>end of that and see if they think any </v>
<v Speaker 5>differently about the world because they</v>

1099
01:15:50.411 --> 01:15:51.244
<v Speaker 5>certainly will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the nihilistic argument to me </v>

1100
01:15:54.911 --> 01:15:59.911
<v Speaker 5>seems remarkably weak both on its space </v>
<v Speaker 5>and in depth because there are things to</v>

1101
01:16:01.121 --> 01:16:05.440
<v Speaker 5>be done and the things that need to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>done are obvious to anyone who will open</v>

1102
01:16:05.441 --> 01:16:06.940
<v Speaker 5>their eyes and look at them.</v>

1103
01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:08.450
<v Speaker 5>And so then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1104
01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.333
<v Speaker 5>open your eyes and look what needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>done immediately around you and do it </v>

1105
01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:16.920
<v Speaker 5>and keep doing that and keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you'll find that the APP,</v>

1106
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:17.793
<v Speaker 5>the questions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the answers to the questions that you </v>

1107
01:16:20.351 --> 01:16:23.350
<v Speaker 5>have been paralyzed you for so many </v>
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>

1108
01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:28.120
<v Speaker 5>will manifest themselves to you clearly </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough so that you won't have to believe</v>

1109
01:16:28.121 --> 01:16:28.954
<v Speaker 5>that because they will be self evident </v>
<v Speaker 5>so that suffering can be ameliorated so </v>

1110
01:16:34.391 --> 01:16:36.970
<v Speaker 5>that we can all stumble forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1111
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.863
<v Speaker 5>why I stumbled well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's because we stumbled when we move </v>

1112
01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:42.573
<v Speaker 5>forward because we don't know everything</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so we moved forward in error </v>

1113
01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:49.990
<v Speaker 5>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why we need to speak with other</v>

1114
01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:50.853
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can listen so that we don't stumble and </v>

1115
01:16:53.561 --> 01:16:54.394
<v Speaker 5>fall and be unable to arise and so we </v>
<v Speaker 5>stumbled forward because forward </v>

1116
01:17:00.431 --> 01:17:01.264
<v Speaker 5>movement is necessary to human beings </v>
<v Speaker 5>and forward movement implies that there </v>

1117
01:17:05.111 --> 01:17:10.111
<v Speaker 5>is something better to go to and there </v>
<v Speaker 5>is something better to go to the that is</v>

1118
01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:14.053
<v Speaker 5>at least a world where there is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>least amount of suffering that is </v>

1119
01:17:19.341 --> 01:17:22.310
<v Speaker 5>commensurate with the existence of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1120
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:27.490
<v Speaker 5>And I would say that we have ameliorated</v>
<v Speaker 5>a substantial amount of suffering in the</v>

1121
01:17:27.801 --> 01:17:28.634
<v Speaker 5>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're doing a very good job of doing </v>

1122
01:17:30.441 --> 01:17:33.140
<v Speaker 5>such things as combating absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 5>already.</v>

1123
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.273
<v Speaker 5>You may or may not know that every </v>
<v Speaker 5>single day about 150,000 people </v>

1124
01:17:37.971 --> 01:17:38.804
<v Speaker 5>worldwide are lifted out of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 5>poverty and about 300,000 people are </v>

1125
01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:47.630
<v Speaker 5>attached to the electrical grid that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>

1126
01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:48.523
<v Speaker 5>We have the enriching the bottom segment</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the world's population for the last </v>

1127
01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:53.534
<v Speaker 5>15 years at a rate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's absolutely unprecedented in human </v>

1128
01:17:56.931 --> 01:17:57.764
<v Speaker 5>history and that makes me wonder just </v>
<v Speaker 5>how well we could do if everyone really </v>

1129
01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:06.830
<v Speaker 5>put their shoulders to the wheel and </v>
<v Speaker 5>pushed and so if we did that together,</v>

1130
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:10.910
<v Speaker 5>then perhaps we won't degenerate into </v>
<v Speaker 5>absolute chaos,</v>

1131
01:18:10.911 --> 01:18:15.830
<v Speaker 5>which is certainly something that learns</v>
<v Speaker 5>now and is a real threat.</v>

1132
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.560
<v Speaker 5>We're at a crisis point as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 5>tell,</v>

1133
01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.000
<v Speaker 5>and we need to determine whether we want</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything to go to hell,</v>

1134
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.863
<v Speaker 5>which it certainly could and I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>recommend that or whether or not we can </v>

1135
01:18:27.351 --> 01:18:28.340
<v Speaker 5>work together.</v>

1136
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:29.683
<v Speaker 5>And that brings me to the last line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is that so that we can all </v>

1137
01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:38.740
<v Speaker 5>stumbled forward to the Kingdom of God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And why do I put it that way?</v>

1138
01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:41.210
<v Speaker 5>And the reason I put it that way is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because.</v>

1139
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:42.111
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1140
01:18:42.111 --> 01:18:42.944
<v Speaker 5>everybody does really know what that </v>
<v Speaker 5>means even though they may not believe </v>

1141
01:18:45.771 --> 01:18:47.670
<v Speaker 5>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't really matter.</v>

1142
01:18:47.671 --> 01:18:48.504
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that to believe is to act and </v>

1143
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.273
<v Speaker 5>not to spout a set of statements and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>is certainly possible to act as if what </v>

1144
01:18:57.951 --> 01:18:58.784
<v Speaker 5>you were attempting to do is bring about</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Kingdom of God and I would say that </v>

1145
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:02.833
<v Speaker 5>doing so is something that will </v>
<v Speaker 5>radically justify your miserable </v>

1146
01:19:05.631 --> 01:19:06.464
<v Speaker 5>existence and that's really what you </v>
<v Speaker 5>need is radical justification for your </v>

1147
01:19:10.731 --> 01:19:11.564
<v Speaker 5>miserable existence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And because human beings are so </v>

1148
01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:17.030
<v Speaker 5>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really powerful beyond the limits of our</v>

1149
01:19:17.031 --> 01:19:17.864
<v Speaker 5>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have no idea what our ultimate </v>

1150
01:19:19.491 --> 01:19:20.840
<v Speaker 5>destiny might be.</v>

1151
01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:23.990
<v Speaker 5>That it's not unclear what our limits </v>
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>

1152
01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:28.400
<v Speaker 5>That if we decided to improve the place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

1153
01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:29.293
<v Speaker 5>and I would say starting with ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that is the safest and humblest </v>

1154
01:19:32.931 --> 01:19:34.310
<v Speaker 5>way to begin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That.</v>

1155
01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:35.144
<v Speaker 5>There's no telling where we might end up</v>
<v Speaker 5>and since we're all fragile and </v>

1156
01:19:38.931 --> 01:19:42.140
<v Speaker 5>vulnerable creatures and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>lose everything anyways.</v>

1157
01:19:42.141 --> 01:19:46.820
<v Speaker 5>We might as well risk everything to </v>
<v Speaker 5>obtain the highest possible good,</v>

1158
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:47.743
<v Speaker 5>and then that will make the mystery that</v>
<v Speaker 5>constitutes our life bearable as a </v>

1159
01:19:51.141 --> 01:19:51.974
<v Speaker 5>consequence of our intrinsic nobility </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's nothing in that accept the </v>

1160
01:19:56.781 --> 01:19:57.614
<v Speaker 5>good and so then why not do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so that's what I would enjoy and </v>

1161
01:20:03.891 --> 01:20:08.891
<v Speaker 5>encourage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>encourage everyone to do because there's</v>

1162
01:20:09.151 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 5>nothing better to do than now and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>might as well all do that,</v>

1163
01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.050
<v Speaker 5>which there is nothing better than that.</v>

1164
01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Thank you</v>

1165
01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:33.520
<v Speaker 5>and so all repeat the outline</v>

1166
01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.233
<v Speaker 2>and then</v>

1167
01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:40.543
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was talking about the boundaries of </v>

1168
01:20:43.221 --> 01:20:44.054
<v Speaker 5>free speech and I believe that speech </v>
<v Speaker 5>should be untrammeled because it's too </v>

1169
01:20:48.231 --> 01:20:52.550
<v Speaker 5>dangerous with counseling does not mean </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1170
01:20:52.551 --> 01:20:57.170
<v Speaker 5>I believe that speech free speech comes </v>
<v Speaker 5>without responsibility.</v>

1171
01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:58.933
<v Speaker 5>I believe quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The free speech carries with it the </v>

1172
01:21:01.731 --> 01:21:02.564
<v Speaker 5>highest responsibility because you went </v>
<v Speaker 5>right to speak and wish to shoulder the </v>

1173
01:21:08.901 --> 01:21:09.734
<v Speaker 5>responsibility of speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you have to contend with the fact </v>

1174
01:21:12.831 --> 01:21:13.664
<v Speaker 5>that your words are the force that </v>
<v Speaker 5>shapes the world and that with every </v>

1175
01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:18.643
<v Speaker 5>word you utter things tilt slightly </v>
<v Speaker 5>heavenward or slightly pell word and </v>

1176
01:21:23.731 --> 01:21:24.564
<v Speaker 5>that that responsibility rests firmly on</v>
<v Speaker 5>your shoulders and it's inescapable and </v>

1177
01:21:30.411 --> 01:21:31.244
<v Speaker 5>that's a terrible thing to realize is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very meaningful thing to realize and </v>

1178
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:38.270
<v Speaker 5>people saying that they would like their</v>
<v Speaker 5>life to be meaningful,</v>

1179
01:21:38.271 --> 01:21:43.271
<v Speaker 5>but that's a questionable claim because </v>
<v Speaker 5>to recognize your life is meaningful,</v>

1180
01:21:44.061 --> 01:21:44.894
<v Speaker 5>is to understand that everything you do </v>
<v Speaker 5>matters and that what it means for </v>

1181
01:21:47.961 --> 01:21:52.961
<v Speaker 5>things to matter is that you're deciding</v>
<v Speaker 5>in some sense between heaven on earth,</v>

1182
01:21:53.210 --> 01:21:57.710
<v Speaker 5>hell on earth with every decision that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you make and the decisions that you make</v>

1183
01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:58.573
<v Speaker 5>echo far beyond you in ways that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>almost incomprehensible and the destiny </v>

1184
01:22:02.601 --> 01:22:03.434
<v Speaker 5>of the world is determined by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>collective decisions of all the </v>

1185
01:22:07.491 --> 01:22:11.540
<v Speaker 5>individuals that make up the world and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we're all locked together.</v>

1186
01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:16.030
<v Speaker 5>Deciding in which metaphysical direction</v>
<v Speaker 5>our little planet will</v>

1187
01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:18.130
<v Speaker 2>we'll go.</v>

1188
01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:22.500
<v Speaker 5>So free speech carries with it heavy </v>
<v Speaker 5>responsibility,</v>

1189
01:22:22.501 --> 01:22:23.334
<v Speaker 5>but the responsibility is something you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want because it justifies suffering of </v>

1190
01:22:26.491 --> 01:22:29.100
<v Speaker 5>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Said life is suffering.</v>

1191
01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:34.590
<v Speaker 5>Love is the desire to see necessary </v>
<v Speaker 5>suffering.</v>

1192
01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:39.370
<v Speaker 5>Meliorative truth is the handmaid of </v>
<v Speaker 5>love.</v>

1193
01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:45.980
<v Speaker 5>Dialogue is the pathway to truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>humility,</v>

1194
01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.093
<v Speaker 5>that's recognition of personal </v>
<v Speaker 5>insufficiency and the willingness to </v>

1195
01:22:52.431 --> 01:22:53.264
<v Speaker 5>learn</v>
<v Speaker 5>to learn is to dive voluntarily and to </v>

1196
01:22:58.631 --> 01:23:00.760
<v Speaker 5>be born again in great ways in small</v>

1197
01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.633
<v Speaker 2>Paul,</v>

1198
01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 5>so speech must be untrammeled so that </v>
<v Speaker 5>dialogue</v>

1199
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:06.993
<v Speaker 4>can take place so that we can all humbly</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn so that truth can serve law so </v>

1200
01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:17.161
<v Speaker 4>that suffering can be ameliorated so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we can all step forward towards the</v>

1201
01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:19.983
<v Speaker 4>Kingdom of God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you for inviting me to </v>

1202
01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:28.450
<v Speaker 4>Mcminnville.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>

1203
01:23:56.770 --> 01:23:57.603
<v Speaker 4>Now we'd like to take the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 4>open things up for questions to answer </v>

1204
01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:11.930
<v Speaker 4>and what we might do here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously</v>

1205
01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:18.680
<v Speaker 4>a the person in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>simple answer your questions.</v>

1206
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:33.130
<v Speaker 4>Thanks</v>
<v Speaker 4>for everything you said.</v>

1207
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:38.703
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've ever had the opportunity to see so </v>

1208
01:24:44.531 --> 01:24:49.480
<v Speaker 4>many people in here</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he knew of test,</v>

1209
01:24:49.481 --> 01:24:51.370
<v Speaker 4>validated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My whole exists.</v>

1210
01:24:51.490 --> 01:24:56.490
<v Speaker 4>To thank is we're working importantly in</v>
<v Speaker 4>India</v>

1211
01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:11.040
<v Speaker 4>and we're alone and we're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't eat together.</v>

1212
01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:13.803
<v Speaker 4>It's like a death trap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Medicare bringing people together is a </v>

1213
01:25:16.481 --> 01:25:21.481
<v Speaker 4>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it that people are resonating to</v>

1214
01:25:22.330 --> 01:25:23.163
<v Speaker 4>that we can use that will bring people </v>
<v Speaker 4>together so that we can talk about </v>

1215
01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:31.831
<v Speaker 4>solutions?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1216
01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:49.740
<v Speaker 4>I watched this Netflix special with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russell Peters and Russell Peters,</v>

1217
01:25:50.981 --> 01:25:53.380
<v Speaker 4>for those of you who don't know is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Canadian comic.</v>

1218
01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.473
<v Speaker 4>He's of Indian descent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was raised in a suburb in Toronto </v>

1219
01:25:59.290 --> 01:26:04.290
<v Speaker 4>which makes them acutely or culinary </v>
<v Speaker 4>Canadian and he's very</v>

1220
01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:09.980
<v Speaker 7>similar to the Canadian culture and </v>
<v Speaker 7>Russell has made his living</v>

1221
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:12.763
<v Speaker 7>insulting every racial and ethnic group </v>
<v Speaker 7>that he could possibly insulted and so </v>

1222
01:26:17.181 --> 01:26:22.181
<v Speaker 7>interesting because he filled up an </v>
<v Speaker 7>entire arena in London.</v>

1223
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:27.410
<v Speaker 7>I think it was the most people that have</v>
<v Speaker 7>ever gathered together to see a comedian</v>

1224
01:26:27.411 --> 01:26:30.500
<v Speaker 7>before and it was a United Nations in </v>
<v Speaker 7>the.</v>

1225
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:31.663
<v Speaker 7>In the arena.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The Arabs were there and the and the </v>

1226
01:26:34.881 --> 01:26:38.750
<v Speaker 7>Jews were there and the Russians were </v>
<v Speaker 7>there in the south.</v>

1227
01:26:38.751 --> 01:26:39.584
<v Speaker 7>Americans were there and every group was</v>
<v Speaker 7>waiting with their tongues out so that </v>

1228
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:45.163
<v Speaker 7>Russell could insult their particular </v>
<v Speaker 7>ethnicity so that they could feel </v>

1229
01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:53.980
<v Speaker 7>finally that someone was saying </v>
<v Speaker 7>something that was truthful and not hide</v>

1230
01:26:53.981 --> 01:26:58.981
<v Speaker 7>it and to say it openly in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 7>and to make light of it and we would say</v>

1231
01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:03.043
<v Speaker 7>you bring people together by</v>
<v Speaker 7>telling them what you think without </v>

1232
01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.120
<v Speaker 7>manipulation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>without care for the outcome,</v>

1233
01:27:11.610 --> 01:27:12.443
<v Speaker 7>and people can hear the very rough terms</v>
<v Speaker 7>if they trust who's stating the heaters </v>

1234
01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.890
<v Speaker 7>is trusted by everyone because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I suppose</v>

1235
01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:28.620
<v Speaker 7>non discriminant prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He hates everyone equally.</v>

1236
01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.850
<v Speaker 7>There's nothing behind his assaults </v>
<v Speaker 7>except</v>

1237
01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.193
<v Speaker 7>the desire for everyone to come together</v>
<v Speaker 7>in recognition of their idiocy and </v>

1238
01:27:40.011 --> 01:27:45.011
<v Speaker 7>vulnerability of people very much enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 7>that and so I would say you unite people</v>

1239
01:27:45.561 --> 01:27:46.394
<v Speaker 7>to the degree that they can be united by</v>
<v Speaker 7>saying what you think without trying to </v>

1240
01:27:50.151 --> 01:27:50.984
<v Speaker 7>manipulate the outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so that's a better way to live </v>

1241
01:27:54.231 --> 01:27:57.750
<v Speaker 7>anyways because you don't have to keep </v>
<v Speaker 7>track of anything that way.</v>

1242
01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:01.370
<v Speaker 7>Not so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Say what you think carefully.</v>

1243
01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:02.473
<v Speaker 7>You observed the response and adjust </v>
<v Speaker 7>your behavior and and everyone likes </v>

1244
01:28:07.101 --> 01:28:11.690
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I don't know a better way of doing,</v>

1245
01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.100
<v Speaker 7>of doing it now,</v>

1246
01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:14.913
<v Speaker 8>so</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm an author and a biologist and I was </v>

1247
01:28:29.691 --> 01:28:34.691
<v Speaker 8>researching</v>
<v Speaker 8>district keep disturbing.</v>

1248
01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:42.900
<v Speaker 8>It was written by</v>
<v Speaker 8>and the Irish.</v>

1249
01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.660
<v Speaker 8>It's a peculiar,</v>
<v Speaker 8>neither</v>

1250
01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:54.800
<v Speaker 8>exceed</v>
<v Speaker 8>because it voted so much energy</v>

1251
01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:03.560
<v Speaker 8>and the author took this and her </v>
<v Speaker 8>proposition was</v>

1252
01:29:07.770 --> 01:29:10.570
<v Speaker 8>so</v>
<v Speaker 8>full</v>

1253
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:17.270
<v Speaker 8>of basically</v>
<v Speaker 8>and</v>

1254
01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:25.120
<v Speaker 8>the brain</v>
<v Speaker 8>as much of a</v>

1255
01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:28.993
<v Speaker 8>race.</v>

1256
01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:48.790
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a cool question.</v>

1257
01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:55.090
<v Speaker 7>I think that you retool the story of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>fall genesis,</v>

1258
01:29:56.610 --> 01:30:01.090
<v Speaker 7>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean that because as far as I can tell</v>

1259
01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:02.093
<v Speaker 7>that story means is that at some,</v>
<v Speaker 7>at some point in time people became </v>

1260
01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:13.080
<v Speaker 7>conceptually sophisticated enough to </v>
<v Speaker 7>understand their own vulnerability,</v>

1261
01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:15.213
<v Speaker 7>to realize their own native units.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you discovered the path to discover </v>

1262
01:30:18.671 --> 01:30:19.504
<v Speaker 7>the necessity of work and to be blown </v>
<v Speaker 7>out of that preconscious paradise into </v>

1263
01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:25.413
<v Speaker 7>the tragic believe history.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe that's what that story means </v>

1264
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:34.090
<v Speaker 7>and you can read that as a tragic </v>
<v Speaker 7>catastrophe with no solution.</v>

1265
01:30:35.170 --> 01:30:36.730
<v Speaker 7>And I would say though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>however,</v>

1266
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:40.000
<v Speaker 7>that since that time and God only knows </v>
<v Speaker 7>when that was,</v>

1267
01:30:40.630 --> 01:30:41.463
<v Speaker 7>the human race has been collectively </v>
<v Speaker 7>attempting to address the problem and </v>

1268
01:30:45.671 --> 01:30:48.670
<v Speaker 7>the solution that's emerged is something</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1269
01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:54.210
<v Speaker 7>although a little bit of excess </v>
<v Speaker 7>consciousness demolish us,</v>

1270
01:30:55.480 --> 01:31:00.480
<v Speaker 7>a lot more consciousness could save us,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I think that that's the case.</v>

1271
01:31:02.050 --> 01:31:04.150
<v Speaker 7>There's no going back,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1272
01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:07.000
<v Speaker 7>Alcohol makes you unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

1273
01:31:07.001 --> 01:31:07.834
<v Speaker 7>when that's part of why people like it </v>
<v Speaker 7>then it's not surprising sedatives to </v>

1274
01:31:11.401 --> 01:31:12.234
<v Speaker 7>the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the things that people do to themselves </v>

1275
01:31:14.711 --> 01:31:17.620
<v Speaker 7>to destroy your consciousness by </v>
<v Speaker 7>distraction,</v>

1276
01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:18.693
<v Speaker 7>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>alleviate the terrible catastrophe of </v>

1277
01:31:21.881 --> 01:31:26.680
<v Speaker 7>being morally that is easy to bear,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's the wrong solution.</v>

1278
01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:32.080
<v Speaker 7>The right solution is to be even more </v>
<v Speaker 7>awake and to pay even more attention and</v>

1279
01:31:32.081 --> 01:31:37.081
<v Speaker 7>there's a way out the problem that way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so the fall,</v>

1280
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:39.303
<v Speaker 7>the idea of the fall indicates something</v>
<v Speaker 7>about people that's irredeemably </v>

1281
01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:44.590
<v Speaker 7>damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well perhaps not redeemable,</v>

1282
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:47.520
<v Speaker 7>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1283
01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:48.950
<v Speaker 7>There's this schism,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mba,</v>

1284
01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:54.010
<v Speaker 7>let's say that's not easy to rectify.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What historic indicates,</v>

1285
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:56.103
<v Speaker 7>and I think it's tightly tied with the </v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of evolutionary process that were </v>

1286
01:31:59.741 --> 01:32:00.520
<v Speaker 7>just commenting</v>

1287
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.110
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Irish elk was actually</v>

1288
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.863
<v Speaker 5>developed its excess antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The theory goes as a consequence of </v>

1289
01:32:07.481 --> 01:32:08.314
<v Speaker 5>female sexual selection course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>female human beings are very choosy </v>

1290
01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:14.050
<v Speaker 5>maters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unlike chimpanzees,</v>

1291
01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:14.943
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there is reasonable evidence that </v>

1292
01:32:17.201 --> 01:32:18.034
<v Speaker 5>one of the factories that propelled our </v>
<v Speaker 5>political evolution forward was female </v>

1293
01:32:20.951 --> 01:32:21.784
<v Speaker 5>sexual choosing this and and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps that it's eve tempts Adam into </v>

1294
01:32:26.861 --> 01:32:27.694
<v Speaker 5>self consciousness in genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and maybe that's why there's been new </v>

1295
01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:33.310
<v Speaker 5>eternal enmity between men and women </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever since,</v>

1296
01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:36.250
<v Speaker 5>because women certainly do make men self</v>
<v Speaker 5>conscious.</v>

1297
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:39.340
<v Speaker 5>It might be the primary effect that </v>
<v Speaker 5>women have.</v>

1298
01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:43.510
<v Speaker 5>Men that's advantageous in a more </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscious men are better,</v>

1299
01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:46.280
<v Speaker 5>but it's disadvantages for the manner in</v>
<v Speaker 5>itself.</v>

1300
01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:49.030
<v Speaker 5>Consciousness is generally a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>unpleasant emotion,</v>

1301
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:50.583
<v Speaker 5>so I would say however,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that self consciousness is the gateway </v>

1302
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:53.703
<v Speaker 5>to transcendence and development,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so the best thing for human beings </v>

1303
01:32:57.491 --> 01:32:58.324
<v Speaker 5>to do is to bear up underneath their </v>
<v Speaker 5>self-conscious tragic end to transcend </v>

1304
01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:05.710
<v Speaker 5>passed that by becoming even more </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscious.</v>

1305
01:33:06.010 --> 01:33:08.070
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's the hope that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>

1306
01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:08.913
<v Speaker 5>I think that that's what the great </v>
<v Speaker 5>religions of the world constantly </v>

1307
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:15.880
<v Speaker 5>dangled before us is that if you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>suffering in your half a weak state,</v>

1308
01:33:15.881 --> 01:33:19.780
<v Speaker 5>then it's time to wake up completely and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then perhaps that will go away.</v>

1309
01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:21.380
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't know,</v>

1310
01:33:21.381 --> 01:33:26.381
<v Speaker 5>but we don't have a better option.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No other option is annihilation and that</v>

1311
01:33:28.181 --> 01:33:31.750
<v Speaker 5>seems a bit premature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shall we say.</v>

1312
01:33:35.850 --> 01:33:37.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Given that we're not all we could be,</v>

1313
01:33:37.891 --> 01:33:39.450
<v Speaker 5>it seems a bit premature.</v>

1314
01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:44.753
<v Speaker 4>Some of your youtube videos you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about the ancient mythology of </v>

1315
01:33:49.230 --> 01:33:54.230
<v Speaker 4>Babylon in Egypt and you described it as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a way that they act out what they sensed</v>

1316
01:33:57.130 --> 01:33:57.963
<v Speaker 4>to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even because they couldn't </v>

1317
01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:00.093
<v Speaker 4>articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a modern day equivalent of </v>

1318
01:34:04.150 --> 01:34:09.150
<v Speaker 4>acting out the truth and if so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>describe it for us?</v>

1319
01:34:14.850 --> 01:34:18.840
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say in large part Christianity's</v>

1320
01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:19.570
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1321
01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:21.280
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it it.</v>

1322
01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:24.280
<v Speaker 4>It's fundamentally</v>

1323
01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:30.850
<v Speaker 5>description of pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in an optimized being be and the way</v>

1324
01:34:33.611 --> 01:34:34.444
<v Speaker 5>that it was generated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again this is a psychological </v>

1325
01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:39.070
<v Speaker 5>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't claim that it's exhausting.</v>

1326
01:34:39.210 --> 01:34:44.210
<v Speaker 5>Not The least is that you could imagine </v>
<v Speaker 5>that as people move through time,</v>

1327
01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:46.993
<v Speaker 5>this is akin to the idea that the figure</v>
<v Speaker 5>of Christ is implicit in the Old </v>

1328
01:34:49.641 --> 01:34:53.330
<v Speaker 5>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is also a psychological idea.</v>

1329
01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:56.000
<v Speaker 5>Imagine that as people progress through </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

1330
01:34:56.001 --> 01:34:57.110
<v Speaker 5>they observed that some</v>

1331
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:00.290
<v Speaker 7>were handling exist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's better than others,</v>

1332
01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:01.753
<v Speaker 7>and those people attracted attention and</v>
<v Speaker 7>admiration and stories regenerated and </v>

1333
01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:09.153
<v Speaker 7>so you might say that out of 100 people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the most capable of honorable and </v>

1334
01:35:14.391 --> 01:35:19.391
<v Speaker 7>respectable and useful and benevolent </v>
<v Speaker 7>person was identified and then celebrate</v>

1335
01:35:19.721 --> 01:35:20.554
<v Speaker 7>it at least with admiration and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>perhaps with stories and so then you </v>

1336
01:35:24.291 --> 01:35:25.124
<v Speaker 7>might imagine that there were 10 groups </v>
<v Speaker 7>of 100 people in each of them had their </v>

1337
01:35:28.791 --> 01:35:29.624
<v Speaker 7>story of the most admirable person and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then those stories came together as </v>

1338
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:33.763
<v Speaker 7>those tribes amalgamated and then the </v>
<v Speaker 7>story of the 10 most admirable people </v>

1339
01:35:38.241 --> 01:35:43.241
<v Speaker 7>was amalgamated into.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I figured that was the most admirable of</v>

1340
01:35:44.031 --> 01:35:49.031
<v Speaker 7>those 10 and the entire groups group of </v>
<v Speaker 7>ten one hundred tribes.</v>

1341
01:35:49.191 --> 01:35:50.024
<v Speaker 7>People could come together under that </v>
<v Speaker 7>banner and it really looks like in some </v>

1342
01:35:52.551 --> 01:35:55.910
<v Speaker 7>sense that's how monotheism or </v>
<v Speaker 7>polytheism is.</v>

1343
01:35:55.911 --> 01:35:58.520
<v Speaker 7>That the tribal groups had their local </v>
<v Speaker 7>ideals,</v>

1344
01:35:58.521 --> 01:35:59.354
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then when they came together and it </v>

1345
01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:01.413
<v Speaker 7>was a local ideals were amalgamated into</v>
<v Speaker 7>what you might describe as a mat at </v>

1346
01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:07.310
<v Speaker 7>ideal and people were able to unite </v>
<v Speaker 7>under that Metta ideal.</v>

1347
01:36:07.311 --> 01:36:08.144
<v Speaker 7>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in in Mesopotamia there was a god known </v>

1348
01:36:13.161 --> 01:36:16.880
<v Speaker 7>as martyr and Martin had a very large </v>
<v Speaker 7>number of names,</v>

1349
01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:21.940
<v Speaker 7>some of which are quite fascinating and</v>
<v Speaker 7>the reason he had a very large number of</v>

1350
01:36:23.271 --> 01:36:24.104
<v Speaker 7>names was because he wasn't available.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have a very large number of previous </v>

1351
01:36:26.601 --> 01:36:27.434
<v Speaker 7>thoughts.</v>

1352
01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:34.980
<v Speaker 7>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's an idea,</v>

1353
01:36:36.670 --> 01:36:38.060
<v Speaker 7>a Christian idea,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

1354
01:36:38.061 --> 01:36:40.330
<v Speaker 7>that Christ we cave case,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>

1355
01:36:40.331 --> 01:36:41.164
<v Speaker 7>or a hero of heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And from a psychological perspective I </v>

1356
01:36:44.511 --> 01:36:45.344
<v Speaker 7>just read that was straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 7>observation is that pass the stories of </v>

1357
01:36:51.650 --> 01:36:53.990
<v Speaker 7>the great people of the past,</v>
<v Speaker 7>amalgamated.</v>

1358
01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:56.780
<v Speaker 7>Out of that emerged in the human </v>
<v Speaker 7>imagination.</v>

1359
01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:58.633
<v Speaker 7>A conceptualization of the ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a very strange conceptualization </v>

1360
01:37:01.850 --> 01:37:02.683
<v Speaker 7>because if it falls something like the </v>
<v Speaker 7>voluntary voluntary acceptance of </v>

1361
01:37:07.041 --> 01:37:07.874
<v Speaker 7>suffering and it's simultaneous</v>
<v Speaker 7>transcendence at that's a candidate in </v>

1362
01:37:13.791 --> 01:37:14.624
<v Speaker 7>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the old stories of the hero who fights </v>

1363
01:37:17.001 --> 01:37:22.001
<v Speaker 7>the dragon because of course in some </v>
<v Speaker 7>sense the ultimate dragon is about death</v>

1364
01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:23.503
<v Speaker 7>and also at the level that might produce</v>
<v Speaker 7>an unjust death and to be able to face </v>

1365
01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:28.634
<v Speaker 7>that without shrinking is perhaps the </v>
<v Speaker 7>essential hallmark of the most well </v>

1366
01:37:36.381 --> 01:37:41.381
<v Speaker 7>developed character out that ideal is a </v>
<v Speaker 7>product of the collective imagination of</v>

1367
01:37:42.891 --> 01:37:45.770
<v Speaker 7>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>From a psychological perspective,</v>

1368
01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:49.490
<v Speaker 7>what it means to be on that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if anything,</v>

1369
01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:54.540
<v Speaker 7>I no position to determine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

1370
01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:24.940
<v Speaker 7>great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

1371
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.863
<v Speaker 7>so the question is how do you speak </v>
<v Speaker 7>truth in a highly hierarchical </v>

1372
01:38:28.701 --> 01:38:29.534
<v Speaker 7>environment like a workplace where </v>
<v Speaker 7>perhaps you have disagreeable than even </v>

1373
01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.780
<v Speaker 7>tyrannical managers and a resistance to </v>
<v Speaker 7>the truth?</v>

1374
01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:37.430
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's an excellent question.</v>

1375
01:38:38.150 --> 01:38:38.983
<v Speaker 7>The first thing I would say is you </v>
<v Speaker 7>prepare yourself and so if you want to </v>

1376
01:38:44.241 --> 01:38:45.800
<v Speaker 7>negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

1377
01:38:46.130 --> 01:38:50.060
<v Speaker 7>you can negotiate from a position of </v>
<v Speaker 7>weakness because you lose,</v>

1378
01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:53.330
<v Speaker 7>you'll lose in every way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can't stand the conflict.</v>

1379
01:38:53.331 --> 01:38:56.870
<v Speaker 7>You've got nothing to fall out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if you're in a workplace that's,</v>

1380
01:38:57.470 --> 01:39:02.470
<v Speaker 7>that's not admittable to</v>
<v Speaker 7>informative messages,</v>

1381
01:39:03.171 --> 01:39:08.171
<v Speaker 7>let's say the first thing you do is look</v>
<v Speaker 7>for another job or I don't,</v>

1382
01:39:09.650 --> 01:39:11.480
<v Speaker 7>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mainly you take another job.</v>

1383
01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:16.730
<v Speaker 7>That is what I need.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean you need to provide yourself with</v>

1384
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:20.740
<v Speaker 7>credible options because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll be weak when you,</v>

1385
01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:21.933
<v Speaker 7>when you stand forth and especially </v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody who's a bully will just pull </v>

1386
01:39:26.091 --> 01:39:26.924
<v Speaker 7>you right over because we've got no </v>
<v Speaker 7>power and so you have to prepare </v>

1387
01:39:31.911 --> 01:39:36.911
<v Speaker 7>yourself and you do that by reducing the</v>
<v Speaker 7>risk to yourself in an intelligent map.</v>

1388
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:41.900
<v Speaker 7>And one of the things I counseled my </v>
<v Speaker 7>clients,</v>

1389
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:46.990
<v Speaker 7>many of whom are executives or people </v>
<v Speaker 7>who are successful,</v>

1390
01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:48.593
<v Speaker 7>is that you should always be prepared to</v>
<v Speaker 7>make allowable awkward movement move </v>

1391
01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:56.790
<v Speaker 7>because otherwise you have negotiating </v>
<v Speaker 7>power.</v>

1392
01:39:57.410 --> 01:39:59.710
<v Speaker 7>And so of course that means that if you </v>
<v Speaker 7>have the options,</v>

1393
01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:00.583
<v Speaker 7>you're in a weak position,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it is the case that if you have the </v>

1394
01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:07.400
<v Speaker 7>options that you're weak position.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you keep your CV update,</v>

1395
01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:12.130
<v Speaker 7>you develop the skills necessary to make</v>
<v Speaker 7>you movable in the marketplace.</v>

1396
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:15.740
<v Speaker 7>You reduce your fear of interviews as an</v>
<v Speaker 7>alternative.</v>

1397
01:40:15.810 --> 01:40:16.643
<v Speaker 7>Know that the processes that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 7>go to through to seek alternative </v>

1398
01:40:19.101 --> 01:40:19.934
<v Speaker 7>employment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is a very good thing to do </v>

1399
01:40:20.661 --> 01:40:21.494
<v Speaker 7>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then if you could put yourself in a </v>

1400
01:40:24.321 --> 01:40:25.154
<v Speaker 7>position of relative strength,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then you can decide what it is that you </v>

1401
01:40:28.911 --> 01:40:29.744
<v Speaker 7>have to say first.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't fight unnecessary bouts and </v>

1402
01:40:33.771 --> 01:40:34.604
<v Speaker 7>you don't make unnecessary enemies and </v>
<v Speaker 7>perhaps you put forth attendant of </v>

1403
01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:44.260
<v Speaker 7>suggested with brain argumentation </v>
<v Speaker 7>behind it after perhaps also finding out</v>

1404
01:40:44.901 --> 01:40:45.734
<v Speaker 7>if there are other people who feel the </v>
<v Speaker 7>same way you do and I'm formulating </v>

1405
01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:52.310
<v Speaker 7>intentional solution and then generally </v>
<v Speaker 7>speaking,</v>

1406
01:40:52.311 --> 01:40:53.144
<v Speaker 7>under those conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the probability that you will be </v>

1407
01:40:56.411 --> 01:40:57.690
<v Speaker 7>successful will be buried.</v>

1408
01:40:58.690 --> 01:41:01.420
<v Speaker 7>I would also say that if under those </v>
<v Speaker 7>conditions</v>

1409
01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:03.813
<v Speaker 7>you still can succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you should leave because you're </v>

1410
01:41:07.781 --> 01:41:11.670
<v Speaker 7>purchasing security of a person out </v>
<v Speaker 7>there,</v>

1411
01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:13.010
<v Speaker 7>pricing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>security,</v>

1412
01:41:13.110 --> 01:41:15.400
<v Speaker 7>soul,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's a bad choice.</v>

1413
01:41:15.410 --> 01:41:18.490
<v Speaker 7>It beat you down across time and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't want that.</v>

1414
01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:20.600
<v Speaker 6>So Yep.</v>

1415
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:40.423
<v Speaker 5>Chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chicken,</v>

1416
01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:44.310
<v Speaker 5>you again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really young Americans for liberty.</v>

1417
01:41:44.490 --> 01:41:47.920
<v Speaker 5>So I'm thinking you guys and thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously I'm,</v>

1418
01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:49.913
<v Speaker 5>I'm also here for Portland.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I completely agree with your assessment </v>

1419
01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.033
<v Speaker 5>with some colleagues from the newsroom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>miserable newsgroup called torch cast </v>

1420
01:41:55.770 --> 01:41:59.120
<v Speaker 5>your mind if you've got split testing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1421
01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:04.760
<v Speaker 5>I do have a societal question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What in your view is the macro agenda or</v>

1422
01:42:05.761 --> 01:42:06.990
<v Speaker 5>the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the end goal,</v>

1423
01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:12.020
<v Speaker 5>the end game for the current sjw left </v>
<v Speaker 5>who fight free speech,</v>

1424
01:42:12.270 --> 01:42:13.103
<v Speaker 5>obfuscate the basic concepts of identity</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you pedal outright falsity in </v>

1425
01:42:18.121 --> 01:42:20.880
<v Speaker 5>regards to the with things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>

1426
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:26.870
<v Speaker 5>in the media and on college campuses and</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a solution,</v>

1427
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:28.223
<v Speaker 5>not the solution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a solution to that moving of the </v>

1428
01:42:32.251 --> 01:42:34.350
<v Speaker 5>overton window,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak,</v>

1429
01:42:34.410 --> 01:42:36.270
<v Speaker 5>through mischief,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trolling</v>

1430
01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:40.953
<v Speaker 6>speakers.</v>

1431
01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:46.650
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the motivational issue is,</v>

1432
01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:50.940
<v Speaker 7>is complex.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think some of it is</v>

1433
01:42:53.550 --> 01:42:58.550
<v Speaker 7>the naive good harkness of youth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fair bit is that</v>

1434
01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:01.343
<v Speaker 7>some of it I think is the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 7>of the introduction of women aren't </v>

1435
01:43:06.061 --> 01:43:06.894
<v Speaker 7>passive to the political environment and</v>
<v Speaker 7>the manifestation of the personality </v>

1436
01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:14.130
<v Speaker 7>trait,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the personality trait,</v>

1437
01:43:14.131 --> 01:43:18.750
<v Speaker 7>agreeableness as a political force for </v>
<v Speaker 7>perhaps the first time in history.</v>

1438
01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:20.693
<v Speaker 7>It's a radical transformation and have </v>
<v Speaker 7>women occupy positions of power and we </v>

1439
01:43:24.001 --> 01:43:26.460
<v Speaker 7>don't know what that will be for better </v>
<v Speaker 7>or for worse.</v>

1440
01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:29.490
<v Speaker 7>To think that it will only be for better</v>
<v Speaker 7>is naive.</v>

1441
01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:34.320
<v Speaker 7>You want believe so and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 7>willful blindness.</v>

1442
01:43:34.321 --> 01:43:39.321
<v Speaker 7>There's ideological possession and</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's.</v>

1443
01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:41.213
<v Speaker 7>There's a kind of.</v>

1444
01:43:43.290 --> 01:43:44.123
<v Speaker 7>I'm grateful there's a deep gratitude as</v>
<v Speaker 7>well because in a sense of historical </v>

1445
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:56.630
<v Speaker 7>lack of historical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's quite compelling to me to my way of</v>

1446
01:43:56.631 --> 01:43:57.464
<v Speaker 7>thinking perhaps because I'm reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 7>well versed in the nature of historical </v>

1447
01:44:01.191 --> 01:44:02.024
<v Speaker 7>catastrophes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The fact that we can all assemble </v>

1448
01:44:05.130 --> 01:44:05.963
<v Speaker 7>peacefully in this unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 7>beautiful place in this crazily </v>

1449
01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:12.410
<v Speaker 7>beautiful town with with the tension </v>
<v Speaker 7>that does exist.</v>

1450
01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:13.273
<v Speaker 7>Just rather minimal white historical </v>
<v Speaker 7>standards and engage in this sort of </v>

1451
01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:17.203
<v Speaker 7>discussion peacefully and productively </v>
<v Speaker 7>is almost incomprehensible given the </v>

1452
01:44:24.591 --> 01:44:29.591
<v Speaker 7>evidence that's come forth to us.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Throw a kiss and I don't believe that we</v>

1453
01:44:31.101 --> 01:44:31.934
<v Speaker 7>do enough to teach our young people just</v>
<v Speaker 7>exactly how improbable that is and so I </v>

1454
01:44:39.621 --> 01:44:40.454
<v Speaker 7>don't think they know and so what they </v>
<v Speaker 7>see instead of the improbable </v>

1455
01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:47.803
<v Speaker 7>functionality of our culture is all the </v>
<v Speaker 7>errors that it still makes and it's </v>

1456
01:44:51.711 --> 01:44:56.711
<v Speaker 7>reasonable for them to see that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but not without that broader context.</v>

1457
01:44:58.250 --> 01:45:01.370
<v Speaker 7>What to do about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1458
01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:07.010
<v Speaker 7>I think the fundamental thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 7>about it,</v>

1459
01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:08.780
<v Speaker 7>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is for,</v>

1460
01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:09.853
<v Speaker 7>and this is I believe the western way </v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamentally is for people to Excel to </v>

1461
01:45:16.491 --> 01:45:19.970
<v Speaker 7>magnify the degree to which they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>taking personal responsibility for their</v>

1462
01:45:19.971 --> 01:45:24.971
<v Speaker 7>life because I think that as individuals</v>
<v Speaker 7>they'll find the proper way to fight the</v>

1463
01:45:25.431 --> 01:45:30.431
<v Speaker 7>micro battles that will be necessary in </v>
<v Speaker 7>order to stamp the type of rising</v>

1464
01:45:34.610 --> 01:45:39.610
<v Speaker 7>radical</v>
<v Speaker 7>radicalism.</v>

1465
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:41.383
<v Speaker 7>Let's leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What I think will have with the amount </v>

1466
01:45:44.490 --> 01:45:47.600
<v Speaker 7>of what I would also encourage people to</v>
<v Speaker 7>do is to</v>

1467
01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:54.050
<v Speaker 7>stop enrolling in those classes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean the humanities are bleeding.</v>

1468
01:45:54.051 --> 01:45:57.500
<v Speaker 7>People like map men are leaving in </v>
<v Speaker 7>droves.</v>

1469
01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:00.230
<v Speaker 7>There won't be a man in the humanities </v>
<v Speaker 7>at 10 years.</v>

1470
01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:02.720
<v Speaker 7>And then most of the social sciences as </v>
<v Speaker 7>well.</v>

1471
01:46:02.721 --> 01:46:03.554
<v Speaker 7>I mean I've watched the enrollment </v>
<v Speaker 7>curves for really for decades and have </v>

1472
01:46:07.311 --> 01:46:08.144
<v Speaker 7>seen this propagate itself across time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but more delicately even is that the </v>

1473
01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:13.333
<v Speaker 7>overall proportion of enrollment amongst</v>
<v Speaker 7>students in the humanities has declined </v>

1474
01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:18.643
<v Speaker 7>every decade since the 19 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so as the humanities moves farther </v>

1475
01:46:22.821 --> 01:46:25.280
<v Speaker 7>away from what it is that they truly </v>
<v Speaker 7>have to offer,</v>

1476
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:26.143
<v Speaker 7>which is the transmission of the wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 7>of the past to youth so that they could </v>

1477
01:46:31.311 --> 01:46:32.144
<v Speaker 7>see their proper way forward and to </v>
<v Speaker 7>become articulate well are responsible </v>

1478
01:46:37.041 --> 01:46:40.430
<v Speaker 7>citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>As they abandoned that responsibility,</v>

1479
01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:45.150
<v Speaker 7>then all they have to offer is dynamism </v>
<v Speaker 7>and resentment.</v>

1480
01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:46.093
<v Speaker 7>That doesn't sell well except to a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 7>fraction of people who would like to </v>

1481
01:46:49.411 --> 01:46:51.570
<v Speaker 7>have as much of that as they can </v>
<v Speaker 7>possibly manage.</v>

1482
01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:56.010
<v Speaker 4>We see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We see it happening.</v>

1483
01:46:57.350 --> 01:47:00.770
<v Speaker 4>That essay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>overall cultural shift tour.</v>

1484
01:47:00.970 --> 01:47:05.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm selling also to people in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>liberty rally in Berkeley.</v>

1485
01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:12.020
<v Speaker 4>You look at essentially every post </v>
<v Speaker 4>college protest on the streets,</v>

1486
01:47:14.210 --> 01:47:17.940
<v Speaker 4>Portland to Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems that how,</v>

1487
01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:18.913
<v Speaker 4>how do we address the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This type of narrative is not just </v>

1488
01:47:22.761 --> 01:47:23.594
<v Speaker 4>adding all this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it seems that the idea of what you </v>

1489
01:47:26.490 --> 01:47:30.290
<v Speaker 4>were given your framework of getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the Kingdom of God,</v>

1490
01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:33.150
<v Speaker 4>the kingdom is completely different for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the</v>

1491
01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:36.260
<v Speaker 4>cultural issues.</v>

1492
01:47:37.210 --> 01:47:38.043
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1493
01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:39.460
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1494
01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.880
<v Speaker 7>in many times in my life I trucked face,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say the choice between a political</v>

1495
01:47:46.751 --> 01:47:47.584
<v Speaker 7>group and this say philosophical root or</v>
<v Speaker 7>a psychological root that I had chosen </v>

1496
01:47:51.521 --> 01:47:56.320
<v Speaker 7>to go and what I gave you tonight is </v>
<v Speaker 7>really the best answer that I have.</v>

1497
01:47:56.650 --> 01:47:59.230
<v Speaker 7>I'm not trying to make the case that </v>
<v Speaker 7>would that.</v>

1498
01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:00.093
<v Speaker 7>That's a comprehensive answer,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think that if you want to move </v>

1499
01:48:04.961 --> 01:48:05.794
<v Speaker 7>forward properly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the best thing to do is to organize </v>

1500
01:48:08.291 --> 01:48:09.124
<v Speaker 7>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I need personally to organize yourself </v>

1501
01:48:11.381 --> 01:48:12.214
<v Speaker 7>as well as you possibly cap at the gift,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those things around you that aren't in </v>

1502
01:48:15.491 --> 01:48:16.324
<v Speaker 7>order in order your family,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how you conduct yourself because then </v>

1503
01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:20.733
<v Speaker 7>you're going to be in the best position </v>
<v Speaker 7>to make the proper decisions in the </v>

1504
01:48:23.721 --> 01:48:24.554
<v Speaker 7>specific situations that uptake to you </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I think that that's where people </v>

1505
01:48:28.691 --> 01:48:32.740
<v Speaker 7>have their power and I think that power </v>
<v Speaker 7>is not insignificant.</v>

1506
01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:36.550
<v Speaker 7>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's the best I can do for that.</v>

1507
01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:41.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I can.</v>

1508
01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:42.893
<v Speaker 5>That was a really interesting question </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not a social justice warrior </v>

1509
01:48:46.201 --> 01:48:49.200
<v Speaker 5>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as I understand it,</v>

1510
01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:53.490
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of people I've talked to </v>
<v Speaker 5>who we think about that,</v>

1511
01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:54.493
<v Speaker 5>I think they're really trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>dismantle what they see to be unfair </v>

1512
01:48:57.121 --> 01:49:01.230
<v Speaker 5>systems have advantages and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>patriarchal structures they have it.</v>

1513
01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:03.150
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1514
01:49:03.210 --> 01:49:07.950
<v Speaker 5>my question is because this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this truth idea really,</v>

1515
01:49:07.951 --> 01:49:09.060
<v Speaker 5>really interests me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1516
01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:09.903
<v Speaker 5>do you feel that because of the limits </v>
<v Speaker 5>of your own human experience and your </v>

1517
01:49:12.541 --> 01:49:13.374
<v Speaker 5>own identity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there are things that you will </v>

1518
01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:16.310
<v Speaker 5>never be able to change your mind?</v>

1519
01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:26.130
<v Speaker 7>I think there are that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there are things that I'll never.</v>

1520
01:49:26.190 --> 01:49:30.250
<v Speaker 7>There are things are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's say would stake my life on,</v>

1521
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:32.340
<v Speaker 7>which I think is a better way of putting</v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

1522
01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:37.470
<v Speaker 7>I'm one of those is that it's better to </v>
<v Speaker 7>serve,</v>

1523
01:49:38.150 --> 01:49:43.150
<v Speaker 7>to denounce it at that it's better to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to not lie,</v>

1524
01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:48.550
<v Speaker 7>let's say instead of telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because someone asked earlier,</v>

1525
01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:52.720
<v Speaker 7>how can you go about telling the truth </v>
<v Speaker 7>and in some sense you can,</v>

1526
01:49:52.721 --> 01:49:55.690
<v Speaker 7>but you can't stop seeing things you've </v>
<v Speaker 7>known to be false.</v>

1527
01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:56.763
<v Speaker 7>Which is a good start.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's within anyone's scrapped and </v>

1528
01:49:59.530 --> 01:50:00.363
<v Speaker 7>I could say I'm not likely to change my </v>
<v Speaker 7>mind about the utility of doing that </v>

1529
01:50:04.690 --> 01:50:05.523
<v Speaker 7>either because I've decided that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to accept the consequences of </v>

1530
01:50:09.971 --> 01:50:14.260
<v Speaker 7>doing that gratefully regardless of what</v>
<v Speaker 7>the consequences are.</v>

1531
01:50:14.590 --> 01:50:15.423
<v Speaker 7>And so at some point in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and perhaps not precisely when you're </v>

1532
01:50:19.511 --> 01:50:20.344
<v Speaker 7>young,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to decide what it is that </v>

1533
01:50:22.361 --> 01:50:25.780
<v Speaker 7>you're going to act out something Carl </v>
<v Speaker 7>you specify,</v>

1534
01:50:25.810 --> 01:50:26.643
<v Speaker 7>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>know you're going to act out of </v>

1535
01:50:28.271 --> 01:50:30.640
<v Speaker 7>mythological structure of one type or </v>
<v Speaker 7>another.</v>

1536
01:50:31.210 --> 01:50:33.610
<v Speaker 7>You're either going to be aware of it or</v>
<v Speaker 7>not.</v>

1537
01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:36.400
<v Speaker 7>If you become aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that perhaps you could choose it.</v>

1538
01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:40.740
<v Speaker 7>And that doesn't give you any guarantee </v>
<v Speaker 7>precise,</v>

1539
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:42.700
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because even if you act out,</v>

1540
01:50:42.701 --> 01:50:43.534
<v Speaker 7>let's say that her path,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know when you and you face the </v>

1541
01:50:46.181 --> 01:50:48.730
<v Speaker 7>dragon and combat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's no necessary.</v>

1542
01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:53.000
<v Speaker 7>It's not a necessity that you when the </v>
<v Speaker 7>dragon to the EU.</v>

1543
01:50:53.530 --> 01:50:57.670
<v Speaker 7>But the idea is that that's your best.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fap All things considered.</v>

1544
01:50:57.671 --> 01:51:00.970
<v Speaker 7>It's your best bet to face it </v>
<v Speaker 7>forthrightly.</v>

1545
01:51:00.971 --> 01:51:01.804
<v Speaker 7>And I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I believe that because I'm a clinical </v>

1546
01:51:03.641 --> 01:51:04.474
<v Speaker 7>psychologist and one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of the things that clinical </v>

1547
01:51:07.361 --> 01:51:08.194
<v Speaker 7>psychologists know is that if you help </v>
<v Speaker 7>people confront the things that they </v>

1548
01:51:12.191 --> 01:51:13.024
<v Speaker 7>avoid voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they get better and that that's a </v>

1549
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:18.783
<v Speaker 7>fundamental truth and I think it's the </v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamental truth of human advancement </v>

1550
01:51:21.821 --> 01:51:22.654
<v Speaker 7>and learning and it's possible that we </v>
<v Speaker 7>are Irish elk and our fundamental </v>

1551
01:51:27.641 --> 01:51:28.474
<v Speaker 7>approach to the world is deeply flawed </v>
<v Speaker 7>and if we pursue it wholeheartedly will </v>

1552
01:51:31.481 --> 01:51:32.610
<v Speaker 7>end up estate.</v>

1553
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:33.723
<v Speaker 7>It is possible that that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but if that's the case that there's </v>

1554
01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:37.610
<v Speaker 7>nothing I can do about it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>time,</v>

1555
01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:38.973
<v Speaker 7>part of the human race and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 7>act out its destiny the best that I can </v>

1556
01:51:41.621 --> 01:51:46.621
<v Speaker 7>manage and and I'm not willing to </v>
<v Speaker 7>reconsider things at that level.</v>

1557
01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:48.513
<v Speaker 7>I think that that's because I've thought</v>
<v Speaker 7>them through sufficiently for me and </v>

1558
01:51:52.241 --> 01:51:54.880
<v Speaker 7>because I've also determined the course </v>
<v Speaker 7>of my own life,</v>

1559
01:51:54.881 --> 01:51:55.714
<v Speaker 7>that and from watching the effects of </v>
<v Speaker 7>what I be talking about or other people </v>

1560
01:51:59.951 --> 01:52:00.784
<v Speaker 7>that what I'm doing is serving the good </v>
<v Speaker 7>at least as well as I could do it and </v>

1561
01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:09.940
<v Speaker 7>what I've learned is be very helpful to </v>
<v Speaker 7>me personally.</v>

1562
01:52:09.941 --> 01:52:13.870
<v Speaker 7>It's been very helpful to my family.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know it's been helpful for my students</v>

1563
01:52:13.871 --> 01:52:14.704
<v Speaker 7>because they always tell me that and </v>
<v Speaker 7>people write me all the time and say </v>

1564
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:19.383
<v Speaker 7>that they'd found a great utility in </v>
<v Speaker 7>what I was communicating and so that's </v>

1565
01:52:27.311 --> 01:52:32.311
<v Speaker 7>enough evidence for me right now that</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm on a path that's sufficient,</v>

1566
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:38.860
<v Speaker 7>that sufficiently justifies me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

1567
01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:41.973
<v Speaker 7>I'd just like to say we have about 20 </v>
<v Speaker 7>minutes until probably going to take </v>

1568
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 7>five</v>

1569
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:46.873
<v Speaker 4>or 10 minutes more questions then about </v>
<v Speaker 4>10 minutes to fill about talks about </v>

1570
01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:53.450
<v Speaker 4>themselves and make their way out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So typically</v>

1571
01:52:56.470 --> 01:53:00.800
<v Speaker 4>I just like to thank everybody who </v>
<v Speaker 4>helped organize this event.</v>

1572
01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:01.873
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been watching yourself on youtube </v>

1573
01:53:04.461 --> 01:53:09.461
<v Speaker 4>for a while now and I really felt that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you help me and I'm sure</v>

1574
01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:13.370
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really appreciate.</v>

1575
01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:15.913
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a pleasure.</v>

1576
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:22.330
<v Speaker 4>So I'm just wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on history and whatnot that you go</v>

1577
01:53:24.291 --> 01:53:29.291
<v Speaker 4>into a discussed like the archipelago </v>
<v Speaker 4>and whatnot,</v>

1578
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:35.590
<v Speaker 4>what kind of role do you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>government should play in society?</v>

1579
01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:49.640
<v Speaker 7>I think that it depends on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>circumstances</v>

1580
01:53:51.230 --> 01:53:54.500
<v Speaker 7>and so I don't think that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 7>right question.</v>

1581
01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:56.533
<v Speaker 7>I think the right question is how should</v>
<v Speaker 7>the government constituted itself so </v>

1582
01:54:01.731 --> 01:54:05.300
<v Speaker 7>that it can respond flexibly to the </v>
<v Speaker 7>demands of the situation.</v>

1583
01:54:06.650 --> 01:54:07.483
<v Speaker 7>I believe that there's utility in a </v>
<v Speaker 7>conservative viewpoint and I believe </v>

1584
01:54:11.421 --> 01:54:13.730
<v Speaker 7>that there's utility in a liberal </v>
<v Speaker 7>viewpoint,</v>

1585
01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:14.793
<v Speaker 7>but that it determined it depends on the</v>
<v Speaker 7>specifics of the situation and that </v>

1586
01:54:18.711 --> 01:54:22.940
<v Speaker 7>there is also error and even </v>
<v Speaker 7>catastrophic error on both sides,</v>

1587
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:26.030
<v Speaker 7>so the government needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>constituted.</v>

1588
01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:31.040
<v Speaker 7>I would say much like it is what else </v>
<v Speaker 7>were sovereignty is,</v>

1589
01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:32.413
<v Speaker 7>is instantiated it people for better or </v>
<v Speaker 7>worse so that the people can learn from </v>

1590
01:54:35.991 --> 01:54:36.824
<v Speaker 7>their errors and that we progress by </v>
<v Speaker 7>engaging in dialogue across people of </v>

1591
01:54:43.461 --> 01:54:44.294
<v Speaker 7>different temperamental types because </v>
<v Speaker 7>sometimes the borders are to open and </v>

1592
01:54:50.091 --> 01:54:50.924
<v Speaker 7>they need to be tight and sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 7>borders are too closed and they need to </v>

1593
01:54:55.221 --> 01:54:56.960
<v Speaker 7>be elusive if they be.</v>

1594
01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:00.350
<v Speaker 7>If the borders between everything become</v>
<v Speaker 7>completely closed and everything,</v>

1595
01:55:00.351 --> 01:55:02.780
<v Speaker 7>God's right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's deprived of air,</v>

1596
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:03.623
<v Speaker 7>water and everything died.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there's endless mythological </v>

1597
01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:09.050
<v Speaker 7>representations of that would be part of</v>
<v Speaker 7>the reason that Egypt,</v>

1598
01:55:09.051 --> 01:55:10.640
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the mosaic story,</v>

1599
01:55:10.641 --> 01:55:11.474
<v Speaker 7>is a kingdom of Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That stone is because Sam Stone Water </v>

1600
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:17.270
<v Speaker 7>and Moses who's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who's,</v>

1601
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:18.263
<v Speaker 7>who's someone who leads his people out </v>
<v Speaker 7>of tyranny is a master of water and the </v>

1602
01:55:21.621 --> 01:55:22.454
<v Speaker 7>message and that story is that sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 7>the kingdom turns to stone and it's a </v>

1603
01:55:25.581 --> 01:55:30.290
<v Speaker 7>tyranny and new revivification needs to </v>
<v Speaker 7>be integrated.</v>

1604
01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:33.380
<v Speaker 7>The doors have to open,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a new information has to flow in,</v>

1605
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:36.800
<v Speaker 7>but then there are times when I.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The story,</v>

1606
01:55:36.801 --> 01:55:40.490
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there are times when,</v>

1607
01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:44.310
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's too much influx of inflammation.</v>

1608
01:55:44.330 --> 01:55:45.163
<v Speaker 7>That's a flood.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's one way of reading the flood </v>

1609
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:49.760
<v Speaker 7>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's just too much pouring in.</v>

1610
01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:53.610
<v Speaker 7>Everyone drops.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And what we have to always ask ourselves</v>

1611
01:55:53.670 --> 01:55:56.310
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are we tending the garden properly?</v>

1612
01:55:56.730 --> 01:55:59.370
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not drying out for lack of water.</v>

1613
01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:01.650
<v Speaker 7>It's not drowning because there's too </v>
<v Speaker 7>much,</v>

1614
01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:02.513
<v Speaker 7>there's too much moisture coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the only way we can determine that </v>

1615
01:56:05.610 --> 01:56:06.443
<v Speaker 7>is by paying attention to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's why free speech is such a </v>

1616
01:56:08.971 --> 01:56:11.820
<v Speaker 7>fundamental necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's not,</v>

1617
01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:15.840
<v Speaker 7>it's not precisely what the government </v>
<v Speaker 7>can do because it has to do many things,</v>

1618
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:20.220
<v Speaker 7>but because it's the society of people </v>
<v Speaker 7>and people have to do many things,</v>

1619
01:56:20.610 --> 01:56:21.443
<v Speaker 7>but how the government goes about making</v>
<v Speaker 7>decisions and then at least with the </v>

1620
01:56:25.801 --> 01:56:29.130
<v Speaker 7>government that has to do is protect </v>
<v Speaker 7>those,</v>

1621
01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:30.593
<v Speaker 7>what would you call the rare and </v>
<v Speaker 7>precious processes that enable it to </v>

1622
01:56:33.931 --> 01:56:36.760
<v Speaker 7>continue to be a responsive and alive </v>
<v Speaker 7>entity.</v>

1623
01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:39.820
<v Speaker 7>And I think that we have done a </v>
<v Speaker 7>remarkably good job of that.</v>

1624
01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:44.400
<v Speaker 7>The West and I think that the US is a </v>
<v Speaker 7>great example of that for all its flaws.</v>

1625
01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:46.140
<v Speaker 7>Everything is flaw,</v>

1626
01:56:47.010 --> 01:56:47.843
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1627
01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:52.280
<v Speaker 7>but the proper analysis is flawed </v>
<v Speaker 7>compared to white.</v>

1628
01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:56.150
<v Speaker 7>And the answer is to the hypothetical </v>
<v Speaker 7>utopia of your imagination.</v>

1629
01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:57.193
<v Speaker 7>The answer is to other similar systems </v>
<v Speaker 7>that have actually existed in time and </v>

1630
01:57:00.321 --> 01:57:03.320
<v Speaker 7>space.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And by that measure I would say the West</v>

1631
01:57:03.321 --> 01:57:08.321
<v Speaker 7>is doing spectacularly well and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>think that we should sync it because of.</v>

1632
01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:11.690
<v Speaker 7>Because we're ignorant to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's available.</v>

1633
01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:22.530
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Postmodern philosophers,</v>

1634
01:57:25.301 --> 01:57:27.490
<v Speaker 4>they mentioned this happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

1635
01:57:29.210 --> 01:57:33.580
<v Speaker 4>destructive ideas caused people </v>
<v Speaker 4>questioning.</v>

1636
01:57:33.730 --> 01:57:38.730
<v Speaker 4>We cited</v>
<v Speaker 4>a who has mentioned as an inspiration,</v>

1637
01:57:41.170 --> 01:57:42.670
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1638
01:57:42.671 --> 01:57:47.450
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how might somebody like or </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody like me</v>

1639
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:50.743
<v Speaker 4>getting each other?</v>

1640
01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:53.990
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a</v>

1641
01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:57.180
<v Speaker 7>reasonable amount of food,</v>
<v Speaker 7>colon,</v>

1642
01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:02.260
<v Speaker 7>I would say that among the </v>
<v Speaker 7>postmodernists he's rather remarkable in</v>

1643
01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:04.990
<v Speaker 7>the fact that you can actually </v>
<v Speaker 7>understand what you say,</v>

1644
01:58:07.070 --> 01:58:07.903
<v Speaker 7>what he wrote particularly surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the idea that mental illness is in </v>

1645
01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:12.993
<v Speaker 7>part a social construct is if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 7>reasonably educated clinician that's </v>

1646
01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:19.713
<v Speaker 7>more than self evident in virtually </v>
<v Speaker 7>every complex activity that human </v>

1647
01:58:24.410 --> 01:58:28.180
<v Speaker 7>engagement is culturally determined to a</v>
<v Speaker 7>large degree,</v>

1648
01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:31.390
<v Speaker 7>a exterra doubt that I have a problem </v>
<v Speaker 7>with.</v>

1649
01:58:32.090 --> 01:58:32.923
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I also know that he put his finger </v>

1650
01:58:35.561 --> 01:58:36.394
<v Speaker 7>on a very complex problem,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is like the central postmodernist </v>

1651
01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:44.410
<v Speaker 7>place.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Every situation allows for a potentially</v>

1652
01:58:44.411 --> 01:58:47.620
<v Speaker 7>infinite number of interpretations which</v>
<v Speaker 7>is true,</v>

1653
01:58:48.130 --> 01:58:52.300
<v Speaker 7>and therefore it's difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 7>determine which interpretation should be</v>

1654
01:58:52.301 --> 01:58:56.230
<v Speaker 7>held up as paramount.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now that's true.</v>

1655
01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:57.273
<v Speaker 7>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the artificial intelligence researchers </v>

1656
01:58:58.631 --> 01:58:59.464
<v Speaker 7>ran into that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They were trying to design systems that </v>

1657
01:59:01.001 --> 01:59:01.834
<v Speaker 7>could perceive the world because the </v>
<v Speaker 7>original idea was that perceiving the </v>

1658
01:59:04.691 --> 01:59:05.524
<v Speaker 7>world was easy because it's just made a </v>
<v Speaker 7>phase and learning how to manipulate </v>

1659
01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:10.330
<v Speaker 7>those states.</v>

1660
01:59:10.330 --> 01:59:13.000
<v Speaker 7>That act would be the complicated </v>
<v Speaker 7>problem,</v>

1661
01:59:13.150 --> 01:59:13.983
<v Speaker 7>but it actually turned out perception </v>
<v Speaker 7>was the complicated problem because </v>

1662
01:59:16.481 --> 01:59:19.030
<v Speaker 7>there's an indefinite number of ways to </v>
<v Speaker 7>perceive things.</v>

1663
01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:20.733
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the reason the postmodernist role were </v>

1664
01:59:23.741 --> 01:59:24.574
<v Speaker 7>wrong is because there aren't an </v>
<v Speaker 7>indefinite number of interpretations of </v>

1665
01:59:28.331 --> 01:59:32.570
<v Speaker 7>the world that don't kill you or make </v>
<v Speaker 7>others killed you.</v>

1666
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:33.783
<v Speaker 7>There's a very constrained number of </v>
<v Speaker 7>interpretations that allow you to </v>

1667
01:59:35.921 --> 01:59:39.130
<v Speaker 7>continue to exist and equally </v>
<v Speaker 7>importantly,</v>

1668
01:59:39.131 --> 01:59:42.220
<v Speaker 7>allow you to continue to exist in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>presence of other people.</v>

1669
01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:43.353
<v Speaker 7>So although there are many </v>
<v Speaker 7>interpretations that you can ferret out </v>

1670
01:59:46.901 --> 01:59:47.734
<v Speaker 7>of the Shakespeare text,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your job is to ferret out what that </v>

1671
01:59:50.201 --> 01:59:51.034
<v Speaker 7>actually helps you live.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's hypothetically the goal of </v>

1672
01:59:54.491 --> 01:59:55.324
<v Speaker 7>the guides to great literature.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so I think the postmodernists </v>

1673
01:59:58.211 --> 02:00:02.200
<v Speaker 7>radically overplayed their hand and </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's particularly true with data.</v>

1674
02:00:02.590 --> 02:00:03.423
<v Speaker 7>And I think that the people who followed</v>
<v Speaker 7>Aryzta are in many cases doing so </v>

1675
02:00:07.121 --> 02:00:07.954
<v Speaker 7>because it's a hell of a lot easier than</v>
<v Speaker 7>actually doing the difficult job of </v>

1676
02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:15.660
<v Speaker 7>extracting out useful tools from the </v>
<v Speaker 7>literature of the world,</v>

1677
02:00:15.730 --> 02:00:16.563
<v Speaker 7>which is what you do when you read,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you extract out useful tools with </v>

1678
02:00:19.541 --> 02:00:23.530
<v Speaker 7>regards to nature being each has said </v>
<v Speaker 7>something about everything.</v>

1679
02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:27.220
<v Speaker 7>And so every philosopher of the modern </v>
<v Speaker 7>age,</v>

1680
02:00:27.490 --> 02:00:28.323
<v Speaker 7>one way or another is deeply influenced </v>
<v Speaker 7>by nature and the problem with niches </v>

1681
02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:36.190
<v Speaker 7>that he was a thinker prolific beyond </v>
<v Speaker 7>comprehension.</v>

1682
02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:39.520
<v Speaker 7>Virtually I did recently.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I did a,</v>

1683
02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:44.200
<v Speaker 7>I think it was a 45 minute video on one </v>
<v Speaker 7>paragraph.</v>

1684
02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:46.210
<v Speaker 7>You choose beyond good and evil and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>know,</v>

1685
02:00:46.211 --> 02:00:47.044
<v Speaker 7>I barely started to scrape the surface </v>
<v Speaker 7>of it and of course he has multiple </v>

1686
02:00:50.051 --> 02:00:54.160
<v Speaker 7>books.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So Nisha is a very strange character.</v>

1687
02:00:54.161 --> 02:00:58.210
<v Speaker 7>And he said that he philosophize with a </v>
<v Speaker 7>hammer and he meant it.</v>

1688
02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:02.680
<v Speaker 7>And his critique of Christianity was </v>
<v Speaker 7>devastating I would say.</v>

1689
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:04.263
<v Speaker 7>But I would also say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and this is a rather shocking </v>

1690
02:01:06.431 --> 02:01:09.280
<v Speaker 7>comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that nature play.</v>

1691
02:01:09.670 --> 02:01:10.503
<v Speaker 7>The role that you played with regard to </v>
<v Speaker 7>Christianity was the same rule that a </v>

1692
02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:15.873
<v Speaker 7>complaining that wooed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is the can devour athlete but </v>

1693
02:01:18.371 --> 02:01:19.580
<v Speaker 7>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 7>flesh and leave,</v>

1694
02:01:19.581 --> 02:01:20.414
<v Speaker 7>what's healthy behind,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I think there is a reading if </v>

1695
02:01:21.971 --> 02:01:22.804
<v Speaker 7>Nietzsche that allows each of that </v>
<v Speaker 7>allows for precisely that when he said </v>

1696
02:01:26.561 --> 02:01:27.394
<v Speaker 7>that God was dead,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he also said that that would be a </v>

1697
02:01:30.461 --> 02:01:31.210
<v Speaker 7>catastrophe.</v>

1698
02:01:31.210 --> 02:01:32.043
<v Speaker 7>The likes of which we could not even </v>
<v Speaker 7>imagine that society itself would </v>

1699
02:01:34.630 --> 02:01:38.350
<v Speaker 7>oscillate back and forth murderously for</v>
<v Speaker 7>centuries as a consequence.</v>

1700
02:01:38.590 --> 02:01:39.423
<v Speaker 7>So it wasn't triumphant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He strolled to find out what an </v>

1701
02:01:43.101 --> 02:01:43.934
<v Speaker 7>alternative to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yet he formulated the idea of the </v>

1702
02:01:46.461 --> 02:01:48.200
<v Speaker 7>overlap,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so essentially right.</v>

1703
02:01:48.201 --> 02:01:51.030
<v Speaker 7>The Superman was capable of creating his</v>
<v Speaker 7>own.</v>

1704
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:52.903
<v Speaker 7>I think that each state there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it was a mistake that was </v>

1705
02:01:55.911 --> 02:01:57.440
<v Speaker 7>rectified,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Carl Young,</v>

1706
02:01:57.710 --> 02:02:01.520
<v Speaker 7>because you'll know that I think was </v>
<v Speaker 7>really the first person.</v>

1707
02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:02.413
<v Speaker 7>Although Nicha has has intimations of </v>
<v Speaker 7>this because nature does say that art </v>

1708
02:02:06.311 --> 02:02:08.090
<v Speaker 7>drives philosophize,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1709
02:02:08.091 --> 02:02:11.550
<v Speaker 7>Which is very biologically oriented </v>
<v Speaker 7>observation.</v>

1710
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:14.150
<v Speaker 7>Like what you noted was that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1711
02:02:14.170 --> 02:02:18.290
<v Speaker 7>we don't create our own values because </v>
<v Speaker 7>the values are implicit within us,</v>

1712
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:19.183
<v Speaker 7>but we can read the start and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was so interested in the analysis of </v>

1713
02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:23.323
<v Speaker 7>mythology and the unconscious and so I </v>
<v Speaker 7>think the postmodernists took the the </v>

1714
02:02:29.690 --> 02:02:30.523
<v Speaker 7>part of nature that's only destructive </v>
<v Speaker 7>to its final conclusion and that's </v>

1715
02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:35.690
<v Speaker 7>what's being played out now.</v>

1716
02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:37.493
<v Speaker 7>Derrida's critique of modern </v>
<v Speaker 7>civilization is failing a logocentric </v>

1717
02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:42.320
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Male dominated,</v>

1718
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:43.183
<v Speaker 7>centered around the idea of the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He regarded that as nothing but a tool </v>

1719
02:02:46.071 --> 02:02:46.904
<v Speaker 7>of oppression and marginalization.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's some truth in that because </v>

1720
02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:51.433
<v Speaker 7>whenever you produce a value system,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you also exclude things from the value </v>

1721
02:02:55.431 --> 02:02:56.264
<v Speaker 7>system as valuable obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the problem I think that the </v>

1722
02:03:00.441 --> 02:03:01.274
<v Speaker 7>postmodernist smoke address you the </v>
<v Speaker 7>alternative pretty all your systems and </v>

1723
02:03:07.251 --> 02:03:08.084
<v Speaker 7>dealing with the with the exclusive that</v>
<v Speaker 7>comes along with that is to drop it </v>

1724
02:03:11.590 --> 02:03:16.590
<v Speaker 7>nihilistic chaos and worse while you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>drawing to get nihilistic chaos,</v>

1725
02:03:16.890 --> 02:03:21.710
<v Speaker 7>you're going to call out sources of </v>
<v Speaker 7>totalitarian order and so it's no,</v>

1726
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.863
<v Speaker 7>it's no sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What I seek postmodernism doing do </v>

1727
02:03:26.050 --> 02:03:27.360
<v Speaker 7>students,</v>
<v Speaker 7>generally speaking,</v>

1728
02:03:27.361 --> 02:03:31.070
<v Speaker 7>it's demoralizing completely until they </v>
<v Speaker 7>come to university.</v>

1729
02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:32.053
<v Speaker 7>Looking to categorize the identity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>often cleaning to the last rebated </v>

1730
02:03:35.871 --> 02:03:39.320
<v Speaker 7>shreds of their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's just what's keeping them afloat.</v>

1731
02:03:39.570 --> 02:03:42.590
<v Speaker 7>All the postmodernist professors do is </v>
<v Speaker 7>take those remaining.</v>

1732
02:03:42.591 --> 02:03:45.380
<v Speaker 7>Frank's took her along to stay above the</v>
<v Speaker 7>water,</v>

1733
02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:48.590
<v Speaker 7>tell their illusory and take them away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1734
02:03:48.591 --> 02:03:50.120
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>now you're free.</v>

1735
02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:52.340
<v Speaker 7>Like I've dropped you in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the ocean.</v>

1736
02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:55.040
<v Speaker 7>You could swim in any direction you </v>
<v Speaker 7>want.</v>

1737
02:03:55.550 --> 02:03:56.383
<v Speaker 7>You're free.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I think that that's rooted in large </v>

1738
02:03:59.331 --> 02:04:01.250
<v Speaker 7>part.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Even in hatred of youth.</v>

1739
02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:06.020
<v Speaker 7>I really believed that because why would</v>
<v Speaker 7>you crippled people if you didn't pay?</v>

1740
02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:09.310
<v Speaker 7>And so there's hatred of humanity </v>
<v Speaker 7>lurking at the bar,</v>

1741
02:04:09.311 --> 02:04:11.930
<v Speaker 7>but the worst excesses of video logs in </v>
<v Speaker 7>general.</v>

1742
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:13.600
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you hear this from environmentalist,</v>

1743
02:04:13.601 --> 02:04:16.370
<v Speaker 7>so I've heard this many times,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the planet,</v>

1744
02:04:16.371 --> 02:04:18.430
<v Speaker 7>it would be better off if there were no </v>
<v Speaker 7>people on it.</v>

1745
02:04:18.850 --> 02:04:19.220
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1746
02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:21.730
<v Speaker 7>let's keep you away from the thermal </v>
<v Speaker 7>nuclear weapons.</v>

1747
02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

1748
02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:34.890
<v Speaker 7>So it's not easy to come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 7>canonical interpretation of nature.</v>

1749
02:04:34.891 --> 02:04:37.140
<v Speaker 7>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Again,</v>

1750
02:04:37.230 --> 02:04:38.063
<v Speaker 7>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought for a long time from a </v>

1751
02:04:41.281 --> 02:04:42.114
<v Speaker 7>psychological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I tried to understand whether the </v>

1752
02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:47.310
<v Speaker 7>speeches philosophy that drove him </v>
<v Speaker 7>insane,</v>

1753
02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:50.250
<v Speaker 7>but I think the evidence for that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>nonexistent.</v>

1754
02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:51.113
<v Speaker 7>I think he did suffer from a </v>
<v Speaker 7>degenerative brain disease severity and </v>

1755
02:04:54.150 --> 02:04:56.460
<v Speaker 7>I actually think different fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 7>laws,</v>

1756
02:04:56.490 --> 02:04:59.760
<v Speaker 7>which I haven't read everything he wrote</v>
<v Speaker 7>because there's books,</v>

1757
02:04:59.761 --> 02:05:00.594
<v Speaker 7>pumps,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I read this great works in </v>

1758
02:05:01.561 --> 02:05:03.930
<v Speaker 7>chronological order,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think is fundamental.</v>

1759
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:04.783
<v Speaker 7>Philosophy is is affirmative negative,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he's a critic and he wanted to find </v>

1760
02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:14.390
<v Speaker 7>something that he could stand on and </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what critics,</v>

1761
02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:16.830
<v Speaker 7>real critics here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're not looking to destroy you.</v>

1762
02:05:16.831 --> 02:05:17.664
<v Speaker 7>I'm looking for something that you could</v>
<v Speaker 7>stand up and nature was certainly very </v>

1763
02:05:19.831 --> 02:05:20.664
<v Speaker 7>useful to me in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I knew it was also extraordinary useful </v>

1764
02:05:22.831 --> 02:05:27.210
<v Speaker 7>to crawl your was a real student of </v>
<v Speaker 7>nature and I was really devoting himself</v>

1765
02:05:27.211 --> 02:05:29.670
<v Speaker 7>to solving the problem that each </v>
<v Speaker 7>proposed,</v>

1766
02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:30.653
<v Speaker 7>which is well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what do we do with the aftermath of the </v>

1767
02:05:31.861 --> 02:05:32.694
<v Speaker 7>depth of God and humans?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Answer was we rescued from the deaths </v>

1768
02:05:36.340 --> 02:05:37.173
<v Speaker 7>and that's the right dance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what the university should be </v>

1769
02:05:39.211 --> 02:05:40.890
<v Speaker 7>doing with young people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like you're dead.</v>

1770
02:05:40.930 --> 02:05:43.610
<v Speaker 7>Father's in the library,</v>
<v Speaker 7>go out there and fought.</v>

1771
02:05:43.690 --> 02:05:44.680
<v Speaker 7>Fair to help.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1772
02:05:44.690 --> 02:05:45.523
<v Speaker 7>And Unite.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Live and become the thing that keeps </v>

1773
02:05:48.061 --> 02:05:49.450
<v Speaker 7>chaos at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1774
02:05:52.210 --> 02:05:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1775
02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:05.440
<v Speaker 7>Concludes our talk with Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Please join me in thanking.</v>

1776
02:06:05.441 --> 02:06:06.274
<v Speaker 7>You've been getting.</v>

1777
02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
