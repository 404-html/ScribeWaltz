1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So today we're going to talk about</v>

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>openness.</v>

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.233
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>you might say in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness is the last discovered that the</v>

5
00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:16.414
<v Speaker 1>big five traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also the one I would say that </v>

6
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:21.400
<v Speaker 1>comes up most weekly in the factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.273
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when hands ising formulated his trait </v>

8
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.870
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was extroversion,</v>

9
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and psychotic system,</v>

10
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.073
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.383
<v Speaker 1>he felt that he encapsulated all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental variation in human </v>

12
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:45.711
<v Speaker 1>personality and he was loath to include </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence as a personality trait.</v>

13
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Now the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>

14
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:51.144
<v Speaker 1>ISM and openness is rather complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isaac basically felt that people could </v>

15
00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>be extroverted and that would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive dimension.</v>

16
00:00:58.681 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:00.684
<v Speaker 1>high in negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the negative emotion </v>

18
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:02.754
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that they also could have a </v>

19
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>predisposition to psychosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that would be,</v>

20
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.143
<v Speaker 1>he was thinking about the brain systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that underlie schizophrenia and that </v>

21
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.613
<v Speaker 1>that tendency to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dissociate and develop </v>

22
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:19.134
<v Speaker 1>hallucinations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also maybe the system in human </v>

23
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>beings that are affected by </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic drugs,</v>

24
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.133
<v Speaker 1>which seem to affect human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently than they have other </v>

25
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

26
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:32.964
<v Speaker 1>but Isaac psychotic cism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually it was broken down into low </v>

27
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.194
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness and low conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't predict the predisposition to </v>

28
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>psychosis at all.</v>

29
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And later factor analysis found that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could load out</v>

30
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and creativity as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality dimension separately.</v>

31
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a bit tricky because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq measures.</v>

32
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.493
<v Speaker 1>Iq measures are much more direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>measures of intelligence than the </v>

33
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:01.614
<v Speaker 1>personality measures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the personality measure is </v>

34
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think you're smart?</v>

35
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.123
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm being a bit flip about that </v>

36
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>because it's more sophisticated than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

37
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>But when you talk about someone as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart person,</v>

38
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>you're generally referring to the trait </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we would describe as openness.</v>

39
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>You also are doing that when you refer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

40
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.233
<v Speaker 1>to creativity as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a predisposition and you could </v>

41
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:27.714
<v Speaker 1>measure the smart part a lot better with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq and Iq is also a pretty good </v>

42
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>predictor of creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

43
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's see how they're associated.</v>

44
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:43.311
<v Speaker 1>So he remember that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your big two traits,</v>

45
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.060
<v Speaker 1>stability of plasticity and stability </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks down into conscientiousness,</v>

46
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability and agreeableness.</v>

47
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>And then you can see how each of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects are correlated,</v>

48
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:54.474
<v Speaker 1>how highly they're correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So industriousness and orderliness at </v>

49
00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:59.130
<v Speaker 1>about 0.4,</v>
<v Speaker 1>volatility,</v>

50
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal and emotional stability or </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism actually,</v>

51
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.573
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 0.6 and agreeableness and </v>

52
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:06.664
<v Speaker 1>politeness at about 0.4.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next trade is extroversion </v>

53
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.984
<v Speaker 1>and openness that makes plasticity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were high in plasticity tend </v>

54
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:18.874
<v Speaker 1>to be good entrepreneurs by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And extroversion rates into </v>

55
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.153
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness and enthusiasm correlated </v>
<v Speaker 1>at about 0.5 and then openness and </v>

56
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and the correlation there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is lower.</v>

57
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:33.424
<v Speaker 1>It's 0.35.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average correlation between the big </v>

58
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:40.741
<v Speaker 1>five is 0.2 and the correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the big two is about 0.2 and so you have</v>

59
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might ask yourself,</v>

60
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:43.894
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it correlation of point for twice as </v>

61
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>large as a correlation of point to </v>
<v Speaker 1>announce to that is no,</v>

62
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>because you have to square them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare the marath medically.</v>

63
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.520
<v Speaker 1>So correlation of point to give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>0.044% squared,</v>

64
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.873
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of correlation port four gives you </v>

65
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:03.304
<v Speaker 1>16% squared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's actually a difference of a </v>

66
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:06.784
<v Speaker 1>factor of four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need to remember that when </v>

67
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:10.114
<v Speaker 1>you're considering effects sizes so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can understand exactly what they </v>

68
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:15.724
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know if you're accounting for </v>

69
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>16% of the variants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be a correlation of 0.4 then</v>

70
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:22.354
<v Speaker 1>that leaves 84% left unexplained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a bit of an overstatement </v>

71
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:32.731
<v Speaker 1>most of the time in psychology because </v>
<v Speaker 1>our measures are are rather imperfect.</v>

72
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.263
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give someone a personality test </v>

73
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:40.144
<v Speaker 1>and let's say that the validity of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>self report is about 0.6 and 0.7 which </v>

74
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:45.574
<v Speaker 1>is probably what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it might be a little bit higher </v>

75
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

76
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.463
<v Speaker 1>that means that they're self reporting </v>
<v Speaker 1>is only picking up 50% of the variation </v>

77
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>in their personality.</v>

78
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 1>And if you pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know if,</v>

79
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.823
<v Speaker 1>if your are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if an are derived from that measure </v>

80
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.273
<v Speaker 1>accounts for 16% of the variance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense it's twice as powerful as </v>

81
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 1>it appears to be because the measure is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so error retinal and a lot of the things</v>

82
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:12.930
<v Speaker 1>that we measure in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our error ridden.</v>

83
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.773
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlations are generally what it </v>

84
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although not in variable,</v>

85
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:18.934
<v Speaker 1>he isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correlations are bigger than they </v>

86
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>

87
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.473
<v Speaker 1>the correlations that come up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality research are certainly big </v>

88
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:26.824
<v Speaker 1>enough to be meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say meaningful in terms of </v>

89
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.833
<v Speaker 1>predicting major life outcomes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicting important economic outcomes </v>

90
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>

91
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:42.421
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you might ask yourself</v>

92
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>is exactly what does intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure.</v>

93
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.880
<v Speaker 1>So we'll start with intelligence from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

94
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>and that would be equivalent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect,</v>

95
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:51.610
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

96
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.443
<v Speaker 1>So intellect in the big five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aspect seems to be associated with </v>

97
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.140
<v Speaker 1>interest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas the openness proper aspect seems</v>

98
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:06.371
<v Speaker 1>to be associated with aesthetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensibility and creativity.</v>

99
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way to think about it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as we've been able to figure out.</v>

100
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:10.904
<v Speaker 1>And the biggest relationship is between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the intellect and intelligence as </v>

101
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.063
<v Speaker 1>measured psychometrically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now intelligence is an interesting </v>

102
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very controversial.</v>

103
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

104
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.463
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that continually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens over and over again in </v>

105
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:30.164
<v Speaker 1>psychology is that psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover all sorts of new kinds of </v>

106
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:33.374
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest two proponents of that sort </v>

107
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:38.114
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose we're Bob Sternberg who came </v>

108
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 1>up with this thing he called practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and then Howard Gardner who</v>

109
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 1>came up with the theory of multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligences,</v>

110
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>which had a very large effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational psychology.</v>

111
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the theory was first proposed.</v>

112
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.933
<v Speaker 1>And that's not saying much because </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking it's very difficult </v>

113
00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:56.144
<v Speaker 1>to find a discipline that's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to fads than educational </v>

114
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>

115
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each fat is worse than the previous one.</v>

116
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gardner positive that I think there were</v>

117
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:12.140
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh there they are,</v>

118
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 1>seven or eight different intelligence as</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic,</v>

119
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 1>musical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>

120
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 1>mathematical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spacial body,</v>

121
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 1>kinesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal and interpersonal.</v>

122
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.133
<v Speaker 1>And people talk about emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and they talk about </v>

123
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:29.240
<v Speaker 1>practical intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I'm concerned,</v>

124
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:33.620
<v Speaker 1>all of that's complete rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's technical reasons for that.</v>

125
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's technical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical reasons for that.</v>

126
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is you can't just mess </v>
<v Speaker 1>up a word.</v>

127
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.473
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole point of having a word is so </v>

128
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:43.694
<v Speaker 1>that it defined some things at described</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things and doesn't describe other </v>

129
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:47.474
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

130
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.403
<v Speaker 1>And so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make the word intelligence a </v>

131
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.510
<v Speaker 1>comment for whatever you want.</v>

132
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>So you can say that the ability to dance</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a form of intelligence.</v>

133
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.223
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is you blur </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the word so bad that you can't tell </v>

134
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 1>what it means anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

135
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:05.414
<v Speaker 1>and I would also point out we had </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly good words for those major </v>

136
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:12.971
<v Speaker 1>intelligence as we called them talents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's perfectly reasonable to make</v>

137
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 1>a distinction between the talent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

138
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

139
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you know the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>

140
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:24.110
<v Speaker 1>if things look similar to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then how do you know if they're the same</v>

141
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:26.420
<v Speaker 1>or different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's exactly what you do when you</v>

142
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:27.254
<v Speaker 1>do the construct validity process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you rated a number of </v>

143
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:32.054
<v Speaker 1>people on their dancing ability and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rated the number of people on their </v>

144
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>ability to multiply two digit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

145
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 1>two digit numbers in their head quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>while then you see,</v>

146
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 1>technically if both of those were </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligences,</v>

147
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.233
<v Speaker 1>then the people who could dance better </v>
<v Speaker 1>could multiply two digit numbers faster </v>

148
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:55.250
<v Speaker 1>in their head and they would be slightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

149
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

150
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens when I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>any diet coke.</v>

151
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.123
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if intelligence was the right word to </v>

152
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:09.054
<v Speaker 1>subsume both of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you'd see is that would be a </v>

153
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:13.194
<v Speaker 1>high correlation with people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>good dancers would also be the ones who </v>

154
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:20.541
<v Speaker 1>could multiply most rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean multiply in their head.</v>

155
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

156
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract out a single factor like that.</v>

157
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.020
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not the case that those things</v>

158
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 1>associated like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for something to be one phenomena,</v>

159
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.600
<v Speaker 1>the things that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

160
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 1>obviously I've talked too much this </v>
<v Speaker 1>semester.</v>

161
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:55.490
<v Speaker 1>All the things that are subsumed under </v>
<v Speaker 1>that definition has to be correlated and</v>

162
00:09:56.401 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 1>highly correlated because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not the same thing.</v>

163
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 1>It's the definition of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

164
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:03.504
<v Speaker 1>Rq is a very peculiar construct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very unique construct from a </v>

165
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:10.974
<v Speaker 1>psychological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also more generally from a social </v>

166
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:14.724
<v Speaker 1>science perspective because Iq has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most predictive validity of anything </v>

167
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 1>ever discovered in the social sciences </v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

168
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Now the other thing that is interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about our Iq is that a lot of the people</v>

169
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:33.300
<v Speaker 1>who were interested early in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>measurement of intelligence,</v>

170
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.243
<v Speaker 1>we're engineers turned psychologists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the engineers have actually had quite a </v>

171
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:40.224
<v Speaker 1>whopping effect on psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason that psychology has </v>

172
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.670
<v Speaker 1>an advanced methodology and advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical techniques is because we got</v>

173
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:51.120
<v Speaker 1>invaded by engineers in the early part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century.</v>

174
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.013
<v Speaker 1>And so the engineer has made our </v>
<v Speaker 1>measurements much more rigorous than </v>

175
00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 1>they would've otherwise been.</v>

176
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's been a huge advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

177
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:02.010
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's happening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology is that starting to eat other</v>

178
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:02.844
<v Speaker 1>disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's had a massive effect on </v>

179
00:11:05.011 --> 00:11:08.100
<v Speaker 1>economics and it's going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive effect on political science.</v>

180
00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:08.934
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to measure things and it </v>

181
00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:13.770
<v Speaker 1>actually turns out to matter that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to measure things.</v>

182
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.023
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're going to be talking </v>

183
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.570
<v Speaker 1>about something that's specific and well</v>
<v Speaker 1>defined,</v>

184
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.633
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't make it specific and well </v>

185
00:11:21.951 --> 00:11:25.500
<v Speaker 1>defined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you can really do is argue about it.</v>

186
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.870
<v Speaker 1>And you know there are better and worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>

187
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:31.704
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>an argument is good doesn't mean it's </v>

188
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:35.364
<v Speaker 1>right and that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So also something to remember when </v>

189
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:42.090
<v Speaker 1>you're arguing about people that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have relationship with because you know,</v>

190
00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:44.670
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to be better at </v>
<v Speaker 1>structuring your arguments and your more</v>

191
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:45.504
<v Speaker 1>verbally fluent man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps more assertive and maybe less </v>

192
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 1>agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to win the arguments.</v>

193
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.750
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unfortunately,</v>

194
00:11:53.751 --> 00:11:57.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as far as I can tell me,</v>

195
00:11:57.471 --> 00:11:58.304
<v Speaker 1>empirical process is the only way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of that is restricting or </v>

196
00:12:03.621 --> 00:12:07.550
<v Speaker 1>eliminating the catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the detrimental effects of pure theory.</v>

197
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.603
<v Speaker 2>No and</v>

198
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our measurement techniques have been</v>

199
00:12:13.021 --> 00:12:14.130
<v Speaker 1>pretty good about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

200
00:12:14.131 --> 00:12:18.270
<v Speaker 1>So now what happens with Iq here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can define Iq for use,</v>

201
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.060
<v Speaker 1>just so you know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

202
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.650
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you had a library of </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

203
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.880
<v Speaker 1>So here's some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's millions of questions in this</v>

204
00:12:32.011 --> 00:12:32.844
<v Speaker 1>data bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's two times 68 what's the capitol </v>

205
00:12:36.481 --> 00:12:38.850
<v Speaker 1>of Georgia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the definition of hyper tricks?</v>

206
00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Anemia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What comes after in this sequence?</v>

207
00:12:42.391 --> 00:12:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Two four eight 16</v>

208
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.170
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

209
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.003
<v Speaker 1>remember these numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd tell you the numbers and then </v>

210
00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:50.004
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to tell me the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two (413) 576-1215 1418 2022 and then I </v>

211
00:12:58.981 --> 00:13:01.320
<v Speaker 1>might ask you in fact to remember them </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards.</v>

212
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's a working memory task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

213
00:13:04.081 --> 00:13:06.450
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are all questions that require,</v>

214
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.270
<v Speaker 1>they require abstraction and mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>operations.</v>

215
00:13:09.271 --> 00:13:12.660
<v Speaker 1>That's the key as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

216
00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:13.494
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what constitutes and </v>

217
00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:15.594
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it looks to me like what an </v>

218
00:13:18.061 --> 00:13:18.894
<v Speaker 1>abstraction is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the capacity to formulate an </v>

219
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.043
<v Speaker 1>abstraction and there's the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate them to formulate an </v>

220
00:13:24.541 --> 00:13:25.374
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you do is you take a </v>

221
00:13:26.551 --> 00:13:30.660
<v Speaker 1>phenomena and you represent it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's low resolution,</v>

222
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.850
<v Speaker 1>that's more or less what an abstraction </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

223
00:13:32.851 --> 00:13:37.851
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I imagine this classroom later,</v>

224
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

225
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.793
<v Speaker 1>my imagined representation is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a much lower resolution than the </v>

226
00:13:44.611 --> 00:13:45.444
<v Speaker 1>actual classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's sufficient for certain </v>

227
00:13:48.211 --> 00:13:49.044
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a thumbnail on a computer is </v>

228
00:13:51.151 --> 00:13:53.010
<v Speaker 1>sufficient for certain purposes.</v>

229
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:57.390
<v Speaker 1>And then once I simplify the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

230
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.583
<v Speaker 1>the phenomena in question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can also perform certain </v>

231
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.173
<v Speaker 1>operations on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in imagination or semantically and </v>

232
00:14:06.391 --> 00:14:09.720
<v Speaker 1>the capacity degenerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That abstraction and the trends and make</v>

233
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.970
<v Speaker 1>the ability to manipulate those seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the core element of intelligence.</v>

234
00:14:14.971 --> 00:14:18.030
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

235
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.570
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking as a human dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you know,</v>

236
00:14:21.571 --> 00:14:23.190
<v Speaker 1>obviously you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

237
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.653
<v Speaker 1>you can to some degree rank order </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals in terms of their capacity to </v>

238
00:14:27.931 --> 00:14:28.764
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's this whopping </v>

239
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.840
<v Speaker 1>differentiation between human beings and</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals in this area,</v>

240
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.690
<v Speaker 1>particularly is because we can use </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractions.</v>

241
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.553
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard a woman named Temple grandin </v>

242
00:14:39.571 --> 00:14:42.120
<v Speaker 1>speak once and it was very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>

243
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.570
<v Speaker 1>She's very autistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

244
00:14:45.571 --> 00:14:46.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very,</v>

245
00:14:46.921 --> 00:14:48.240
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very brilliant,</v>

246
00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:49.074
<v Speaker 1>which is not very common for people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are artistic because usually it's </v>

247
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:52.544
<v Speaker 1>associated with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a substantial amount of intellectual </v>

248
00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:54.620
<v Speaker 1>impairment.</v>

249
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.453
<v Speaker 1>But she also had an extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>devoted parent who spent almost all of </v>

250
00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 1>her time trying to pull her daughter out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her autistic isolation.</v>

251
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.713
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandon has gone on to become a </v>

252
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 1>University of Chicago professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she works in the,</v>

253
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:15.420
<v Speaker 1>in the agricultural area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she has redesigned the mission,</v>

254
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.790
<v Speaker 1>the chutes walkways basically that take </v>
<v Speaker 1>cattle to the slaughterhouse.</v>

255
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:24.260
<v Speaker 1>And she's done that to make them less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less stressful for the animals.</v>

256
00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:26.840
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that she can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as far as she's concerned,</v>

257
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:27.674
<v Speaker 1>is because she thinks like an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means as far as she can </v>

258
00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 1>tell is that she cannot generate an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction,</v>

259
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 1>not easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now she could speak.</v>

260
00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:38.690
<v Speaker 1>So obviously she learned to do it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree,</v>

261
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:39.524
<v Speaker 1>but she talked more about inner talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more about deficits and imagination or </v>

262
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:43.484
<v Speaker 1>concrete [inaudible] of imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the weird things that you see </v>

263
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:48.980
<v Speaker 1>with autistic kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not frequently,</v>

264
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 1>but now and then it's actually a famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of this on the web.</v>

265
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.773
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's from Britain and you can </v>

266
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:56.084
<v Speaker 1>take them in a helicopter and fly him </v>
<v Speaker 1>over a city and then he can stand in </v>

267
00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:03.410
<v Speaker 1>front of a paid piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 12 by eight start anywhere and draw</v>

268
00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:04.900
<v Speaker 1>the entire city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

269
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.630
<v Speaker 1>and now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you see autistic savant who are</v>

270
00:16:08.631 --> 00:16:11.750
<v Speaker 1>children who can draw perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>realistically.</v>

271
00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:15.410
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe they'll draw a horse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even start the horse.</v>

272
00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Like a kid would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a normal kid would,</v>

273
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 1>would sketch the outline of the horse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and put some eyes in,</v>

274
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:21.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start anywhere and make the horse </v>

275
00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.110
<v Speaker 1>perfectly detailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

276
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.840
<v Speaker 1>and what Clarendon claimed was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she said,</v>

277
00:16:29.841 --> 00:16:30.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of,</v>

278
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:35.240
<v Speaker 1>think of house or think of church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she says,</v>

279
00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:37.220
<v Speaker 1>what comes to mind if you think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>church?</v>

280
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:38.330
<v Speaker 1>And maybe she'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

281
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:42.040
<v Speaker 1>you'd get this little image of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of shaped like this with a,</v>

282
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a steeple on top or across or something </v>

283
00:16:44.661 --> 00:16:45.140
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

284
00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's the church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you think of house and it's</v>

285
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:49.100
<v Speaker 1>like a little kid's house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:49.934
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a rectangle and a parallel and </v>

287
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Graham and that's not a Parallelogram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell you call that thing on</v>

288
00:16:55.341 --> 00:16:56.174
<v Speaker 1>the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's got a chimney with smoke </v>

289
00:16:57.801 --> 00:16:58.760
<v Speaker 1>coming out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

290
00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Two windows and a door house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

291
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:02.540
<v Speaker 1>But there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no houses like that.</v>

292
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Like each individual house looks a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than that.</v>

293
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 1>And so in order to have that conception </v>
<v Speaker 1>of house,</v>

294
00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:10.094
<v Speaker 1>what essentially what you have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take the class of all </v>

295
00:17:12.651 --> 00:17:13.484
<v Speaker 1>possible houses and extract out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>features that are in common across all </v>

296
00:17:17.271 --> 00:17:19.250
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an abstraction.</v>

297
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 1>And so as far as Grandin's concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't have obstructions like that,</v>

298
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.020
<v Speaker 1>which when you ask her to remember to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of church,</v>

299
00:17:27.021 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 1>she remembers at Church it's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>singular instances.</v>

300
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about human beings is that,</v>

301
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.293
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we perceive singular instances to some </v>

302
00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:38.984
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I think our abstraction </v>

303
00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:43.130
<v Speaker 1>capacity all often interferes with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to do that.</v>

304
00:17:43.131 --> 00:17:46.970
<v Speaker 1>But we also perceive abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can kind of tell this,</v>

305
00:17:46.971 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 1>if you're ever trying to learn to draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I say draw a hound,</v>

306
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.110
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of you,</v>

307
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:52.944
<v Speaker 1>unless you have artistic training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to draw up what's </v>

308
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.940
<v Speaker 1>essentially a hero glyphic hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

309
00:17:57.941 --> 00:18:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I think the drawings the children come </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with aren't drawings.</v>

310
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:01.554
<v Speaker 1>I think their hero glyphs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're abstracted representations that </v>

311
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:08.040
<v Speaker 1>are quasi linguistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not artwork there.</v>

312
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 1>They're pro prodo language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

313
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.190
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here are glyphs,</v>

314
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:12.024
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're one of the earliest forms of </v>

315
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:14.010
<v Speaker 1>written language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

316
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you want to communicate about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

317
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:17.640
<v Speaker 1>why not draw an image?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

318
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:19.740
<v Speaker 1>And then the eventually the image turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a word.</v>

319
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.573
<v Speaker 1>But I actually think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the developmental </v>

320
00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:24.570
<v Speaker 1>progression of language among human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

321
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.660
<v Speaker 1>It's the abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that image first and then it's the word.</v>

322
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

323
00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:31.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you drew a hand,</v>

324
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.610
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to draw a hieroglyphic hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five fingers or maybe even four,</v>

325
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:36.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what they do.</v>

326
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:37.703
<v Speaker 1>That's what animators do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't fit all those sausages on one </v>

327
00:18:39.901 --> 00:18:41.190
<v Speaker 1>circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:44.250
<v Speaker 1>so they just simplify it down to four </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one even cares.</v>

329
00:18:44.251 --> 00:18:46.830
<v Speaker 1>You Watch an animation automated </v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

330
00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 1>which is highly abstracted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

331
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:49.194
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homer Simpson looks nothing like an </v>

332
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.653
<v Speaker 1>actual person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really tremendously unlike an </v>

333
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 1>actual person that's completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant,</v>

334
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after two or three seconds,</v>

335
00:18:58.171 --> 00:19:01.740
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is also why I think three d movies</v>

336
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:02.574
<v Speaker 1>never really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never a technology that's ever </v>

337
00:19:04.921 --> 00:19:06.900
<v Speaker 1>caught on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's after the first four seconds.</v>

338
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.733
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's irrelevant whether you see it in </v>

339
00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:10.734
<v Speaker 1>three dimensions because you don't need </v>
<v Speaker 1>much information to actually structure </v>

340
00:19:13.441 --> 00:19:14.970
<v Speaker 1>your perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

341
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:18.630
<v Speaker 1>if you want to see your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough so that you can draw it,</v>

342
00:19:18.631 --> 00:19:21.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to snap out of your normal mode</v>
<v Speaker 1>of perception.</v>

343
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:22.463
<v Speaker 1>I find it's often a lot easier to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that with one eye closed because it </v>

344
00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:25.524
<v Speaker 1>flattens it out and then you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop looking at your hand as if it's a </v>

345
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:29.514
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at it again like it's </v>

346
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 1>an object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you do that it's actually</v>

347
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:35.520
<v Speaker 1>rather shocking cause it's such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange looking thing.</v>

348
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:36.354
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put your hand in a non-canonical </v>

349
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.670
<v Speaker 1>position that's a canonical position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say you put your hand in the non</v>

350
00:19:42.671 --> 00:19:44.640
<v Speaker 1>canonical position and then look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

351
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.410
<v Speaker 1>it's the weirdest shape thing.</v>

352
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.243
<v Speaker 1>It's quite shocking to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can draw it once you can </v>

353
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:52.620
<v Speaker 1>actually see it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before that you're pretty much stuck</v>

354
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:54.450
<v Speaker 1>in hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

355
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.003
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens with intelligence </v>

356
00:19:59.161 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 1>is that people are capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstracting and then they can manipulate</v>

357
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.180
<v Speaker 1>abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so let's take another look at,</v>

358
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.710
<v Speaker 1>at what abstractions might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

359
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.433
<v Speaker 1>now part of the reason I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction is so useful is because </v>

360
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.153
<v Speaker 1>things are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really complicated and it's going to be </v>

361
00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 1>a lot more difficult to manipulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual thing that to manipulate some</v>

362
00:20:19.891 --> 00:20:22.260
<v Speaker 1>represent to div,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction of it.</v>

363
00:20:22.261 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 1>So if you could get an abstraction that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that captures the gist of the entity.</v>

364
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Now how would we do that is not exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious,</v>

365
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:32.520
<v Speaker 1>but if you can then you can expand a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>more resources,</v>

366
00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on the relevant parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

367
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.420
<v Speaker 1>of the entity and a lot last time </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on the irrelevant parts.</v>

368
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.820
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

369
00:20:41.821 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 1>if you ask a child to draw a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what color the house is is irrelevant.</v>

370
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Now why it's irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly obvious.</v>

371
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:50.194
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's because color can vary </v>
<v Speaker 1>across houses and color varies across </v>

372
00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:54.604
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so color turns out to be a non </v>

373
00:20:57.211 --> 00:21:00.070
<v Speaker 1>canonical element of house so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>just dispense with it.</v>

374
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.080
<v Speaker 1>When you're thinking about a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>

375
00:21:02.081 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 1>well it doesn't matter what the into </v>
<v Speaker 1>houses,</v>

376
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.793
<v Speaker 1>it's still a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly defines those features </v>

377
00:21:08.591 --> 00:21:09.424
<v Speaker 1>that make something a house rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else or are not that easy to </v>

378
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:13.390
<v Speaker 1>figure out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

379
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

380
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:19.120
<v Speaker 1>how's has four walls and a roof?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are the external walls.</v>

381
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Speaker 1>And I guess you could identify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimal necessary components,</v>

382
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:24.760
<v Speaker 1>but even that's not so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so simple.</v>

383
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.163
<v Speaker 1>And you could say a house is also </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that someone lives in which </v>

384
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:30.574
<v Speaker 1>allows you to put caves as houses </v>
<v Speaker 1>because caves obviously share very </v>

385
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:36.280
<v Speaker 1>little in common with you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a standard house.</v>

386
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.473
<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is is that it's difficult </v>

387
00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:40.264
<v Speaker 1>exactly to figure out what set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>features we do use to determine whether </v>

388
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:47.860
<v Speaker 1>something is a member of a class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this guy named,</v>

389
00:21:47.861 --> 00:21:48.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigger answer,</v>

390
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.910
<v Speaker 1>who's thought about this a lot and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks that we,</v>

391
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.540
<v Speaker 1>that there are a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective and functional basically.</v>

392
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:56.374
<v Speaker 1>And that enables us to do things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with the category of things you </v>

393
00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:03.250
<v Speaker 1>would take from your apartment if it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>on fire.</v>

394
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.890
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

395
00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:06.724
<v Speaker 1>Because most of the things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take bear very little </v>

396
00:22:08.651 --> 00:22:09.484
<v Speaker 1>resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to see why they make a </v>

397
00:22:10.431 --> 00:22:12.160
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pets,</v>

398
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.870
<v Speaker 1>family members probably in that order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

399
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.750
<v Speaker 1>photo albums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identification.</v>

400
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.490
<v Speaker 1>What else might you take if you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone,</v>

401
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.353
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else would you take out of an </v>

402
00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:26.320
<v Speaker 1>apartment during the fire?</v>

403
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:30.303
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys would be out on the street </v>

404
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.060
<v Speaker 1>stark naked obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so well you get,</v>

405
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:35.470
<v Speaker 1>the point is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

406
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.333
<v Speaker 1>those things that are just mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to share very little in terms of </v>

407
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:39.574
<v Speaker 1>objective features in common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's some reason that they still </v>

408
00:22:41.771 --> 00:22:43.330
<v Speaker 1>cohere as a category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

409
00:22:43.331 --> 00:22:45.280
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you need to abstract?</v>

410
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can handle the complexity of</v>

411
00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:48.454
<v Speaker 1>the world better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even your perception is a form of </v>

412
00:22:50.111 --> 00:22:51.190
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

413
00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:52.024
<v Speaker 1>because when you look at someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the abstraction has done for </v>

414
00:22:55.331 --> 00:22:57.550
<v Speaker 1>you because you just can't perceive very</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

415
00:22:57.551 --> 00:22:59.320
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

416
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:03.160
<v Speaker 1>you only see the surface of them that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>facing you would not the other surface.</v>

417
00:23:03.161 --> 00:23:06.670
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only see them now in this,</v>

418
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>split second rather than extended across</v>

419
00:23:09.311 --> 00:23:10.144
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see any of their micro </v>

420
00:23:11.471 --> 00:23:14.650
<v Speaker 1>structure right beyond the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the,</v>

421
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>general pattern of the physiology at </v>

422
00:23:18.981 --> 00:23:20.200
<v Speaker 1>this level of resolution.</v>

423
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't see anything below that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see yourselves or your organs or</v>

424
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:24.604
<v Speaker 1>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a real problem often </v>

425
00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:26.944
<v Speaker 1>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can't see the systems that you're </v>

426
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:32.350
<v Speaker 1>part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right off the bat just to proceed,</v>

427
00:23:32.351 --> 00:23:34.480
<v Speaker 1>gives you a low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

428
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that's limitations of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing.</v>

429
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:38.074
<v Speaker 1>Your eyes just can't zoom in that far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the cortical capacity to </v>

430
00:23:40.931 --> 00:23:42.670
<v Speaker 1>improve your vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

431
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:45.010
<v Speaker 1>plus how much do you really want to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>at one time,</v>

432
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.540
<v Speaker 1>no more than necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>

433
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 1>And evolution seems to take care of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

434
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.780
<v Speaker 1>So your perception abstracts for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

435
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:54.614
<v Speaker 1>But then I would say maybe you make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>leap from perception to conception or </v>

436
00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:58.883
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be the leap from the </v>

437
00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:05.330
<v Speaker 1>perception of the actual object to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>image of the object and then a leak from</v>

438
00:24:05.331 --> 00:24:07.340
<v Speaker 1>the image of the object to the word.</v>

439
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.910
<v Speaker 1>So it looks to be like a word is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of an image,</v>

440
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.570
<v Speaker 1>which is a representation of an object </v>
<v Speaker 1>or situation.</v>

441
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:15.643
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and you need those because you have </v>

442
00:24:19.671 --> 00:24:21.470
<v Speaker 1>to deal with the complex world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

443
00:24:21.471 --> 00:24:22.304
<v Speaker 1>here's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look at the top left corner of that </v>

444
00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:28.310
<v Speaker 1>diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I called that the thing in itself and</v>

445
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.901
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

446
00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 1>is an array of dots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

447
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.860
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's 360 dots there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

448
00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:39.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if it was a real world object,</v>

449
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:41.900
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine that would be in three</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>

450
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.033
<v Speaker 1>Not to cause that's too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would be transforming because it </v>

451
00:24:45.591 --> 00:24:48.590
<v Speaker 1>would be also extended across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

452
00:24:48.591 --> 00:24:49.424
<v Speaker 1>and it would have micro structures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were far smaller than that and macro </v>

453
00:24:52.581 --> 00:24:56.600
<v Speaker 1>structures that were far bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so even that is an abstraction.</v>

454
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.750
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

455
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:02.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm using a fairly complex abstraction </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rip represent the thing in itself.</v>

456
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:04.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot proceed,</v>

457
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What something actually is,</v>

458
00:25:06.681 --> 00:25:07.514
<v Speaker 1>you just get an image and then the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>five things are ways you could look at </v>

459
00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:12.500
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>

460
00:25:12.501 --> 00:25:13.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a rectangle.</v>

461
00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.820
<v Speaker 1>You could say it's four rectangles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about the dots.</v>

462
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.570
<v Speaker 1>You could say that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's 16 lines or what is it?</v>

463
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:23.780
<v Speaker 1>32 lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 24 lines.</v>

464
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.963
<v Speaker 1>So if you are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that thing in itself was an orchard </v>

465
00:25:28.191 --> 00:25:31.850
<v Speaker 1>and you are going to walk north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>south to north through it,</v>

466
00:25:31.851 --> 00:25:32.684
<v Speaker 1>that would be a good representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know those would be corridors </v>

467
00:25:35.721 --> 00:25:36.554
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then object for is a combination of </v>

468
00:25:39.441 --> 00:25:43.370
<v Speaker 1>object one and object to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then object five is well all of it's</v>

469
00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:46.490
<v Speaker 1>blurred out are the little groups of six</v>
<v Speaker 1>dots.</v>

470
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.000
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say well what is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

471
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.910
<v Speaker 1>And then answer is well it's any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those five things.</v>

472
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.360
<v Speaker 1>And so that's an interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it too because one of the</v>

473
00:25:56.361 --> 00:25:57.194
<v Speaker 1>things that shows you is that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree about what something is right </v>

474
00:25:59.421 --> 00:26:02.120
<v Speaker 1>at the level of perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

475
00:26:02.121 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 1>well which of those is the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation?</v>

476
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:08.540
<v Speaker 1>And the first answer might be well the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most complex one,</v>

477
00:26:08.541 --> 00:26:10.790
<v Speaker 1>the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one on the left hand corner.</v>

478
00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:11.624
<v Speaker 1>But that's not necessarily the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might depend on what you want the </v>

479
00:26:14.571 --> 00:26:16.400
<v Speaker 1>representation for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

480
00:26:16.401 --> 00:26:17.780
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

481
00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:19.940
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because imagine you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>map.</v>

482
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>

483
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.173
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make the best map in the </v>

484
00:26:24.171 --> 00:26:26.330
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you make a map that's exactly the</v>

485
00:26:26.331 --> 00:26:30.350
<v Speaker 1>same size as the territory that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents and has all the detail.</v>

486
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:31.813
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not any use at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing because you could just use </v>

487
00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:36.920
<v Speaker 1>the territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

488
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:37.783
<v Speaker 1>So you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because as a map gets increasingly </v>

489
00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 1>detailed to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's increasingly useless as a map.</v>

490
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.693
<v Speaker 1>And so what you need is this weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination between accuracy and </v>

491
00:26:50.491 --> 00:26:51.324
<v Speaker 1>simplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you want your map to be no more </v>

492
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:57.660
<v Speaker 1>complicated than is necessary to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>you from point a to point b.</v>

493
00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:58.973
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because otherwise it wouldn't be </v>

494
00:27:01.261 --> 00:27:02.094
<v Speaker 1>simple to use and the additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity would eliminate the utility </v>

495
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the map.</v>

496
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.393
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might say that what we're trying </v>

497
00:27:10.471 --> 00:27:11.304
<v Speaker 1>to do with our intelligence is to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we need with the least amount of </v>

498
00:27:14.641 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 1>effort possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

499
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.993
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a sort of a Piagetian idea </v>

500
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.830
<v Speaker 1>that's lurking behind that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

501
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.700
<v Speaker 1>well you don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have limited resources,</v>

502
00:27:26.701 --> 00:27:27.534
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to expend any more energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>than is necessary and you want to build </v>

503
00:27:30.721 --> 00:27:31.554
<v Speaker 1>representations of the world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffice to keep you going now and then </v>

504
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:36.774
<v Speaker 1>next week and next month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know alone and then in </v>

505
00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:41.820
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you build a representation of the</v>

506
00:27:41.821 --> 00:27:45.600
<v Speaker 1>world that has some concordance with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in itself,</v>

507
00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:46.434
<v Speaker 1>but has this functional simplicity so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could actually use it in the </v>

508
00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:51.090
<v Speaker 1>real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

509
00:27:51.091 --> 00:27:51.924
<v Speaker 1>so back to this diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've got the object and five </v>

510
00:27:55.411 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 1>representations and then there are ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>of representing it linguistically at the</v>

511
00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:00.744
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>

512
00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.283
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

513
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.660
<v Speaker 1>what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the words are basically a simplification</v>

514
00:28:06.661 --> 00:28:08.730
<v Speaker 1>of something that's already simplified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

515
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:09.564
<v Speaker 1>so intelligence seems to have something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with the process of functional </v>

516
00:28:15.061 --> 00:28:15.990
<v Speaker 1>simplification.</v>

517
00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.393
<v Speaker 1>Now back to the library of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have this database of questions </v>

518
00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:30.400
<v Speaker 1>and so then what you do is pull out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred questions randomly.</v>

519
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.713
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you want to pick out a hundred </v>

520
00:28:33.911 --> 00:28:34.744
<v Speaker 1>because if you just pick out one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I asked you what the capital of </v>

521
00:28:37.811 --> 00:28:38.644
<v Speaker 1>Georgia was and I asked you what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital of Georgia was and you got it </v>

522
00:28:41.141 --> 00:28:44.560
<v Speaker 1>wrong and you got it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't really say with any degree of</v>

523
00:28:44.561 --> 00:28:45.394
<v Speaker 1>certainty that that means that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>more intelligence because the </v>

524
00:28:48.551 --> 00:28:52.540
<v Speaker 1>probability that I get an accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure with one question is quite low.</v>

525
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.540
<v Speaker 1>But if I use three questions while then,</v>

526
00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:57.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

527
00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:58.763
<v Speaker 1>I would start to become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my measurement would start to become </v>

528
00:29:01.711 --> 00:29:04.740
<v Speaker 1>less error written and if I use 10 would</v>
<v Speaker 1>even be better.</v>

529
00:29:04.741 --> 00:29:08.430
<v Speaker 1>And if I use 20 for a personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire,</v>

530
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.370
<v Speaker 1>the rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is just a rule of thumb,</v>

531
00:29:11.371 --> 00:29:15.270
<v Speaker 1>is that if you don't have 20 questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the questionnaire,</v>

532
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:19.440
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have enough questions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really generate a reliable measure.</v>

533
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.993
<v Speaker 1>So you'll still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll still see single item measures </v>

534
00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:26.490
<v Speaker 1>used in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

535
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.820
<v Speaker 1>you can add additional accuracy by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by increasing the number of items.</v>

536
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I designed an Iq test a while back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a pretty good,</v>

537
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.300
<v Speaker 1>we've got pretty good reliability and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good validity.</v>

538
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Reliability as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you the same set of people twice and the</v>

539
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 1>rank order of their performance stays </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

540
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:48.460
<v Speaker 1>So if you've got 90 on the previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>test,</v>

541
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:49.330
<v Speaker 1>you'd get 90.</v>

542
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.870
<v Speaker 1>And if you go up 95 because you're more </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent in this example,</v>

543
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:56.080
<v Speaker 1>if you've got 95 and the last one you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>get 95 on this one.</v>

544
00:29:56.081 --> 00:29:59.020
<v Speaker 1>So that's reliability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get a pretty,</v>

545
00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 1>we could get a pretty reliable Iq test </v>
<v Speaker 1>with nine items,</v>

546
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:06.520
<v Speaker 1>but it was substantially improved with </v>
<v Speaker 1>17 and with increments,</v>

547
00:30:06.521 --> 00:30:07.354
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get uh,</v>

548
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:08.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

549
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Diminishing returns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a hundreds,</v>

550
00:30:10.871 --> 00:30:12.280
<v Speaker 1>plenty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

551
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:13.114
<v Speaker 1>So you pull out a hundred questions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you take a hundred people and you </v>

552
00:30:17.621 --> 00:30:21.130
<v Speaker 1>give them those questions and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>score them right and wrong.</v>

553
00:30:21.131 --> 00:30:23.920
<v Speaker 1>That's all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you sum the scores.</v>

554
00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically that,</v>

555
00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:30.550
<v Speaker 1>that miss some behaves like the average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you average the scores just to</v>

556
00:30:30.551 --> 00:30:33.640
<v Speaker 1>make the argument a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight forward.</v>

557
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:37.630
<v Speaker 1>You average the scores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so each of you gets the average of,</v>

558
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:39.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

559
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 1>calculated across the Times that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were right and wrong.</v>

560
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's an approximation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequency of your,</v>

561
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.193
<v Speaker 1>of how right you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we rank order you one to a </v>

562
00:30:51.051 --> 00:30:53.920
<v Speaker 1>hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Iq,</v>

563
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:59.550
<v Speaker 1>that's all there is to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now people say Iq doesn't exist.</v>

564
00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Well that's annoying because all they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is gerrymandering.</v>

565
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.540
<v Speaker 1>The definition of the word exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

566
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 1>cause you can do that if you ask if a is</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to be,</v>

567
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:16.100
<v Speaker 1>the answer is it depends on what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean by a and what you mean by be,</v>

568
00:31:16.101 --> 00:31:16.934
<v Speaker 1>it's almost always a foolish question </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can take b and a and bend </v>

569
00:31:20.801 --> 00:31:24.190
<v Speaker 1>them and twist them in such a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make one thing and other thing</v>

570
00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:25.024
<v Speaker 1>without too much problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People usually get around that by only </v>

571
00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:30.280
<v Speaker 1>using a word in a context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

572
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:31.114
<v Speaker 1>In a sentence or a phrase or a paragraph</v>
<v Speaker 1>that defines the word so that you can't </v>

573
00:31:35.081 --> 00:31:36.550
<v Speaker 1>weasel around like that.</v>

574
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.080
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more specifically in psychology,</v>

575
00:31:41.081 --> 00:31:43.240
<v Speaker 1>we have methods to tell if something is </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

576
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:45.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and psych,</v>

577
00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:50.340
<v Speaker 1>if Iq doesn't pass the test of reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a psychological measure,</v>

578
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:52.443
<v Speaker 1>then no other psychological measures </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed the test because they're </v>

579
00:31:55.541 --> 00:31:59.770
<v Speaker 1>validated exactly the same way Iq is and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't work as well.</v>

580
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:03.760
<v Speaker 1>So you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no that's not real.</v>

581
00:32:03.761 --> 00:32:04.594
<v Speaker 1>But then you have to throw out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably have to throw out the </v>

582
00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:07.474
<v Speaker 1>social sciences completely insofar as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually sinuses because the </v>

583
00:32:11.081 --> 00:32:13.930
<v Speaker 1>same statistics are used to generate </v>
<v Speaker 1>their findings.</v>

584
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:14.973
<v Speaker 1>So you can't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this really powerful thing doesn't </v>

585
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:17.374
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well a bunch of these weak things exist </v>

586
00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:21.220
<v Speaker 1>and they're measured the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to play that game.</v>

587
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.320
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

588
00:32:23.321 --> 00:32:25.450
<v Speaker 1>so does it exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you could measure it,</v>

589
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.110
<v Speaker 1>you can measure it reliably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's definitely something you know,</v>

590
00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:31.450
<v Speaker 1>cause you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well does your shadow exist?</v>

591
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:32.853
<v Speaker 1>Well generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under normal conditions you could </v>

592
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:37.810
<v Speaker 1>envision your shout a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>reliable,</v>

593
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it exist?</v>

594
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Well it passes one test of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

595
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.230
<v Speaker 1>you can't be detected with a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>senses.</v>

596
00:32:48.231 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 1>You can't touch it for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

597
00:32:51.411 --> 00:32:54.140
<v Speaker 1>whether or not something exist is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a rather tricky question,</v>

598
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:56.263
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

599
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:06.650
<v Speaker 1>you can measure it and it's useful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a bad definition of,</v>

600
00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:10.810
<v Speaker 1>of exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's it good for?</v>

601
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.733
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it predicts major life outcomes and </v>

602
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.820
<v Speaker 1>importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

603
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.900
<v Speaker 1>and we can talk about the power of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence momentarily.</v>

604
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.360
<v Speaker 1>If you were actually going to calculate </v>
<v Speaker 1>an Iq score per se,</v>

605
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:30.403
<v Speaker 1>you would take the rank order that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just described and you would correct it </v>

606
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:37.940
<v Speaker 1>for age because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really expect a seven year old</v>

607
00:33:37.941 --> 00:33:41.450
<v Speaker 1>to know as much as it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the year old or a 20 year old.</v>

608
00:33:41.451 --> 00:33:44.780
<v Speaker 1>So generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take a technical Iq test,</v>

609
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.333
<v Speaker 1>it will rank order you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll only rank order you with </v>

610
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:51.170
<v Speaker 1>people of the same age as you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's just another,</v>

611
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an additional correction.</v>

612
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.713
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not that actually gives you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>more accurate estimate of Iq is depends </v>

613
00:33:57.201 --> 00:33:58.730
<v Speaker 1>on what you mean by accurate.</v>

614
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.140
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

615
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:06.140
<v Speaker 1>very bright seven year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally doesn't know enough to do much</v>

616
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:11.130
<v Speaker 1>useful in the way of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can learn extremely quickly.</v>

617
00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.353
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

618
00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:13.963
<v Speaker 3>mmm.</v>

619
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.673
<v Speaker 1>If you compared seven year olds to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people of other ages purely in terms of </v>

620
00:34:20.301 --> 00:34:21.134
<v Speaker 1>their score on an Iq test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a high probability that you </v>

621
00:34:23.271 --> 00:34:26.060
<v Speaker 1>would underestimate their speed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

622
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.673
<v Speaker 1>By the same token though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you were 40 you have a lot </v>

623
00:34:30.351 --> 00:34:35.351
<v Speaker 1>of accumulated knowledge and so if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you only measure learning speed,</v>

624
00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:37.154
<v Speaker 1>then you would underestimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would overestimate that seven year </v>

625
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:45.310
<v Speaker 1>olds advantage over the 40 year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq is basically a unitary phenomenon,</v>

626
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:52.550
<v Speaker 1>but you can fractionated into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

627
00:34:52.551 --> 00:34:53.384
<v Speaker 1>very complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that I'll tell you about in </v>

628
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.033
<v Speaker 1>a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to divide Iq into to the way </v>

629
00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:01.364
<v Speaker 1>you would divide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be into crystallized and fluid </v>

630
00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:04.334
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and fluid intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be roughly the ability to learn </v>

631
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:10.423
<v Speaker 1>and crystallized intelligence would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly a measure of how much you've </v>

632
00:35:13.131 --> 00:35:13.964
<v Speaker 1>learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now those are separate to some degree </v>

633
00:35:17.691 --> 00:35:18.260
<v Speaker 1>and here's why.</v>

634
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.900
<v Speaker 1>They're separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you age,</v>

635
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:25.460
<v Speaker 1>your capacity to learn decreases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite ugly.</v>

636
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.833
<v Speaker 1>So by the time you're about 24 you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to get stupider from the </v>

637
00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:31.544
<v Speaker 1>perspective of being able to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just pretty much a linear </v>

638
00:35:34.011 --> 00:35:36.740
<v Speaker 1>trip downhill until you depart the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

639
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

640
00:35:38.071 --> 00:35:41.700
<v Speaker 1>it's nasty to see cause it's quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>steep degeneration.</v>

641
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:42.743
<v Speaker 1>You can stave that off by the way with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cardiovascular and cardiovascular </v>

642
00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:47.874
<v Speaker 1>exercise and weightlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the best way to keep your </v>

643
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.533
<v Speaker 1>learning capacity intact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not to do cognitive exercises and </v>

644
00:35:54.291 --> 00:35:57.060
<v Speaker 1>stood in physical exercise and then as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you age,</v>

645
00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.043
<v Speaker 1>then the amount you know goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is those two things </v>

646
00:36:01.621 --> 00:36:05.970
<v Speaker 1>actually tend to average out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might say,</v>

647
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:09.450
<v Speaker 1>well if I'm claiming that Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this a unitary thing,</v>

648
00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:10.284
<v Speaker 1>how can I make the claim that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>divide it into two elements and that </v>

649
00:36:13.651 --> 00:36:15.660
<v Speaker 1>those elements are in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>

650
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason is for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your,</v>

651
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 1>your prefrontal Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

652
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:24.720
<v Speaker 1>So that's the part of your brain here </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

653
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:25.943
<v Speaker 1>You can think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in part it's the part that does the </v>

654
00:36:27.991 --> 00:36:30.930
<v Speaker 1>programming of motor activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary motor activity.</v>

655
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.153
<v Speaker 1>But it also seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you're doing something new </v>

656
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:36.563
<v Speaker 1>and you're pretty clunky and awkward at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then you do it more and more and </v>

657
00:36:39.541 --> 00:36:40.374
<v Speaker 1>you get smoother and smoother and </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoother at it and you know what you </v>

658
00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:43.021
<v Speaker 1>have taught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monetize it.</v>

659
00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:43.854
<v Speaker 1>What happens is you're using your </v>
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal cortex and to some degree </v>

660
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.670
<v Speaker 1>your whole right hemisphere when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>first doing it.</v>

661
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.680
<v Speaker 1>And then as you get better and better at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

662
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.410
<v Speaker 1>the ability shifts to the left and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes backwards.</v>

663
00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:56.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's happening to some degree is </v>

664
00:36:59.281 --> 00:37:00.114
<v Speaker 1>your prefrontal cortex is programming </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your brain and you could </v>

665
00:37:03.451 --> 00:37:07.350
<v Speaker 1>think of fluid intelligence as a measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ability of your,</v>

666
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.680
<v Speaker 1>of your brain to program itself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crystallized ability as a measure of how</v>

667
00:37:14.221 --> 00:37:15.930
<v Speaker 1>much programming is there.</v>

668
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:19.890
<v Speaker 1>And then so are separate in that manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they perform separate functions.</v>

669
00:37:19.891 --> 00:37:24.570
<v Speaker 1>But then you can also understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the better your program or is the better</v>

670
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:28.020
<v Speaker 1>the programming is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that inflates the correlation.</v>

671
00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.423
<v Speaker 1>And so you can have two separate things </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional functionally that are even </v>

672
00:37:33.241 --> 00:37:34.074
<v Speaker 1>dissociable in terms of age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because they worked so tightly </v>

673
00:37:36.271 --> 00:37:37.104
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like how fast can you dig a hole </v>

674
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.420
<v Speaker 1>and how big is the pile of dirt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

675
00:37:42.421 --> 00:37:45.450
<v Speaker 1>obviously those two things are different</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some important sense,</v>

676
00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:46.284
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to be highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlated because the faster you can </v>

677
00:37:48.121 --> 00:37:50.910
<v Speaker 1>take a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bigger the pile of dirt and so,</v>

678
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:52.853
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crystallized intelligence is often also </v>

679
00:37:55.081 --> 00:37:55.914
<v Speaker 1>often measured as verbal intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the better measure s fundamentally </v>

680
00:38:00.061 --> 00:38:01.590
<v Speaker 1>is crystallized intelligence.</v>

681
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Now you know how we looked at the I the </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality hierarchy,</v>

682
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:11.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was this</v>

683
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.420
<v Speaker 1>and what you see is three strata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking aspect,</v>

684
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:23.540
<v Speaker 1>trait super factor and it looks like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>super factors.</v>

685
00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:24.384
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>
<v Speaker 1>the validity of those super factors is </v>

686
00:38:27.931 --> 00:38:28.764
<v Speaker 1>not yet clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get a lot of useful prediction </v>

687
00:38:31.741 --> 00:38:35.260
<v Speaker 1>by looking at the traits and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more evidence.</v>

688
00:38:35.261 --> 00:38:38.170
<v Speaker 1>There's about 400 studies now using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect.</v>

689
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.633
<v Speaker 1>There's more and more evidence that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can also derive additional useful </v>

690
00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:47.671
<v Speaker 1>predictive validity from differentiating</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personality down to the,</v>

691
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.770
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the aspect level.</v>

692
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:53.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the highest resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality model we have.</v>

693
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:55.893
<v Speaker 1>There are people who claim that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something at the apex which you might </v>

694
00:38:58.841 --> 00:39:02.500
<v Speaker 1>call good personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think so.</v>

695
00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

696
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.180
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to read the literature to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the,</v>

697
00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:08.080
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

698
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:08.913
<v Speaker 1>The dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a statistical dispute roughly </v>

699
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:12.490
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

700
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.013
<v Speaker 1>we've found in our research that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability and plasticity early </v>

701
00:39:16.151 --> 00:39:18.280
<v Speaker 1>correlated that 0.2 they're pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>

702
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.520
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to stick with that for now </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it might be wrong.</v>

703
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:23.103
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

704
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

705
00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.240
<v Speaker 3>see how I would explain this problem.</v>

706
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:11.200
<v Speaker 1>If you read the cognitive literature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neuropsychological literature,</v>

707
00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:16.840
<v Speaker 1>you will find that neuropsychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to assume that,</v>

708
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:17.710
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

709
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:22.710
<v Speaker 1>there are forms of cognitive ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you cannot describe as Iq.</v>

710
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

711
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:28.470
<v Speaker 1>And they make that claim because they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a test and they'll,</v>

712
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:29.463
<v Speaker 1>they'll use the test to measure </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and then they'll correlate </v>

713
00:40:31.121 --> 00:40:35.200
<v Speaker 1>that with Iq and the correlation will </v>
<v Speaker 1>only be about 0.2 or 0.3.</v>

714
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.453
<v Speaker 1>And so they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not a high enough </v>

715
00:40:37.631 --> 00:40:38.500
<v Speaker 1>correlation.</v>

716
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

717
00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:43.390
<v Speaker 1>To justify saying that those things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>identical because the correlation should</v>

718
00:40:43.391 --> 00:40:45.460
<v Speaker 1>be more like 0.8 for them to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>identical.</v>

719
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.750
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say I had a measure of your Iq and</v>

720
00:40:49.751 --> 00:40:51.910
<v Speaker 1>your Iq and your Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Iq,</v>

721
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:53.463
<v Speaker 1>and then I asked you two questions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you and you and I summed your </v>

722
00:40:57.461 --> 00:40:59.860
<v Speaker 1>answers whether they were correct or </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrect.</v>

723
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.113
<v Speaker 1>Now what would happen is there'd be some</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation between your total score on </v>

724
00:41:05.081 --> 00:41:05.914
<v Speaker 1>those two questions and your overall Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would be 0.3 but that wouldn't </v>

725
00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:11.534
<v Speaker 1>justify me in claiming that the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>question Iq test is different than the </v>

726
00:41:16.011 --> 00:41:18.830
<v Speaker 1>full scale Iq test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just worse.</v>

727
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

728
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.333
<v Speaker 1>You're going to run into this problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you read psychological literature </v>

729
00:41:24.321 --> 00:41:25.154
<v Speaker 1>and if you ever do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do any research because it's very </v>

730
00:41:27.321 --> 00:41:31.040
<v Speaker 1>difficult to determine whether you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called discriminant validity,</v>

731
00:41:31.041 --> 00:41:31.874
<v Speaker 1>which is this thing measures this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing measures this thing and </v>

732
00:41:35.151 --> 00:41:38.990
<v Speaker 1>they're actually different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whether you just have a lousy measure</v>

733
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:41.990
<v Speaker 1>of this and the lousy measure this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so the correlation is low.</v>

734
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Now here's a neuropsychological test</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could make the case that this is</v>

735
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.583
<v Speaker 1>measuring something different than Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you see an array of 12 </v>

736
00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:00.440
<v Speaker 1>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just drawings,</v>

737
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:03.140
<v Speaker 1>drawings of a telephone and a boot and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chair.</v>

738
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Just calm and objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

739
00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:05.534
<v Speaker 1>so you see 12 of them and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to click one and then when you do that </v>

740
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:11.083
<v Speaker 1>they move and then the next time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to click one you haven't already </v>

741
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:15.074
<v Speaker 1>clipped and then they move again and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>click and they move again and you click </v>

742
00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 1>and you'll see by the time you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>about eight of them,</v>

743
00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 1>you're starting to run into trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

744
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:28.280
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to remember more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight abstractions simultaneously.</v>

745
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Seven actually in some people claim it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>as low as four.</v>

746
00:42:31.431 --> 00:42:32.264
<v Speaker 1>That's the capacity of working memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why we kind of like phone </v>

747
00:42:35.391 --> 00:42:36.224
<v Speaker 1>numbers to be seven digits long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the things we want to just </v>

748
00:42:38.361 --> 00:42:43.361
<v Speaker 1>remember r s r seven units long and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to remember more than that,</v>

749
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.670
<v Speaker 1>we chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you know,</v>

750
00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:48.260
<v Speaker 1>if I show you some dots,</v>

751
00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.213
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

752
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.800
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how many doors?</v>

753
00:42:52.801 --> 00:42:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to count them.</v>

754
00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.520
<v Speaker 1>You can see three dots.</v>

755
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:01.813
<v Speaker 1>You can see four dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious that you can see five </v>

756
00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:05.804
<v Speaker 1>dogs at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start to go three and two and then </v>

757
00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:10.274
<v Speaker 1>if there's six dots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's how they would be arranged </v>

758
00:43:13.971 --> 00:43:15.620
<v Speaker 1>on a dice dice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

759
00:43:15.621 --> 00:43:16.454
<v Speaker 1>The reason they'd be reached on a dice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way is because you could see two </v>

760
00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:20.690
<v Speaker 1>sets of three and for six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

761
00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 1>if they're sort of randomly dispersed </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

762
00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how many dots is that?</v>

763
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:28.100
<v Speaker 1>One?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have character.</v>

764
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:31.910
<v Speaker 1>And what that shows you is that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>working memory,</v>

765
00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:34.280
<v Speaker 1>which is really a function of fluid </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

766
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 1>is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very narrow thing.</v>

767
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:38.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's like your vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

768
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.170
<v Speaker 1>remember we saw the gorilla video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

769
00:43:40.171 --> 00:43:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Then you can only pick up the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're attending to.</v>

770
00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working memory is like that.</v>

771
00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:46.034
<v Speaker 1>It's this narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow form of attention and it's sort </v>

772
00:43:48.621 --> 00:43:50.930
<v Speaker 1>of specifies unitary phenomenon.</v>

773
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not coining unitary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's close enough.</v>

774
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:55.270
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason that it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

775
00:43:55.271 --> 00:43:56.104
<v Speaker 1>it's like why is your attention so </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow is because often what you're </v>

776
00:43:59.661 --> 00:44:02.690
<v Speaker 1>trying to do as you work in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to make binary choices,</v>

777
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to choose between 20 </v>

778
00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:05.954
<v Speaker 1>things you want to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to choose between two things </v>

779
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:10.730
<v Speaker 1>because then when you choose between two</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

780
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:13.100
<v Speaker 1>you can actually act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's still two things,</v>

781
00:44:13.101 --> 00:44:15.050
<v Speaker 1>you can't act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's one thing you could act.</v>

782
00:44:15.051 --> 00:44:15.884
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you go into Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant is a good example because </v>

783
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Chinese restaurants virtually always </v>
<v Speaker 1>have like 400 items on the menu.</v>

784
00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.150
<v Speaker 1>And you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how the hell do you figure out what</v>

785
00:44:26.151 --> 00:44:26.984
<v Speaker 1>you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you don't do is go through </v>

786
00:44:29.091 --> 00:44:33.180
<v Speaker 1>every single menu item and contemplate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because you'd be there for a week.</v>

787
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 1>So what you seem to do is eradicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>chunks.</v>

788
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:37.613
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not in the mood for anything </v>

789
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:42.420
<v Speaker 1>but fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay Bang,</v>

790
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.090
<v Speaker 1>three quarters of the menu disappears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

791
00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:46.260
<v Speaker 1>and then you might go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I,</v>

792
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:50.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it branded whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another half is gone.</v>

793
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:52.890
<v Speaker 1>And now you're down to maybe eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices and you know,</v>

794
00:44:52.891 --> 00:44:55.560
<v Speaker 1>you reduce that to four and then to to </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps,</v>

795
00:44:55.561 --> 00:44:59.220
<v Speaker 1>well I'd like this or I'd like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the waiter doesn't care about that.</v>

796
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:00.443
<v Speaker 1>The waiter wants to know which one you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want because until it's reduced to one </v>

797
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:07.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the reduction,</v>

798
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:07.854
<v Speaker 1>the reduced narrow strip that we use to </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive the world and partly as a </v>

799
00:45:12.211 --> 00:45:13.044
<v Speaker 1>consequence of processing inadequacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also partly because we really </v>

800
00:45:16.141 --> 00:45:19.110
<v Speaker 1>are trying to reduce things all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to zero in one,</v>

801
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:19.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

802
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

803
00:45:22.261 --> 00:45:23.094
<v Speaker 1>so back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this three stratum theory of cognitive </v>

804
00:45:25.111 --> 00:45:26.010
<v Speaker 1>abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

805
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:33.080
<v Speaker 1>you've got this array of 12 items and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps shifting.</v>

806
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.983
<v Speaker 1>And what I would do is score you by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of duplications you if you pick </v>

807
00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:41.010
<v Speaker 1>the same item more than once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose a point.</v>

808
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:43.590
<v Speaker 1>So the maximum points you can get is 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

809
00:45:43.591 --> 00:45:46.020
<v Speaker 1>people usually make three or four </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes.</v>

810
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:48.600
<v Speaker 1>And so I could take your score on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>

811
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'd give it to you two or three </v>
<v Speaker 1>times just to make sure.</v>

812
00:45:51.001 --> 00:45:51.834
<v Speaker 1>I have a reasonably stable indicator and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can correlate it with your full </v>

813
00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:55.464
<v Speaker 1>scale fluid Iq and I get a correlation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but both put two five or 0.3 now if you </v>

814
00:46:01.201 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 1>don't know anything about psychometrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>

815
00:46:03.391 --> 00:46:04.224
<v Speaker 1>oh well that's obviously measuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>something different than full scale Iq </v>

816
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:11.370
<v Speaker 1>because it only correlates that 0.25 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>0.3 but what it turns out is no,</v>

817
00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:15.390
<v Speaker 1>it's more analogous to the problem that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking about where I asked</v>

818
00:46:15.391 --> 00:46:18.900
<v Speaker 1>you three questions and tried to derive </v>
<v Speaker 1>your entire icu from that.</v>

819
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:19.943
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bad measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens is if you take the </v>

820
00:46:23.371 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychological tests that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have developed that theoretically assess</v>

821
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:29.490
<v Speaker 1>the function of different parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

822
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:34.770
<v Speaker 1>so and you factor analyze them and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract out a single factor,</v>

823
00:46:34.771 --> 00:46:35.604
<v Speaker 1>the single factor it looks exactly like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid intelligence now is exactly the </v>

824
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:41.940
<v Speaker 1>same as fluid intelligence.</v>

825
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:46.223
<v Speaker 1>It would be the onus would be on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who claims it's not to </v>

826
00:46:48.571 --> 00:46:49.404
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did give university students have a </v>

827
00:46:52.231 --> 00:46:57.231
<v Speaker 1>very extensive battery of prefrontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortical tests and measured their Iq.</v>

828
00:46:57.391 --> 00:46:58.224
<v Speaker 1>And then we use the prefrontal cortical </v>
<v Speaker 1>test average and the Iq to predict </v>

829
00:47:02.671 --> 00:47:03.504
<v Speaker 1>grades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we did find was the prefrontal </v>

830
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:08.730
<v Speaker 1>tests predicted over and above the eye </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq,</v>

831
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.660
<v Speaker 1>but we thought maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>

832
00:47:12.661 --> 00:47:17.580
<v Speaker 1>the prefrontal average and the Iq and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you added them to to predict grade,</v>

833
00:47:17.581 --> 00:47:22.080
<v Speaker 1>say that's a regression analysis they </v>
<v Speaker 1>both added in so they predict,</v>

834
00:47:22.081 --> 00:47:25.170
<v Speaker 1>they predicted different parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation.</v>

835
00:47:25.171 --> 00:47:27.930
<v Speaker 1>It added additional youth necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

836
00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:28.973
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took all the neuropsychological </v>

837
00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:33.453
<v Speaker 1>tests and all the individual Iq tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you put them in one data set and </v>

838
00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:40.510
<v Speaker 1>then extracted out a single factor is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be fluid intelligence,</v>

839
00:47:40.511 --> 00:47:43.690
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that predicted grades very well.</v>

840
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:46.030
<v Speaker 1>And then what was leftover didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict it all.</v>

841
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.770
<v Speaker 1>So what we concluded was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychological tests,</v>

842
00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:53.590
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal cortical tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test intelligence,</v>

843
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.620
<v Speaker 1>and they test a slightly different thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>than fluid intelligence tests do.</v>

844
00:47:59.021 --> 00:48:01.810
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't because they're testing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something different.</v>

845
00:48:01.811 --> 00:48:06.010
<v Speaker 1>It's because fluid intelligence tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they're currently constituted.</v>

846
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't sample the universe of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions as well as they should.</v>

847
00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.650
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't that we discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>something different.</v>

848
00:48:14.651 --> 00:48:15.484
<v Speaker 1>We discovered a measurement error </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking that only took five </v>

849
00:48:18.041 --> 00:48:18.821
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

850
00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:19.654
<v Speaker 1>it took five years to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very annoying because when we </v>

851
00:48:22.751 --> 00:48:25.990
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to predict grades,</v>

852
00:48:25.991 --> 00:48:26.824
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't know the ICU literature </v>

853
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:32.920
<v Speaker 1>very well at that point because </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist don't usually teach it very</v>

854
00:48:32.921 --> 00:48:36.070
<v Speaker 1>much because Iq bothers the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

855
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.910
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the neuropsychologist who have their</v>

856
00:48:39.911 --> 00:48:42.140
<v Speaker 1>own field are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

857
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:45.610
<v Speaker 1>they are motivated to make the claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've discovered something new.</v>

858
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:49.420
<v Speaker 1>And I just took that on face value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then we tried to predict like,</v>

859
00:48:49.421 --> 00:48:50.254
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to predict how well you do </v>

860
00:48:51.071 --> 00:48:51.904
<v Speaker 1>at your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I want to get a good cognitive </v>

861
00:48:53.951 --> 00:48:57.460
<v Speaker 1>measure because if it's a complex job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if it's a complex job that keeps</v>

862
00:48:57.461 --> 00:49:00.310
<v Speaker 1>changing and you have to learn to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and if you can't do that,</v>

863
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:01.144
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be bad for you and it </v>

864
00:49:03.311 --> 00:49:04.144
<v Speaker 1>would be bad for everyone around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we were trying to pick up </v>

865
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:12.450
<v Speaker 1>additional information that would enable</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

866
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:16.690
<v Speaker 1>the accuracy of that prediction to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased and looked at the neuroscience</v>

867
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.553
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at most it was an ambivalent </v>

868
00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:20.950
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

869
00:49:20.951 --> 00:49:23.410
<v Speaker 1>So how does that relate to this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

870
00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:26.590
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom tier where it's the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated,</v>

871
00:49:26.591 --> 00:49:27.424
<v Speaker 1>you have single tests and there are only</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlated with each other at about </v>

872
00:49:30.521 --> 00:49:32.680
<v Speaker 1>point to maybe 0.3.</v>

873
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:33.730
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

874
00:49:33.731 --> 00:49:35.460
<v Speaker 1>they're all measuring different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

875
00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.413
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all measuring the same thing </v>

876
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:39.580
<v Speaker 1>badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might clump them.</v>

877
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.510
<v Speaker 1>So let's say I ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

878
00:49:43.511 --> 00:49:45.200
<v Speaker 1>maybe I give you a test that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

879
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:46.123
<v Speaker 1>asks you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tested your vocabulary with six letter </v>

880
00:49:49.121 --> 00:49:49.954
<v Speaker 1>words and then I gave you another test </v>
<v Speaker 1>that tested you vocabulary with seven </v>

881
00:49:52.271 --> 00:49:55.360
<v Speaker 1>letter words and another one that tested</v>
<v Speaker 1>you vocabulary with eight letter words.</v>

882
00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:56.411
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

883
00:49:56.411 --> 00:49:57.910
<v Speaker 1>those are all different tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

884
00:49:57.911 --> 00:50:00.700
<v Speaker 1>they would correlate quite high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not perfectly,</v>

885
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:04.900
<v Speaker 1>but I could clump them together and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>one sort of super test out of them.</v>

886
00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:05.734
<v Speaker 1>And then I could take super test a and </v>
<v Speaker 1>super testy and super test B C and look </v>

887
00:50:10.391 --> 00:50:11.224
<v Speaker 1>at the correlations between those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those would climb to about 0.5 or 0.6 </v>

888
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:17.050
<v Speaker 1>and then if I clump the super tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

889
00:50:17.051 --> 00:50:20.380
<v Speaker 1>which would be happening by the time we </v>
<v Speaker 1>got destroyed him to there,</v>

890
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.633
<v Speaker 1>then the correlation between the tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>would start to rise to about 0.7 and </v>

891
00:50:25.361 --> 00:50:28.520
<v Speaker 1>then if I collapsed all the super tasks </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a single measure,</v>

892
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:29.803
<v Speaker 1>then the correlation between any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those stratum to tests and g cause that </v>

893
00:50:34.011 --> 00:50:35.210
<v Speaker 1>would be the highest level thing.</v>

894
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:36.043
<v Speaker 1>G is general intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's roughly speaking fluid </v>

895
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:41.690
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between any of the super</v>

896
00:50:41.691 --> 00:50:46.670
<v Speaker 1>tests and gene would be about 0.8 so the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of all this,</v>

897
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:48.913
<v Speaker 1>there's no way of discussing this sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing without doing it statistically </v>

898
00:50:51.731 --> 00:50:54.890
<v Speaker 1>and technically because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical and technical processes.</v>

899
00:50:54.891 --> 00:50:55.724
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is is that now let's say</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you have a measure of fluid </v>

900
00:51:00.531 --> 00:51:01.970
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

901
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:07.030
<v Speaker 1>you've got this measure and you take one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the stratum two sets of tasks and you</v>

902
00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:09.620
<v Speaker 1>use both to predict academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement.</v>

903
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:14.540
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that the super factor g </v>
<v Speaker 1>kills the rest of them.</v>

904
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:15.673
<v Speaker 1>You're just not going to be able to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of the tests in the bottom strata </v>

905
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:24.140
<v Speaker 1>that are going to add to the prediction </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what the general factor can give you.</v>

906
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Now with with with personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not the case.</v>

907
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:28.813
<v Speaker 1>You can't pull out a single factor that </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicts how personality is going to </v>

908
00:51:32.391 --> 00:51:33.620
<v Speaker 1>influence jobs.</v>

909
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance across your life.</v>

910
00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.213
<v Speaker 1>If you add neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take the single factor and you </v>

911
00:51:40.851 --> 00:51:41.684
<v Speaker 1>add neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism is going to kick the single </v>

912
00:51:43.821 --> 00:51:44.654
<v Speaker 1>factor out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness is going to kick the </v>

913
00:51:46.131 --> 00:51:49.220
<v Speaker 1>single factor out and so forth because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a single factor.</v>

914
00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:50.683
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tests aren't highly correlated </v>

915
00:51:52.191 --> 00:51:55.460
<v Speaker 1>enough to say that they're all measuring</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing to some degree.</v>

916
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.440
<v Speaker 1>The personality traits really are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

917
00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.393
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can clump them into plasticity and </v>

918
00:51:59.481 --> 00:52:00.740
<v Speaker 1>stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even there,</v>

919
00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:03.710
<v Speaker 1>your loot you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're maintaining a lot of validity.</v>

920
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:04.783
<v Speaker 1>So if I took stability and then he and </v>
<v Speaker 1>used conscientiousness to predict job </v>

921
00:52:09.621 --> 00:52:10.454
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness would wipe out </v>

922
00:52:11.661 --> 00:52:13.070
<v Speaker 1>stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a better measure.</v>

923
00:52:13.071 --> 00:52:13.904
<v Speaker 1>But you never get that virtually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never get that with the lower tests in </v>

924
00:52:16.401 --> 00:52:18.740
<v Speaker 1>the EICU stratum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

925
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

926
00:52:22.491 --> 00:52:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just talked to you about that.</v>

927
00:52:24.201 --> 00:52:26.180
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

928
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:29.360
<v Speaker 1>that's a good representation of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are associated.</v>

929
00:52:29.361 --> 00:52:32.540
<v Speaker 1>So at the bottom you have the single </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests and then they,</v>

930
00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.750
<v Speaker 1>they chunk into say sequential </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasoning,</v>

931
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.593
<v Speaker 1>quantitative reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and induction on the fluid intelligence </v>

932
00:52:38.451 --> 00:52:41.300
<v Speaker 1>size side in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and language development.</v>

933
00:52:41.301 --> 00:52:43.760
<v Speaker 1>On the crystallized intelligence side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the red.</v>

934
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.950
<v Speaker 1>And then they're all subsumed underneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid intelligence,</v>

935
00:52:48.951 --> 00:52:50.750
<v Speaker 1>which is the measure that you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have.</v>

936
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what good is that?</v>

937
00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.353
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it basically correlates 0.5 with major </v>

938
00:53:00.551 --> 00:53:05.050
<v Speaker 1>life outcomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's 25% of the variance.</v>

939
00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.180
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you can get it a bit higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

940
00:53:07.181 --> 00:53:11.560
<v Speaker 1>but we'll just stick with 0.5 as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a representation.</v>

941
00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.900
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say,</v>

942
00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.820
<v Speaker 1>let's say you take a bunch of students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred of them,</v>

943
00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:23.403
<v Speaker 1>and you want to sort them into those who</v>
<v Speaker 1>will pass a class with a 50% failure </v>

944
00:53:27.511 --> 00:53:28.950
<v Speaker 1>rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

945
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:31.080
<v Speaker 1>So you just pick the brandable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pass,</v>

946
00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pass,</v>

947
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:34.380
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's no knowledge.</v>

948
00:53:34.381 --> 00:53:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I have no predictive dominant you </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

949
00:53:36.031 --> 00:53:36.864
<v Speaker 1>So my validity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the validity of my classification is </v>

950
00:53:40.231 --> 00:53:42.390
<v Speaker 1>basically going to be equivalent chats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

951
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:43.603
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only going to have a 50% chance of </v>

952
00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:49.290
<v Speaker 1>picking who passes and who fails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I used Iq,</v>

953
00:53:49.291 --> 00:53:53.040
<v Speaker 1>if I had all your Iq scores and I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>the prediction,</v>

954
00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:58.041
<v Speaker 1>I'd get right 75% of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a huge difference.</v>

955
00:53:58.081 --> 00:54:01.230
<v Speaker 1>It cuts the failure rate in half by </v>
<v Speaker 1>using Iq.</v>

956
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Iq is a very good predictor of health </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a predictor of longevity.</v>

957
00:54:06.661 --> 00:54:09.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a predictor of resistance to post </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic stress disorder.</v>

958
00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:13.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a predictor of obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupational status.</v>

959
00:54:13.621 --> 00:54:17.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a predictor of educational success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a predictor of income.</v>

960
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:19.463
<v Speaker 1>It's very powerful predictor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's another way of </v>

961
00:54:23.911 --> 00:54:28.911
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing its effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you could choose how you</v>

962
00:54:29.281 --> 00:54:30.114
<v Speaker 1>were going to be when you were born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is in North America because it's </v>

963
00:54:32.461 --> 00:54:35.280
<v Speaker 1>going to vary by society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree.</v>

964
00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:40.970
<v Speaker 1>You get to be born into a family that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the 95th percentile for wealth or you</v>

965
00:54:41.401 --> 00:54:44.640
<v Speaker 1>get to be born at the 95th percentile </v>
<v Speaker 1>for intelligence,</v>

966
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:46.163
<v Speaker 1>who's better off at the age of 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that answer is the person who picks </v>

967
00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:54.540
<v Speaker 1>being born with an Iq in the 95th </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile at birth.</v>

968
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:58.140
<v Speaker 1>It's more powerful predictor of longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>life outcome then familiar wealth.</v>

969
00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:03.480
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it shows up everywhere.</v>

970
00:55:03.481 --> 00:55:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things we did recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>was looking at disgust,</v>

971
00:55:06.691 --> 00:55:07.524
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk a little bit about </v>

972
00:55:08.431 --> 00:55:12.120
<v Speaker 1>that when we talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness because orderly people</v>

973
00:55:12.121 --> 00:55:15.450
<v Speaker 1>seem to be more sensitive to discuss the</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorderly people.</v>

974
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:20.720
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be why they're orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the higher you are in Icu,</v>

975
00:55:20.971 --> 00:55:23.850
<v Speaker 1>the less disgust sensitive you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

976
00:55:23.851 --> 00:55:26.580
<v Speaker 1>we don't know exactly why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because,</v>

977
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:27.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could make the inference that </v>

978
00:55:29.761 --> 00:55:30.594
<v Speaker 1>Iq is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in related in some way to the </v>

979
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:36.840
<v Speaker 1>physiological integrity of the cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

980
00:55:36.841 --> 00:55:39.210
<v Speaker 1>rather than the limbic system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>

981
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:41.910
<v Speaker 1>is the source of say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and motivations.</v>

982
00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

983
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:48.720
<v Speaker 1>the more powerful it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more inhibitory capacity.</v>

984
00:55:48.721 --> 00:55:49.554
<v Speaker 1>It has over the more fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations and emotions you could make </v>

985
00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:53.514
<v Speaker 1>that case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that intelligent </v>

986
00:55:55.981 --> 00:55:59.370
<v Speaker 1>people don't necessarily seem to be any </v>
<v Speaker 1>less impulsive.</v>

987
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.983
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can have pretty vicious </v>

988
00:56:03.721 --> 00:56:04.554
<v Speaker 1>personality disorder that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by extremely disorganized </v>

989
00:56:07.051 --> 00:56:07.884
<v Speaker 1>behavior and a complete inability to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm plans into operation and still </v>

990
00:56:11.881 --> 00:56:12.714
<v Speaker 1>have a high Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are the things we really can't </v>

991
00:56:16.291 --> 00:56:17.124
<v Speaker 1>figure out?</v>

992
00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:17.993
<v Speaker 1>It's just a hell of a thing to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out is like the relationship </v>

993
00:56:21.541 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 1>between Iq and industriousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

994
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:26.343
<v Speaker 1>And that just makes no sense to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of the brain models are </v>

995
00:56:29.651 --> 00:56:30.484
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that your ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to engage in longterm planning is a </v>

996
00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:37.420
<v Speaker 1>factor that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

997
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:42.220
<v Speaker 1>But then industrious people seem to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only engage in longterm planning,</v>

998
00:56:42.221 --> 00:56:44.860
<v Speaker 1>they seem to do it right so that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more industrious,</v>

999
00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:47.770
<v Speaker 1>they put their plans into operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the plan is actually work.</v>

1000
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:52.480
<v Speaker 1>But it's not correlated with Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I can't figure out,</v>

1001
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:53.314
<v Speaker 1>well obviously the industrious person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways able to regulate their own </v>

1002
00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:58.280
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1003
00:56:58.281 --> 00:57:00.340
<v Speaker 1>well they're not procrastinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

1004
00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:01.593
<v Speaker 1>And you'd think that that the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not procrastinate would be a cognitive </v>

1005
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:08.440
<v Speaker 1>feature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't seem to be and we have no</v>

1006
00:57:08.441 --> 00:57:11.230
<v Speaker 1>idea what makes people industrious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't figure it out.</v>

1007
00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:13.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's this incredibly potent </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictor.</v>

1008
00:57:13.561 --> 00:57:18.561
<v Speaker 1>It's just about as powerful as Iq and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have no idea what it is.</v>

1009
00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:22.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you,</v>

1010
00:57:22.171 --> 00:57:22.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think,</v>

1011
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:23.793
<v Speaker 1>if you have a smart idea about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to pursue it like feel free </v>

1012
00:57:26.411 --> 00:57:27.244
<v Speaker 1>because there's a big mystery there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's been able to crack and we'd </v>

1013
00:57:29.501 --> 00:57:33.610
<v Speaker 1>been added for a long time and have had </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost no success.</v>

1014
00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.513
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had people do things like give them </v>

1015
00:57:36.071 --> 00:57:36.904
<v Speaker 1>sentences of ends am's and use sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>randomly distributed and then we'd have </v>

1016
00:57:41.651 --> 00:57:42.790
<v Speaker 1>them count the use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1017
00:57:42.791 --> 00:57:46.120
<v Speaker 1>like a whole page of sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not sentences,</v>

1018
00:57:46.121 --> 00:57:48.430
<v Speaker 1>they're just strings of letter count the</v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

1019
00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:49.720
<v Speaker 1>how useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1020
00:57:49.721 --> 00:57:53.080
<v Speaker 1>you'd think that someone industrious </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do that better.</v>

1021
00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:55.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an Iq test.</v>

1022
00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.240
<v Speaker 1>And people who co can count the used </v>
<v Speaker 1>faster have hierarchy,</v>

1023
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.570
<v Speaker 1>almost everything that you would do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

1024
00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:06.550
<v Speaker 1>where it has to do with manipulation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractions of any sort.</v>

1025
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Even something that basic seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally associated with Iq.</v>

1026
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:13.990
<v Speaker 1>People with hierarchies have slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger heads.</v>

1027
00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:17.350
<v Speaker 1>If you control for body size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have slightly bigger brains.</v>

1028
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:18.243
<v Speaker 1>If you control for body size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the axons on their neurons are a bit </v>

1029
00:58:21.641 --> 00:58:22.474
<v Speaker 1>thicker so that the electrical messages </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to travel a little bit more </v>

1030
00:58:25.721 --> 00:58:26.554
<v Speaker 1>efficiency efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are slightly faster in simple </v>

1031
00:58:29.651 --> 00:58:30.484
<v Speaker 1>reflex tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it goes right down to the level of </v>

1032
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:35.230
<v Speaker 1>cause are simple reflex light goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing buttons.</v>

1033
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:38.050
<v Speaker 1>There's not many neurons mediating that </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

1034
00:58:38.051 --> 00:58:39.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chains of neurons.</v>

1035
00:58:39.251 --> 00:58:42.550
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few neurons communicating</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can do that.</v>

1036
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.940
<v Speaker 1>But even at that relatively simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing level,</v>

1037
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Iq is associated with speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a physiological component.</v>

1038
00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:51.633
<v Speaker 1>You're less likely to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's disease if you have a high </v>

1039
00:58:53.651 --> 00:58:54.484
<v Speaker 1>Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's because your brain is </v>

1040
00:58:55.961 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 1>just more robust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1041
00:58:57.371 --> 00:58:58.204
<v Speaker 1>so you could sustain damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say of up to 50% of your brain and you </v>

1042
00:59:01.931 --> 00:59:05.200
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't even show it if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a sufficiently high Iq.</v>

1043
00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1044
00:59:06.971 --> 00:59:09.250
<v Speaker 1>if you're on the bottom end of the Eicu </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

1045
00:59:09.251 --> 00:59:11.680
<v Speaker 1>you're much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seem to be much more susceptible to,</v>

1046
00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:14.580
<v Speaker 1>to physiological damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1047
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.350
<v Speaker 1>nutrition is a big predictor of Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation.</v>

1048
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:20.560
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of that's been hammered out of</v>

1049
00:59:20.561 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 1>modern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1050
00:59:21.981 --> 00:59:22.814
<v Speaker 1>so 150 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's Iq was pretty tightly </v>

1051
00:59:26.601 --> 00:59:28.550
<v Speaker 1>associated with their nutritional </v>
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>

1052
00:59:28.551 --> 00:59:29.540
<v Speaker 1>But now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1053
00:59:29.541 --> 00:59:30.374
<v Speaker 1>there are very few people in North </v>
<v Speaker 1>America who don't have enough to eat </v>

1054
00:59:32.631 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 1>even though there's some variation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of diet and that's flattened out</v>

1055
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:39.230
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1056
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 1>cultural variability and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

1057
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a,</v>

1058
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy named him.</v>

1059
00:59:51.711 --> 00:59:55.160
<v Speaker 1>He'll did this paper to American </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist a while back and one of the</v>

1060
00:59:55.161 --> 00:59:58.280
<v Speaker 1>things he was interested in doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember we talked about effect sizes,</v>

1061
00:59:58.281 --> 00:59:59.114
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big is an effect in psychology or </v>

1062
01:00:01.281 --> 01:00:06.281
<v Speaker 1>the social sciences in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people have used rules of thumb that</v>

1063
01:00:06.531 --> 01:00:09.980
<v Speaker 1>0.5 was a moderate effect and 0.3 was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1064
01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:12.290
<v Speaker 1>a minimal effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And 0.2 was uh,</v>

1065
01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to diminish to the point of non</v>

1066
01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:16.423
<v Speaker 1>utility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what hand pld had instead of </v>

1067
01:00:18.351 --> 01:00:20.330
<v Speaker 1>guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that was just a gas,</v>

1068
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.740
<v Speaker 1>was actually go and look at papers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were published in psychology to see what</v>

1069
01:00:24.741 --> 01:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>effects sizes are we're being reported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an empirical analysis of how big</v>

1070
01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:33.380
<v Speaker 1>the effects that psychologists and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>social scientists report.</v>

1071
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.750
<v Speaker 1>And so what he found was that</v>

1072
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.393
<v Speaker 3>mmm,</v>

1073
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>the highest third of papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the third of papers that had the</v>

1074
01:00:43.261 --> 01:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>biggest effects reported effects from </v>
<v Speaker 1>0.35 to 0.78.</v>

1075
01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle third from 0.2,</v>

1076
01:00:49.981 --> 01:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>one to 0.33 and the lower third from 0.2</v>
<v Speaker 1>to point to one.</v>

1077
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>So then was there another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1078
01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.673
<v Speaker 1>if you look on the left side here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that and are of less than 0.15 </v>

1079
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:05.743
<v Speaker 1>characterizes the first quarter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>published studies and R of 0.15 to 0.35 </v>

1080
01:01:10.921 --> 01:01:11.754
<v Speaker 1>the next core tile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 50% of psychological studies report </v>

1081
01:01:16.561 --> 01:01:17.394
<v Speaker 1>and are of less than 0.35</v>
<v Speaker 1>90% report and are of less than 0.5 and </v>

1082
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>only seven to 8% reported in our 0.5 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>above.</v>

1083
01:01:29.671 --> 01:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between Iq and say academic</v>

1084
01:01:34.561 --> 01:01:35.394
<v Speaker 1>performance or longterm life income is </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than that reported in all but </v>

1085
01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:45.531
<v Speaker 1>about 5% of psychology studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1086
01:01:45.781 --> 01:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>So here's an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say</v>

1087
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:49.843
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1088
01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>in order to determine whether something </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>

1089
01:01:54.061 --> 01:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to measure it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it has to be good for something.</v>

1090
01:01:56.491 --> 01:01:57.324
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>grippable and it has to be usable as a </v>

1091
01:02:00.601 --> 01:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll save for it.</v>

1092
01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:02.843
<v Speaker 1>For the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of Iq do you need for what </v>

1093
01:02:05.401 --> 01:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>kind of job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1094
01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.753
<v Speaker 1>this was derived from a company called </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderlic and wonderlic does employment </v>

1095
01:02:12.301 --> 01:02:13.134
<v Speaker 1>testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologists usually don't use the </v>

1096
01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>wonderlic test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a relatively short Iq test and it's</v>

1097
01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:18.234
<v Speaker 1>a good test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think don't use it because it was </v>

1098
01:02:20.401 --> 01:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>developed commercially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we tested the the wonderlic code lot</v>

1099
01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>and it has excellent psychometric </v>
<v Speaker 1>properties.</v>

1100
01:02:25.681 --> 01:02:26.514
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good Iq testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably errors a little bit in testing </v>

1101
01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:32.784
<v Speaker 1>crystallized Iq rather than fluid Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we won't argue about that for the </v>

1102
01:02:36.931 --> 01:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>time being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1103
01:02:38.251 --> 01:02:39.084
<v Speaker 1>so if you have an Iq from 130 116 to 130</v>
<v Speaker 1>that puts you in the 86 to 95th </v>

1104
01:02:46.411 --> 01:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>percentile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1105
01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:48.744
<v Speaker 1>So that means you're minimally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there were eight people in a room on </v>

1106
01:02:51.991 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be the smartest person.</v>

1107
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:55.013
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1108
01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.180
<v Speaker 1>I should tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know that</v>

1109
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:01.283
<v Speaker 1>if you're a state college student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use the u s as an example because </v>

1110
01:03:04.831 --> 01:03:05.664
<v Speaker 1>there's more differentiation between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American universities in terms of </v>

1111
01:03:08.461 --> 01:03:10.500
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there is the Canadian universities.</v>

1112
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:12.950
<v Speaker 1>If you're in an a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a,</v>

1113
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:17.100
<v Speaker 1>if you're in an average American </v>
<v Speaker 1>postsecondary institution,</v>

1114
01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:22.130
<v Speaker 1>your Iq is 115 and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that's not all that bright,</v>

1115
01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:29.450
<v Speaker 1>but that's brighter than seven out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight people in the general population.</v>

1116
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:32.453
<v Speaker 1>And so there are as many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the North American </v>

1117
01:03:34.951 --> 01:03:35.784
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have the 50th percentile in the </v>

1118
01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:39.504
<v Speaker 1>middle of the normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the 85th percentile here and </v>

1119
01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:42.624
<v Speaker 1>you have the 15th percentile here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about 70% of people fall between </v>

1120
01:03:46.141 --> 01:03:49.140
<v Speaker 1>the 15th and the 85th percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

1121
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:51.110
<v Speaker 1>At the 50th percentile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1122
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:52.023
<v Speaker 1>you're not really very literate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that in the </v>

1123
01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.064
<v Speaker 1>United States there's just as many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who aren't literate as there are </v>

1124
01:03:59.341 --> 01:04:00.600
<v Speaker 1>people who are in college.</v>

1125
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:02.123
<v Speaker 1>And what I would mean by literate is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much like here's a bare bones </v>

1126
01:04:07.921 --> 01:04:11.700
<v Speaker 1>definition of literate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could follow written instructions.</v>

1127
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.690
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is it's kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>twofold issue,</v>

1128
01:04:15.691 --> 01:04:16.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

1129
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:20.040
<v Speaker 1>you can make out the words and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrases and the sentences,</v>

1130
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:22.770
<v Speaker 1>but then you can translate them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual action.</v>

1131
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.633
<v Speaker 1>You can use the information and an 85 </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have not a very good </v>

1132
01:04:26.941 --> 01:04:27.774
<v Speaker 1>time doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're wondering things </v>

1133
01:04:31.621 --> 01:04:36.480
<v Speaker 1>about the way society is structured and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white people you know are not,</v>

1134
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:40.590
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily make the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually sophisticated choices.</v>

1135
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.890
<v Speaker 1>One thing that's very much worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembering is that there's just as many</v>

1136
01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:47.430
<v Speaker 1>people who are functionally illiterate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in North America as there are people who</v>

1137
01:04:47.431 --> 01:04:48.780
<v Speaker 1>are in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1138
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:52.050
<v Speaker 1>tier one colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite shocking.</v>

1139
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.311
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1140
01:04:53.311 --> 01:04:54.144
<v Speaker 1>so you want to be an attorney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a research analyst and editor and </v>

1141
01:04:56.431 --> 01:04:58.140
<v Speaker 1>advertising manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chemist,</v>

1142
01:04:58.141 --> 01:05:01.980
<v Speaker 1>an engineer and executive assistance </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyst and auditor.</v>

1143
01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:04.350
<v Speaker 1>So you're up in the profession levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1144
01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:10.370
<v Speaker 1>You need an Iq of at least 116 and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>130 would be better.</v>

1145
01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:11.993
<v Speaker 1>My suspicions are that the average Iq of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in this room is about one 20 to </v>

1146
01:05:15.721 --> 01:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>one 25 it might be a little higher than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1147
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.253
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to measure Iq in the ot </v>
<v Speaker 1>population because a lot of people have </v>

1148
01:05:23.111 --> 01:05:24.830
<v Speaker 1>English as a second language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>

1149
01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>that makes it harder to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1150
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.840
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to measure crystallized </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

1151
01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>obviously using an English language </v>
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>

1152
01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:32.253
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found when we've done our studies at </v>

1153
01:05:34.481 --> 01:05:39.481
<v Speaker 1>the uft that the average exceeds one 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

1154
01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:41.074
<v Speaker 1>so you guys have the cognitive power to </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically pursue professional level </v>

1155
01:05:43.841 --> 01:05:45.580
<v Speaker 1>careers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1156
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:51.610
<v Speaker 1>from one 10 to one 15 manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supervisor,</v>

1157
01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:53.560
<v Speaker 1>programmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher,</v>

1158
01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:54.720
<v Speaker 1>general manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1159
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:55.743
<v Speaker 1>purchasing agent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>registered nurse sales account </v>

1160
01:05:57.401 --> 01:05:58.234
<v Speaker 1>executive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are actually empirically derived </v>

1161
01:06:00.071 --> 01:06:00.904
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the wonderlic company has tested a </v>

1162
01:06:02.771 --> 01:06:05.850
<v Speaker 1>very large number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these are the,</v>

1163
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:09.670
<v Speaker 1>the actual averages of the professions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are describing.</v>

1164
01:06:09.671 --> 01:06:10.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not hypothetical.</v>

1165
01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:13.423
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1166
01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:21.173
<v Speaker 1>108 to 103 two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>108 so that's the 60 to the 70th </v>

1167
01:06:24.091 --> 01:06:27.450
<v Speaker 1>percentile clerk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer service Rep,</v>

1168
01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:29.700
<v Speaker 1>computer operator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical debt collectors,</v>

1169
01:06:29.701 --> 01:06:31.980
<v Speaker 1>secretary accounting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear general sales,</v>

1170
01:06:31.981 --> 01:06:34.380
<v Speaker 1>telephone sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assistant manager,</v>

1171
01:06:34.381 --> 01:06:35.610
<v Speaker 1>credit clerk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drafter,</v>

1172
01:06:35.611 --> 01:06:36.810
<v Speaker 1>designer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bookkeeper.</v>

1173
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:38.303
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of white color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like low level entry level white color </v>

1174
01:06:42.301 --> 01:06:43.134
<v Speaker 1>jobs in that particular category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the brighter people </v>

1175
01:06:48.841 --> 01:06:53.841
<v Speaker 1>among the high school students who </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't go to college and university Iq.</v>

1176
01:06:54.541 --> 01:06:57.720
<v Speaker 1>This is dead average 50th to the 55th </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>

1177
01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Police officer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>receptionist,</v>

1178
01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:00.474
<v Speaker 1>cashier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>general clerical staff inside sales </v>

1179
01:07:03.031 --> 01:07:05.850
<v Speaker 1>clerk meter reader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>printer teller,</v>

1180
01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.400
<v Speaker 1>data entry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electrical helper,</v>

1181
01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:09.863
<v Speaker 1>dispatcher in general office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's right at 195 to 98 so that's </v>

1182
01:07:15.421 --> 01:07:19.520
<v Speaker 1>the 42nd to the 45th percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quality Control Checker,</v>

1183
01:07:19.610 --> 01:07:21.300
<v Speaker 1>claims clerk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>security gardner,</v>

1184
01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:23.220
<v Speaker 1>unskilled labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

1185
01:07:23.221 --> 01:07:26.580
<v Speaker 1>the unskilled laborers are up at 95th to</v>
<v Speaker 1>98 right?</v>

1186
01:07:26.581 --> 01:07:29.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still at unt,</v>

1187
01:07:29.491 --> 01:07:30.324
<v Speaker 1>the unskilled labor level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still have an Iq that's higher </v>

1188
01:07:32.341 --> 01:07:34.200
<v Speaker 1>than 40% of the population.</v>

1189
01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.461
<v Speaker 1>Arc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welder,</v>

1190
01:07:35.461 --> 01:07:39.870
<v Speaker 1>diasend or mechanic medical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dental assistant Iq,</v>

1191
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:44.990
<v Speaker 1>87 to 93 messenger factory production </v>
<v Speaker 1>worker Assembler,</v>

1192
01:07:45.271 --> 01:07:46.920
<v Speaker 1>food service worker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurses aid,</v>

1193
01:07:46.921 --> 01:07:48.180
<v Speaker 1>warehouseman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>custodian,</v>

1194
01:07:48.181 --> 01:07:50.790
<v Speaker 1>janitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>material handler and packer.</v>

1195
01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now what you see happening,</v>

1196
01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:56.460
<v Speaker 1>the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks to me like you can do job,</v>

1197
01:07:56.490 --> 01:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>you can count conceptualize jobs most </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply with a two by two matrix.</v>

1198
01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:02.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's managerial administrative </v>

1199
01:08:04.471 --> 01:08:08.010
<v Speaker 1>jobs and creative jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first one.</v>

1200
01:08:08.011 --> 01:08:10.020
<v Speaker 1>And then there's low complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>High complexity.</v>

1201
01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:15.940
<v Speaker 1>And so what you're starting to fall into</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the 21st to the 30 percentile.</v>

1202
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:19.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's still one person in three are </v>
<v Speaker 1>low complexity,</v>

1203
01:08:19.701 --> 01:08:20.534
<v Speaker 1>managerial jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I mean by that is that if </v>

1204
01:08:22.551 --> 01:08:23.384
<v Speaker 1>you're in a low complexity job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine you're responsible for 30 </v>

1205
01:08:26.691 --> 01:08:28.970
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but roughly speaking,</v>

1206
01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>it's the same 30 things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And roughly speaking,</v>

1207
01:08:32.391 --> 01:08:35.150
<v Speaker 1>they have to be taken care of the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way each time.</v>

1208
01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:40.420
<v Speaker 1>So you have a finite domain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and you can master it and</v>

1209
01:08:40.611 --> 01:08:41.444
<v Speaker 1>Iq will predict how fast you master it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you master it will predict how </v>

1210
01:08:45.141 --> 01:08:45.974
<v Speaker 1>well you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens then in all likelihood is </v>

1211
01:08:47.871 --> 01:08:49.670
<v Speaker 1>that conscientiousness starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict,</v>

1212
01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:54.320
<v Speaker 1>or maybe emotional stability starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict or some of the other personality</v>

1213
01:08:54.321 --> 01:08:56.780
<v Speaker 1>factors start to become more important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1214
01:08:56.781 --> 01:09:01.370
<v Speaker 1>but at 87 to 93 you're down at the level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of custodian and janitor.</v>

1215
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:04.363
<v Speaker 1>And then that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not so good because you have </v>

1216
01:09:09.921 --> 01:09:14.910
<v Speaker 1>the bottom 15 to 20% of the population </v>
<v Speaker 1>who aren't quite,</v>

1217
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.793
<v Speaker 1>who haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't have the cognitive ability at </v>

1218
01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:19.574
<v Speaker 1>that level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that you're </v>

1219
01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:25.721
<v Speaker 1>going to hear a lot about as you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>older is reasons for unemployment.</v>

1220
01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:30.230
<v Speaker 1>And one of the prime reasons for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>employment in the future is increasingly</v>

1221
01:09:30.231 --> 01:09:31.064
<v Speaker 1>going to be that there is just nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone of that level of </v>

1222
01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:34.814
<v Speaker 1>intelligence to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is partly why people hate Iq </v>

1223
01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.180
<v Speaker 1>because you think that is a nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty thing to conclude.</v>

1224
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:42.493
<v Speaker 1>I'd be telling you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a client at one point who I </v>

1225
01:09:45.951 --> 01:09:50.951
<v Speaker 1>suspect he had a verbal Iq of about 85 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a nonverbal Iq that was lower.</v>

1226
01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had other psychological issues,</v>

1227
01:09:54.681 --> 01:09:55.514
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll just concentrate on that one </v>

1228
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:58.340
<v Speaker 1>for the time being.</v>

1229
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:04.190
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a hard time finding a job.</v>

1230
01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:06.710
<v Speaker 1>He was socially anxious and that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

1231
01:10:06.711 --> 01:10:09.290
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if he could overcome that,</v>

1232
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:10.633
<v Speaker 1>it was very difficult for him to master </v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic skills that were involved in </v>

1233
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:17.630
<v Speaker 1>what you would consider even relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward tasks.</v>

1234
01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:20.600
<v Speaker 1>So I spent a lot of time trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>him a job,</v>

1235
01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:21.973
<v Speaker 1>which is insanely difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to the government first to get </v>

1236
01:10:25.791 --> 01:10:28.310
<v Speaker 1>help and they told him to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1237
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.010
<v Speaker 1>type up his resume on a computer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>

1238
01:10:31.011 --> 01:10:31.521
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1239
01:10:31.521 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't very helpful because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know how to use a computer and he</v>

1240
01:10:34.281 --> 01:10:36.740
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going to type up his damn resume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1241
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:39.170
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get a job,</v>

1242
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:42.590
<v Speaker 1>go out and do the things that it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>take to get a job while yeah,</v>

1243
01:10:42.591 --> 01:10:44.630
<v Speaker 1>if you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have a problem.</v>

1244
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:48.140
<v Speaker 1>And so the government agencies were </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely useless,</v>

1245
01:10:48.141 --> 01:10:48.974
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were staffed by people who </v>

1246
01:10:49.911 --> 01:10:52.820
<v Speaker 1>would assume that if you didn't do what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were advised to,</v>

1247
01:10:52.821 --> 01:10:53.654
<v Speaker 1>that you just didn't want to have a job </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of ever thinking that maybe you </v>

1248
01:10:56.061 --> 01:10:58.610
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy to use a computer.</v>

1249
01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:01.190
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1250
01:11:01.191 --> 01:11:03.830
<v Speaker 1>and then I tried to get him a volunteer </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

1251
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:04.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bloody well forget about that </v>

1252
01:11:05.751 --> 01:11:08.810
<v Speaker 1>because it's harder to get a volunteer </v>
<v Speaker 1>job than it is to get a real job.</v>

1253
01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:10.093
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to step through a number of complex </v>

1254
01:11:12.441 --> 01:11:15.540
<v Speaker 1>bureaucratic hoops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including having police check.</v>

1255
01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:17.100
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1256
01:11:17.101 --> 01:11:17.934
<v Speaker 1>that's intimidating as hell for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they haven't done anything </v>

1257
01:11:20.071 --> 01:11:20.910
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

1258
01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:22.950
<v Speaker 1>it's not that straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1259
01:11:22.951 --> 01:11:26.820
<v Speaker 1>it involves maneuvering through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated bureaucracy.</v>

1260
01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the only step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of other steps.</v>

1261
01:11:29.461 --> 01:11:31.740
<v Speaker 1>So volunteer work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it man,</v>

1262
01:11:31.741 --> 01:11:34.110
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not gonna happen.</v>

1263
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Not generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I found him a job helping a guy</v>

1264
01:11:38.821 --> 01:11:41.100
<v Speaker 1>out who had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bicycle shop.</v>

1265
01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Slash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bookstore.</v>

1266
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:43.243
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of a strange combination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a government subsidized </v>

1267
01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:48.210
<v Speaker 1>temporary position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he did a good job at it.</v>

1268
01:11:48.211 --> 01:11:48.751
<v Speaker 1>He could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1269
01:11:48.751 --> 01:11:50.790
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was reshelving books and that sort of</v>

1270
01:11:50.791 --> 01:11:51.624
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he was reliable and he could do </v>

1271
01:11:52.831 --> 01:11:54.650
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1272
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.050
<v Speaker 1>the subsidy program ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course if you run a bike shop,</v>

1273
01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.160
<v Speaker 1>slash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bookstore,</v>

1274
01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:02.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you have additional money </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hire someone because you know,</v>

1275
01:12:02.071 --> 01:12:02.904
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a store that's just not going to </v>

1276
01:12:04.171 --> 01:12:05.004
<v Speaker 1>be generating maybe any income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But certainly not enough to hire </v>

1277
01:12:07.501 --> 01:12:09.570
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that fell apart.</v>

1278
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Then I did a bunch of con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

1279
01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:13.344
<v Speaker 1>made a bunch of personal contacts with </v>
<v Speaker 1>charity organizations to see if I can </v>

1280
01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 1>get them a volunteer position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finally got him a volunteer position.</v>

1281
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:22.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1282
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.633
<v Speaker 1>then I went with him to train him at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>volunteer position and that was so </v>

1283
01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:27.174
<v Speaker 1>enlightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what he had to do was he had a stack </v>

1284
01:12:31.801 --> 01:12:36.030
<v Speaker 1>of pieces of paper here and then a stack</v>
<v Speaker 1>of envelopes here.</v>

1285
01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.580
<v Speaker 1>And in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pieces of paper,</v>

1286
01:12:38.581 --> 01:12:42.330
<v Speaker 1>which were letters were in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>order as the envelopes were.</v>

1287
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:46.230
<v Speaker 1>And so what he had to do was fold the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces of paper three times and stuff,</v>

1288
01:12:46.231 --> 01:12:47.064
<v Speaker 1>the folded piece of paper into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>envelope and then seal the envelope and </v>

1289
01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:50.364
<v Speaker 1>then put it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a bit more complicated than </v>

1290
01:12:52.711 --> 01:12:53.544
<v Speaker 1>that because sometimes the letters were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in French and sometimes they were an </v>

1291
01:12:56.851 --> 01:12:57.210
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>

1292
01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:58.043
<v Speaker 1>So what that meant was that he had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch and see that the French envelopes </v>

1293
01:13:02.641 --> 01:13:05.670
<v Speaker 1>went into this stack and the English and</v>
<v Speaker 1>envelopes went into that stock.</v>

1294
01:13:05.671 --> 01:13:07.710
<v Speaker 1>So that's one degree of complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1295
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.113
<v Speaker 1>But then it also turned out that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn envelopes had to be run through an </v>

1296
01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:14.700
<v Speaker 1>automatic letter sorting machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think,</v>

1297
01:13:14.701 --> 01:13:15.534
<v Speaker 1>well that doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does matter because those things </v>

1298
01:13:17.521 --> 01:13:22.521
<v Speaker 1>have very tightly defined tolerances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you</v>

1299
01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:25.613
<v Speaker 1>make a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine you fold a piece of paper and </v>

1300
01:13:27.661 --> 01:13:28.494
<v Speaker 1>the first time you fold it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made a mistake of an eighth of an </v>

1301
01:13:30.211 --> 01:13:32.370
<v Speaker 1>inch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next time you fold it,</v>

1302
01:13:32.371 --> 01:13:33.930
<v Speaker 1>you make another eighth of an inch </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

1303
01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:37.320
<v Speaker 1>That means your piece of papers now one </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter inch out of true</v>

1304
01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:42.020
<v Speaker 1>and then you stuff it in the envelope </v>
<v Speaker 1>and folded,</v>

1305
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:43.320
<v Speaker 1>but you crinkle the envelope.</v>

1306
01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.860
<v Speaker 1>And so then the envelope gets stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the automatic processing machine.</v>

1307
01:13:47.861 --> 01:13:52.861
<v Speaker 1>So I taught him probably 20 hours how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fold this piece of paper into three,</v>

1308
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:54.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was a bit shaky and he just </v>

1309
01:13:56.970 --> 01:14:01.440
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the motor fine motor ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the cognitive ability to do that.</v>

1310
01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:06.441
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll end with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need finally couldn't do it anymore.</v>

1311
01:14:06.931 --> 01:14:09.930
<v Speaker 1>What happened was the letters came with </v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs attached to them.</v>

1312
01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:11.483
<v Speaker 1>And then he had the full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pieces of paper around the </v>

1313
01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:13.714
<v Speaker 1>photographs in a way that different </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumpled the photographs so that they </v>

1314
01:14:16.031 --> 01:14:19.060
<v Speaker 1>could still fit into the envelopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And each photo was,</v>

1315
01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:24.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stapled maybe half an inch different per</v>

1316
01:14:24.041 --> 01:14:24.874
<v Speaker 1>piece of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he had to fold them properly </v>

1317
01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:30.700
<v Speaker 1>with a different folding technique for </v>
<v Speaker 1>every piece of paper.</v>

1318
01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:34.510
<v Speaker 1>And he had to sort them into French and </v>
<v Speaker 1>English and then also with the envelopes</v>

1319
01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.360
<v Speaker 1>and the papers ever gone out of sync,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they did now.</v>

1320
01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:38.193
<v Speaker 1>And then he had to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort the envelopes and the pieces of </v>

1321
01:14:40.931 --> 01:14:43.090
<v Speaker 1>paper to make sure that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>matched with the proper,</v>

1322
01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:45.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they were matched with the proper </v>

1323
01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.260
<v Speaker 1>envelope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no,</v>

1324
01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:48.123
<v Speaker 1>that was the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm telling you the rest of his </v>

1325
01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:52.740
<v Speaker 1>story later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1326
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:53.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1327
01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:54.603
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moral of the story is if you're </v>

1328
01:14:56.471 --> 01:14:58.930
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're privileged and it's thank God,</v>

1329
01:14:58.960 --> 01:14:59.793
<v Speaker 1>make use of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're on the low end of the Iq </v>

1330
01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:02.680
<v Speaker 1>of distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1331
01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:06.730
<v Speaker 1>you've got one tough life ahead of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with willingness to</v>

1332
01:15:06.731 --> 01:15:08.890
<v Speaker 1>work or virtually nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1333
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:11.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's a good thing to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's horrible.</v>

1334
01:15:11.281 --> 01:15:12.114
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1335
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Entrepreneurial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1336
01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:24.770
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

1337
01:15:25.570 --> 01:15:26.403
<v Speaker 3>I just want.</v>
