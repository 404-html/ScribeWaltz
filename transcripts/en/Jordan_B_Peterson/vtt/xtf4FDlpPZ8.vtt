1
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a question.</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:04.943
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'd like to know a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more about why you specifically chose </v>

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>the title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the master and the emissary.</v>

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.533
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an attempt to explain what I believe to </v>

6
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.140
<v Speaker 1>be the relationship if he needs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>habits,</v>

7
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:20.440
<v Speaker 1>fears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.510
<v Speaker 1>that like most other things in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the in equal and asymmetrical and one of</v>

9
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>the brain hemispheres sees more than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>That is the one that I've designated the</v>
<v Speaker 1>master and it was the right hemisphere.</v>

11
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.013
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird inversion because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>often think of the left hemisphere is </v>

12
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>the one that's dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do,</v>

13
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Traditionally that's been the case.</v>

14
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

15
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>as is becoming ever clearer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right hemisphere,</v>

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>this has been a real steep learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>curve for some people,</v>

17
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.573
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right hemisphere is in many ways </v>

18
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>more reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees more,</v>

19
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>understands more than the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere,</v>

20
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>which is like a sort of high functioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucrat.</v>

21
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.953
<v Speaker 1>In a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the story was simply that </v>

22
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>certain matters needed to be delegated </v>
<v Speaker 1>not to only because as it were,</v>

23
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.034
<v Speaker 1>the master couldn't do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needed an emissary to go abroad and </v>

24
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.783
<v Speaker 1>do some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that he must not get involved </v>

25
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.623
<v Speaker 1>with a certain point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise he'd lose what it was if you </v>

26
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:22.194
<v Speaker 1>did see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm really saying there </v>

27
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:29.020
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a good reason why evolution,</v>

28
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 1>really speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two brain hemispheres are separate.</v>

29
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>And when you see it doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

30
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>what's the advantage of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

31
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>that detachment from the involvement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.770
<v Speaker 1>it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Ramonica Hall who you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a great histopathologist.</v>

34
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.493
<v Speaker 1>one of his findings was in primates are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more inhibitory neurons and then any </v>

36
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>other animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are more in humans than in any</v>

37
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:59.840
<v Speaker 1>other primate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

38
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>there are many more being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportionally,</v>

39
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>proportionately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are more kinds as well.</v>

40
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>So we think that about 25% of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire,</v>

41
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex is,</v>

42
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.860
<v Speaker 1>is inhibitory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.150
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very strong effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Corpus callosum seems to be very</v>

44
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>largely in the end inhabiting function </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the other hemisphere.</v>

45
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

46
00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>because over time the two hemispheres of</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to specialize.</v>

47
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>There are reasons why actually it can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

48
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.003
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to go into now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was talking about just a few days </v>

49
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.663
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be evolutionary sake cacciatore </v>

50
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.423
<v Speaker 1>meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are reasons way the Corpus </v>

51
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:41.004
<v Speaker 1>callosum has had to become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>selective and to inhibit quite a lot of </v>

52
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.564
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in the other hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it enables the two to do </v>

53
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:50.064
<v Speaker 1>distinct things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course they have to work </v>

54
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:53.394
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But usually good teamwork doesn't mean </v>

55
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>everyone trained to do the same row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So differentiation is very important for</v>

56
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>two elements to work together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And inhibition is one way of doing that.</v>

57
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 1>So effectively the two takes on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world if you like,</v>

58
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>that the hemispheres have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not easily compatible.</v>

59
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're not aware of that because at a</v>

60
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:16.984
<v Speaker 1>level below consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a metric control center that is </v>

61
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>bringing them together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in ordinary experience,</v>

62
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>we don't feel we're in two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>worlds,</v>

63
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:25.504
<v Speaker 1>but effectively we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have different qualities and </v>

64
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>different goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different values,</v>

65
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:30.004
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different takes on what is important in </v>

66
00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

67
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.373
<v Speaker 1>And what meeting,</v>

68
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

69
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:41.960
<v Speaker 2>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've developed a conceptual scheme for,</v>

70
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 2>for thinking about the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the two hemispheres and I'm kind</v>

71
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.183
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been curious about what you think </v>

72
00:03:47.481 --> 00:03:51.260
<v Speaker 2>about it and how it might map on to or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not you're your ideas.</v>

73
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.100
<v Speaker 2>So I've been really interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>orienting reflex and discovered by socal</v>

74
00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.160
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think back in about 1962.</v>

75
00:03:58.161 --> 00:03:58.994
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a student of Laureus and the </v>

76
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.280
<v Speaker 2>orienting reflexes manifested when </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

77
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.100
<v Speaker 2>at least in their terminology is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something unpredictable happened.</v>

78
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.173
<v Speaker 2>I've thought much more recently did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually when something undesired </v>

79
00:04:11.331 --> 00:04:16.280
<v Speaker 2>happened happens and the laboratory </v>
<v Speaker 2>constraints obscured that.</v>

80
00:04:16.281 --> 00:04:17.720
<v Speaker 2>And that turned out to actually be </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

81
00:04:17.721 --> 00:04:18.990
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

82
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.653
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I kind of put together the ideas of </v>

83
00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:22.934
<v Speaker 2>the orienting reflects with some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things I learned from young young's </v>

84
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.680
<v Speaker 2>observations on the function of art and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams.</v>

85
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.040
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you have a conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>scheme laid out,</v>

86
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could say that it's,</v>

87
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:34.460
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's linguistically mediate,</v>

88
00:04:34.461 --> 00:04:38.120
<v Speaker 2>it's enforced on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there are exceptions to that,</v>

89
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.770
<v Speaker 2>to that conceptual scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are anomalies.</v>

90
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.623
<v Speaker 2>Those are the numbers that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected and the orienting reflex </v>

91
00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:44.804
<v Speaker 2>orients you towards those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those are things that aren't </v>

92
00:04:47.361 --> 00:04:50.930
<v Speaker 2>fitting property in your conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>scheme that you have to figure out.</v>

93
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.823
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing you do is react </v>
<v Speaker 2>defensively essential because it might </v>

94
00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:55.724
<v Speaker 2>be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then your exploratory systems are </v>

95
00:04:58.101 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 2>activated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

96
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.730
<v Speaker 2>and the exploratory systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

97
00:05:01.731 --> 00:05:04.580
<v Speaker 2>our enhanced attention from an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentional perspective.</v>

98
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.623
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where the art issue sort of </v>

99
00:05:07.851 --> 00:05:08.684
<v Speaker 2>creeps into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea would be something like </v>

100
00:05:10.971 --> 00:05:11.804
<v Speaker 2>the right hemisphere generates an </v>
<v Speaker 2>imaginative landscape of possibility </v>

101
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.003
<v Speaker 2>that could map that a normally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can kind of experience that if </v>

102
00:05:18.921 --> 00:05:19.760
<v Speaker 2>it's at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:22.430
<v Speaker 2>like say you're sitting alone at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's two or three in the morning,</v>

104
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.353
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of tired.</v>

105
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.533
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're in an unfamiliar place and </v>

106
00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:28.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a noise that happens that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't happen in another room.</v>

107
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 2>You can play with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

108
00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:31.334
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you open the door slightly and put </v>

109
00:05:33.861 --> 00:05:37.010
<v Speaker 2>your hand in turn on the light and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch what happens,</v>

110
00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:37.844
<v Speaker 2>your mind will fill with imaginative </v>
<v Speaker 2>representations of what might be in the </v>

111
00:05:40.851 --> 00:05:41.750
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

112
00:05:41.751 --> 00:05:43.250
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

113
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.143
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the landscape of anomaly will be </v>

114
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.920
<v Speaker 2>populated with something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>imaginative demons.</v>

115
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.023
<v Speaker 2>And that's a first pass approximation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me that that's a right </v>

116
00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:53.564
<v Speaker 2>hemispheric function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that as you explore further </v>

117
00:05:56.181 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 2>that imaginative domain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

118
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.043
<v Speaker 2>which circumscribes what might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is constrained and constrained and </v>

119
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.404
<v Speaker 2>constrained and constrained until you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get what it actually is and that </v>

120
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 2>specialized in routinized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

121
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Does that seem like a reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about that as well</v>

122
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.850
<v Speaker 1>for a whole host of reasons?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

123
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.013
<v Speaker 1>one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned a defense and one of the </v>

124
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.993
<v Speaker 1>ideas behind my hypothesis is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right hemisphere is on the lookout for </v>

125
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.483
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

126
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the left hemisphere is looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for prey.</v>

127
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.150
<v Speaker 1>And this has been confirmed in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>

128
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.210
<v Speaker 1>have never heard that second part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amphibians and mammals.</v>

129
00:06:36.211 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

130
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

131
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.053
<v Speaker 1>so when you're in left hemispheric mode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more in Predator mode and when </v>

132
00:06:43.321 --> 00:06:45.060
<v Speaker 1>you'd wave home as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

133
00:06:45.061 --> 00:06:45.894
<v Speaker 1>of course we are not uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lizards or toads or marmosets or </v>

134
00:06:48.931 --> 00:06:50.330
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in animals,</v>

135
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.780
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the case getting and grasping.</v>

136
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.850
<v Speaker 1>And after all our left hemisphere is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>London.</v>

137
00:06:56.851 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 1>It controls the grasping hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his left hemisphere and uh,</v>

138
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.520
<v Speaker 1>exploring which you mentioned is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>right hemisphere.</v>

139
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.600
<v Speaker 1>And when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a frontal function is deficient,</v>

140
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people often go into sematic mode of the</v>

141
00:07:13.681 --> 00:07:18.170
<v Speaker 1>hand of that side and the left hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually explorer,</v>

142
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.250
<v Speaker 1>few emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless ones,</v>

143
00:07:20.251 --> 00:07:21.084
<v Speaker 1>but trying to explore the environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and with the right hand it's grasping </v>

144
00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:25.140
<v Speaker 1>pointlessly at things.</v>

145
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.131
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it were,</v>

146
00:07:26.131 --> 00:07:29.550
<v Speaker 1>the automatic thing is with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the left hand,</v>

147
00:07:29.551 --> 00:07:31.860
<v Speaker 1>the right hemisphere to explore with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right hand,</v>

148
00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:32.694
<v Speaker 1>the left hemisphere to grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you said exploratory and you </v>

149
00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:36.924
<v Speaker 1>said defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you said also opening up to </v>

150
00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:39.624
<v Speaker 1>possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are all aspects of the way the </v>

151
00:07:41.131 --> 00:07:41.964
<v Speaker 1>right hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often say the right hemisphere opens </v>

152
00:07:44.851 --> 00:07:45.684
<v Speaker 1>up to possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas the left hemisphere wants to </v>

153
00:07:47.281 --> 00:07:50.030
<v Speaker 1>close down to a certain team and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need both chaos,</v>

154
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:51.660
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and order.</v>

155
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.990
<v Speaker 1>And you knew I loved him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In your talk,</v>

156
00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:57.960
<v Speaker 1>you talked about um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

157
00:07:57.961 --> 00:07:58.794
<v Speaker 1>chaos and order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I may say so you've seemed maybe </v>

158
00:08:01.861 --> 00:08:02.694
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to gloss that a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seem to suggest that it would be </v>

159
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.540
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't get rid of chaos,</v>

160
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.120
<v Speaker 1>but you've seemed to imply that it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be better if we could,</v>

161
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.133
<v Speaker 1>whereas my view is it chaos and order </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary to one another and there is </v>

162
00:08:15.091 --> 00:08:17.220
<v Speaker 1>a proper sort of harmony</v>

163
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 2>well balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

164
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

165
00:08:19.261 --> 00:08:21.270
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That mean I think that's,</v>

166
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.880
<v Speaker 2>that's as deep a question as you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly ask.</v>

167
00:08:23.881 --> 00:08:24.714
<v Speaker 2>I would say in some sense some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say there's a central </v>

168
00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:31.140
<v Speaker 2>theological issue there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issue there is the,</v>

169
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in genesis the proper environment if </v>

170
00:08:34.141 --> 00:08:38.250
<v Speaker 2>humanity is construed as a garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I see that as the optimal balance</v>

171
00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:39.084
<v Speaker 2>of chaos and order because nature is </v>
<v Speaker 2>flourishes and it's prolific in his </v>

172
00:08:42.691 --> 00:08:43.524
<v Speaker 2>chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

173
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Then if you add harmony to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the garden.</v>

174
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.090
<v Speaker 2>So you live in the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to tend the garden.</v>

175
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now the garden is created.</v>

176
00:08:50.161 --> 00:08:53.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a walled space because eden is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wallet space.</v>

177
00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:54.960
<v Speaker 2>It's a pair of day side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a walled garden.</v>

178
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing is,</v>

179
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you make a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to keep what's outside out,</v>

180
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.850
<v Speaker 2>but you can't because the boundaries </v>
<v Speaker 2>between things are permeable.</v>

181
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to have reality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a bounded space,</v>

182
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a snake in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>garden.</v>

183
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Now then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell should you do about that?</v>

184
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:11.514
<v Speaker 2>Should we make the walls so high that no</v>
<v Speaker 2>snake can possibly get in or should or </v>

185
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 2>should you allow for the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes,</v>

186
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Speaker 2>but make yourself strong enough so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can contend with them?</v>

187
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.943
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an answer there that goes deep </v>

188
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:24.414
<v Speaker 2>to the question of even maybe why </v>
<v Speaker 2>theological question of why God allowed </v>

189
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 2>evil to exist in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

190
00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:31.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

191
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:32.423
<v Speaker 2>do you make people safe or strong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And strong is better and safe might not </v>

192
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 2>be commensurate with being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might not be possible to exist and to</v>

193
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:42.550
<v Speaker 2>be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

194
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.580
<v Speaker 2>so existence is predicated on the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we die.</v>

195
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Well was never safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's certainly bounded,</v>

196
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.111
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

197
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:49.944
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's inevitably wrapped up with </v>

198
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:54.960
<v Speaker 2>that sort of finitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this old,</v>

199
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a lovely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lovely Jewish id and ancient idea.</v>

200
00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:59.910
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most profound ideas I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever come across.</v>

201
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a kind of a Zen Koan and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here it is.</v>

202
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

203
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 2>so it's a question about the classic </v>
<v Speaker 2>attributes of God,</v>

204
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Omniscient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>omnipresent,</v>

205
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.403
<v Speaker 2>omnipotent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it being with those three </v>

206
00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:13.490
<v Speaker 2>attributes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lock,</v>

207
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.090
<v Speaker 2>what kind of question is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer is limitation.</v>

208
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.523
<v Speaker 2>And the second answer is that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>justification for being is that the </v>

209
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:25.080
<v Speaker 2>unlimited lacks the limited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

210
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:27.300
<v Speaker 2>And so because limited is us</v>

211
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:31.270
<v Speaker 1>for anything to come into existence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be an element of resistance.</v>

212
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:36.690
<v Speaker 1>And so things are never predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 1>one pole of what is always a dipo.</v>

213
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Everything is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has that,</v>

214
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diapers.</v>

215
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a prerequisite for being,</v>

216
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.210
<v Speaker 1>it is and it's imaged in the yen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yen idea.</v>

217
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.283
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me very important </v>

218
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.593
<v Speaker 1>because in our culture we often seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose that certain things are just </v>

219
00:10:52.361 --> 00:10:53.194
<v Speaker 1>good and other things are just about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be good if we could get rid of the </v>

220
00:10:55.691 --> 00:10:56.524
<v Speaker 1>bad ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually my pursuing certain good </v>

221
00:10:59.351 --> 00:11:01.450
<v Speaker 1>things that are good within measure too </v>
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>

222
00:11:01.451 --> 00:11:02.284
<v Speaker 1>they become bad and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's go back to her and normally </v>

223
00:11:05.321 --> 00:11:09.290
<v Speaker 1>thing because Ramachandran calls the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right hemisphere the anomaly detection.</v>

224
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:10.773
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that that's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important point because there are two </v>

225
00:11:13.571 --> 00:11:15.370
<v Speaker 1>ways you can react to an anomaly.</v>

226
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.473
<v Speaker 1>One is two and both have to be explored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is to try and prove that it's not </v>

227
00:11:21.011 --> 00:11:24.490
<v Speaker 1>really an anomaly and therefore you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry on with things as normal.</v>

228
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:28.780
<v Speaker 1>And the other is hopeful that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

229
00:11:28.781 --> 00:11:30.690
<v Speaker 1>that's the typical left hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>

230
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.270
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't want anything to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shift and quite reasonably,</v>

231
00:11:34.271 --> 00:11:37.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be chaotically </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifting if you're onto a good thing.</v>

232
00:11:37.241 --> 00:11:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Too stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

233
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.910
<v Speaker 1>That takes too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might actually be mistaken.</v>

234
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.380
<v Speaker 1>So in a way it's perfectly correct to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>wary,</v>

235
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's not correct to be so wary that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you blot out anomalies.</v>

236
00:11:51.161 --> 00:11:53.310
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm sure you know,</v>

237
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.483
<v Speaker 1>the left hemisphere simply blocks out </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that doesn't fit with it's </v>

238
00:11:57.701 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 1>cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't see it actually.</v>

239
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.334
<v Speaker 1>You're tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a hugely important element and </v>

240
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:04.084
<v Speaker 1>the right hemisphere going hang on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the maybe another way of thinking </v>

241
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:11.170
<v Speaker 1>that will accommodate this better and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually good science needs yes.</v>

242
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 1>To be skeptical about anomalies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise there'd be chaos,</v>

243
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.913
<v Speaker 1>but it also needs to be able to shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when an anomaly is really large </v>

244
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

245
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.340
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite a lot of them.</v>

246
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:22.810
<v Speaker 1>And they don't really fit very well </v>
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

247
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

248
00:12:24.081 --> 00:12:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>

249
00:12:25.231 --> 00:12:26.930
<v Speaker 2>there's another observation that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>

250
00:12:26.931 --> 00:12:28.820
<v Speaker 2>which I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved this observation.</v>

251
00:12:28.821 --> 00:12:32.360
<v Speaker 2>He was trying to account for radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality transformation,</v>

252
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.160
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so his idea was this,</v>

253
00:12:34.161 --> 00:12:35.060
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

254
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.210
<v Speaker 2>it's commensurate with the ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibition between the two hemispheres.</v>

255
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.313
<v Speaker 2>So let's imagine the left is habitually </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibiting the function of the right to </v>

256
00:12:43.251 --> 00:12:45.440
<v Speaker 2>keep fear under control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does that all sorts of ways,</v>

257
00:12:45.441 --> 00:12:46.274
<v Speaker 2>but so imagine that the right is I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>reacting to anomalies and it's </v>

258
00:12:51.261 --> 00:12:53.120
<v Speaker 2>aggregating them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

259
00:12:53.121 --> 00:12:53.954
<v Speaker 2>The left camp deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the right is aggregating anomalies </v>

260
00:12:56.121 --> 00:12:58.940
<v Speaker 2>and maybe that's starting to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself in nightmarish dreams.</v>

261
00:12:58.941 --> 00:13:01.100
<v Speaker 2>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all these anomalies are piling</v>

262
00:13:01.101 --> 00:13:01.934
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's indication that you're on shifting </v>

263
00:13:03.381 --> 00:13:04.214
<v Speaker 2>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also then imagine that the right </v>

264
00:13:06.231 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere aggregates normally is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it starts to detect patterns in the</v>

265
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:10.354
<v Speaker 2>anomalies and so now it starts to </v>
<v Speaker 2>generate what you might consider a </v>

266
00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 2>counter hypothesis to the left type </v>
<v Speaker 2>offices.</v>

267
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.333
<v Speaker 2>If that counter or hypothesis gets to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the point where the total sum in some </v>

268
00:13:20.811 --> 00:13:21.644
<v Speaker 2>sense of the anomalies plus the already </v>
<v Speaker 2>mapped territory can be mapped by that </v>

269
00:13:25.431 --> 00:13:28.700
<v Speaker 2>new pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then at some point it will shift and the</v>

270
00:13:28.701 --> 00:13:31.310
<v Speaker 2>person will kick into a new personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration.</v>

271
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Piagetian stage transition </v>
<v Speaker 2>except more dramatic.</v>

272
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.533
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what a Ph [inaudible] stage </v>

273
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.560
<v Speaker 1>physician is also like and subsumes both</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he galean uh oh fable.</v>

274
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.500
<v Speaker 1>The idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

275
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is opposed by something else,</v>

276
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.770
<v Speaker 1>but when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there is a synthesis,</v>

277
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not that one of them is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated,</v>

278
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.530
<v Speaker 1>they're both transformed and taken up </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the new hoe,</v>

279
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.543
<v Speaker 1>which embraces</v>

280
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.170
<v Speaker 2>before look like look like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition.</v>

281
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Here's a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

282
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:05.813
<v Speaker 2>when I read Thomas Kuhn and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading top piaget at the same time and </v>

283
00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I knew that piaget was aware of Kuhn's </v>
<v Speaker 2>work by the way end.</v>

284
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:11.963
<v Speaker 2>The problem I had with Kuehne and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation interpreters of coon is </v>

285
00:14:14.611 --> 00:14:17.600
<v Speaker 2>they don't seem to get something who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

286
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.190
<v Speaker 2>who interpret Kuhn has a moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>relativist in some sense.</v>

287
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.213
<v Speaker 2>They don't seem to get the idea of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increased generalized ability of a </v>

288
00:14:26.461 --> 00:14:29.700
<v Speaker 2>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say I have a theory and a bunch</v>

289
00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:30.534
<v Speaker 2>of anomalies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a crew and I have to wipe out the </v>

290
00:14:31.501 --> 00:14:32.334
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then I wipe out the theory and I </v>

291
00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:35.970
<v Speaker 2>incorporate the anomalies and now I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>another theory.</v>

292
00:14:35.971 --> 00:14:38.700
<v Speaker 2>So that's a descent into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my estimation.</v>

293
00:14:38.701 --> 00:14:41.430
<v Speaker 2>That's the old story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the anomaly,</v>

294
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.283
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disruption is the mythical descend into </v>

295
00:14:43.771 --> 00:14:44.604
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you reconfigure this theory </v>

296
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.650
<v Speaker 2>with the chaos and you come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better theory.</v>

297
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.813
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question,</v>

298
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.883
<v Speaker 2>why is it better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is what accounts for </v>

299
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:56.600
<v Speaker 2>everything that the previous theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accountants plus the anomalies.</v>

300
00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.790
<v Speaker 2>So there's progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

301
00:14:58.791 --> 00:14:59.624
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And but coon is often read is stating </v>

302
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 2>that there is no progress that you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's incommensurate paradigms and you</v>

303
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:07.670
<v Speaker 2>have to just shift between them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there isn't,</v>

304
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 2>there isn't cumulative knowledge in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

305
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:10.853
<v Speaker 1>Well I think one thing that when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably would both agree about is that </v>

306
00:15:14.101 --> 00:15:14.934
<v Speaker 1>we don't buy the story that you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>because nothing can be demonstrated </v>

307
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.050
<v Speaker 1>definitively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>utterly to be the case.</v>

308
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.093
<v Speaker 1>There is no truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think we both believe that </v>

309
00:15:28.111 --> 00:15:28.944
<v Speaker 1>there are truths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are true or than other </v>

310
00:15:30.481 --> 00:15:31.770
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And indeed,</v>

311
00:15:31.771 --> 00:15:34.960
<v Speaker 1>if we're where we couldn't even talk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

312
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:35.813
<v Speaker 1>if we did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even to say that there are no truth </v>

313
00:15:39.121 --> 00:15:41.110
<v Speaker 1>is itself a truth statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

314
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:41.993
<v Speaker 1>it's truer than the statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are truths so everybody </v>

315
00:15:44.281 --> 00:15:46.830
<v Speaker 1>automatically has truth whether they </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it or not.</v>

316
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just because you were you,</v>

317
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.280
<v Speaker 2>you said why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

318
00:15:50.281 --> 00:15:54.190
<v Speaker 2>it's not only that you can't talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't even see no,</v>

319
00:15:54.191 --> 00:15:55.024
<v Speaker 2>cause you don't know how to,</v>

320
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't know how to discriminate </v>
<v Speaker 1>what coming into your brain.</v>

321
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

322
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we would agree about that,</v>

323
00:16:03.791 --> 00:16:04.624
<v Speaker 1>but I think that there's maybe a slight </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of difference between us in the </v>

324
00:16:07.261 --> 00:16:10.860
<v Speaker 1>time I'm very willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

325
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.640
<v Speaker 1>embrace the idea of uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

326
00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I maybe wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you could expand on that,</v>

327
00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.840
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you come across as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a man who has certainties that</v>

328
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.510
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a peculiar kind of certainty.</v>

329
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm certain that standing on the border </v>
<v Speaker 2>between order and chaos is a good idea.</v>

330
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

331
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

332
00:16:33.321 --> 00:16:34.154
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you need to be in the sort of </v>

333
00:16:35.201 --> 00:16:37.080
<v Speaker 2>slightly unstable position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

334
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.770
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you have to be,</v>

335
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

336
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Encountering as much uncertainty as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can voluntarily tolerate?</v>

337
00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's equivalent to </v>

338
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:47.414
<v Speaker 2>Vygotsky's zone of proximal development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we talked a little bit earlier </v>

339
00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:52.970
<v Speaker 2>about the idea of an instinct for </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

340
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.100
<v Speaker 2>So I think what meaning is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

341
00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:55.934
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the elaborated form of the </v>

342
00:16:58.011 --> 00:17:01.280
<v Speaker 2>orienting reflex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what meaning does its function,</v>

343
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:04.220
<v Speaker 2>its biological function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is more real in some sense</v>

344
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:05.054
<v Speaker 2>than any other biological function is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you when you're in the place where </v>

345
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.613
<v Speaker 2>you've balanced the stability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say of your left hemisphere </v>

346
00:17:11.901 --> 00:17:15.230
<v Speaker 2>systems with the exploratory capacity of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your right.</v>

347
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.230
<v Speaker 2>So that not only are you master of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>domain,</v>

348
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.730
<v Speaker 2>but you're expanding that domain </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>

349
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:21.883
<v Speaker 2>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that when you're there and it's </v>

350
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:24.080
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

351
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:24.913
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of a metaphysical place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense that you're imbued with a </v>

352
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:28.934
<v Speaker 2>sense of meaning and purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's an indication that you've </v>

353
00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:32.840
<v Speaker 2>actually optimized your neurological </v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

354
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pimps,</v>

355
00:17:34.601 --> 00:17:37.570
<v Speaker 1>we could gloss the idea of purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's</v>

356
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.670
<v Speaker 1>a difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get very confused.</v>

357
00:17:42.671 --> 00:17:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I think about the idea of purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly</v>

358
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.133
<v Speaker 1>whether there's a problem that </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting there is a purpose and I </v>

359
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 1>believe there is a purpose or they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our purpose is to the cosmos.</v>

360
00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:01.671
<v Speaker 1>Not just to me and suggest that somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all been predetermined by God.</v>

361
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:06.060
<v Speaker 1>But this is to misunderstand the nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>

362
00:18:06.061 --> 00:18:06.894
<v Speaker 1>that there are time static slices and </v>
<v Speaker 1>God is there and he's sorted it all out </v>

363
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:10.524
<v Speaker 1>and the whole thing is just unfolding as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bergson says like ladies fan being </v>

364
00:18:13.981 --> 00:18:16.050
<v Speaker 1>unfurled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was extremely boring and,</v>

365
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:16.770
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

366
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.810
<v Speaker 1>and an entirely static and noncreative </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

367
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.280
<v Speaker 1>But actually something is at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are unfolding.</v>

368
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:27.630
<v Speaker 1>They have overall a direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually exactly what that direction</v>

369
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:32.220
<v Speaker 1>is isn't known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know it's a fool who says anything</v>

370
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:33.054
<v Speaker 1>positive about the nature of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not convinced that God is </v>

371
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.300
<v Speaker 1>omniscient and omnipotent either.</v>

372
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I think God is in the process of is </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming,</v>

373
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 1>God is not only just becoming but is </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming family.</v>

374
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.710
<v Speaker 1>So being and becoming more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming,</v>

375
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:51.443
<v Speaker 1>becoming as important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that it's also a </v>

376
00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 1>strange segue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not criticizing,</v>

377
00:18:57.061 --> 00:18:59.280
<v Speaker 1>but I'm curious what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what drove you to that conclusion?</v>

378
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.280
<v Speaker 1>An awful lot of thing is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

379
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that everything is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a process.</v>

380
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.010
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing a book called,</v>

381
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:08.844
<v Speaker 1>there are no things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are processes and there are </v>

382
00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:18.130
<v Speaker 1>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think music is so powerful.</v>

383
00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.053
<v Speaker 1>Music is one of the most mysterious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful things in the universe and I </v>

384
00:19:23.101 --> 00:19:26.250
<v Speaker 1>didn't think it was a tool foolish of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to have thought that the,</v>

385
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan a few motions were in a song.</v>

386
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:30.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

387
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.171
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

388
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.840
<v Speaker 1>It's the kind of music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is a very important insight.</v>

389
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:35.623
<v Speaker 1>Music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know I've said this in public </v>

390
00:19:37.201 --> 00:19:39.900
<v Speaker 1>lectures that music is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of the arts</v>

391
00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.420
<v Speaker 1>and music describes how those parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be arranged.</v>

392
00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:47.280
<v Speaker 1>You're using representative in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>

393
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:54.070
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you mean by</v>
<v Speaker 1>representing the ultimate reality of the</v>

394
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:57.130
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I would like to say presented in or</v>

395
00:19:57.131 --> 00:19:57.964
<v Speaker 1>that it's not representing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is actually when we're in the </v>

396
00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:03.330
<v Speaker 1>presence of music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something is coming into being,</v>

397
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:07.020
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is at the core of the whole cosmic</v>

398
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:10.140
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why people love music.</v>

399
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:11.003
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do and I mean I just hardly any </v>

400
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:16.230
<v Speaker 1>originality in the idea cause lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>visitors say this,</v>

401
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.333
<v Speaker 1>that the sort of the movement of atoms </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the movement of planets and so </v>

402
00:20:21.361 --> 00:20:22.480
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

403
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.210
<v Speaker 1>are more like a dance or more music than</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are like things bumping in track.</v>

404
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

405
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:28.643
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

406
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.513
<v Speaker 1>so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of things as patterns that people </v>

407
00:20:32.161 --> 00:20:32.994
<v Speaker 1>have made into tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you and tools and what the </v>

408
00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:37.920
<v Speaker 1>left hand is who is always looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always looking for something new to</v>

409
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:42.030
<v Speaker 1>grasp it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray phase processes that if you,</v>

410
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.953
<v Speaker 1>it's all a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single thing including the </v>

411
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>mountain behind my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you able to,</v>

412
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Speaker 1>which is billions of years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were able to take,</v>

413
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 1>as it were a series of like a time lapse</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>

414
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.750
<v Speaker 1>you'd see the thing morphing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing and flowing.</v>

415
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Everything flows as eric takes is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

416
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.573
<v Speaker 1>Everything flows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a question of over the time </v>

417
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:08.320
<v Speaker 1>period that you consider it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a question of the time.</v>

418
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.593
<v Speaker 1>And so taking time out of things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>considering them in the abstract you </v>

419
00:21:13.331 --> 00:21:14.164
<v Speaker 1>resonated from context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly from the flow and from the </v>

420
00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:18.850
<v Speaker 1>context of time changes them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

421
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.800
<v Speaker 1>And I think that what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

422
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:21.723
<v Speaker 1>in brief what Plato has done and what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the history of more recent </v>

423
00:21:24.941 --> 00:21:29.941
<v Speaker 1>Christianity has done is two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defy God and have an perfect states that</v>

424
00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:34.830
<v Speaker 1>are unaltered and torn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that it is an ever,</v>

425
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.303
<v Speaker 1>ever more wonderfully self</v>
<v Speaker 1>self exploring self actualizing process </v>

426
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.453
<v Speaker 1>that requires a degree of opposition as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a stream in order to have the movements </v>

427
00:21:50.701 --> 00:21:52.320
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

428
00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.810
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas and patterns in it.</v>

429
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.460
<v Speaker 1>It has to be constrained deck</v>

430
00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.773
<v Speaker 2>when I've experienced want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to describe these experiences </v>

431
00:22:01.271 --> 00:22:05.530
<v Speaker 2>but when I've contemplated death deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's his struck me as a,</v>

432
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:09.220
<v Speaker 2>as a fundamental repair mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's part of the mechanism by which</v>

433
00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:11.120
<v Speaker 2>new things that are better are brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>into being.</v>

434
00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.013
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean you see that in your own </v>

435
00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:16.840
<v Speaker 2>being because of course without death </v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't live because you're dying.</v>

436
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:17.763
<v Speaker 2>The things about you that aren't right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even at a physiological level are dying </v>

437
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:22.300
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are unfortunately,</v>

438
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:23.134
<v Speaker 2>you also completely die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which used to be a bit of the </v>

439
00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:28.480
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate side but more cosmically </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking.</v>

440
00:22:28.481 --> 00:22:33.250
<v Speaker 2>It does seem to me that death is the is</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno man,</v>

441
00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Speaker 2>I s it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had intuitions are intimations that</v>

442
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:39.220
<v Speaker 2>death is the friend of being and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

443
00:22:39.221 --> 00:22:41.330
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to get my head around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pete,</v>

444
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.240
<v Speaker 1>do you agree with you and indeed that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being said by the many,</v>

445
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:49.320
<v Speaker 1>many ways of people then than myself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even the yourself.</v>

446
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I think that that's right,</v>

447
00:22:53.671 --> 00:22:54.504
<v Speaker 1>that death is predicated on life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that it shouldn't be seen as a </v>

448
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.480
<v Speaker 1>sort of something that's the negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

449
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a necessary stage in the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

450
00:23:07.201 --> 00:23:12.150
<v Speaker 1>becoming what it is and since everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>is ramified since nothing,</v>

451
00:23:12.151 --> 00:23:14.830
<v Speaker 1>it's just isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I may look or feel as though,</v>

452
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
<v Speaker 1>but as you often eloquently say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all have the history and we,</v>

453
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.820
<v Speaker 1>we have in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we come from a place,</v>

454
00:23:23.821 --> 00:23:26.220
<v Speaker 1>but also as a culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have history.</v>

455
00:23:26.221 --> 00:23:29.430
<v Speaker 1>We can't detach ourselves from it were </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressions of it,</v>

456
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.473
<v Speaker 1>but we're also inevitably dependent as </v>
<v Speaker 1>all organisms are on the environment </v>

457
00:23:34.561 --> 00:23:37.550
<v Speaker 1>where I end and where the quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment begins is,</v>

458
00:23:37.551 --> 00:23:38.384
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like the word environment </v>

459
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:40.283
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would suggest something that's </v>

460
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.170
<v Speaker 1>always been born whereas environments </v>
<v Speaker 1>around me from which I'm separate.</v>

461
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that is connected supposed to.</v>

462
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.273
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

463
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.233
<v Speaker 2>So I would see us as like an idiot in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stream or like a wave in the seed that </v>

464
00:23:54.231 --> 00:23:59.231
<v Speaker 2>he was never separate</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coming together of physics with,</v>

465
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.220
<v Speaker 2>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a process philosophy,</v>

466
00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.360
<v Speaker 2>a very strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when does that book come out?</v>

467
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.700
<v Speaker 2>When I finished writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm very worried that um,</v>

468
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 2>it's getting bigger and is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

469
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:13.994
<v Speaker 2>all the time I'm writing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing more and more of things that </v>

470
00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 2>I am really must get to know more about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an ever receding.</v>

471
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's a danger of a book that I know</v>

472
00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:25.203
<v Speaker 2>that aims at something fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>because every run you never hit the </v>

473
00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:30.520
<v Speaker 2>proper boundaries as it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need that war.</v>

474
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:33.913
<v Speaker 2>I also had experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say when I was trying to </v>

475
00:24:36.711 --> 00:24:38.780
<v Speaker 2>understand as they're imaginative </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

476
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:41.750
<v Speaker 2>when I was trying to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say the necessity of evil.</v>

477
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:42.973
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's also a fundamental </v>

478
00:24:44.331 --> 00:24:47.360
<v Speaker 2>theological conundrum and a metaphysical</v>
<v Speaker 2>conundrum.</v>

479
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why isn't that being as constituted such</v>

480
00:24:50.181 --> 00:24:52.010
<v Speaker 2>that evil is allowed to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

481
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:56.390
<v Speaker 2>It's Ivan Carrabba's Arvs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What critique of our valley,</v>

482
00:24:56.391 --> 00:25:00.650
<v Speaker 2>Osha's Christianity essentially what </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of God would allow for this sort of</v>

483
00:25:00.651 --> 00:25:02.080
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ancient question.</v>

484
00:25:02.081 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an ancient question and I mean,</v>

485
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.720
<v Speaker 2>part of what I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've,</v>

486
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean I thought about the adversarial </v>
<v Speaker 2>element to that,</v>

487
00:25:08.331 --> 00:25:10.700
<v Speaker 2>which is that you need to challenge </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't,</v>

488
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:11.683
<v Speaker 2>you're not forced to bring forth what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could bring forth without a </v>

489
00:25:14.871 --> 00:25:17.810
<v Speaker 2>challenge and the greater the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to bring forth,</v>

490
00:25:17.811 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 2>the greater of the challenge has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you need an adversary,</v>

491
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.523
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

492
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.800
<v Speaker 2>But then I also thought that it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's possible that that,</v>

493
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:28.063
<v Speaker 2>that being being requires limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say optimal being requires </v>

494
00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.510
<v Speaker 2>sprite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free choice.</v>

495
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm going through a lot of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

496
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Free choice requires the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction between good and evil.</v>

497
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Without that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have choice.</v>

498
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe it's possible to set up a world</v>

499
00:25:42.171 --> 00:25:45.290
<v Speaker 2>where evil is a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where it isn't something that has to</v>

500
00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:46.580
<v Speaker 2>be manifest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:47.414
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's an option open to you and a </v>

502
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:49.214
<v Speaker 2>real option and it has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the challenge that was presented to </v>

503
00:25:51.771 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something that you can not,</v>

504
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 2>you can not move towards if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you,</v>

505
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:57.494
<v Speaker 2>so desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that seems to me to be something </v>

506
00:25:59.451 --> 00:26:00.284
<v Speaker 2>like the eth ethical requirement that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the fundamental ethical </v>

507
00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:06.740
<v Speaker 2>requirement to avoid evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.</v>

508
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

509
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:09.830
<v Speaker 2>it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't.</v>

510
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:10.723
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an I,</v>

511
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:15.770
<v Speaker 2>I under one could recount it as the need</v>
<v Speaker 2>for otherness.</v>

512
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.760
<v Speaker 2>It goad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>need something other and that other,</v>

513
00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:22.940
<v Speaker 2>if it's not going to be just part of God</v>
<v Speaker 2>has got to be free,</v>

514
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.240
<v Speaker 2>otherwise we'll be no creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

515
00:26:25.241 --> 00:26:25.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

516
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.130
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature that there is something other</v>

517
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.930
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than God.</v>

518
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.393
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may in the end come from and come </v>

519
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 2>back to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

520
00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:37.304
<v Speaker 2>That God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that divine essence or that </v>

521
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.693
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a wonderful thing I can't </v>

522
00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:43.430
<v Speaker 2>figure out either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in,</v>

523
00:26:43.431 --> 00:26:46.220
<v Speaker 2>in the Christian idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the end of time where the,</v>

524
00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:47.163
<v Speaker 2>the evil is separated from God forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think about that as a </v>

525
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.510
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

526
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.530
<v Speaker 2>you might think if it's a form of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagined,</v>

527
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.460
<v Speaker 2>it's a form of perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a form of striving for perfection.</v>

528
00:26:59.461 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 2>You fragment yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you challenge yourself,</v>

529
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 2>throw what's not worthy into the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lasting,</v>

530
00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:06.650
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what it,</v>

531
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.513
<v Speaker 2>what you end up with retained as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than what you started with </v>

532
00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:11.310
<v Speaker 2>through the trials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

533
00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.393
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds a bit like the dialectical </v>

534
00:27:13.751 --> 00:27:18.751
<v Speaker 1>process that we've been talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have alluded to a couple of very</v>

535
00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:20.280
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

536
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

537
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:27.040
<v Speaker 1>myths and there's one in the [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kavala,</v>

538
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the creation,</v>

539
00:27:29.471 --> 00:27:30.840
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know if you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

540
00:27:30.841 --> 00:27:34.170
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely river thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

541
00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:39.210
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that the primary being and </v>
<v Speaker 1>is off the ground of all being,</v>

542
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:45.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs something other to come into being</v>

543
00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:51.510
<v Speaker 1>the creation and that creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that ends off do?</v>

544
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:55.330
<v Speaker 1>It was this his first act as it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch out your hand and make something</v>

545
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.450
<v Speaker 1>not a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first act is to withdraw,</v>

546
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:02.980
<v Speaker 1>to create a place in which the canvas </v>
<v Speaker 1>something other than dance off.</v>

547
00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.870
<v Speaker 1>And so the first stage is called Sim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solomon as it sounds negative,</v>

548
00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:13.050
<v Speaker 1>as so many creative things do withdraw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in that space the uh,</v>

549
00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.253
<v Speaker 1>vessels and a spark comes out of ames </v>
<v Speaker 1>off and falls into the vessels and they </v>

550
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:18.984
<v Speaker 1>will shatter.</v>

551
00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:24.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's called a chef a how can</v>
<v Speaker 1>you write?</v>

552
00:28:25.271 --> 00:28:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there is the third stage repair</v>

553
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.650
<v Speaker 1>in which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

554
00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:34.930
<v Speaker 1>what has just been fragmented is </v>
<v Speaker 1>restored into something greater.</v>

555
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.410
<v Speaker 1>And so this process carries on and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my terms,</v>

556
00:28:38.411 --> 00:28:41.290
<v Speaker 1>very light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens with the hemisphere.</v>

557
00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.980
<v Speaker 1>The right hemisphere is the one that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>first accepting.</v>

558
00:28:44.981 --> 00:28:49.450
<v Speaker 1>It is sort of actively receptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can put it that way too.</v>

559
00:28:49.451 --> 00:28:50.284
<v Speaker 1>Whatever is new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about Algorithm </v>

560
00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Goldberg and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

561
00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.573
<v Speaker 1>and then whatever that is is then sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of processed by the left hemisphere at </v>

562
00:28:58.301 --> 00:28:59.134
<v Speaker 1>the next stage into categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's bit of that and try to </v>

563
00:29:02.261 --> 00:29:04.000
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course,</v>

564
00:29:04.001 --> 00:29:04.834
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much bigger than any of the </v>

565
00:29:05.861 --> 00:29:06.694
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they all break down and it gets </v>

566
00:29:08.741 --> 00:29:11.230
<v Speaker 1>restored and the right hemisphere into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new hole.</v>

567
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

568
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:13.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to comb the repair,</v>

569
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:15.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

570
00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Tiq Mti candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I need the,</v>

571
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.100
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of</v>

572
00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:26.050
<v Speaker 1>easy way of thinking about it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning a piece of music.</v>

573
00:29:26.051 --> 00:29:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Your first of all attracted to it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

574
00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:28.863
<v Speaker 1>You then realize that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice that piece at Bar 28 and you </v>

575
00:29:32.021 --> 00:29:33.160
<v Speaker 1>realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

576
00:29:33.161 --> 00:29:33.550
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

577
00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.383

<v Speaker 1>there's a return to the dominant or </v>

578
00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:37.480
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

582
00:29:44.711 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 1>it's just that it's no longer present.</v>

583
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.833
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
