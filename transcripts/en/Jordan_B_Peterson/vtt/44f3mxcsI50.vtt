1
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to read you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get some,</v>

2
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of mail and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I got this.</v>

3
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:27.031
<v Speaker 1>I have been a lot of different places in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last week and this showed up at one </v>

4
00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:30.970
<v Speaker 1>of them and I'm going to read it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what to make of it.</v>

5
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.160
<v Speaker 1>It's written in a female hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's about all I can tell,</v>

6
00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:43.780
<v Speaker 1>but there's no address or name on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a question,</v>

7
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.580
<v Speaker 1>but a comment or more accurately perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>a message.</v>

8
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 1>I spent this past weekend in an Iowaska </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceremony,</v>

9
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>which for those of you who don't know is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a South American visionary plant </v>

10
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.170
<v Speaker 1>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you may roll your eyes at this,</v>

11
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>but IOWASCA brings you into direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with the archetypal realm of </v>

12
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.310
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Users of this medicine initiates,</v>

13
00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:17.311
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>refer to Iowasca as she because the </v>

14
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:21.931
<v Speaker 1>spirit of the plant is decidedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine and encounter with Iowasca is </v>

15
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:23.440
<v Speaker 1>an encounter with the great mother of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation,</v>

16
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Speaker 1>the goddess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the void from which all things come.</v>

17
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>The Feminine counterpart of Logos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson,</v>

18
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.650
<v Speaker 1>you appeared in one of my Osca visions.</v>

19
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

20
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Might account for why have been rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>fatigued late.</v>

21
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You appeared in one of my Iowasca </v>

22
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>visions and I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked her,</v>

23
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.410
<v Speaker 1>who is Jordan Peterson?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is he doing that which is something</v>

24
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:05.411
<v Speaker 1>I'd really like to know as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she responded with Kristalina </v>

25
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 1>clarity quote here he is here to invoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>and initiate the divine masculine </v>

26
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:15.740
<v Speaker 1>principle on earth at this time.</v>

27
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

28
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.050
<v Speaker 1>So I'm up here to thank you deeply and </v>
<v Speaker 1>profoundly on behalf of the great mother</v>

29
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.460
<v Speaker 1>herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goddess,</v>

30
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:36.461
<v Speaker 1>the divine feminine principle who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been eagerly awaiting the awakening of </v>

31
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:40.130
<v Speaker 1>the masculine principle into divinity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and service.</v>

32
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.770
<v Speaker 1>get a letter like that every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually I get a letter to like that </v>

34
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:53.321
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know what went through my head </v>

35
00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 1>when I read this and this is of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely crazy,</v>

36
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.860
<v Speaker 1>but we know one of the things I learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do as a psychotherapist was just to </v>

37
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>tell people who were talking to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what came into my head,</v>

38
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

39
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Because that's not exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

40
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>you know what comes into your head is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more like a dream.</v>

41
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>It comes unbidden and it's like your </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

42
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.180
<v Speaker 1>If you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be like a voluntary </v>

43
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.180
<v Speaker 1>element of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

44
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of who God only knows how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

45
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:26.310
<v Speaker 1>but it.</v>

46
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>It seems partly voluntary at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you only thought about it,</v>

47
00:03:31.941 --> 00:03:36.941
<v Speaker 1>Carl young thought about it like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue between the conscious mind and </v>

48
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a constant continual dialogue,</v>

49
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:42.871
<v Speaker 1>but when things just pop into your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not much different than walking </v>

50
00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>into a room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having something there,</v>

51
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>which is an observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also derived from young by the way,</v>

52
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:52.441
<v Speaker 1>because he pointed out quite rightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people don't really think that </v>

53
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.600
<v Speaker 1>thoughts appear to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can think because you can take </v>

54
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.751
<v Speaker 1>the thoughts that appear to you and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can subject them to criticism and </v>

55
00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>elaboration and so on instead of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that they're true right off the</v>

56
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people often don't do that.</v>

57
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:09.601
<v Speaker 1>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something just pops into their head and </v>

58
00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>then they assume that it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

59
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:15.091
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I tend to do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy is just to tell people </v>

60
00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>what pops into my head because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

61
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

62
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Because then the person that is talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me gets one person's untrammeled </v>

63
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even that reaction,</v>

64
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 1>not opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really an opinion.</v>

65
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think an opinion maybe is what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think later.</v>

66
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.840
<v Speaker 1>And there's this personal flavor to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What popped into my head was this story </v>

67
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>about socrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.080
<v Speaker 1>he had this when he was being put on </v>
<v Speaker 1>trial by the Athenians for corrupting </v>

69
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.821
<v Speaker 1>the nation's youth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something I've been accused of by the </v>

70
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:57.151
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's not self evident to me </v>

71
00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 1>that it's me doing the corrupting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>he said that somebody had asked him </v>
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>

73
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>had asked the delphic oracle once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the delphic oracle was this retreat that</v>

74
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:11.620
<v Speaker 1>you could go to if you were an ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek citizen and you'd,</v>

75
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.160
<v Speaker 1>you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be there and you'd have a dream </v>

76
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.160
<v Speaker 1>and then you'd go ask the delphic oracle</v>
<v Speaker 1>to interpret it.</v>

77
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 1>And nobody really knows what was up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the delphic oracle today,</v>

78
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:25.591
<v Speaker 1>how that worked exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she would interpret your dream in </v>

79
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:28.891
<v Speaker 1>any case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somebody wants to ask her who the </v>

80
00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:33.391
<v Speaker 1>wisest man in Greece was and the delphic</v>
<v Speaker 1>oracle said it was socrates because he </v>

81
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:36.970
<v Speaker 1>knew he didn't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially the story that popped</v>

82
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:39.490
<v Speaker 1>into my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy comparison.</v>

83
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:44.491
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a crazy wine so I guess that's </v>

84
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:47.671
<v Speaker 1>how it works out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now one of the things I'm going to do</v>

85
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:52.861
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I haven't done before because I'm </v>

86
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:56.401
<v Speaker 1>going to read you a little bit of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you I finished my book last week </v>

87
00:05:56.401 --> 00:05:57.610
<v Speaker 1>and I haven't read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read to anyone.</v>

88
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.190
<v Speaker 3>I have given it to a couple of friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>to review a one person in particular,</v>

89
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 3>a screenwriter named Gregg Hurwitz has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been unbelievably helpful.</v>

90
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:13.001
<v Speaker 3>He's so fast and so sharp at this sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of thing and I can send him like a 20 </v>

91
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:18.461
<v Speaker 3>page dense 20 page manuscript and he'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>rip it to shreds and send it back to me </v>

92
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 3>and like 90 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just unbelievable.</v>

93
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 3>He's so good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been very helpful,</v>

94
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:28.091
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one else has seen it depart from my </v>

95
00:06:28.091 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 3>editor and I haven't read it to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

96
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 3>But some of it seemed particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate for tonight's lecture,</v>

97
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 3>so I thought I would start the lecture </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight by reading a little bit of it,</v>

98
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 3>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's from a chapter.</v>

99
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 3>It's on the issue of sacrifice as such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Abraham and Isaac.</v>

100
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 3>This is a very strange old testament </v>
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

101
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

102
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.490
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the stories that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>contained in the old testament that </v>

103
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.631
<v Speaker 3>makes modern people think that maybe we </v>
<v Speaker 3>should just not have that much to do </v>

104
00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 3>with the old testament per say it at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

105
00:06:56.511 --> 00:07:01.511
<v Speaker 3>and especially with regards and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't have anything to do with the </v>

106
00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 3>god of the Old Testament either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I mean,</v>

107
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:07.211
<v Speaker 3>as far as Abraham is concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God tells him to sacrifice his own son.</v>

108
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 3>Now it turns out that God was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>kidding,</v>

109
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

110
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously being flippant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does raise the question,</v>

111
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 3>what do you make of a divine being?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who would,</v>

112
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 3>who would require such thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>such a thing?</v>

113
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:27.581
<v Speaker 3>Or conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you make of Abraham who would </v>

114
00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 3>have such delusions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either way,</v>

115
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.860
<v Speaker 3>it's a little hard on the what would you</v>
<v Speaker 3>call modern believability and moral </v>

116
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 3>integrity of the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these are very,</v>

117
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 3>very strange storks and they're not what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they seem to be or they are,</v>

118
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 3>but they're more so.</v>

119
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.700
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice tonight and here's some of the</v>

120
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 3>things that I've been thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice.</v>

121
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.480
<v Speaker 3>So this is from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This book is called 12 rules for life,</v>

122
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.050
<v Speaker 3>an antidote for chaos and it's coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>out in January,</v>

123
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.280
<v Speaker 3>which I think I mentioned and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>from rule seven,</v>

124
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.940
<v Speaker 3>which is do what is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not what is expedient.</v>

125
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.870
<v Speaker 3>And so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's some of the writing I've been </v>

126
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 3>doing over the last three years on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the Motif of sacrifice.</v>

127
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 3>I'll start with just a brief intro </v>
<v Speaker 3>before I read this.</v>

128
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:25.810
<v Speaker 3>It took me a long time to understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>what was meant in the Old Testament by </v>

129
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice and which is strange because </v>
<v Speaker 3>once I figured it out,</v>

130
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 3>it seemed bloody obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemed like,</v>

131
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 3>oh y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously that's what it means,</v>

132
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 3>but lots of times if you figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>something out correctly,</v>

133
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 3>it seems self evident as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured it out correctly.</v>

134
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll see how that goes,</v>

135
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:42.710
<v Speaker 3>but it seemed to work for me anyways.</v>

136
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 3>I knew that of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least implicitly I knew of the modern</v>

137
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:55.661
<v Speaker 3>usage of the idea of sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone understands that Motif is that </v>

138
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 3>if you want to make things better in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>

139
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.650
<v Speaker 3>then you make sacrifices in the present </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you even do that </v>

140
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 3>multi-generationally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

141
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 3>you most definitely do if you're a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>parent.</v>

142
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's I would say that's really </v>

143
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.610
<v Speaker 3>particularly typical of of of immigrants</v>
<v Speaker 3>because immigrants often come from </v>

144
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.700
<v Speaker 3>terrible places and have to undergo </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible things to come to a new </v>

145
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.451
<v Speaker 3>community where they get a rough </v>
<v Speaker 3>reception and have a hard time getting </v>

146
00:09:26.451 --> 00:09:30.111
<v Speaker 3>their life going and a big part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason that they do it is to make their </v>

147
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:33.450
<v Speaker 3>lives of their children better and </v>
<v Speaker 3>luckily when they come to Canada,</v>

148
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.480
<v Speaker 3>usually given where they came from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually works because where they </v>

149
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.060
<v Speaker 3>came from is worse and here is better.</v>

150
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 3>Even though you know immigrants often </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to struggle to to get on their feet</v>

151
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:48.741
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to learn a new language and </v>

152
00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:50.151
<v Speaker 3>becoming culturated and face the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're not part of the mainstream </v>

153
00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 3>culture and well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

154
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:55.430
<v Speaker 3>many of you know the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the idea that you make sacrifices for</v>

155
00:09:55.861 --> 00:10:00.861
<v Speaker 3>the future and you make sacrifices for </v>
<v Speaker 3>your children and that's everyone </v>

156
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:05.031
<v Speaker 3>understands that and it's part of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible and mature and shouldering </v>

157
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:09.030
<v Speaker 3>the burden of being properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you do that for yourself too.</v>

158
00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:10.680
<v Speaker 3>If you're disciplined in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

159
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:15.681
<v Speaker 3>that's almost what discipline means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That discipline means that you're </v>

160
00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 3>capable of making sacrifices because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not disciplined.</v>

161
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:22.251
<v Speaker 3>If you just do something you want more </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than something that you're doing </v>

162
00:10:22.251 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 3>that's not disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's maybe that works then great.</v>

163
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 3>If your life is working out that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great man,</v>

164
00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:27.210
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't.</v>

165
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:32.300
<v Speaker 3>That isn't disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is plan is when you want to do </v>

166
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Speaker 3>something right now and instead you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

167
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to forestall my gratification.</v>

168
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:40.670
<v Speaker 3>Maybe forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but certainly for a very long period of </v>

169
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 3>tar medium to long period of time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you concentrate on something that you </v>

170
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.270
<v Speaker 3>think will bear fruit in the medium to </v>
<v Speaker 3>long run,</v>

171
00:10:45.271 --> 00:10:50.271
<v Speaker 3>and so you'll look into the future and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you decide that by making today a little</v>

172
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:56.301
<v Speaker 3>less impulsively pleasurable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shall we say you'll make tomorrow a </v>

173
00:10:56.301 --> 00:10:59.160
<v Speaker 3>little bit more secure and productive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you actually do it too.</v>

174
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.270
<v Speaker 3>And that's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

175
00:11:01.271 --> 00:11:06.271
<v Speaker 3>and we discussed last week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam and Eve's discovery of the future </v>

176
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.520
<v Speaker 3>and the revelation of the possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future,</v>

177
00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:16.090
<v Speaker 3>including the possibility of tragedy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering in the future.</v>

178
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:21.150
<v Speaker 3>And it's our knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of tragedy and suffering in </v>

179
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.801
<v Speaker 3>the future that motivates us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice in the present so that we can </v>

180
00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:29.760
<v Speaker 3>reduce the unnecessary anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncertainty and pain that awaits us.</v>

181
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.500
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a negative way of putting it.</v>

182
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.940
<v Speaker 3>We're also doing it so that we can have </v>
<v Speaker 3>some joy and we can make life better and</v>

183
00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:36.690
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

184
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 3>and that's not trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fundamental issue,</v>

185
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:45.141
<v Speaker 3>especially once you have small children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fundamental issue is to stave the </v>

186
00:11:45.141 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 3>suffering the hell off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

187
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:49.980
<v Speaker 3>That's what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your primary moral obligation.</v>

188
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 3>If you're a person who has any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your eyes are open at all,</v>

189
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:59.101
<v Speaker 3>that's your primary obligation and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you make the sacrifices that are </v>

190
00:11:59.101 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 3>necessary and you set up the future and </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

191
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:07.090
<v Speaker 3>the the Motif of sacrifice is there in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Old Testament,</v>

192
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.870
<v Speaker 3>but it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so concrete that it's difficult to </v>

193
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:13.480
<v Speaker 3>draw a parallel between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least for me,</v>

194
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:18.481
<v Speaker 3>they didn't align self evidently and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't remember in my rather limited </v>

195
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:24.390
<v Speaker 3>religious education as a child in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United Church because I went to the </v>

196
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 3>United Church till I was about 13.</v>

197
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:31.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't ever remember anybody pointing </v>
<v Speaker 3>out that the sacrifices that can enable,</v>

198
00:12:32.341 --> 00:12:37.341
<v Speaker 3>we're making or the sacrifice that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham was supposed to make or the </v>

199
00:12:37.341 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices that people were making to </v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

200
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:44.310
<v Speaker 3>We're the call were the precursors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say the dramatic precursors to the</v>

201
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:50.941
<v Speaker 3>psychological idea of sacrifice that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>all hold as civilized people in the </v>

202
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:55.630
<v Speaker 3>modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So although it seems obvious,</v>

203
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.220
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you lay it out,</v>

204
00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember that ever being </v>
<v Speaker 3>explained to me,</v>

205
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:00.390
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

206
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then let me read this.</v>

207
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:04.960
<v Speaker 3>So now that I sort of introduced it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what happened.</v>

208
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.800
<v Speaker 3>As humanity developed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first we're the endless tens or hundreds</v>

209
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:15.871
<v Speaker 3>of thousands of years prior to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emergence of written history and drama,</v>

210
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.960
<v Speaker 3>the twin practices of delay and exchange</v>
<v Speaker 3>began to emerge slowly and painfully.</v>

211
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.720
<v Speaker 3>So here's a cool psychological study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's called the marshmallow test and </v>

212
00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:30.670
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's even a reliable study.</v>

213
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Even though it was done by social </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologists,</v>

214
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.080
<v Speaker 3>it's probably replicable and it's a nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>study.</v>

215
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.560
<v Speaker 3>So you take small children and you bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>them into a room and you put something </v>

216
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:49.230
<v Speaker 3>that they would like in front of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a marshmallow and you then you torture </v>

217
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:54.331
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically you say see that marshmallow </v>

218
00:13:54.331 --> 00:13:57.511
<v Speaker 3>and the things I see that marshmallow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can have that marshmallow </v>

219
00:13:58.031 --> 00:14:03.031
<v Speaker 3>right now or if you wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the experiment is 10 minutes.</v>

220
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Then you can have two marshmallows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that puts the child in quite a </v>

221
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.580
<v Speaker 3>conundrum because they're being asked to</v>
<v Speaker 3>trade in actual concrete,</v>

222
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:17.610
<v Speaker 3>tangible marshmallow for two </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothetical future marshmallows and </v>

223
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 3>it's not that easy to conjure up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothetical future reality that has the</v>

224
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:27.721
<v Speaker 3>same tangible significance as something </v>
<v Speaker 3>real right in front of you.</v>

225
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.460
<v Speaker 3>And so it's amazing thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do that.</v>

226
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.640
<v Speaker 3>And so then the experimenter leaves and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some children's grabbed the marshmallow </v>

227
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.570
<v Speaker 3>and just chomp that thing down right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

228
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.500
<v Speaker 3>Other kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they videotaped kids while they're </v>

229
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.320
<v Speaker 3>waiting and they do all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They whistled,</v>

230
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:46.570
<v Speaker 3>they look at the ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sit on their hands,</v>

231
00:14:46.571 --> 00:14:48.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they try to distract themselves.</v>

232
00:14:48.311 --> 00:14:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Course they're eyeing that marshmallow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a squirrel lying and not and,</v>

233
00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 3>and trying to restrain themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

234
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.460
<v Speaker 3>what I see in that is that the child's </v>
<v Speaker 3>prefrontal Cortex,</v>

235
00:15:01.461 --> 00:15:06.461
<v Speaker 3>the higher cortical systems are warring </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the underlying motivational </v>

236
00:15:06.461 --> 00:15:10.871
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more primordial motivational systems </v>

237
00:15:10.871 --> 00:15:10.970
<v Speaker 3>that govern such things as hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hunger system,</v>

238
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:14.960
<v Speaker 3>hypothalamic system says there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>something sweet and fat,</v>

239
00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sitting there,</v>

240
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 3>right bloody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now grab that thing and stuff it down.</v>

241
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure many of you have a constant</v>

242
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:26.351
<v Speaker 3>battle with your hypothalamus with </v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to sweet and fat things and </v>

243
00:15:26.351 --> 00:15:29.960
<v Speaker 3>often lose so you can feel some sympathy</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the child,</v>

244
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:35.230
<v Speaker 3>but the hypothalamus has these </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendously powerful tendrils upward </v>

245
00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:41.081
<v Speaker 3>into the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the parts that we would associate </v>

246
00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:44.051
<v Speaker 3>more with voluntary control and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>voluntary control centers have these </v>

247
00:15:44.051 --> 00:15:47.891
<v Speaker 3>little weak ribbons going down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>control the hypothalamus since it's </v>

248
00:15:47.891 --> 00:15:50.780
<v Speaker 3>pretty obvious if you know something </v>
<v Speaker 3>about neuroanatomy,</v>

249
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.540
<v Speaker 3>what part is actually in charge when the</v>
<v Speaker 3>chips are down,</v>

250
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.840
<v Speaker 3>and it's not easy for children to learn </v>
<v Speaker 3>to regulate those underlying primordial </v>

251
00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.150
<v Speaker 3>impulses.</v>

252
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.210
<v Speaker 3>The ones that are wired in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones that we share with animals,</v>

253
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.220
<v Speaker 3>but they do it and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

254
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.150
<v Speaker 3>and the cool thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what Walter Michelle found.</v>

255
00:16:08.151 --> 00:16:13.151
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy who did the study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that the longterm outcome for the </v>

256
00:16:13.151 --> 00:16:17.951
<v Speaker 3>children who can delay gratification in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the marshmallow test is much more </v>

257
00:16:17.951 --> 00:16:21.191
<v Speaker 3>positive than it is for the children </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are impulsive and eat the </v>

258
00:16:21.191 --> 00:16:23.960
<v Speaker 3>marshmallow instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's delay of gratification.</v>

259
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:27.980
<v Speaker 3>Now it's likely that that's associated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with trait conscientiousness,</v>

260
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:32.981
<v Speaker 3>although that specifically has that </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific connection has not yet been </v>

261
00:16:32.981 --> 00:16:35.150
<v Speaker 3>established,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they seem conceptually very,</v>

262
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:37.020
<v Speaker 3>very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

263
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.500
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>

264
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.770
<v Speaker 3>this emerges in children probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the ages of two and four,</v>

265
00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:50.771
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should have it in place by four </v>

266
00:16:50.771 --> 00:16:53.390
<v Speaker 3>because it's very difficult for them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>really interact well with other children</v>

267
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:56.840
<v Speaker 3>without having that delay of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gratification in place because you can't</v>

268
00:16:56.841 --> 00:16:57.650
<v Speaker 3>delay gratification.</v>

269
00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.010
<v Speaker 3>Other kids don't like you because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

270
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.880
<v Speaker 3>you want everything your way and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want it now and you're,</v>

271
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.180
<v Speaker 3>you're liable to temper tantrums and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing.</v>

272
00:17:05.181 --> 00:17:08.330
<v Speaker 3>You haven't got to kind of self control </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary to make you fun to play with.</v>

273
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:11.810
<v Speaker 3>So you can see that emerging in children</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's pretty.</v>

274
00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:14.240
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>

275
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.500
<v Speaker 3>if it emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it predicts positive longterm outcomes,</v>

276
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.690
<v Speaker 3>just like trait conscientiousness does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

277
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:25.691
<v Speaker 3>because trait conscientiousness is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>second best predictor of longterm </v>

278
00:17:25.691 --> 00:17:27.410
<v Speaker 3>success over the lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In Western cultures,</v>

279
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 3>it's second after intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so in our societies,</v>

280
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.910
<v Speaker 3>the people who do best across time are </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who have high iqs and who </v>

281
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.300
<v Speaker 3>work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would say that's a pretty decent,</v>

282
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:43.430
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a validation in some sense that our</v>

283
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:46.160
<v Speaker 3>cultures are working properly because </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you would want,</v>

284
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 3>I would say if the system is working </v>
<v Speaker 3>meritocratic</v>

285
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Lee like it should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're trying to extract </v>

286
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.520
<v Speaker 1>resources from those who can contribute </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a higher rate than what you would </v>

287
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.240
<v Speaker 1>want to have happen is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardworking,</v>

288
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.060
<v Speaker 1>smart people do better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>

289
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:05.910
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everyone does better hopefully</v>

290
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.680
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can see this developing in </v>

291
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.320
<v Speaker 1>children first worthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>endless tens or hundreds of thousands of</v>

292
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:18.321
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prior to the emergence of written </v>

293
00:18:18.321 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 1>history and drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the twin practices of delay and exchange</v>

294
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.230
<v Speaker 1>began to emerge slowly and painfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hadn't.</v>

295
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:27.231
<v Speaker 1>They became represented in metaphorical </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction as rituals and tales of </v>

296
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:29.490
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

297
00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:33.510
<v Speaker 1>if there's a powerful figure in the sky </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's judging you,</v>

298
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.510
<v Speaker 1>you better keep them happy or look the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell out.</v>

299
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 1>We've been watching ourselves deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him for a long time.</v>

300
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.650
<v Speaker 1>He seems to like it when you give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you value,</v>

301
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.530
<v Speaker 1>so practice sharing and sacrificing </v>
<v Speaker 1>until you get good at it.</v>

302
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.720
<v Speaker 1>No one actually said any of this so long</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

303
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.750
<v Speaker 1>although they said something very </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar,</v>

304
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.880
<v Speaker 1>but it was implicit in the practice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then in the stories action comes first.</v>

305
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Implicit comes first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People watched the successful succeed </v>

306
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 1>and the unsuccessful fail for thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thousands of years and we thought it</v>

307
00:19:14.281 --> 00:19:19.281
<v Speaker 1>over and we drew a conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The successful among us sacrifice,</v>

308
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:23.280
<v Speaker 1>the successful among us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delay gratification,</v>

309
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.470
<v Speaker 1>the successful among us bargain with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

310
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:34.170
<v Speaker 1>and then a great idea begins to emerge </v>
<v Speaker 1>in evermore articulated form.</v>

311
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.040
<v Speaker 1>That idea is the point of a long and </v>
<v Speaker 1>profound story.</v>

312
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:46.490
<v Speaker 1>It's the moral of this story and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to engage in some foreshadowing </v>

313
00:19:47.281 --> 00:19:52.281
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference between the </v>

314
00:19:52.281 --> 00:19:55.281
<v Speaker 1>successful and the unsuccessful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The successful sacrifice and things get </v>

315
00:19:56.911 --> 00:20:00.900
<v Speaker 1>better as the successful practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are sacrifices.</v>

316
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.950
<v Speaker 1>The question becomes increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>precise and simultaneously broader.</v>

317
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.680
<v Speaker 1>What is the greatest possible sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the greatest possible?</v>

318
00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

319
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.510
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you push a question in section,</v>

320
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.840
<v Speaker 1>perhaps there comes a time when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't formulate it any more precisely </v>

321
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.110
<v Speaker 1>and broadly and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

322
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:26.780
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

323
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the point at which the question </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

324
00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps even the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question becomes archetipal,</v>

325
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:36.070
<v Speaker 1>it becomes archetipal because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't be bested and,</v>

326
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.640
<v Speaker 1>and this is like an ultimate question in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

327
00:20:38.641 --> 00:20:41.910
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to ask a more broad </v>
<v Speaker 1>based question than that?</v>

328
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.420
<v Speaker 1>What is given the initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions that you have to make </v>

329
00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.301
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the logical end point to that is </v>

330
00:20:50.301 --> 00:20:50.301
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

331
00:20:50.301 --> 00:20:53.731
<v Speaker 1>if you have to make a sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the greatest possible sacrifice and </v>

332
00:20:53.731 --> 00:20:55.450
<v Speaker 1>for the greatest possible good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a good question.</v>

333
00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.930
<v Speaker 1>The answer becomes increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>profound.</v>

334
00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:05.030
<v Speaker 1>The God of Western tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like so many gods requires sacrifice.</v>

335
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:10.230
<v Speaker 1>We've already examined why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes he goes even further and </v>

336
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.300
<v Speaker 1>requires the sacrifice of what is love </v>
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

337
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:19.530
<v Speaker 1>This is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is another one of mankind's </v>

338
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.730
<v Speaker 1>fundamental discoveries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes things do not go well,</v>

339
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.960
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that self evident,</v>

340
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:32.110
<v Speaker 1>but here's the rub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when things are not going </v>

341
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's precisely that which is most </v>

342
00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:36.890
<v Speaker 1>valued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the cause,</v>

343
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.720
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because the world is revealed </v>

344
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.780
<v Speaker 1>through the template of your values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the world you are seeing is not the </v>

345
00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.531
<v Speaker 1>world you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore it's time to examine your </v>

346
00:21:51.531 --> 00:21:55.371
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time to rid yourself of your </v>

347
00:21:55.371 --> 00:21:58.640
<v Speaker 1>current presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a famous experiment that I've </v>

348
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.570
<v Speaker 1>alluded to a couple of times I believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this lecture series,</v>

349
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.520
<v Speaker 1>the invisible gorilla experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the invisible gorilla experiment,</v>

350
00:22:05.521 --> 00:22:09.990
<v Speaker 1>there's two teams of players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each with three members,</v>

351
00:22:09.991 --> 00:22:12.120
<v Speaker 1>one dressed in black and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>dressed in white,</v>

352
00:22:12.121 --> 00:22:17.121
<v Speaker 1>and each team is passing the basketball </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth to the team members and </v>

353
00:22:17.121 --> 00:22:21.030
<v Speaker 1>milling about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see a video of them doing so.</v>

354
00:22:21.031 --> 00:22:26.031
<v Speaker 1>They've basically filled the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen and the white team is passing a </v>

355
00:22:26.031 --> 00:22:29.961
<v Speaker 1>basketball to the white team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Members in the block team is passing a </v>

356
00:22:29.961 --> 00:22:32.520
<v Speaker 1>basketball to the black team members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your job as,</v>

357
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:37.790
<v Speaker 1>as far as the experimenter is concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is for you to count the number of times </v>

358
00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.540
<v Speaker 1>that the black black team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

359
00:22:39.541 --> 00:22:42.300
<v Speaker 1>black team passes the basketball back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and forth.</v>

360
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.300
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you have an ambition and a name </v>

361
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.050
<v Speaker 1>and a value and they ambition and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aim and the value,</v>

362
00:22:49.051 --> 00:22:52.080
<v Speaker 1>they're all the same thing and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to perform well at the task.</v>

363
00:22:52.081 --> 00:22:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing that's so cool about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is really so cool,</v>

364
00:22:55.111 --> 00:23:00.111
<v Speaker 1>it's just unbelievably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just unbelievable that this is the </v>

365
00:23:00.111 --> 00:23:02.430
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a complete validation of,</v>

366
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.530
<v Speaker 1>of a certain element of the Buddhist </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview.</v>

367
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:11.180
<v Speaker 1>So they pass the ball for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and then the experimenter says </v>

368
00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:11.370
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many?</v>

369
00:23:11.371 --> 00:23:16.371
<v Speaker 1>And you say 15 and [inaudible] you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy and you're happy with yourself </v>

370
00:23:16.371 --> 00:23:16.371
<v Speaker 1>because you've been paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

371
00:23:16.371 --> 00:23:17.610
<v Speaker 1>and the experimenter says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

372
00:23:17.611 --> 00:23:18.810
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe not.</v>

373
00:23:18.811 --> 00:23:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you missed one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the experimenter says,</v>

374
00:23:21.481 --> 00:23:24.360
<v Speaker 1>did you see the gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And half of you say,</v>

375
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.740
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

376
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.590
<v Speaker 1>what gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like really?</v>

377
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:33.980
<v Speaker 1>And he and the experimenter says yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he rewinds it and plays the </v>

378
00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.551
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like a minute and a half into the </v>

379
00:23:37.551 --> 00:23:37.551
<v Speaker 1>three minute video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure enough,</v>

380
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:42.650
<v Speaker 1>in walks this guy in a gorilla suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six foot three or so stands in the </v>

381
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.950
<v Speaker 1>middle of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the middle of the game,</v>

382
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:51.490
<v Speaker 3>the same size as the players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly obviously evident beats his </v>

383
00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:57.461
<v Speaker 3>chest for like a second and a half and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then sorta saunders off and half the </v>

384
00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:01.400
<v Speaker 3>people who watched the video don't see </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gorilla,</v>

385
00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:07.850
<v Speaker 3>which is absolutely shocking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what that means is that your </v>

386
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:08.540
<v Speaker 3>ambitions blind you to the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

387
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:14.770
<v Speaker 3>Now they eliminate some reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they blind you to most of it and </v>

388
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.840
<v Speaker 3>that's fine because you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of you.</v>

389
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:22.841
<v Speaker 3>In some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're very pinpoint thing like a laser </v>

390
00:24:22.841 --> 00:24:23.780
<v Speaker 3>beam and so you just can't be attending </v>
<v Speaker 3>to everything all the time.</v>

391
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:29.530
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that you might ask</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself once you know that is that if </v>

392
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.951
<v Speaker 3>you're suffering dreadfully than one </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility is that you're so fixed on </v>

393
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.900
<v Speaker 3>the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're so fixed on a point.</v>

394
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:42.130
<v Speaker 3>The fact that you're so fixed on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point that you're fixed on might be </v>

395
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 3>integrally related to why things are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going so catastrophic it wrong.</v>

396
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Now perhaps not because you know there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of arbitrary ness about life and </v>

397
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.720
<v Speaker 3>perhaps you suffer even when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>deserve to.</v>

398
00:24:53.721 --> 00:24:56.090
<v Speaker 3>That seems to happen in the book of Job </v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

399
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.240
<v Speaker 3>because job is a good guy and God has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bet with Satan,</v>

400
00:24:59.241 --> 00:25:04.241
<v Speaker 3>which seems like another relatively </v>
<v Speaker 3>nasty thing to do to let's say just </v>

401
00:25:04.241 --> 00:25:07.721
<v Speaker 3>torture him and he does quite nicely to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see if he'll turn against God and it </v>

402
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.910
<v Speaker 3>seems like a rather playground sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing for God to engage in.</v>

403
00:25:13.911 --> 00:25:18.500
<v Speaker 3>But the point is is that even in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>document like the Old Testament,</v>

404
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:23.501
<v Speaker 3>there's ample suggestion that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>people just get wiped out and hurt even </v>

405
00:25:24.741 --> 00:25:28.790
<v Speaker 3>if they're living good moral lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aiming properly and all that.</v>

406
00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:33.110
<v Speaker 3>There's an arbitrary this in life that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not radical,</v>

407
00:25:33.111 --> 00:25:38.111
<v Speaker 3>but it's possible that it's what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinging to that's hurting you and it's </v>

408
00:25:40.161 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 3>even possible.</v>

409
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.790
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that you're clinging to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hardest that's hurting you the most.</v>

410
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.820
<v Speaker 3>That could easily be someone you love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like lots of times I see people in </v>

411
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.331
<v Speaker 3>therapy and they're miserable for one </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason or another and sometimes it's </v>

412
00:25:52.331 --> 00:25:56.081
<v Speaker 3>because they have a very close </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with a family member and </v>

413
00:25:56.081 --> 00:25:56.960
<v Speaker 3>that just isn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

414
00:25:56.961 --> 00:26:01.961
<v Speaker 3>the family member for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 3>simplicity we'll say is not really </v>

415
00:26:02.601 --> 00:26:05.120
<v Speaker 3>oriented towards helping them have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good life.</v>

416
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.540
<v Speaker 3>The family member is instead oriented </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards making them as bloody miserable </v>

417
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.780
<v Speaker 3>as you can possibly make anyone and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you say?</v>

418
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Exploiting the bond between family </v>
<v Speaker 3>members in order to enable that and then</v>

419
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:26.830
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the sacrifice that's necessary</v>
<v Speaker 3>is either merely distancing yourself </v>

420
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:33.821
<v Speaker 3>from that person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes substantively and sometimes </v>

421
00:26:33.821 --> 00:26:38.290
<v Speaker 3>seriously distancing yourself from like </v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't talk anymore ever and so that's</v>

422
00:26:39.801 --> 00:26:42.110
<v Speaker 3>pretty damn rough and it hurts and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that,</v>

423
00:26:42.111 --> 00:26:43.890
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

424
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:49.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a good example of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in order to extract yourself </v>

425
00:26:51.211 --> 00:26:54.690
<v Speaker 1>from the miserable bit of chaos that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to be in meshed in.</v>

426
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.300
<v Speaker 1>You have to let go of what you love </v>
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

427
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.470
<v Speaker 1>If the world you are seeing is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world you want,</v>

428
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 1>therefore it's time to examine your </v>
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>

429
00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.170
<v Speaker 1>That's really worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really worth thinking about,</v>

430
00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:12.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the alternative is to curse </v>

431
00:27:12.171 --> 00:27:12.171
<v Speaker 1>fate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

432
00:27:12.171 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Because if it isn't you and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing you can do to change,</v>

433
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.910
<v Speaker 1>there isn't something you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

434
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Then it's fate itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the world itself.</v>

435
00:27:17.911 --> 00:27:20.570
<v Speaker 1>It's other people let's say because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a huge part of the world or it's</v>

436
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:25.580
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the world itself or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's God himself in whatever form you</v>

437
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:31.070
<v Speaker 1>either believe in or don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's fundamentally all the same </v>

438
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 1>in this situation that I'm describing.</v>

439
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:37.460
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's really </v>

440
00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.291
<v Speaker 1>interesting and I mentioned this before </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Israelites in the Old </v>

441
00:27:39.291 --> 00:27:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they got this right.</v>

442
00:27:40.051 --> 00:27:45.051
<v Speaker 1>It's really something because what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to the Israelites over and over </v>

443
00:27:45.051 --> 00:27:49.041
<v Speaker 1>in the Old Testament is that they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>all puffed up about how wonderful they </v>

444
00:27:49.041 --> 00:27:53.391
<v Speaker 1>are and then they make moral errors </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're arrogant and then God </v>

445
00:27:53.391 --> 00:27:57.381
<v Speaker 1>comes along and just cuts them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces for like generation after </v>

446
00:27:57.381 --> 00:28:00.981
<v Speaker 1>generation and they wobble back to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet and they always maintain the same </v>

447
00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:03.780
<v Speaker 1>attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is we did something wrong.</v>

448
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.070
<v Speaker 1>We did something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's like,</v>

449
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like an axiom rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation is that if we're not,</v>

450
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.940
<v Speaker 1>if things are not laying themselves out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for us as they should be,</v>

451
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:20.150
<v Speaker 1>then we cannot curse God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to look to ourselves while and </v>

452
00:28:20.491 --> 00:28:20.970
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

453
00:28:20.971 --> 00:28:21.720
<v Speaker 1>why not curse?</v>

454
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.600
<v Speaker 1>God knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's his fault.</v>

455
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that I've tried to figure out</v>

456
00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.250
<v Speaker 1>over the last 30 years is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

457
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:37.251
<v Speaker 1>why not just curse God?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there is this arbitrary element </v>

458
00:28:37.251 --> 00:28:40.581
<v Speaker 1>to existence and we are vulnerable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is plenty of suffering and things </v>

459
00:28:40.581 --> 00:28:41.760
<v Speaker 1>are unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's problems,</v>

460
00:28:41.761 --> 00:28:43.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's injustice and unfairness and all</v>

461
00:28:43.741 --> 00:28:45.750
<v Speaker 1>of these things and an endless </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

462
00:28:45.751 --> 00:28:50.520
<v Speaker 1>so why not just laid at the feet of God </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whether God exists or not.</v>

463
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:51.990
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

464
00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.950
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the metaphysics of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular discussion is not relevant.</v>

465
00:28:55.951 --> 00:29:00.951
<v Speaker 1>It's the point remains the same either </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and the answer is as far as I can </v>

466
00:29:00.951 --> 00:29:05.811
<v Speaker 1>tell that if you refuse to take on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility yourself and you </v>

467
00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:11.391
<v Speaker 1>attempted to lay it at the feet of </v>
<v Speaker 1>either society or being itself,</v>

468
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.680
<v Speaker 1>then you instantly start to act in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes everything much worse,</v>

469
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:21.980
<v Speaker 1>not only for you but for everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even for being itself and so </v>

470
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

471
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:27.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you decide that it's you,</v>

472
00:29:27.511 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 1>you've got the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's not even true,</v>

473
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:34.911
<v Speaker 1>like maybe you are someone who's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>tortured by the bet between God and </v>

474
00:29:34.911 --> 00:29:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Satan and like too bad for you if that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to be the case,</v>

475
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.470
<v Speaker 1>but it still seems to be the appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing</v>

476
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.040
<v Speaker 3>for a human being who's standing on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>or her own two feet in a proper manner </v>

477
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:54.150
<v Speaker 3>to take the responsibility on for </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves regardless of the counter </v>

478
00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.920
<v Speaker 3>arguments that might be made against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really something.</v>

479
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.690
<v Speaker 3>It's time to rid yourself of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>current presuppositions.</v>

480
00:30:01.691 --> 00:30:03.700
<v Speaker 3>I also think of that it's a deadwood </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

481
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:08.701
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you see with motifs </v>

482
00:30:08.701 --> 00:30:11.431
<v Speaker 3>like the pair of the Phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember when Harry Potter goes off to </v>

483
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:13.480
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like St George.</v>

484
00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 3>He goes off to fight the hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that thing,</v>

485
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:18.400
<v Speaker 3>the bast list that turns you to stone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at it,</v>

486
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:20.290
<v Speaker 3>it's a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For all intents and purposes,</v>

487
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:21.740
<v Speaker 3>it's guarding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Avert a virgin for.</v>

488
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.040
<v Speaker 3>What's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For just not Virginia.</v>

489
00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:26.520
<v Speaker 3>It's close to that though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ginny.</v>

490
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.970
<v Speaker 3>Ginny Ginevra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

491
00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Which is a variant of virgin and very </v>
<v Speaker 3>introvert,</v>

492
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

493
00:30:31.781 --> 00:30:36.640
<v Speaker 3>when he gets bitten by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the dragon and poisoned,</v>

494
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.890
<v Speaker 3>that's the dragon of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

495
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.170
<v Speaker 3>The thing that turns you to stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at it,</v>

496
00:30:41.171 --> 00:30:45.340
<v Speaker 3>when he gets bitten by it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he's going to die and yeah,</v>

497
00:30:45.341 --> 00:30:50.341
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get bitten by the thing that </v>

498
00:30:50.341 --> 00:30:50.341
<v Speaker 3>turns you to stone when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it bites you,</v>

499
00:30:50.341 --> 00:30:50.920
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not dead,</v>

500
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:52.600
<v Speaker 3>you're going to wish you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the two,</v>

501
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:58.100
<v Speaker 3>and then the phoenix flies in and cries </v>
<v Speaker 3>tears into the wound and that heals </v>

502
00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.350
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Phoenix is the thing that allows</v>

503
00:30:59.351 --> 00:31:04.300
<v Speaker 3>the dead wood to burn off occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

504
00:31:04.301 --> 00:31:04.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

505
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:09.601
<v Speaker 3>I think it's once every hundred years </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the Phoenix and of course it's </v>

506
00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:12.331
<v Speaker 3>pretty dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole damn bird has to go up in </v>

507
00:31:12.331 --> 00:31:12.331
<v Speaker 3>flames and then there's nothing left but</v>
<v Speaker 3>an egg.</v>

508
00:31:12.331 --> 00:31:14.110
<v Speaker 3>But there's a very serious message there</v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

509
00:31:14.111 --> 00:31:19.111
<v Speaker 3>which is that you can compare yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>in some sense to a forest fire,</v>

510
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.520
<v Speaker 3>to a forest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

511
00:31:20.521 --> 00:31:21.910
<v Speaker 3>in a forest has to burn now.</v>

512
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:26.910
<v Speaker 3>And then for the deadwood to clear so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the forest can actually maintain </v>

513
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.841
<v Speaker 3>its continued existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you stop the forest from burning </v>

514
00:31:30.841 --> 00:31:32.680
<v Speaker 3>for a prolonged period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which happened in the United States when</v>

515
00:31:32.681 --> 00:31:34.960
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to manage the forest </v>
<v Speaker 3>fires too tightly,</v>

516
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:40.230
<v Speaker 3>then all that happens is the dead would </v>
<v Speaker 3>accumulate and accumulate and </v>

517
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:43.411
<v Speaker 3>accumulates and accumulates and </v>
<v Speaker 3>accumulates until the whole damn forest </v>

518
00:31:43.411 --> 00:31:45.310
<v Speaker 3>is dead wood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then lightning hits it and it burned</v>

519
00:31:45.311 --> 00:31:49.450
<v Speaker 3>so hot that it burns the topsoil off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's nothing left.</v>

520
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.300
<v Speaker 3>Nothing grows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a good moral lesson,</v>

521
00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:55.270
<v Speaker 3>which is don't wait too long to let the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dam did,</v>

522
00:31:55.271 --> 00:31:56.600
<v Speaker 3>would burn off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

523
00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:01.770
<v Speaker 3>maybe a little self immolation on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>daily basis might be preferable to </v>

524
00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.880
<v Speaker 3>burning yourself all the way down to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bedrock,</v>

525
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once every 20 years or so.</v>

526
00:32:05.831 --> 00:32:10.831
<v Speaker 3>Because maybe there won't be anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>left of you when you do that and you </v>

527
00:32:10.831 --> 00:32:11.130
<v Speaker 3>know that happens to people all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

528
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.390
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that happen to people many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times.</v>

529
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.180
<v Speaker 3>The deadwood accumulates the mess around</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

530
00:32:16.181 --> 00:32:18.940
<v Speaker 3>gathers the chaos that they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealt with accumulates.</v>

531
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:24.150
<v Speaker 3>And then one day the spark comes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they burned so far and so fast that </v>

532
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough left of them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>recover.</v>

533
00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:28.480
<v Speaker 3>And then they're the people who've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>eaten by the beast.</v>

534
00:32:28.481 --> 00:32:30.860
<v Speaker 3>They are the people who've been eaten by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Dragon.</v>

535
00:32:30.861 --> 00:32:34.210
<v Speaker 3>And now we're inside its belly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another very common architectural motif.</v>

536
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:39.540
<v Speaker 3>And while maybe a hero will come along </v>
<v Speaker 3>and rescue them or maybe they'll just </v>

537
00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:40.490
<v Speaker 3>stay in there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a precursor</v>

538
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:45.490
<v Speaker 1>to the idea of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not something I would </v>

539
00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:48.011
<v Speaker 1>recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a little medicine on a regular basis </v>

540
00:32:48.011 --> 00:32:49.580
<v Speaker 1>is a lot better too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then total emulation.</v>

541
00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm on terms other than your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>sporadically.</v>

542
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.540
<v Speaker 1>It's time to rid yourself of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>current presuppositions.</v>

543
00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.510
<v Speaker 1>There's another thing that</v>

544
00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.570
<v Speaker 1>see in the Soviet Union went </v>
<v Speaker 1>solzhenitsyn,</v>

545
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.790
<v Speaker 1>wrote about the Soviet Union and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologies.</v>

546
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:12.490
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of peaked in terms of it's </v>

547
00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.831
<v Speaker 1>pathological authoritarianism when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>became illegal to complain that your </v>

548
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:18.850
<v Speaker 1>life wasn't going well and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about how horrible that Esa.</v>

549
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Because because you know lots of times </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're isn't going well,</v>

550
00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.520
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean this in some casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

551
00:33:25.521 --> 00:33:26.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

552
00:33:26.721 --> 00:33:31.721
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have diabetes in your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're gonna lose your feet or </v>

553
00:33:31.721 --> 00:33:35.891
<v Speaker 1>something like it's really not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing trivial that's going on </v>

554
00:33:35.891 --> 00:33:36.170
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something is not good.</v>

555
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it's economic or maybe you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployed or,</v>

556
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.440
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you see the idea of the Soviet Union</v>

557
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:43.820
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

558
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.720
<v Speaker 1>we already have all the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's perfect already.</v>

559
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what totalitarians think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

560
00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:54.770
<v Speaker 1>if everything's perfect and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

561
00:33:55.490 --> 00:34:00.490
<v Speaker 1>then well maybe there's something wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you because everything is perfect </v>

562
00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:00.770
<v Speaker 1>after all.</v>

563
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.930
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a suffering then and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you gonna come out and say,</v>

564
00:34:02.931 --> 00:34:03.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm suffering.</v>

565
00:34:03.681 --> 00:34:08.681
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then your evidence that things </v>

566
00:34:08.681 --> 00:34:08.681
<v Speaker 1>aren't perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

567
00:34:08.681 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 1>You're a widow or an orphan in an old </v>
<v Speaker 1>testament story,</v>

568
00:34:10.851 --> 00:34:13.160
<v Speaker 1>you know when the Kings got too high and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mighty,</v>

569
00:34:13.161 --> 00:34:15.920
<v Speaker 1>then they wouldn't pay enough attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the widows and the orphans,</v>

570
00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:17.390
<v Speaker 1>and then the profit would come along and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

571
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:22.990
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those widows and orphans a lot more </v>

572
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:25.991
<v Speaker 1>important than you think they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't pay attention to them </v>

573
00:34:25.991 --> 00:34:28.301
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then things are going to fall apart </v>

574
00:34:28.301 --> 00:34:30.881
<v Speaker 1>around you in a way that you just can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even imagine and so well then you're </v>

575
00:34:30.881 --> 00:34:31.480
<v Speaker 1>sort of like your own widow in your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>orphaned,</v>

576
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:32.690
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

577
00:34:32.691 --> 00:34:37.691
<v Speaker 1>you know things aren't perfect yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm actually having still quite </v>

578
00:34:37.691 --> 00:34:40.841
<v Speaker 1>a rough time here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to admit to your own </v>

579
00:34:40.841 --> 00:34:44.171
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't admit to your own </v>

580
00:34:44.171 --> 00:34:46.130
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you certainly see the suffering,</v>

581
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:51.850
<v Speaker 1>especially the additional suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The excess suffering should be treated </v>

582
00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:53.990
<v Speaker 1>as evidence that you're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something quite right yet.</v>

583
00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:58.170
<v Speaker 1>It should be treated as evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

584
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:01.500
<v Speaker 1>There's something important that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that's wrong.</v>

585
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:06.680
<v Speaker 1>I understand how harsh that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that everyone who is </v>

586
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.091
<v Speaker 1>suffering is suffering because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something in some simple way </v>

587
00:35:11.091 --> 00:35:13.200
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in an elevator once in a hospital.</v>

588
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:18.610
<v Speaker 1>It was a very terrifying thing and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person got on who was just in an </v>

589
00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:19.070
<v Speaker 1>absolute state of shock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

590
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really not good and I don't </v>

591
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.880
<v Speaker 1>remember how this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I engaged the person in conversation</v>

592
00:35:26.881 --> 00:35:31.881
<v Speaker 1>and they just said that they had just </v>
<v Speaker 1>been diagnosed with what looked to be </v>

593
00:35:31.881 --> 00:35:32.380
<v Speaker 1>terminal cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

594
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.650
<v Speaker 1>what was horrifying about it was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were doing was going over life</v>

595
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.680
<v Speaker 1>in the elevator trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they had done in order to deserve </v>

596
00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:42.680
<v Speaker 1>such a fate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

597
00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.910
<v Speaker 1>they immediately taken it on themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a moral failing.</v>

598
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's not what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't come up to someone who has </v>

599
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.910
<v Speaker 1>cancer and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

600
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:51.990
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't such a bloody idiot </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout your whole life,</v>

601
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:53.280
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>

602
00:35:53.281 --> 00:35:58.281
<v Speaker 1>that happens a lot more than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people who have diseases like that </v>

603
00:35:58.281 --> 00:35:58.680
<v Speaker 1>get blamed for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm saying.</v>

604
00:35:58.681 --> 00:35:59.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

605
00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:00.670
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

606
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a more generalized attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is that if life isn't yet what it </v>

607
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.870
<v Speaker 1>should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have a response.</v>

608
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.270
<v Speaker 1>You have a primary responsibility to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it,</v>

609
00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:14.271
<v Speaker 1>and the place to start looking is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own errors and to fix them.</v>

610
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

611
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.100
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a safe bet man,</v>

612
00:36:20.101 --> 00:36:25.101
<v Speaker 1>because you're probably doing some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you wouldn't have to be </v>

613
00:36:25.101 --> 00:36:25.410
<v Speaker 1>doing that if you fixed would make </v>
<v Speaker 1>things better.</v>

614
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:31.070
<v Speaker 1>So it's time to let go and to sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are for who you could become.</v>

615
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:49.990
<v Speaker 1>There's an old story about how to catch </v>
<v Speaker 1>a monkey in case any of you are </v>

616
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:54.760
<v Speaker 1>interested in how to catch a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're now you're going to know how </v>

617
00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.670
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First you have to take a large,</v>

618
00:36:55.910 --> 00:37:00.910
<v Speaker 1>narrow neck jar just large enough in </v>
<v Speaker 1>diameter at the top for a monkey to put </v>

619
00:37:01.371 --> 00:37:06.371
<v Speaker 1>his hand inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to fill it partway with </v>

620
00:37:06.371 --> 00:37:08.951
<v Speaker 1>rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's too heavy for the monkey to </v>

621
00:37:08.951 --> 00:37:10.721
<v Speaker 1>carry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you scatter some treats near the </v>

622
00:37:10.721 --> 00:37:12.680
<v Speaker 1>jar to attract them and you put some </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside inside the narrow neck jar.</v>

623
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:18.170
<v Speaker 1>A monkey will come along if you're lucky</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grabbed the goodies,</v>

624
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.290
<v Speaker 1>but he'll want the ones inside the jar </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

625
00:37:21.291 --> 00:37:24.590
<v Speaker 1>So then put his hand in there and grab </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in there.</v>

626
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.020
<v Speaker 1>And if you've set up your monkey trap </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

627
00:37:27.021 --> 00:37:31.820
<v Speaker 1>then he won't be able to get his hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>out because he's got the goodies.</v>

628
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Not Without unclenching his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not without relinquishing what he </v>

629
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:42.661
<v Speaker 1>already has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The monkey coucher can just walk over </v>

630
00:37:42.661 --> 00:37:45.691
<v Speaker 1>and just pick up the monkey because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey isn't into the whole sacrifice </v>

631
00:37:46.361 --> 00:37:48.700
<v Speaker 1>thing because he's just a monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

632
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.780
<v Speaker 1>And so you can catch him as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of his own.</v>

633
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:57.990
<v Speaker 1>An regulated hypothalamic desires to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say,</v>

634
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.880
<v Speaker 1>charitable to the Monkey if you put out </v>
<v Speaker 1>candy or something like that.</v>

635
00:38:03.881 --> 00:38:05.500
<v Speaker 1>So like how often does a monkey get </v>
<v Speaker 1>candy?</v>

636
00:38:05.501 --> 00:38:08.440
<v Speaker 1>He's probably a little more motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you are to not let go.</v>

637
00:38:08.441 --> 00:38:12.910
<v Speaker 1>But you can get the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The monkey catcher can just walk over to</v>

638
00:38:12.911 --> 00:38:17.911
<v Speaker 1>the jar and pick up the monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animal will not sacrifice the part </v>

639
00:38:17.911 --> 00:38:18.730
<v Speaker 1>for the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a pretty good phrase.</v>

640
00:38:18.731 --> 00:38:23.731
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the animal that will not sacrifice </v>

641
00:38:23.731 --> 00:38:26.371
<v Speaker 1>the part for the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps this story is apocryphal,</v>

642
00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.620
<v Speaker 1>but as an eccentric psychology professor</v>
<v Speaker 1>once told me,</v>

643
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:34.960
<v Speaker 1>fiction lies to you in the most truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the most truthful possible manner,</v>

644
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 1>something valuable given up ensures </v>
<v Speaker 1>future prosperity,</v>

645
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.590
<v Speaker 1>something valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed,</v>

646
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 1>pleases the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are equivalent statements.</v>

647
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:47.620
<v Speaker 1>One's more articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

648
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:52.621
<v Speaker 1>That's the first statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the second one is more dramatic and </v>

649
00:38:52.621 --> 00:38:52.930
<v Speaker 1>more embedded in a collective religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>

650
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:57.931
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's most valuable and best </v>

651
00:38:57.931 --> 00:38:57.931
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

652
00:38:57.931 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 1>obviously that depends on the culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the time.</v>

653
00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:04.260
<v Speaker 1>What is it least emblematic of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A choice cut of meat.</v>

654
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a herdsman,</v>

655
00:39:05.371 --> 00:39:07.110
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a big deal.</v>

656
00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:08.130
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

657
00:39:08.131 --> 00:39:09.900
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout human history,</v>

658
00:39:09.901 --> 00:39:12.480
<v Speaker 1>meat has been a very valuable commodity </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it is.</v>

659
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.770
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among chimpanzees.</v>

660
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzees hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like to hunt colobus monkeys and </v>

661
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.641
<v Speaker 1>you know they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll basically start eating the damn </v>

662
00:39:22.641 --> 00:39:25.041
<v Speaker 1>monkey lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weigh about 40 pounds despite the </v>

663
00:39:25.041 --> 00:39:28.371
<v Speaker 1>fact that the thing is screaming away </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty interesting because </v>

664
00:39:28.371 --> 00:39:30.960
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that indicates is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>male monkeys that mail chimp's,</v>

665
00:39:30.961 --> 00:39:35.961
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones that do the hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't really inhibited that much when </v>

666
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:41.150
<v Speaker 1>they're in your mode by what you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe as empathy and there's certain </v>

667
00:39:41.341 --> 00:39:43.830
<v Speaker 1>elements of human behavior that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reminiscent of that.</v>

668
00:39:43.831 --> 00:39:48.831
<v Speaker 1>You see that sort of thing have merged </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and then in human battlefields when </v>

669
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:53.930
<v Speaker 1>groups of men seem to abandoned all </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal regulation whatsoever to a </v>

670
00:39:55.831 --> 00:40:00.210
<v Speaker 1>degree that makes you wonder if internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation even exists.</v>

671
00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Nice cut of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well meets valuable.</v>

672
00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:10.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's a good document by Richard </v>

673
00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Wrangham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think while back a book about the </v>

674
00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:17.130
<v Speaker 1>human invention of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you a little bit about </v>

675
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.751
<v Speaker 1>this random claim that we invented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire or discovered fire mastered it </v>

676
00:40:19.751 --> 00:40:24.130
<v Speaker 1>maybe two or 3 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a long time longer than people </v>

677
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:27.221
<v Speaker 1>had thought and that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually transformed us physiologically </v>

678
00:40:27.221 --> 00:40:30.431
<v Speaker 1>from our chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ancestors into the sort of spelt </v>

679
00:40:30.431 --> 00:40:32.450
<v Speaker 1>creatures we are now because it's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier to digest cooked meat and meat is</v>

680
00:40:32.451 --> 00:40:35.400
<v Speaker 1>a terminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the source of of nutrition,</v>

681
00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.740
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raw materials,</v>

682
00:40:37.741 --> 00:40:39.300
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's cooked.</v>

683
00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:40.890
<v Speaker 1>So me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal.</v>

684
00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Cooked meat is a big deal and maybe it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a choice cut of meat.</v>

685
00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:45.580
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

686
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.080
<v Speaker 1>kindy might offer to a guest if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not A.</v>

687
00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I always say this wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it Vegan,</v>

688
00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Vegan or Vegan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was Vegan,</v>

689
00:40:54.961 --> 00:40:56.550
<v Speaker 1>but that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a star.</v>

690
00:40:56.551 --> 00:40:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Vegas a start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

691
00:40:57.691 --> 00:41:01.990
<v Speaker 1>They're not like star creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there anyway,</v>

692
00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:04.530
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might offer that,</v>

693
00:41:04.531 --> 00:41:08.730
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if a guest came to your abode</v>

694
00:41:08.731 --> 00:41:11.850
<v Speaker 1>and you were heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

695
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:16.880
<v Speaker 1>you might sacrifice a high end animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and offer your guests a nice choice cut </v>

696
00:41:17.911 --> 00:41:22.911
<v Speaker 1>of meat and that would actually matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would mean something from the best </v>

697
00:41:22.911 --> 00:41:24.810
<v Speaker 1>animal in a flock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's above even that?</v>

698
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the thing you could </v>

699
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:31.140
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice while your best animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

700
00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about you?</v>

701
00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.120
<v Speaker 1>How about your child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about you?</v>

702
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be next on the hierarchy.</v>

703
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:39.860
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of hard to get past that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

704
00:41:39.861 --> 00:41:44.861
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a toss up whether the sacrifice is </v>

705
00:41:45.511 --> 00:41:47.340
<v Speaker 1>greater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's you or if it's your child.</v>

706
00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I would say being a parent that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater if it's your child,</v>

707
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.120
<v Speaker 1>because I think most people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>established</v>

708
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:55.180
<v Speaker 4>a</v>

709
00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hesitate to say proper,</v>

710
00:41:59.071 --> 00:42:04.071
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a proper relationship with their </v>

711
00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:04.071
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's if push came to shove,</v>

712
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:08.720
<v Speaker 4>they'd take the bullet and let their kid</v>
<v Speaker 4>go live.</v>

713
00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.660
<v Speaker 1>The sacrifice of the mother is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exemplified profoundly by Michelangelo's</v>

714
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:17.000
<v Speaker 1>great sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Ada.</v>

715
00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Mary is Contemplating Her son crucified </v>
<v Speaker 1>in ruins,</v>

716
00:42:21.131 --> 00:42:23.050
<v Speaker 1>so that's his body after he's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucified,</v>

717
00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:25.180
<v Speaker 1>it's her fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was through her.</v>

718
00:42:25.181 --> 00:42:28.540
<v Speaker 1>He entered the great drama of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the meaning of this sculpture?</v>

719
00:42:28.541 --> 00:42:33.541
<v Speaker 1>It's a great sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an absolutely unbelievable </v>

720
00:42:33.541 --> 00:42:36.691
<v Speaker 1>sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't believe that someone </v>

721
00:42:36.691 --> 00:42:39.780
<v Speaker 1>could exist who could make something up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it wasn't the only thing </v>

722
00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Michael Angelo made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

723
00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.200
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

724
00:42:41.201 --> 00:42:46.201
<v Speaker 1>It was something he just tossed off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of months while he was doing </v>

725
00:42:46.201 --> 00:42:47.320
<v Speaker 1>other unbelievable things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

726
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:49.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

727
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.640
<v Speaker 1>it's an object of contemplation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's integrate cathedral,</v>

728
00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:57.650
<v Speaker 1>integrate city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an object of contemplation and the </v>

729
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:58.570
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like what,</v>

730
00:42:58.571 --> 00:43:03.571
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the role of a mother if she's </v>

731
00:43:03.571 --> 00:43:06.811
<v Speaker 1>awake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a client come to see me a while </v>

732
00:43:06.811 --> 00:43:06.811
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not very long ago,</v>

733
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.230
<v Speaker 1>woman in about who's about 30 and trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make decisions about her life.</v>

734
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.390
<v Speaker 1>She was pretty career oriented and so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked her about,</v>

735
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.210
<v Speaker 1>although maybe having a bit of trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their career.</v>

736
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times,</v>

737
00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:27.700
<v Speaker 1>so this is an amalgam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a story that's an amalgam and I </v>

738
00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.780
<v Speaker 1>talked to her about the other elements </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your life.</v>

739
00:43:29.781 --> 00:43:29.830
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

740
00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.480
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

741
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.140
<v Speaker 1>there's only five things you do in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got your career down,</v>

742
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.590
<v Speaker 1>know what do you do outside of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>career that's meaningful and engaging.</v>

743
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:43.400
<v Speaker 1>How are things going with your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be your family of origin,</v>

744
00:43:43.401 --> 00:43:44.480
<v Speaker 1>your siblings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

745
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an intimate relationship and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's your plan for your own </v>

746
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.760
<v Speaker 1>family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apart from those five things there's</v>

747
00:43:51.761 --> 00:43:56.250
<v Speaker 1>sort of something like get some exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and then don't eat too badly and try</v>

748
00:43:56.251 --> 00:43:57.860
<v Speaker 1>to stay away from the drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

749
00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:58.580
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

750
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:03.610
<v Speaker 1>that kind of had an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crime that kind of lays out life and </v>

751
00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.800
<v Speaker 1>if you miss any of those five things or </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do any of those other things </v>

752
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:13.301
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're in trouble and you can get </v>

753
00:44:13.301 --> 00:44:13.301
<v Speaker 1>away with missing a couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not all of them,</v>

754
00:44:13.301 --> 00:44:17.170
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said something along the lines </v>

755
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:17.170
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

756
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:17.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I should bring a child into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this world.</v>

757
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh god Christ,</v>

758
00:44:18.591 --> 00:44:20.150
<v Speaker 1>you got to come up with something better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

759
00:44:20.151 --> 00:44:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Such a bloody cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I told her.</v>

760
00:44:22.341 --> 00:44:22.820
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

761
00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.220
<v Speaker 1>you must have thought that up when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were 16.</v>

762
00:44:25.221 --> 00:44:26.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

763
00:44:26.211 --> 00:44:28.220
<v Speaker 1>That's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do any better.</v>

764
00:44:28.221 --> 00:44:29.810
<v Speaker 1>This was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart woman.</v>

765
00:44:29.811 --> 00:44:30.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

766
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 1>You can't do any better than that.</v>

767
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:33.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

768
00:44:33.481 --> 00:44:35.880
<v Speaker 3>obviously this is a veil of tears and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:40.881
<v Speaker 3>a well of suffering and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you asked 30 people who are wondering</v>

770
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:43.800
<v Speaker 3>about having children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why they're wondering,</v>

771
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:48.150
<v Speaker 3>20 of them will say that and so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that tells you how original it is.</v>

772
00:44:48.151 --> 00:44:50.430
<v Speaker 3>It's not original at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a thought.</v>

773
00:44:50.431 --> 00:44:51.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like this little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a.</v>

774
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.580
<v Speaker 3>it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a meme.</v>

775
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:58.600
<v Speaker 3>It's something that lives in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a thought and it's certainly </v>

776
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.781
<v Speaker 3>not something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly not something that you </v>

777
00:45:02.781 --> 00:45:02.781
<v Speaker 3>should just take it face value and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

778
00:45:02.781 --> 00:45:03.810
<v Speaker 3>well I'm not having a family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's like,</v>

779
00:45:03.811 --> 00:45:04.250
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

780
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.170
<v Speaker 3>You kind of look at that and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticize it a little bit.</v>

781
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

782
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.900
<v Speaker 3>the pop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one,</v>

783
00:45:09.901 --> 00:45:14.901
<v Speaker 3>that's the other one that's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's too many people on the planet </v>

784
00:45:14.901 --> 00:45:14.901
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

785
00:45:14.901 --> 00:45:18.900
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't like that statement.</v>

786
00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:22.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just who are you going to ask to leave?</v>

787
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Just how are you going to get them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave?</v>

788
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.960
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a serious question and who says </v>

789
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.051
<v Speaker 3>there's too many people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the Hell's wrong with people </v>

790
00:45:33.051 --> 00:45:34.350
<v Speaker 3>anyways when we're running around </v>
<v Speaker 3>ruining the planet?</v>

791
00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:39.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like I think it was the club of Rome </v>

792
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:42.590
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who prophesied by the way that there </v>

793
00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:42.590
<v Speaker 3>would be so many people on the planet by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the year 2000,</v>

794
00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:46.760
<v Speaker 3>that there would be widespread </v>
<v Speaker 3>starvation and they were completely and </v>

795
00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.380
<v Speaker 3>utterly wrong about that and I think it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the club of Rome who either compared</v>

796
00:45:49.381 --> 00:45:52.200
<v Speaker 3>us to a virus or a cancer on the face of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the planet.</v>

797
00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:53.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

798
00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:54.910
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you think about people a,</v>

799
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.140
<v Speaker 3>aren't you something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that something to think about?</v>

800
00:45:58.141 --> 00:46:00.360
<v Speaker 3>Human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>viruses and cancer.</v>

801
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:04.410
<v Speaker 3>What do you do with viruses and cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Invite them in and make them at home.</v>

802
00:46:04.411 --> 00:46:05.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

803
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:10.220
<v Speaker 3>you tried to eradicate them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a bloody well watch your </v>

804
00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.161
<v Speaker 3>metaphors folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it isn't clear that you come up </v>

805
00:46:13.161 --> 00:46:14.190
<v Speaker 3>with them or that they run you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you better watch him.</v>

806
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.960
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

807
00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.890
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mary and Mary's the great mother,</v>

808
00:46:21.891 --> 00:46:23.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That she's the mother.</v>

809
00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:28.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what Mary is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether she existed or not is not the </v>

810
00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.720
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She exists at least as a hyper reality.</v>

811
00:46:29.721 --> 00:46:33.350
<v Speaker 3>She exists as the mother will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the sacrifice of the mother?</v>

812
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's easy if you're a mother and if </v>

813
00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.640
<v Speaker 3>you're a mother who's worth her salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you offer your son to be destroyed by </v>

814
00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:42.860
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you do.</v>

815
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:44.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's going to happen,</v>

816
00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:50.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna be born and he's going to </v>

817
00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:50.420
<v Speaker 3>suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna have his trouble in life.</v>

818
00:46:50.421 --> 00:46:55.421
<v Speaker 3>He's going to have his illnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to face his failures and </v>

819
00:46:55.421 --> 00:46:59.060
<v Speaker 3>catastrophes and he's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going to happen,</v>

820
00:46:59.061 --> 00:47:00.740
<v Speaker 3>and if you're awake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that,</v>

821
00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.180
<v Speaker 3>and then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

822
00:47:02.181 --> 00:47:07.181
<v Speaker 3>perhaps he will live in a way that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>justify that and then you try to have </v>

823
00:47:07.181 --> 00:47:10.130
<v Speaker 3>that happen and that's what makes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>worthy of a statue like that,</v>

824
00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:17.490
<v Speaker 3>but still the sacrifice of the mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it right to bring a baby into this </v>

825
00:47:20.041 --> 00:47:21.000
<v Speaker 3>terrible world?</v>

826
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:24.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every woman asked yourself that question</v>

827
00:47:24.591 --> 00:47:27.990
<v Speaker 3>and some say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have the reasons Mary answers.</v>

828
00:47:27.991 --> 00:47:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Voluntarily.</v>

829
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Mary is the archetype of the woman who </v>
<v Speaker 3>answers yes to life voluntarily.</v>

830
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.480
<v Speaker 3>That's what that image means and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>because she's blind,</v>

831
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:46.270
<v Speaker 3>she knows what's going to happen and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's the archetypical representation of</v>

832
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:49.090
<v Speaker 3>the woman who says yes to life knowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>full well what,</v>

833
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:54.120
<v Speaker 3>what life is not naive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not someone who got pregnant in the </v>

834
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.000
<v Speaker 3>backseat of the 1957 Chevy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

835
00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:56.940
<v Speaker 3>in one in a one night of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

836
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:59.140
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of half drunk idiocy.</v>

837
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Not that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but consciously,</v>

838
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:07.110
<v Speaker 3>consciously knowing what's to come and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then also allows it to happen because </v>

839
00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.940
<v Speaker 3>that's another thing that's a testament </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the courage of mothers.</v>

840
00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.270
<v Speaker 3>My mother was good at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mother's a very agreeable person too.</v>

841
00:48:13.271 --> 00:48:18.271
<v Speaker 3>Agreeable for her own good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what happens if you're </v>

842
00:48:18.271 --> 00:48:19.000
<v Speaker 3>agreeable because you're too agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 3>if for your own good.</v>

843
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:23.620
<v Speaker 3>That's the definition of agreeable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so she's a nice person and still is.</v>

844
00:48:23.621 --> 00:48:28.621
<v Speaker 3>Luckily she's still alive and we've had </v>
<v Speaker 3>a very good relationship and I have </v>

845
00:48:28.621 --> 00:48:30.730
<v Speaker 3>always been able to make her laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

846
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.180
<v Speaker 3>which is a good thing and but she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>tough cookie.</v>

847
00:48:34.181 --> 00:48:35.110
<v Speaker 3>That woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

848
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:39.940
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember once she came across,</v>

849
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:44.440
<v Speaker 3>I was out playing in this baseball </v>
<v Speaker 3>diamond,</v>

850
00:48:44.441 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 3>little diamond and empty lot really in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this little town I grew up in.</v>

851
00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:54.960
<v Speaker 3>I was about 10 and she walked by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there with a bunch of my friends </v>

852
00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:59.880
<v Speaker 3>and I was about to have a fistfight with</v>
<v Speaker 3>his little tough kid that I hung around </v>

853
00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.061
<v Speaker 3>with and there were half girls on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>team and the fistfight had some </v>

854
00:49:03.061 --> 00:49:05.640
<v Speaker 3>relationship to status maneuvering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

855
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:07.270
<v Speaker 3>in relationship to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

856
00:49:07.271 --> 00:49:09.460
<v Speaker 3>we going to have a fight and my mum </v>
<v Speaker 3>walked by,</v>

857
00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:14.610
<v Speaker 3>she took a look and I could see from her</v>
<v Speaker 3>demeanor that she knew exactly what was </v>

858
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:20.581
<v Speaker 3>about to happen and she looked for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>second and then she walked by and I </v>

859
00:49:20.581 --> 00:49:21.850
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

860
00:49:21.851 --> 00:49:24.220
<v Speaker 3>good work mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No kidding.</v>

861
00:49:24.221 --> 00:49:29.221
<v Speaker 3>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like last bloody thing I needed at </v>

862
00:49:29.221 --> 00:49:29.500
<v Speaker 3>that moment was for her to come charge </v>
<v Speaker 3>it up and say,</v>

863
00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:31.350
<v Speaker 3>you boys aren't planning to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>

864
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.530
<v Speaker 3>are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

865
00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:33.720
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mom,</v>

866
00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:38.730
<v Speaker 3>where we're actually planning to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and now that you came and </v>

867
00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:42.061
<v Speaker 3>intervened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually lost before the God damn </v>

868
00:49:42.061 --> 00:49:42.061
<v Speaker 3>thing even started.</v>

869
00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:51.340
<v Speaker 3>So two thumbs up for mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was also the person that said </v>

870
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.730
<v Speaker 3>because I had some trouble with my dad </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a key adolescent.</v>

871
00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.110
<v Speaker 3>He had some trouble with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

872
00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:58.940
<v Speaker 3>it was 50 slash 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for now,</v>

873
00:49:58.941 --> 00:50:03.170
<v Speaker 3>it's probably 70 slash 30 with me on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>70 end of the being the trouble.</v>

874
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:08.610
<v Speaker 3>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left home when I was about 17 and she </v>

875
00:50:09.261 --> 00:50:11.270
<v Speaker 3>said something really interesting when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>left home.</v>

876
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:14.300
<v Speaker 3>She said it was too good at home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd never leave.</v>

877
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.800
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey mom,</v>

878
00:50:15.801 --> 00:50:16.880
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

879
00:50:16.881 --> 00:50:18.620
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for an agreeable person,</v>

880
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:22.400
<v Speaker 3>you've got a real spine man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was pretty good.</v>

881
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:26.840
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

882
00:50:26.841 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 3>a that says this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The</v>

883
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 1>mother is the person who also says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out there,</v>

884
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:36.380
<v Speaker 1>take your God damn lumps because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough enough so that you can handle it.</v>

885
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:42.070
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't say you just stayed down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in your bedroom bruiting away </v>

886
00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:47.590
<v Speaker 1>because the world is unfair and treating</v>
<v Speaker 1>you badly and your suffering is too </v>

887
00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:48.500
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

888
00:50:48.501 --> 00:50:50.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of suffering out there,</v>

889
00:50:50.061 --> 00:50:53.210
<v Speaker 1>but you're a hell of a lot tougher than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you are.</v>

890
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:54.690
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

891
00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:02.750
<v Speaker 1>in turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary's son Christ offers himself to God </v>

892
00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:07.140
<v Speaker 1>so completely that is faith and trust in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is not broken by betrayal,</v>

893
00:51:07.141 --> 00:51:08.340
<v Speaker 1>torture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or death.</v>

894
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the model for the honorable man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you have an interesting dynamic,</v>

895
00:51:18.061 --> 00:51:21.450
<v Speaker 1>there you have the woman who's willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the sacrifice,</v>

896
00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:27.920
<v Speaker 1>lays the groundwork for the son who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to make the sacrifice that works</v>

897
00:51:28.111 --> 00:51:32.520
<v Speaker 1>out pretty nicely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a good thing to know and Christ</v>

898
00:51:32.521 --> 00:51:33.390
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

899
00:51:33.391 --> 00:51:36.480
<v Speaker 1>as he sacrifices himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

900
00:51:36.481 --> 00:51:39.660
<v Speaker 1>his father is simultaneously sacrificing</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son,</v>

901
00:51:39.661 --> 00:51:44.661
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the oddities of the </v>

902
00:51:44.661 --> 00:51:44.970
<v Speaker 1>trinitarian model is that God sacrifices</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself to himself.</v>

903
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Same thing happens in norse mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

904
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.740
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

905
00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.760
<v Speaker 1>is it norse Zeus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germanic mythology.</v>

906
00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Zoo sacrifices himself to himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually hangs on a tree.</v>

907
00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:00.110
<v Speaker 1>It's actually wounded in his side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting parallel,</v>

908
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:02.990
<v Speaker 1>but I think part of the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

909
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:08.560
<v Speaker 1>the humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human race is trying to work out </v>

910
00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:08.560
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the ultimate sacrifice?</v>

911
00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.310
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice,</v>

912
00:52:10.311 --> 00:52:11.480
<v Speaker 1>a value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

913
00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:12.570
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

914
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:14.570
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the passion story,</v>

915
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:19.100
<v Speaker 1>and I told you I was foreshadowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing this into consideration.</v>

916
00:52:19.101 --> 00:52:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Things we won't talk about for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

917
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not at all in this lecture series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I don't know how </v>

918
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:25.870
<v Speaker 1>far I'll get is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

919
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:29.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a supreme sacrifice demanded on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of the mother and there's a </v>

920
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.071
<v Speaker 1>supreme sacrifice demanded on the part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the sun and there's a supreme </v>

921
00:52:33.071 --> 00:52:36.221
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice demanded on the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>father all at the same time and then </v>

922
00:52:36.221 --> 00:52:38.090
<v Speaker 1>that makes the supreme sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

923
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:40.370
<v Speaker 1>And hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one that renews.</v>

924
00:52:40.371 --> 00:52:42.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the sacrifice that renews and </v>
<v Speaker 1>redeems.</v>

925
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:44.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a hell of an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

926
00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:49.370
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about it is that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know if it's true,</v>

927
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.890
<v Speaker 1>but I know that its opposite is false</v>

928
00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:57.570
<v Speaker 1>and generally the opposite of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's false is true.</v>

929
00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:01.650
<v Speaker 1>It's the opposite is false is because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother doesn't make the sacrifice,</v>

930
00:53:01.651 --> 00:53:06.651
<v Speaker 1>then you get the horrible eatable </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation or something like that in the </v>

931
00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:09.621
<v Speaker 1>household,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just its own absolute </v>

932
00:53:09.621 --> 00:53:12.081
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you want a really good insight </v>

933
00:53:12.081 --> 00:53:12.750
<v Speaker 1>into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say watch the documentary Crumb,</v>

934
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:14.070
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>r u,</v>

935
00:53:14.071 --> 00:53:19.071
<v Speaker 1>m b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man that's been rated by some critics </v>

936
00:53:19.071 --> 00:53:19.590
<v Speaker 1>has the best documentary ever made and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is some piece of work,</v>

937
00:53:19.591 --> 00:53:20.030
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

938
00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:25.040
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I've ever seen that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually lays out the eatable </v>

939
00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:25.990
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe in its full nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

940
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:27.360
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you could,</v>

941
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:32.390
<v Speaker 3>you could look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if the maternal sacrifice isn't </v>

942
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.390
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that doesn't work.</v>

943
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:37.191
<v Speaker 3>If the paternal sacrifice isn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the father isn't willing to put his </v>

944
00:53:37.191 --> 00:53:38.760
<v Speaker 3>son out into the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

945
00:53:38.761 --> 00:53:41.100
<v Speaker 3>to be broken and betrayed and all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things,</v>

946
00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:44.340
<v Speaker 3>then that's a nonstarter because the kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't grow up.</v>

947
00:53:44.341 --> 00:53:46.170
<v Speaker 3>And then if the sun isn't willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

948
00:53:46.171 --> 00:53:48.540
<v Speaker 3>well then who the hell is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder the responsibility?</v>

949
00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:53.730
<v Speaker 3>So if those three things don't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's cataclysmic.</v>

950
00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:55.290
<v Speaker 3>It's chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hell.</v>

951
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.350
<v Speaker 3>If they do happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it the opposite of that?</v>

952
00:53:58.351 --> 00:53:59.280
<v Speaker 3>While you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

953
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:03.630
<v Speaker 3>maybe it depends on the degree to which </v>
<v Speaker 3>they happen and and it's a continuum.</v>

954
00:54:03.631 --> 00:54:06.790
<v Speaker 3>How thoroughly can they happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we don't know?</v>

955
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how good a job do you do have </v>

956
00:54:12.811 --> 00:54:15.090
<v Speaker 3>encouraging your children to live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth?</v>

957
00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:16.740
<v Speaker 3>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

958
00:54:16.741 --> 00:54:20.040
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the answer to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>question and the answer likely is,</v>

959
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:25.190
<v Speaker 3>well not you don't do as good a job of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as you could so it works out quite </v>

960
00:54:25.861 --> 00:54:30.861
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't know how well it could </v>

961
00:54:30.861 --> 00:54:32.130
<v Speaker 3>work if you did it really well are </v>
<v Speaker 3>spectacularly well or ultimately well or</v>

962
00:54:32.131 --> 00:54:37.131
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know and you know people have </v>

963
00:54:37.131 --> 00:54:38.820
<v Speaker 3>an intimation of this because one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that's really cool about having a</v>

964
00:54:38.821 --> 00:54:43.821
<v Speaker 3>young baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something you don't know until </v>

965
00:54:43.821 --> 00:54:43.821
<v Speaker 3>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two things you don't know.</v>

966
00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.680
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot more than two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's three things you don't know </v>

967
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:56.390
<v Speaker 3>until you have a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one is that you didn't grow up yet </v>

968
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:57.990
<v Speaker 3>because you actually don't grow up until</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else is more important than you.</v>

969
00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:03.140
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people think they grow up if they </v>

970
00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:03.140
<v Speaker 3>don't have children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't.</v>

971
00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:07.070
<v Speaker 3>They just think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there are some people who make </v>

972
00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:09.771
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices of other sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is a whole different ball of </v>

973
00:55:09.771 --> 00:55:11.910
<v Speaker 3>wax as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a very elegant metaphor,</v>

974
00:55:11.911 --> 00:55:16.911
<v Speaker 3>but you learn that it's kind of relief </v>
<v Speaker 3>relief not to be the center of </v>

975
00:55:18.661 --> 00:55:23.661
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool that you can sit back </v>

976
00:55:23.661 --> 00:55:26.850
<v Speaker 3>because of course your child in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>family and in society is immediately the</v>

977
00:55:26.851 --> 00:55:31.851
<v Speaker 3>center of attention and so unless you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>a narcissistic than you allow that to </v>

978
00:55:31.851 --> 00:55:36.801
<v Speaker 3>happen and then you learn all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good things about other people </v>

979
00:55:36.801 --> 00:55:37.710
<v Speaker 3>because other people really like babies.</v>

980
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:42.710
<v Speaker 3>It's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived in Montreal when we had our </v>

981
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:44.841
<v Speaker 3>first child and I lived in a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>rough neighborhood by Montreal </v>

982
00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:44.841
<v Speaker 3>standards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

983
00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:45.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

984
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:47.760
<v Speaker 3>Montreal has such a great city like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Toronto.</v>

985
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:52.761
<v Speaker 3>It's like even the rough neighborhoods </v>
<v Speaker 3>are there more like charming with a </v>

986
00:55:52.761 --> 00:55:54.780
<v Speaker 3>little dark under belly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

987
00:55:55.140 --> 00:56:00.140
<v Speaker 3>but there were some rough characters in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our neighborhood and it was pretty poor </v>

988
00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:01.830
<v Speaker 3>and we'd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd push her around in her stroller and</v>

989
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:07.070
<v Speaker 3>these like grizzled rectal guys would </v>
<v Speaker 3>come by and they'd look at her and they </v>

990
00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:10.270
<v Speaker 3>just light up and they'd come over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like smile at her and you know,</v>

991
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:13.920
<v Speaker 3>he just saw there the positive element </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their humanity just.</v>

992
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:15.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fourth,</v>

993
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:20.210
<v Speaker 3>you have to be something seriously wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you if you don't respond that way </v>

994
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.210
<v Speaker 3>to a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

995
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

996
00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>

997
00:56:22.951 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 3>But it was so cool to see these</v>

998
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.410
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of give them generally you sort</v>

999
00:56:26.411 --> 00:56:28.450
<v Speaker 1>of walk four feet around them on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

1000
00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:33.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet they were all of a sudden all </v>

1001
00:56:33.451 --> 00:56:35.821
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the layers that were on them would just </v>

1002
00:56:35.821 --> 00:56:39.811
<v Speaker 1>fall off and they'd be so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the babies are sort of like public </v>

1003
00:56:39.811 --> 00:56:40.870
<v Speaker 1>property weirdly enough to sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnant women,</v>

1004
00:56:40.871 --> 00:56:45.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people often treat pregnant </v>

1005
00:56:45.871 --> 00:56:45.871
<v Speaker 1>women sort of like their public property</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1006
00:56:45.871 --> 00:56:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean in a positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh well Laura,</v>

1007
00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:49.350
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a baby a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1008
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.510
<v Speaker 1>they do all sorts of cute things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1009
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:59.160
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I'm telling you that is </v>

1010
00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.871
<v Speaker 1>because there's a strong impulse in </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to note that there's something </v>

1011
00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:06.330
<v Speaker 1>miraculous about the existence of a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being and the miraculous element </v>

1012
00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:08.820
<v Speaker 1>is all the potential that's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1013
00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:10.840
<v Speaker 1>That's all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is potential.</v>

1014
00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:16.410
<v Speaker 1>And with every birth there is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for something remarkable to be</v>

1015
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:22.890
<v Speaker 1>introduced in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I've thought too </v>

1016
00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:26.461
<v Speaker 1>is the other thing you don't know is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that babies are generic until you have </v>

1017
00:57:27.191 --> 00:57:31.570
<v Speaker 1>one and then you're a baby isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>generic baby at all.</v>

1018
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:36.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like instantly it's a person with </v>
<v Speaker 1>whom you have a relationship that's </v>

1019
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:41.131
<v Speaker 1>closer perhaps than any relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've ever had and that you can </v>

1020
00:57:41.131 --> 00:57:42.250
<v Speaker 1>keep perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1021
00:57:42.251 --> 00:57:47.251
<v Speaker 1>Because most of the relationships you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>had already or with people who are </v>

1022
00:57:47.251 --> 00:57:47.560
<v Speaker 1>screwed up and 50 different ways and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you.</v>

1023
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:51.120
<v Speaker 1>But here you've got this baby and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair,</v>

1024
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:56.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's not ruined yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have this possibility of </v>

1025
00:57:56.251 --> 00:58:00.930
<v Speaker 1>maintaining this relationship that </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts out that baby really likes you.</v>

1026
00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:03.730
<v Speaker 1>And generally that continues for quite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

1027
00:58:03.731 --> 00:58:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Is there are two years old and you come </v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

1028
00:58:05.881 --> 00:58:07.800
<v Speaker 1>they're really happy to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like having a puppy,</v>

1029
00:58:07.801 --> 00:58:09.690
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're thrilled when you come</v>

1030
00:58:09.691 --> 00:58:14.691
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how many people are thrilled </v>

1031
00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:14.691
<v Speaker 1>when you come home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1032
00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:14.700
<v Speaker 1>so I'll see you again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1033
00:58:14.701 --> 00:58:15.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a little kid.</v>

1034
00:58:15.781 --> 00:58:18.840
<v Speaker 1>A little kid is thrilled when you come </v>
<v Speaker 1>home and you can keep that going.</v>

1035
00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:24.320
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this pristine element to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential relationship between </v>

1036
00:58:25.350 --> 00:58:29.070
<v Speaker 1>parents and children that's terribly </v>
<v Speaker 1>devalued in our society terribly.</v>

1037
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:35.670
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if were willfully blind </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it and I think it's an absolute </v>

1038
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:38.911
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe because there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's very little in life that can </v>

1039
00:58:39.251 --> 00:58:43.420
<v Speaker 1>compare to establishing a proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the child.</v>

1040
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:49.740
<v Speaker 1>They make great company if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you keep your relationship with them </v>

1041
00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:52.840
<v Speaker 1>pristine and so you know it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile.</v>

1042
00:58:52.841 --> 00:58:53.430
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1043
00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:58.500
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I'm telling you this is </v>

1044
00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:00.151
<v Speaker 1>because people look at infants and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they think this could be the </v>

1045
00:59:00.151 --> 00:59:02.170
<v Speaker 1>potential savior of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what they think.</v>

1046
00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:06.610
<v Speaker 1>That's how they act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what they think.</v>

1047
00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:12.010
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also true now how true it is,</v>

1048
00:59:12.011 --> 00:59:17.011
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's I think probably because I </v>

1049
00:59:18.211 --> 00:59:23.211
<v Speaker 1>think it's probably because people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>dare to find out how it's how it looks </v>

1050
00:59:23.211 --> 00:59:28.001
<v Speaker 1>to me in Christ case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1051
00:59:28.691 --> 00:59:30.520
<v Speaker 1>as he sacrifices himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1052
00:59:30.521 --> 00:59:33.010
<v Speaker 1>his father is simultaneously sacrificing</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son.</v>

1053
00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:38.220
<v Speaker 1>It is for this reason that the Christian</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificial drama of Sun and self is </v>

1054
00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:40.120
<v Speaker 1>archetipal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing greater can be imagined.</v>

1055
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:44.440
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's an architect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't push past it.</v>

1056
00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:46.160
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1057
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.100
<v Speaker 1>that's the very definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal.</v>

1058
00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:53.210
<v Speaker 1>That's the core of what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious.</v>

1059
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:58.340
<v Speaker 1>The greatest of all possible sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his self and child of that,</v>

1060
00:59:58.341 --> 01:00:03.341
<v Speaker 1>there can be no doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain and suffering define the world of </v>

1061
01:00:03.341 --> 01:00:03.341
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equally.</v>

1062
01:00:03.341 --> 01:00:06.020
<v Speaker 1>There can be no doubt the person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to alleviate suffering,</v>

1063
01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:09.110
<v Speaker 1>who wants to bring about the best of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible futures,</v>

1064
01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>who wants to create heaven on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will therefore sacrificed everything he </v>

1065
01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:18.551
<v Speaker 1>has to God to live in the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a page and half from the book </v>

1066
01:00:22.841 --> 01:00:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to release in January.</v>

1067
01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:30.210
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1068
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:37.270
<v Speaker 1>So back to genesis of we're all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already up to genesis four and Adam </v>

1069
01:00:38.031 --> 01:00:39.470
<v Speaker 1>knew eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>

1070
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:42.170
<v Speaker 1>and she conceived</v>

1071
01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>and Bare Cain and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have gotten a man from the Lord.</v>

1072
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Now this is after Adam and eve had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>chased out of the garden of Eden.</v>

1073
01:00:52.401 --> 01:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's really cool about this?</v>

1074
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:57.380
<v Speaker 1>I really think that the atoms that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>enable stories,</v>

1075
01:00:57.381 --> 01:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>the most profound story I've ever read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially given that it's.</v>

1076
01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:06.790
<v Speaker 1>You can tell it in 15 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't because I tend not to tell </v>

1077
01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>stories in 15 seconds as you may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed,</v>

1078
01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can read the whole thing that </v>

1079
01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:15.020
<v Speaker 1>quickly and it's so densely packed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't.</v>

1080
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's A.</v>

1081
01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:19.970
<v Speaker 1>It's actually unbelievable to me that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be that densely packed.</v>

1082
01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing is,</v>

1083
01:01:21.091 --> 01:01:26.091
<v Speaker 1>is that Adam and eve are not the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>two human beings can enable or the first</v>

1084
01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:31.751
<v Speaker 1>two human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Adam and eve were made by God </v>

1085
01:01:31.751 --> 01:01:31.751
<v Speaker 1>and they were born in paradise.</v>

1086
01:01:31.751 --> 01:01:33.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like what kind of cumin beings are </v>
<v Speaker 1>those?</v>

1087
01:01:33.171 --> 01:01:34.580
<v Speaker 1>You don't know any human beings like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1088
01:01:34.581 --> 01:01:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Human beings aren't born in paradise and</v>
<v Speaker 1>made by God.</v>

1089
01:01:38.541 --> 01:01:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are born of other human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

1090
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

1091
01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>so that's the first thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's post-fall.</v>

1092
01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.410
<v Speaker 1>We're out in the world world in history </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1093
01:01:48.411 --> 01:01:52.880
<v Speaker 1>We're not in some archetipal beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we are still to some degree,</v>

1094
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.600
<v Speaker 1>not to the degree that was the case with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of Adam and eve.</v>

1095
01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:58.250
<v Speaker 1>We we've already been thrown out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden,</v>

1096
01:01:58.251 --> 01:02:01.040
<v Speaker 1>were already self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're already awake,</v>

1097
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:04.430
<v Speaker 1>we're already covered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're already working.</v>

1098
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:09.970
<v Speaker 1>We're full fledged human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you have the first two human </v>

1099
01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:12.890
<v Speaker 1>beings can enable prototypical human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

1100
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:18.370
<v Speaker 1>So what's cool is that humanity enters </v>
<v Speaker 1>history at the end of the story of Adam </v>

1101
01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>and eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the architectural</v>

1102
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.210
<v Speaker 3>patterns for human behavior are </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously presented.</v>

1103
01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.850
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1104
01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.570
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely mind boggling and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not a great.</v>

1105
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:31.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not a very nice story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1106
01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:34.140
<v Speaker 3>So they're your brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're hostile brothers,</v>

1107
01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.120
<v Speaker 3>they've got their hands around each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other's throats,</v>

1108
01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:43.121
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least that's the case in one </v>

1109
01:02:43.121 --> 01:02:43.121
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

1110
01:02:43.121 --> 01:02:47.240
<v Speaker 3>it's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first two human beings engage in a </v>

1111
01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:51.051
<v Speaker 3>fratricidal struggle that ends in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>death of the best.</v>

1112
01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:56.481
<v Speaker 3>One of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the story of human beings in </v>

1113
01:02:56.481 --> 01:03:00.550
<v Speaker 3>history and that man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that doesn't give you nightmares,</v>

1114
01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:05.940
<v Speaker 3>you didn't understand the damn story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now in in these hostile brothers stories</v>

1115
01:03:10.251 --> 01:03:11.600
<v Speaker 3>which are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very common,</v>

1116
01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:17.510
<v Speaker 3>often the older brother Cain is used and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is very true in the Bible,</v>

1117
01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:20.780
<v Speaker 3>but it's true in all sorts of folk tales</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all sorts of stories</v>

1118
01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.160
<v Speaker 3>of all sorts for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1119
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:29.170
<v Speaker 3>the older brother has some advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the older brother and in a </v>

1120
01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:33.310
<v Speaker 3>agricultural community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the older brother generally inherited </v>

1121
01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:35.090
<v Speaker 3>the land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the younger brothers,</v>

1122
01:03:35.091 --> 01:03:36.500
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that was is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1123
01:03:36.501 --> 01:03:40.220
<v Speaker 3>let's say you have like eight sons and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have enough land to support a bit of</v>

1124
01:03:40.221 --> 01:03:43.760
<v Speaker 3>a family and you divided among your </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight sons than they have eight sons and</v>

1125
01:03:43.761 --> 01:03:48.761
<v Speaker 3>they divided among the eight sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like soon everyone has a little </v>

1126
01:03:48.761 --> 01:03:52.600
<v Speaker 3>postage stamp that they can stand on and</v>
<v Speaker 3>starve to death on and so that just </v>

1127
01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.350
<v Speaker 3>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

1128
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:54.290
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1129
01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:56.930
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hand the land down in a piece to the</v>

1130
01:03:56.931 --> 01:04:00.290
<v Speaker 3>eldest son and that's just how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tough luck for the rest of them,</v>

1131
01:04:00.291 --> 01:04:03.590
<v Speaker 3>but at least they know they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go and make their own way.</v>

1132
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:07.130
<v Speaker 3>It's not fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no way of making it fair.</v>

1133
01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:09.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the oldest son has some,</v>

1134
01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:15.910
<v Speaker 3>you might say he has an additional stake</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the stability and the stability of </v>

1135
01:04:18.111 --> 01:04:23.111
<v Speaker 3>the current hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has more of a stake in the status </v>

1136
01:04:23.111 --> 01:04:23.510
<v Speaker 3>quo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that makes them more of an emblematic</v>

1137
01:04:23.511 --> 01:04:28.511
<v Speaker 3>representative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>representative of the status quo and </v>

1138
01:04:28.511 --> 01:04:29.600
<v Speaker 3>perhaps more likely to be blind in it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>favor.</v>

1139
01:04:29.601 --> 01:04:34.601
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that motif creeps up very frequently </v>

1140
01:04:34.601 --> 01:04:36.530
<v Speaker 3>in the hostel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brothers archetipal struggle.</v>

1141
01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:42.070
<v Speaker 3>So Kane fits this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The story of Cain and Abel fits this </v>

1142
01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:44.060
<v Speaker 3>pattern because Cain is the one who </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't budge who won't move.</v>

1143
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:49.300
<v Speaker 3>He's stubborn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the younger son who is able is </v>

1144
01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:50.750
<v Speaker 3>often the one who's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so much of a revolutionary,</v>

1145
01:04:50.751 --> 01:04:55.751
<v Speaker 3>but perhaps more of a balance between </v>
<v Speaker 3>the revolutionary and the </v>

1146
01:04:55.751 --> 01:04:55.751
<v Speaker 3>traditionalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1147
01:04:55.751 --> 01:05:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the older son tends to be more </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditionalist authoritarian,</v>

1148
01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:03.820
<v Speaker 3>at least in these metaphorical </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations.</v>

1149
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:06.430
<v Speaker 3>And Adam knew eve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wife,</v>

1150
01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.290
<v Speaker 3>and she conceived and Bare Cain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1151
01:05:08.291 --> 01:05:12.970
<v Speaker 3>I have gotten a man from the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's the first human being cane.</v>

1152
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like I told you that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mesopotamians thought that mankind</v>

1153
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>was made out of the blood of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>demon.</v>

1154
01:05:20.321 --> 01:05:22.840
<v Speaker 1>That the great goddess of chaos could </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

1155
01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first human being is a murderer and </v>

1156
01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:28.620
<v Speaker 1>not only a murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murder of his own brother.</v>

1157
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:29.560
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1158
01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a harsh book and you </v>

1159
01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:37.921
<v Speaker 1>might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that's a little bit too much </v>

1160
01:05:37.921 --> 01:05:38.050
<v Speaker 1>to bear and then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1161
01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's something to think about.</v>

1162
01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:45.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1163
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1164
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>like they're amazing creatures and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about us as a plague on the planet</v>

1165
01:05:52.811 --> 01:05:57.811
<v Speaker 1>is its own kind of bloody catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent,</v>

1166
01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:03.540
<v Speaker 1>low genocidal metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that we're not </v>

1167
01:06:06.791 --> 01:06:11.791
<v Speaker 1>without our problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that this book that sets </v>

1168
01:06:11.791 --> 01:06:15.031
<v Speaker 1>sits at the cornerstone of our culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>would present the first man that was a </v>

1169
01:06:16.971 --> 01:06:21.971
<v Speaker 1>murder of his brother is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>should really set you back on your </v>

1170
01:06:21.971 --> 01:06:21.971
<v Speaker 1>heels.</v>

1171
01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she bare his brother Abel and Abel was a</v>

1172
01:06:26.181 --> 01:06:28.610
<v Speaker 1>keeper of sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</v>

1173
01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:34.690
<v Speaker 1>There you see a very old representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is able there and he's got his </v>

1174
01:06:36.171 --> 01:06:39.620
<v Speaker 1>sheep up on the altar and Cain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing a Sheaf of wheat.</v>

1175
01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:44.621
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know exactly what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening here with the blood but or </v>

1176
01:06:45.441 --> 01:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a re perhaps it's something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1177
01:06:47.481 --> 01:06:52.481
<v Speaker 1>But the overall impression of the images</v>
<v Speaker 1>that something transcendent is </v>

1178
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:56.210
<v Speaker 1>communicating with this sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see that.</v>

1179
01:06:56.211 --> 01:06:57.080
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1180
01:06:57.081 --> 01:06:58.370
<v Speaker 1>how primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1181
01:06:58.371 --> 01:07:01.940
<v Speaker 1>how primitive these people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificing to their god.</v>

1182
01:07:01.941 --> 01:07:03.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1183
01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.490
<v Speaker 1>those people weren't stupid and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not primitive.</v>

1184
01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not primitive.</v>

1185
01:07:10.531 --> 01:07:13.680
<v Speaker 1>It's sophisticated beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the idea,</v>

1186
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:16.590
<v Speaker 1>as I already pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you could sacrifice something of</v>

1187
01:07:16.591 --> 01:07:18.960
<v Speaker 1>value in that that would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent utility.</v>

1188
01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:21.900
<v Speaker 1>And that is by no means an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsophisticated idea.</v>

1189
01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be the greatest I did the human</v>

1190
01:07:24.411 --> 01:07:25.580
<v Speaker 1>beings ever came up with.</v>

1191
01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:32.920
<v Speaker 1>It's an answer to the problem that's put</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward in the story of Adam and Eve,</v>

1192
01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:37.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we became self conscious and </v>

1193
01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:38.200
<v Speaker 1>then we discovered the future and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we knew we were going to die and then we</v>

1194
01:07:38.201 --> 01:07:43.201
<v Speaker 1>knew we were vulnerable and then we </v>
<v Speaker 1>became ashamed and then we develop the </v>

1195
01:07:43.201 --> 01:07:44.740
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we got thrown out of paradise.</v>

1196
01:07:44.741 --> 01:07:46.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big problem.</v>

1197
01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:48.220
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell are you going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it?</v>

1198
01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.880
<v Speaker 1>While I will sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the hypothesis.</v>

1199
01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a hypothesis,</v>

1200
01:07:54.011 --> 01:07:55.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're doing.</v>

1201
01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:00.360
<v Speaker 1>You've made plenty of sacrifices even to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit in this theater and many people may </v>

1202
01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:04.890
<v Speaker 1>plenty of sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To have a theater like this exist in </v>

1203
01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:08.671
<v Speaker 1>many people made sacrifices so that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually freely engage in the </v>

1204
01:08:08.671 --> 01:08:11.320
<v Speaker 1>dialogue that we're engaging in in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater like this.</v>

1205
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:15.280
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like all of this is built on</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice and sacrifice.</v>

1206
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Bloody well better work because we do </v>
<v Speaker 1>not have a better idea sacrifice,</v>

1207
01:08:21.091 --> 01:08:24.330
<v Speaker 1>what's the counter position?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murder and theft.</v>

1208
01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:29.490
<v Speaker 1>So let's go with sacrifice shall we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps we won't consider it so damn</v>

1209
01:08:29.491 --> 01:08:30.940
<v Speaker 1>primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1210
01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.230
<v Speaker 1>because it's not so primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again she bare.</v>

1211
01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:39.260
<v Speaker 1>His brother Abel enabled was a keeper of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep and Cain was a tiller of the </v>

1212
01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:39.260
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

1213
01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Now some people have read into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>eternal battle between herdsmen and </v>

1214
01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:52.320
<v Speaker 1>agriculturalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which raged in the American West for </v>

1215
01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.381
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the herdsmen like to have their </v>

1216
01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:55.381
<v Speaker 1>herds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep,</v>

1217
01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:57.160
<v Speaker 1>cattle go wherever they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1218
01:08:57.161 --> 01:09:02.161
<v Speaker 1>And of course the agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the farmers like to have things fenced </v>

1219
01:09:02.161 --> 01:09:04.030
<v Speaker 1>off and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the agriculturalists actually won in</v>

1220
01:09:04.031 --> 01:09:07.510
<v Speaker 1>the final analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

1221
01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Abel is a keeper of sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's interesting because that </v>

1222
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:15.571
<v Speaker 1>makes them a shepherd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's part of the critical </v>

1223
01:09:15.791 --> 01:09:20.791
<v Speaker 1>issue here because a shepherd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked a little bit about shepherds </v>

1224
01:09:20.791 --> 01:09:20.791
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1225
01:09:20.791 --> 01:09:22.510
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Michelangelo Statue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>

1226
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:27.550
<v Speaker 1>of David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another staggering work mean </v>

1227
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:32.361
<v Speaker 1>that David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's no trivial figure and of course </v>

1228
01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.510
<v Speaker 1>steven do slight slays Goliath and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Goliath is like</v>

1229
01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:43.410
<v Speaker 1>the giant of the patriarchal enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and you know,</v>

1230
01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Middle Eastern shepherds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to kick take care of sheep and </v>

1231
01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:52.281
<v Speaker 1>they're edible and the lambs are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable and there were lots of wild </v>

1232
01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:56.751
<v Speaker 1>animals around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like England in the 16th </v>

1233
01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:56.990
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like the reliance,</v>

1234
01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:02.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you had a slingshot or a stick or </v>

1235
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.241
<v Speaker 1>some damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your job was to keep the sheep </v>

1236
01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:06.420
<v Speaker 1>organized and not let them beat by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lions alone.</v>

1237
01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.720
<v Speaker 1>And so you had to have a clue and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough and self reliant and all of those </v>

1238
01:10:11.851 --> 01:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be tough and self reliance.</v>

1239
01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:16.890
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to take care of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of vulnerable things,</v>

1240
01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>able to do it on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how are built into the </v>

1241
01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:22.900
<v Speaker 1>shepherd metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1242
01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough thing for.</v>

1243
01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:29.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not a great metaphor for modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because we tend to think of the </v>

1244
01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:30.070
<v Speaker 1>shepherd is someone like little Lord </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fauntleroy,</v>

1245
01:10:30.071 --> 01:10:31.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some little,</v>

1246
01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:37.530
<v Speaker 1>certainly not a lion killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypermasculine lion killing monster </v>

1247
01:10:38.171 --> 01:10:40.690
<v Speaker 1>that's not a shepherd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A shepherd sort of dances around and you</v>

1248
01:10:40.691 --> 01:10:41.680
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1249
01:10:41.681 --> 01:10:43.660
<v Speaker 1>That's not the metaphor here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1250
01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.600
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the metaphor here.</v>

1251
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:51.750
<v Speaker 1>So Abel was a keeper of sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Cain was a tiller of the ground and </v>

1252
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:55.921
<v Speaker 1>in the process of time it came to pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>that cain brought of the fruit of the </v>

1253
01:10:55.921 --> 01:10:56.590
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an offering unto the Lord.</v>

1254
01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's participating in this </v>

1255
01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:02.460
<v Speaker 1>sacrificial ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unable.</v>

1256
01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:04.650
<v Speaker 1>He brought of the firstlings of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>flock and of the fat thereof.</v>

1257
01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.100
<v Speaker 1>And the Lord had respect unto Abel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to his offering.</v>

1258
01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't know why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a built in ambiguity.</v>

1259
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.210
<v Speaker 5>I think now I think there's textual </v>
<v Speaker 5>hints,</v>

1260
01:11:18.211 --> 01:11:19.110
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not sure.</v>

1261
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:20.000
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1262
01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:24.230
<v Speaker 5>Abel brought the firstlings of his flock</v>
<v Speaker 5>and of the fat thereof.</v>

1263
01:11:24.231 --> 01:11:24.800
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1264
01:11:24.801 --> 01:11:26.000
<v Speaker 5>so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1265
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:30.590
<v Speaker 5>he brought high quite so high quality </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice you don't know.</v>

1266
01:11:30.591 --> 01:11:33.050
<v Speaker 5>That enables sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 5>low quality.</v>

1267
01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:35.090
<v Speaker 5>Because it doesn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1268
01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:38.690
<v Speaker 5>Abel brought God some wilted lettuce and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then Burton,</v>

1269
01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:43.720
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't say that but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there isn't a sentence there that </v>

1270
01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:47.531
<v Speaker 5>talks about how high quality cane </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifices,</v>

1271
01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.520
<v Speaker 5>but in any case the Lord had respect </v>
<v Speaker 5>unto Abel and his offering.</v>

1272
01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:58.330
<v Speaker 5>So there's a hint that ables putting a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit more into the whole </v>

1273
01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:03.071
<v Speaker 5>sacrificial thing then then cane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's also a hint that maybe God </v>

1274
01:12:03.071 --> 01:12:05.660
<v Speaker 5>is just like liking you a little better </v>
<v Speaker 5>than these likened him.</v>

1275
01:12:05.661 --> 01:12:10.661
<v Speaker 5>And that's I think useful from a </v>
<v Speaker 5>literary perspective because there is </v>

1276
01:12:10.661 --> 01:12:12.350
<v Speaker 5>that arbitrary ness about life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1277
01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.030
<v Speaker 5>with my own children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1278
01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.090
<v Speaker 5>one of them has had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say</v>

1279
01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:18.910
<v Speaker 4>he</v>

1280
01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:22.950
<v Speaker 5>things come easy to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's lucky,</v>

1281
01:12:22.951 --> 01:12:25.740
<v Speaker 5>fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>however you want to put it.</v>

1282
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:28.950
<v Speaker 5>He seems to be that sort of person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas my other child is like,</v>

1283
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:34.340
<v Speaker 5>it's just like one horrible job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like catastrophe after another.</v>

1284
01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:38.580
<v Speaker 5>And it's so strange to see that because </v>
<v Speaker 5>as far as I can tell,</v>

1285
01:12:38.581 --> 01:12:43.581
<v Speaker 5>there's the character.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Logical differences are certainly not </v>

1286
01:12:43.581 --> 01:12:45.000
<v Speaker 5>accounting for the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the,</v>

1287
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.370
<v Speaker 5>for the difference in destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1288
01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.070
<v Speaker 5>my one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one child who's had so much trouble,</v>

1289
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:54.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean as a child was just a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 5>child,</v>

1290
01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.960
<v Speaker 5>so amazingly happy and easy to get along</v>
<v Speaker 5>with and fun and they have a terrible </v>

1291
01:13:12.201 --> 01:13:17.201
<v Speaker 5>time of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so who knows what God's up to,</v>

1292
01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:22.240
<v Speaker 5>but distributing fate equally certainly </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't one of them,</v>

1293
01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.580
<v Speaker 5>and the Lord had respect unto Abel and </v>
<v Speaker 5>his offering,</v>

1294
01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:32.610
<v Speaker 5>but unto Cain and his offering he had </v>
<v Speaker 5>not respect and Cain was very wroth </v>

1295
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:40.310
<v Speaker 5>angry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Roth is a tough word and and these are </v>

1296
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:44.241
<v Speaker 5>translated many times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to get the full flavor of the </v>

1297
01:13:44.241 --> 01:13:45.890
<v Speaker 5>words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but wroth and his countenance fell well.</v>

1298
01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:49.260
<v Speaker 5>To have your countenance fell at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is sort of up to fall,</v>

1299
01:13:49.261 --> 01:13:51.720
<v Speaker 5>is to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to have it be heavy.</v>

1300
01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:56.310
<v Speaker 5>Depressed for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Angry for sure.</v>

1301
01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:59.670
<v Speaker 5>Resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably Roth.</v>

1302
01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:04.700
<v Speaker 5>That's anger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Kane is not happy clam that his hard </v>

1303
01:14:05.521 --> 01:14:10.320
<v Speaker 5>work is being rejected by God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that's worth thinking about really,</v>

1304
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 5>because you think about how</v>

1305
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.570
<v Speaker 3>human that story is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1306
01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:17.140
<v Speaker 3>you're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1307
01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:20.830
<v Speaker 3>we can say you might be useless </v>
<v Speaker 3>character and you know,</v>

1308
01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.610
<v Speaker 3>you're whining about how catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life isn't.</v>

1309
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:27.760
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty much obvious to everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>around you and you that it's your fault.</v>

1310
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:30.670
<v Speaker 3>You just don't try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't wake up in the morning,</v>

1311
01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:33.790
<v Speaker 3>you don't get a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't engage in things.</v>

1312
01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:38.940
<v Speaker 3>You're cynical and you're bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're angry and you don't try to help </v>

1313
01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:42.931
<v Speaker 3>the people near you and you don't try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fix up your own life and you don't take </v>

1314
01:14:42.931 --> 01:14:47.191
<v Speaker 3>care of yourself and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then things go wrong and it's like </v>

1315
01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 3>hell freely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you expect?</v>

1316
01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:50.830
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

1317
01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean someone in that </v>

1318
01:14:56.190 --> 01:14:56.190
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just say,</v>

1319
01:14:56.190 --> 01:14:56.190
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's okay.</v>

1320
01:14:56.190 --> 01:14:56.500
<v Speaker 3>I deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there'll be happy about it.</v>

1321
01:14:56.501 --> 01:15:01.501
<v Speaker 3>They won't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll be absolutely bitter about it </v>

1322
01:15:01.501 --> 01:15:01.501
<v Speaker 3>and angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1323
01:15:01.501 --> 01:15:01.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put that aside for a moment.</v>

1324
01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:05.830
<v Speaker 3>There are people who seem to struggle </v>
<v Speaker 3>very forthrightly,</v>

1325
01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:10.831
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and still have one catastrophe after </v>

1326
01:15:10.831 --> 01:15:11.790
<v Speaker 3>another happen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>

1327
01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:15.550
<v Speaker 3>there's no easy answer in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this story.</v>

1328
01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:20.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fall afoul of God because your sacrifice</v>

1329
01:15:22.701 --> 01:15:25.450
<v Speaker 3>is our second rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you can just fall,</v>

1330
01:15:25.451 --> 01:15:27.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fall of God and you don't know why.</v>

1331
01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tough luck for you,</v>

1332
01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:33.190
<v Speaker 3>and then what happens in either case is </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly this.</v>

1333
01:15:33.191 --> 01:15:34.390
<v Speaker 3>Almost inevitably</v>

1334
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:38.440
<v Speaker 3>cain was wrong in his countenance fell </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1335
01:15:38.441 --> 01:15:39.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you meet an I.</v>

1336
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.080
<v Speaker 3>people like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1337
01:15:41.081 --> 01:15:42.640
<v Speaker 3>To me all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen many,</v>

1338
01:15:42.641 --> 01:15:44.330
<v Speaker 3>many of them as clients,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1339
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:47.320
<v Speaker 3>they say they're 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so often.</v>

1340
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:49.480
<v Speaker 3>30 more commonly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes 40.</v>

1341
01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Their lives haven't gone well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1342
01:15:51.431 --> 01:15:56.431
<v Speaker 3>they're in a pit of despair of one form </v>
<v Speaker 3>or another and not only are they in a </v>

1343
01:15:56.431 --> 01:16:00.871
<v Speaker 3>pit of despair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're extraordinarily angry about </v>

1344
01:16:00.871 --> 01:16:03.181
<v Speaker 3>it and god only knows what they would do</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that anger if they had the </v>

1345
01:16:03.181 --> 01:16:05.020
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to give it full voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1346
01:16:05.021 --> 01:16:10.021
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I've always thought </v>

1347
01:16:10.021 --> 01:16:10.021
<v Speaker 3>about Hitler is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1348
01:16:10.021 --> 01:16:13.120
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to admire Hitler.</v>

1349
01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:16.930
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was an organizational genius.</v>

1350
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:21.400
<v Speaker 3>You know the thing that doesn't stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>people from being Hitler.</v>

1351
01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:26.140
<v Speaker 3>The thing people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't</v>

1352
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:32.990
<v Speaker 3>refused the ambition to become Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't have the genocidal </v>

1353
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:37.911
<v Speaker 3>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't follow that pathway because </v>

1354
01:16:37.911 --> 01:16:39.360
<v Speaker 3>they don't have the organizational </v>
<v Speaker 3>genius.</v>

1355
01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:42.960
<v Speaker 3>They've got the damn motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1356
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:47.990
<v Speaker 3>if you take 100 people randomly and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to them and you really talked to </v>

1357
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:52.911
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll find that five percent of them </v>

1358
01:16:52.911 --> 01:16:56.600
<v Speaker 3>would take their vengeful thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty damn far if they were just given </v>

1359
01:16:56.611 --> 01:17:01.611
<v Speaker 3>the opportunity and in fact they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they make life miserable for </v>

1360
01:17:01.611 --> 01:17:05.211
<v Speaker 3>themselves and often for their family </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes for anybody they can come </v>

1361
01:17:05.211 --> 01:17:08.751
<v Speaker 3>near and then maybe another 20 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people have that bubble up in them on</v>

1362
01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:10.310
<v Speaker 3>a pretty damn</v>

1363
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:14.930
<v Speaker 1>regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can have some</v>

1364
01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:17.620
<v Speaker 3>the thief for cane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have any sympathy for cane,</v>

1365
01:17:17.621 --> 01:17:21.510
<v Speaker 3>then you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See Cain and Abel also,</v>

1366
01:17:21.511 --> 01:17:24.180
<v Speaker 3>they don't just represent to our </v>
<v Speaker 3>architectural types of being.</v>

1367
01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:25.050
<v Speaker 3>They represent</v>

1368
01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:31.530
<v Speaker 3>so it's not like you're a cane and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're able to near cane and you're </v>

1369
01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:34.261
<v Speaker 3>able.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're half and half and your </v>

1370
01:17:34.261 --> 01:17:34.261
<v Speaker 3>half and half and your half and half at </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like this.</v>

1371
01:17:34.261 --> 01:17:38.581
<v Speaker 3>This is two different potential patterns</v>
<v Speaker 3>of destiny and you don't manifest one </v>

1372
01:17:38.581 --> 01:17:40.670
<v Speaker 3>purely in the other zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're.</v>

1373
01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:44.650
<v Speaker 3>It's like the line between good and evil</v>
<v Speaker 3>that runs down the human heart.</v>

1374
01:17:44.651 --> 01:17:49.651
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly the same idea and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're more like canes or maybe you're </v>

1375
01:17:49.651 --> 01:17:50.980
<v Speaker 3>more like Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's still a little cane in you,</v>

1376
01:17:50.981 --> 01:17:55.981
<v Speaker 3>no matter how able you are and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than a little and probably more </v>

1377
01:17:56.021 --> 01:17:59.080
<v Speaker 3>than literally little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you watch your fantasies,</v>

1378
01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:02.860
<v Speaker 3>which I would very much recommend you </v>
<v Speaker 3>will find that they</v>

1379
01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:09.020
<v Speaker 1>show you dark things about you that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>shock you if you allow yourself to be </v>

1380
01:18:10.531 --> 01:18:15.531
<v Speaker 1>conscious of what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a good time when you're having </v>

1381
01:18:16.381 --> 01:18:18.810
<v Speaker 1>an argument with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially someone that you love,</v>

1382
01:18:19.170 --> 01:18:22.230
<v Speaker 1>to just watch the pictures that flash in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the back of your mind.</v>

1383
01:18:22.231 --> 01:18:27.231
<v Speaker 1>That's part of let's say coming into </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with what Carl Jung called the </v>

1384
01:18:27.231 --> 01:18:29.790
<v Speaker 1>shadow and the shadow is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of cane.</v>

1385
01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:33.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and one of the things that young said</v>

1386
01:18:33.631 --> 01:18:38.631
<v Speaker 1>about the shadow [inaudible] young was </v>
<v Speaker 1>not someone you mess around with </v>

1387
01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:38.631
<v Speaker 1>lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1388
01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:42.930
<v Speaker 1>human shadow has roots that reach all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to hell and young meant that </v>

1389
01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:47.450
<v Speaker 1>that's no metaphor for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he might not have meant it in the </v>

1390
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:50.511
<v Speaker 1>same way that a fundamentalist Christian</v>
<v Speaker 1>from from the southern us might mean it,</v>

1391
01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:56.690
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that young men to in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that's far more terrifying and also </v>

1392
01:18:56.690 --> 01:19:00.831
<v Speaker 1>far more true so and Cain was very wroth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his countenance fell,</v>

1393
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:12.370
<v Speaker 1>so there's able burning is offering away</v>
<v Speaker 1>there at least in this sort of </v>

1394
01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:20.100
<v Speaker 1>relationship with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call them the archetypical figure </v>

1395
01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:25.510
<v Speaker 1>of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the archetypical father,</v>

1396
01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:29.200
<v Speaker 1>and it's something he respects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

1397
01:19:29.201 --> 01:19:32.650
<v Speaker 1>It's an indication that the postures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the indication of respect</v>

1398
01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:39.690
<v Speaker 1>and then there's cane in the background </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see his face is in shadow and </v>

1399
01:19:39.690 --> 01:19:43.141
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's jealous of what's happening here </v>

1400
01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:48.930
<v Speaker 1>and he's going through the motions </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps and maybe God just doesn't like </v>

1401
01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:48.930
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know,</v>

1402
01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:53.340
<v Speaker 1>but he's going through the motions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not very happy about it and you </v>

1403
01:19:53.791 --> 01:19:55.710
<v Speaker 1>know that that's actually a phrase that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could.</v>

1404
01:19:56.130 --> 01:20:00.450
<v Speaker 1>You could carve into many people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tombstones as an epitaph for their life,</v>

1405
01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:04.440
<v Speaker 1>which would be went through the motions </v>
<v Speaker 1>but wasn't very happy about it.</v>

1406
01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:13.240
<v Speaker 1>This is really an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1407
01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:18.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know what God's doing here </v>

1408
01:20:18.241 --> 01:20:21.691
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's helping ignite the sacrificial </v>

1409
01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:26.131
<v Speaker 1>flame and that's kind of an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea I think because you know,</v>

1410
01:20:27.071 --> 01:20:29.800
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you have an impulse to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a sacrifice.</v>

1411
01:20:29.801 --> 01:20:31.540
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1412
01:20:31.541 --> 01:20:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I should change this about my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1413
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:34.600
<v Speaker 1>What's like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that come from?</v>

1414
01:20:34.601 --> 01:20:39.601
<v Speaker 1>That impulse is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well just manifests itself out of </v>

1415
01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:40.810
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what word you came up with it?</v>

1416
01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might want to stop thinking about </v>

1417
01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.870
<v Speaker 1>that thinking so surely that you come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your own thoughts.</v>

1418
01:20:46.871 --> 01:20:49.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't come up with your damn dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you?</v>

1419
01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:53.230
<v Speaker 1>They just happen and God only knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they come from.</v>

1420
01:20:53.231 --> 01:20:55.120
<v Speaker 1>They come from your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy,</v>

1421
01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:58.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a sophisticated answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come from your unconscious.</v>

1422
01:20:58.660 --> 01:20:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not much better.</v>

1423
01:20:59.831 --> 01:21:02.470
<v Speaker 1>At least it's somewhat better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are those matt,</v>

1424
01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:06.640
<v Speaker 1>amazing dramas take place in the theater</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your imagination at night.</v>

1425
01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:10.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't even understand what they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet they occur night after night and</v>

1426
01:21:10.961 --> 01:21:11.950
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

1427
01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:15.220
<v Speaker 1>They can contain wisdom that it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1428
01:21:15.221 --> 01:21:17.800
<v Speaker 1>it just staggers the person who has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>

1429
01:21:17.801 --> 01:21:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Once they get the key to the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they remembered,</v>

1430
01:21:20.171 --> 01:21:21.190
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

1431
01:21:21.191 --> 01:21:24.690
<v Speaker 1>you just revealed a bunch of wisdom to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself that you didn't know what.</v>

1432
01:21:24.691 --> 01:21:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Where'd that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1433
01:21:26.861 --> 01:21:29.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How in the world can you dream up things</v>

1434
01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:32.110
<v Speaker 1>that you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one.</v>

1435
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we'll talk about that at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in this lecture series because </v>

1436
01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:39.130
<v Speaker 1>there are some reasonable things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be said about that,</v>

1437
01:21:39.131 --> 01:21:40.600
<v Speaker 1>but you know the idea of that</v>

1438
01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:45.330
<v Speaker 1>there's something that's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would call it the self.</v>

1439
01:21:45.331 --> 01:21:50.331
<v Speaker 1>Carl Jung would call it the self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he thought of it as the totality </v>

1440
01:21:50.331 --> 01:21:53.721
<v Speaker 1>of your being across time and space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and that you </v>

1441
01:21:53.721 --> 01:21:55.800
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each second that you exist is a slice of</v>

1442
01:21:55.801 --> 01:22:00.801
<v Speaker 1>the self manifesting itself across time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and space and he thought of the self is </v>

1443
01:22:00.801 --> 01:22:05.600
<v Speaker 1>partly the voice of conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that is that helps guide you </v>

1444
01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:10.460
<v Speaker 1>when you have to make a difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision and a difficult decision might </v>

1445
01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:10.460
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1446
01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:11.220
<v Speaker 1>what do I need to sacrifice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

1447
01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:13.210
<v Speaker 1>how do I need to discipline myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1448
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.200
<v Speaker 1>What do I need to for go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1449
01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.380
<v Speaker 1>how do you figure those things out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1450
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:23.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just picture is trying to put </v>

1451
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:25.341
<v Speaker 1>forth the idea that perhaps if you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>establish the proper relationship with </v>

1452
01:22:25.341 --> 01:22:26.970
<v Speaker 1>God the father and we've talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that might mean,</v>

1453
01:22:27.210 --> 01:22:32.210
<v Speaker 1>then he would help figure out how to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sacrificial fires burning so that </v>

1454
01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:36.810
<v Speaker 1>you could stay in a proper relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him across time.</v>

1455
01:22:37.050 --> 01:22:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's such an unreasonable </v>

1456
01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:42.050
<v Speaker 1>proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the alternative proposition?</v>

1457
01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't working out very well,</v>

1458
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.050
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1459
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Kate seems to be doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

1460
01:22:49.021 --> 01:22:54.021
<v Speaker 1>It's like he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he thinks he can only do it himself </v>

1461
01:22:54.021 --> 01:22:55.020
<v Speaker 1>or maybe he wants only to take credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it or something like that,</v>

1462
01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.340
<v Speaker 1>he's not in this</v>

1463
01:22:59.710 --> 01:23:01.030
<v Speaker 1>grateful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1464
01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 1>and inquiring grateful and inquiring </v>
<v Speaker 1>posture because</v>

1465
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.690
<v Speaker 3>that's what a prayer for posture should </v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

1466
01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:09.970
<v Speaker 3>It should be grateful and inquiring and </v>
<v Speaker 3>grateful is,</v>

1467
01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:13.630
<v Speaker 3>thank God things aren't worse for me </v>
<v Speaker 3>than they are,</v>

1468
01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:18.840
<v Speaker 3>and you shouldn't be grateful about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they could be a lot worse than </v>

1469
01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.991
<v Speaker 3>they are mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can be so bad and inquiring would </v>

1470
01:23:21.991 --> 01:23:21.991
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1471
01:23:21.991 --> 01:23:24.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know how I could make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

1472
01:23:24.101 --> 01:23:26.380
<v Speaker 3>but I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm open to suggestions,</v>

1473
01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:28.240
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I can figure out how to do it all,</v>

1474
01:23:28.241 --> 01:23:29.680
<v Speaker 3>try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>

1475
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:34.450
<v Speaker 3>That's the humility and the inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a humble inquiry.</v>

1476
01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:37.930
<v Speaker 3>How could I make things better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that and that's what</v>

1477
01:23:37.931 --> 01:23:40.720
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices do I need to make in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make things better.</v>

1478
01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:46.230
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question to ask yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could ask yourself that every </v>

1479
01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:48.820
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what sacrifice do I have to make to make</v>

1480
01:23:48.821 --> 01:23:52.330
<v Speaker 3>things better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can decide what constitutes better.</v>

1481
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:57.390
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's not even as if it's being </v>

1482
01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:58.270
<v Speaker 3>imposed on you come up with your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>notion of what constitutes better.</v>

1483
01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:00.030
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we try to make it sophisticated.</v>

1484
01:24:00.050 --> 01:24:03.610
<v Speaker 3>Should just be better for you because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that isn't going to work very well.</v>

1485
01:24:03.611 --> 01:24:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1486
01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:09.840
<v Speaker 3>you're just gonna fall down stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do that because you have to live </v>

1487
01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.000
<v Speaker 3>with other people and besides stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>

1488
01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:15.001
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do like can't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>just nothing you could even say about </v>

1489
01:24:15.011 --> 01:24:17.350
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so that that's the.</v>

1490
01:24:17.410 --> 01:24:22.410
<v Speaker 3>That's the attitude of a very badly </v>
<v Speaker 3>behaved hyper aggressive two year old </v>

1491
01:24:22.410 --> 01:24:25.540
<v Speaker 3>and I mean that technically and so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could.</v>

1492
01:24:26.410 --> 01:24:27.850
<v Speaker 3>You could ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1493
01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.690
<v Speaker 3>how I have this day that lays itself out</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of me?</v>

1494
01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:37.080
<v Speaker 3>What thing could I let go of that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>impeding my progress that if I let go of</v>

1495
01:24:37.661 --> 01:24:40.690
<v Speaker 3>would make my life better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my family's life better,</v>

1496
01:24:40.691 --> 01:24:44.230
<v Speaker 3>my culture is life better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my being better,</v>

1497
01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.020
<v Speaker 3>and then that would give you something </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do for the day,</v>

1498
01:24:47.021 --> 01:24:52.021
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it into justify your miserable </v>
<v Speaker 3>life because you need that.</v>

1499
01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:55.630
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole point of the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>story of Adam and eve.</v>

1500
01:24:55.930 --> 01:24:58.150
<v Speaker 3>What do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A miserable life?</v>

1501
01:24:58.630 --> 01:25:02.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what am I going to do about that?</v>

1502
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:04.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just have a miserable life,</v>

1503
01:25:04.691 --> 01:25:07.510
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to suffer stupidly and</v>
<v Speaker 3>get bitter about it.</v>

1504
01:25:07.511 --> 01:25:09.130
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens to cane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1505
01:25:09.131 --> 01:25:10.300
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about not doing that?</v>

1506
01:25:10.301 --> 01:25:13.720
<v Speaker 3>Because that seems to just take a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal and make it worse.</v>

1507
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:18.990
<v Speaker 3>How about making a sacrifice and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can please God and put being on </v>

1508
01:25:20.081 --> 01:25:21.880
<v Speaker 3>track?</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1509
01:25:21.881 --> 01:25:25.450
<v Speaker 3>that'd be something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What could be better than that?</v>

1510
01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.110
<v Speaker 3>What could possibly be better than that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1511
01:25:29.111 --> 01:25:31.750
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's archetipal ban because </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing's better than that.</v>

1512
01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.190
<v Speaker 3>That's where it tops out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you can do that,</v>

1513
01:25:36.191 --> 01:25:41.191
<v Speaker 3>you could do that every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to do it in a little way </v>

1514
01:25:41.191 --> 01:25:44.011
<v Speaker 3>because like what good are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you're not going to go and </v>

1515
01:25:44.011 --> 01:25:47.560
<v Speaker 3>bring this socialist utopia and to being</v>
<v Speaker 3>in one fell swoop.</v>

1516
01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:02.170
<v Speaker 3>You might also think that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things came mind figure out here.</v>

1517
01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:04.730
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of things that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't going right for him,</v>

1518
01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:09.830
<v Speaker 3>downwind of the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the right place to blow from,</v>

1519
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:16.570
<v Speaker 3>and the fact that he's in hen galloped </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Hayes and smoke and breathing it in </v>

1520
01:26:16.570 --> 01:26:20.981
<v Speaker 3>and the fire isn't burning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be an indication that he's doing </v>

1521
01:26:20.981 --> 01:26:23.510
<v Speaker 3>something wrong or he could be wiping </v>
<v Speaker 3>his eyes and say,</v>

1522
01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.840
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of stupid bloody universe </v>

1523
01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:28.840
<v Speaker 3>would produce smoke like this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1524
01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.710
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's the more likely outcome,</v>

1525
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:38.350
<v Speaker 5>and the Lord said unto Cain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why Art Thou wroth and why is they </v>

1526
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:43.331
<v Speaker 5>countenance fallen if they'll do as well</v>
<v Speaker 5>shalt thou not be accepted.</v>

1527
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:49.790
<v Speaker 5>Now that's an interesting line because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've looked at a variety of </v>

1528
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:53.580
<v Speaker 5>different translations of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is seventh verse here,</v>

1529
01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:57.090
<v Speaker 5>like a bunch of them because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>translation for that,</v>

1530
01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.120
<v Speaker 5>that's a critical line and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>translation really matters and so I'll </v>

1531
01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.720
<v Speaker 5>tell you what I think the story is what </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been able to figure out,</v>

1532
01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.420
<v Speaker 5>and I'm sure I haven't got it completely</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1533
01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:06.870
<v Speaker 5>but it's</v>

1534
01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.830
<v Speaker 3>so he asks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God says to him,</v>

1535
01:27:12.010 --> 01:27:14.020
<v Speaker 3>if you do well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>won't you be accepted?</v>

1536
01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:15.670
<v Speaker 3>There's a hint there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1537
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:16.960
<v Speaker 3>It's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1538
01:27:16.961 --> 01:27:21.961
<v Speaker 3>things aren't going so well for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the first thing you might think is </v>

1539
01:27:22.090 --> 01:27:24.730
<v Speaker 3>you're not doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

1540
01:27:24.731 --> 01:27:29.731
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that not mean you're not acting </v>

1541
01:27:29.731 --> 01:27:32.521
<v Speaker 3>properly means it's the hint because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>is suggesting that if you are doing </v>

1542
01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.290
<v Speaker 3>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would be</v>

1543
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:41.050
<v Speaker 5>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a friend at one point who was a </v>

1544
01:27:41.050 --> 01:27:45.431
<v Speaker 5>very bitter person and he had a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 5>problems and some of them were self </v>

1545
01:27:45.651 --> 01:27:48.200
<v Speaker 5>inflicted and some of them were fate I </v>
<v Speaker 5>suppose,</v>

1546
01:27:48.201 --> 01:27:50.120
<v Speaker 5>and he had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>

1547
01:27:50.150 --> 01:27:52.100
<v Speaker 5>he had become very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very destructive,</v>

1548
01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:53.480
<v Speaker 5>murderously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>destructive,</v>

1549
01:27:53.481 --> 01:27:55.370
<v Speaker 5>genocidally destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say.</v>

1550
01:27:55.371 --> 01:28:00.371
<v Speaker 5>You could see it in his dreams and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he lived with me for awhile and I </v>

1551
01:28:02.331 --> 01:28:07.331
<v Speaker 5>knew him very well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a friend of mine from the time I </v>

1552
01:28:07.331 --> 01:28:09.521
<v Speaker 5>was 12 until the time he committed </v>
<v Speaker 5>suicide when he was about 40 and when he</v>

1553
01:28:10.831 --> 01:28:12.930
<v Speaker 5>lived with me I was trying to help him </v>
<v Speaker 5>get on his feet,</v>

1554
01:28:12.931 --> 01:28:16.470
<v Speaker 5>which was why he had come to live with </v>
<v Speaker 5>me because he thought maybe I could help</v>

1555
01:28:16.471 --> 01:28:17.670
<v Speaker 5>him get up on his feet</v>

1556
01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:21.770
<v Speaker 3>and he could only take relatively low </v>
<v Speaker 3>level jobs.</v>

1557
01:28:21.771 --> 01:28:23.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he had some mechanical ability,</v>

1558
01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:25.040
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't get educated.</v>

1559
01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:26.510
<v Speaker 3>Although he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very smart person.</v>

1560
01:28:26.511 --> 01:28:29.240
<v Speaker 3>He probably had an Iq of about 135 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1561
01:28:29.241 --> 01:28:33.110
<v Speaker 3>He's very smart and so he was bitter too</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he hadn't educated themselves to</v>

1562
01:28:33.111 --> 01:28:34.440
<v Speaker 3>the level that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

1563
01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:35.650
<v Speaker 3>it's intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abandoned.</v>

1564
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:39.240
<v Speaker 3>So we had to take jobs that were beneath</v>
<v Speaker 3>him intellectually and he had a real.</v>

1565
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:41.390
<v Speaker 3>He had that real intellectual arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1566
01:28:41.670 --> 01:28:46.670
<v Speaker 3>because he was smart and really smart </v>
<v Speaker 3>people often come to believe that only </v>

1567
01:28:46.911 --> 01:28:51.911
<v Speaker 3>smart matters and if they're smart and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that and all that matters is smart </v>

1568
01:28:51.911 --> 01:28:56.891
<v Speaker 3>and then the world isn't sort of laying </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself at their feet and they've been </v>

1569
01:28:56.891 --> 01:29:00.551
<v Speaker 3>terribly betrayed and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they cling to their </v>

1570
01:29:00.551 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is more like a talent or a gift.</v>

1571
01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:04.260
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like it's an idol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1572
01:29:04.261 --> 01:29:09.261
<v Speaker 3>a false idol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what it is in a very </v>

1573
01:29:09.261 --> 01:29:11.631
<v Speaker 3>dangerous one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And get cynical about the stupidity of </v>

1574
01:29:11.631 --> 01:29:15.651
<v Speaker 3>the world and the fact that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>talents weren't properly recognized and </v>

1575
01:29:15.651 --> 01:29:15.790
<v Speaker 3>that's just not that helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1576
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:18.150
<v Speaker 3>because smart is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'll tell you,</v>

1577
01:29:18.151 --> 01:29:23.151
<v Speaker 3>if you don't use it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will devour you just like all </v>

1578
01:29:23.151 --> 01:29:23.730
<v Speaker 3>arbitrarily assigned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell it right.</v>

1579
01:29:23.731 --> 01:29:26.160
<v Speaker 3>So you might have a talent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's your friend.</v>

1580
01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:31.161
<v Speaker 3>If you use it properly and do misuse it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be your enemy and maybe that's </v>

1581
01:29:31.261 --> 01:29:33.870
<v Speaker 3>how God keeps the cosmic scales </v>
<v Speaker 3>adjusted.</v>

1582
01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.570
<v Speaker 3>But anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend was a very smart person,</v>

1583
01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:41.460
<v Speaker 3>although not as smart as he thought he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was unfortunately and but he hadn't done</v>

1584
01:29:41.461 --> 01:29:46.461
<v Speaker 3>what would have been necessary with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence to make it manifest itself </v>

1585
01:29:46.461 --> 01:29:50.160
<v Speaker 3>properly in the world and that also </v>
<v Speaker 3>embittered him because he also knew that</v>

1586
01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:55.730
<v Speaker 3>there was more that he could have done </v>
<v Speaker 3>if he would have done it and perhaps </v>

1587
01:29:55.730 --> 01:29:58.971
<v Speaker 3>more that he could still do what I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggesting to him while he was living </v>

1588
01:29:58.971 --> 01:30:03.410
<v Speaker 3>with us because he was two levels from </v>
<v Speaker 3>homeless by that point was that he </v>

1589
01:30:04.471 --> 01:30:08.460
<v Speaker 3>should find a job that he could find </v>
<v Speaker 3>working in a garage,</v>

1590
01:30:08.461 --> 01:30:13.461
<v Speaker 3>working in a shop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that because he had some </v>

1591
01:30:13.461 --> 01:30:13.461
<v Speaker 3>mechanical ability and that he should </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

1592
01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:19.820
<v Speaker 3>He should separate himself from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrogance that made him presume that </v>

1593
01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:24.081
<v Speaker 3>such a job would be beneath him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because at that point no job was beneath</v>

1594
01:30:24.661 --> 01:30:24.960
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1595
01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:29.961
<v Speaker 3>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not so obvious that jobs are </v>

1596
01:30:29.961 --> 01:30:30.540
<v Speaker 3>beneath people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1597
01:30:30.541 --> 01:30:35.541
<v Speaker 3>because even if you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if imagine you have a job as a </v>

1598
01:30:35.541 --> 01:30:39.300
<v Speaker 3>checkout person in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a grocery store,</v>

1599
01:30:39.301 --> 01:30:41.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a fairly unskilled job,</v>

1600
01:30:41.370 --> 01:30:43.680
<v Speaker 3>you can be some miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>resentful,</v>

1601
01:30:43.681 --> 01:30:45.960
<v Speaker 3>horrid bastard doing that job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>

1602
01:30:46.230 --> 01:30:51.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can come in there and just exuding </v>

1603
01:30:51.230 --> 01:30:53.151
<v Speaker 3>resentment and bitterness and making </v>
<v Speaker 3>mistakes and making sure that every </v>

1604
01:30:53.151 --> 01:30:57.741
<v Speaker 3>customer that passes by you has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly worse day than they need to </v>

1605
01:30:57.741 --> 01:30:58.710
<v Speaker 3>write and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1606
01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:03.890
<v Speaker 3>pilfering time and perhaps pilfering </v>
<v Speaker 3>goods and being resentful about the </v>

1607
01:31:03.890 --> 01:31:08.571
<v Speaker 3>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who gave you the position because they </v>

1608
01:31:08.571 --> 01:31:09.570
<v Speaker 3>are above you in the dominance hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and talking,</v>

1609
01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad things.</v>

1610
01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Gossiping behind the back of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>coworkers is like,</v>

1611
01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:18.710
<v Speaker 3>you can take your menial position self </v>
<v Speaker 3>described and turn that into a very nice</v>

1612
01:31:19.651 --> 01:31:21.870
<v Speaker 3>little slice of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

1613
01:31:22.050 --> 01:31:23.700
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go into places like that.</v>

1614
01:31:23.701 --> 01:31:25.920
<v Speaker 3>I always think of the archetypical diner</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that way.</v>

1615
01:31:25.921 --> 01:31:27.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys have been in this diner.</v>

1616
01:31:28.110 --> 01:31:33.110
<v Speaker 3>There's a really good opposite diner and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a great video on youtube.</v>

1617
01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:37.630
<v Speaker 3>It's Tom waits reading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reading a poem by Makowsky.</v>

1618
01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:43.100
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's called Nirvana and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a good diner that he happened to </v>

1619
01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:45.930
<v Speaker 3>visit because he happened to visit when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was on a bus when he was,</v>

1620
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:49.320
<v Speaker 3>when he was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a diner where everything was going well.</v>

1621
01:31:49.321 --> 01:31:50.910
<v Speaker 3>And you could listen to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

1622
01:31:50.911 --> 01:31:55.911
<v Speaker 3>I think it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is the opposite diner I'm </v>

1623
01:31:55.911 --> 01:31:55.911
<v Speaker 3>thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'll go into a diner,</v>

1624
01:31:55.911 --> 01:31:55.911
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1625
01:31:55.911 --> 01:32:00.650
<v Speaker 3>It's 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning and you order some bacon </v>

1626
01:32:00.650 --> 01:32:03.990
<v Speaker 3>and eggs and some toast and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look around in the diner and you think </v>

1627
01:32:04.330 --> 01:32:09.330
<v Speaker 3>it was 1975 when the windows were last </v>
<v Speaker 3>washed and there's this kind of thick </v>

1628
01:32:09.371 --> 01:32:13.150
<v Speaker 3>coating of who gives a damn grease on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the walls,</v>

1629
01:32:13.151 --> 01:32:13.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1630
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:18.750
<v Speaker 3>and the floor to has got that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stickiness that you really have to work </v>

1631
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:19.620
<v Speaker 3>out to develop over years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1632
01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:24.630
<v Speaker 3>and the waitress is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not happy to be there and the guy </v>

1633
01:32:24.630 --> 01:32:27.781
<v Speaker 3>behind the counter isn't happy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens to be the waitress that </v>

1634
01:32:27.781 --> 01:32:27.781
<v Speaker 3>he's working with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1635
01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:33.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you walk down the stairs maybe to the </v>

1636
01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:35.071
<v Speaker 3>washroom and now it's its own little </v>
<v Speaker 3>trip and so you come back and you order </v>

1637
01:32:35.261 --> 01:32:38.800
<v Speaker 3>your damn eggs and your order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your toast in the order your bacon,</v>

1638
01:32:38.801 --> 01:32:43.801
<v Speaker 3>and then it comes in like the eggs are </v>
<v Speaker 3>too cooked on the bottom.</v>

1639
01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:49.290
<v Speaker 3>So they're kind of brown and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're kind of raw on top and they're </v>

1640
01:32:49.290 --> 01:32:49.750
<v Speaker 3>called in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

1641
01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:52.240
<v Speaker 3>you really have to work their cooking an</v>
<v Speaker 3>egg like that man.</v>

1642
01:32:52.241 --> 01:32:55.600
<v Speaker 3>But you can master that with like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of bitterness.</v>

1643
01:32:55.601 --> 01:32:58.960
<v Speaker 3>You teach how to cook an egg like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the toast,</v>

1644
01:32:58.961 --> 01:33:00.490
<v Speaker 3>here's what you do at the toast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1645
01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:02.260
<v Speaker 3>You put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take,</v>

1646
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:07.790
<v Speaker 3>you take the white bread,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the priestly based stuff that </v>

1647
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:08.950
<v Speaker 3>no one should ever eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you put that in the toaster and</v>

1648
01:33:08.951 --> 01:33:13.330
<v Speaker 3>you overcook it and then you wait and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you pop it out of the toaster.</v>

1649
01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:18.480
<v Speaker 3>And then because it's overcooked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you scrape it off and you knock off the </v>

1650
01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:22.591
<v Speaker 3>crumbs so it doesn't look too bird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you wait until it's cold and </v>

1651
01:33:22.591 --> 01:33:24.460
<v Speaker 3>then you put cold margin on it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you put cold,</v>

1652
01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:25.870
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not butter,</v>

1653
01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:31.140
<v Speaker 3>but if you put cold margin or you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>also kind of tear holes in it so that </v>

1654
01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:34.871
<v Speaker 3>then it has lumps of margarine in it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really dry except where it's too </v>

1655
01:33:34.871 --> 01:33:39.781
<v Speaker 3>greasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's like it's own little work of </v>

1656
01:33:39.781 --> 01:33:42.031
<v Speaker 3>art man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you put that on the side with </v>

1657
01:33:42.031 --> 01:33:42.031
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

1658
01:33:42.670 --> 01:33:47.670
<v Speaker 3>with the eggs and then you have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>potatoes and this is how you cook the </v>

1659
01:33:47.670 --> 01:33:47.670
<v Speaker 3>potatoes properly.</v>

1660
01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:54.960
<v Speaker 3>So their leftover potatoes and you keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>dumping new leftover potatoes into the </v>

1661
01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:58.060
<v Speaker 3>old leftover potatoes over weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so some of the potatoes,</v>

1662
01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.170
<v Speaker 3>if they're no longer potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1663
01:34:00.930 --> 01:34:05.930
<v Speaker 3>They've have returned to mother earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you flop them on the grill and you </v>

1664
01:34:08.561 --> 01:34:12.190
<v Speaker 3>sort of know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you burden them a bit I guess.</v>

1665
01:34:12.191 --> 01:34:15.370
<v Speaker 3>And then you slap them on the plate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

1666
01:34:15.371 --> 01:34:18.820
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to throw those man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

1667
01:34:18.821 --> 01:34:23.821
<v Speaker 3>And that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have the bake and then you </v>

1668
01:34:23.821 --> 01:34:26.380
<v Speaker 3>want to make sure you buy the lowest </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible quality bacon.</v>

1669
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Not that that's how you start and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you throw it on the grill and you don't.</v>

1670
01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:34.210
<v Speaker 3>Your grill has to be overheated to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1671
01:34:34.211 --> 01:34:38.860
<v Speaker 3>you have to cook the Bacon so that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>raw in places and burned in other places</v>

1672
01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:42.070
<v Speaker 3>and it has that delightful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like older.</v>

1673
01:34:42.071 --> 01:34:47.071
<v Speaker 3>They'd only really cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>badly cooked bacon can provide or maybe </v>

1674
01:34:47.071 --> 01:34:51.391
<v Speaker 3>you use those little breakfast sausages </v>
<v Speaker 3>that no one in their bloody right mind </v>

1675
01:34:51.391 --> 01:34:52.840
<v Speaker 3>would let within 15 feet of anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>living,</v>

1676
01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:58.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you serve that right and you </v>

1677
01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:58.250
<v Speaker 3>serve it with the kind of orange juice</v>

1678
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:03.250
<v Speaker 1>that is only orange in color and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

1679
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:10.721
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say it was started too </v>

1680
01:35:10.721 --> 01:35:12.530
<v Speaker 1>early in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>

1681
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Bad quality coffee started too early in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning.</v>

1682
01:35:17.130 --> 01:35:22.130
<v Speaker 1>God called once or twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has been reheated and then you serve </v>

1683
01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:26.100
<v Speaker 1>that with whitener.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1684
01:35:26.670 --> 01:35:28.730
<v Speaker 1>here's your breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1685
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:31.220
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not breakfast.</v>

1686
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:32.300
<v Speaker 1>That's Hell</v>

1687
01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:39.130
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1688
01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:46.040
<v Speaker 1>And you created it and then what you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a diner like that is because</v>

1689
01:35:46.041 --> 01:35:48.620
<v Speaker 1>you have a miserable life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a diner like that and you've</v>

1690
01:35:48.621 --> 01:35:53.621
<v Speaker 1>really worked on achieving that is every</v>
<v Speaker 1>night you go home and you curse your </v>

1691
01:35:53.621 --> 01:35:57.670
<v Speaker 1>wife and you curse your kids and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking well curse God to for producing </v>

1692
01:35:57.921 --> 01:36:02.921
<v Speaker 1>a universe where a diner like yours is </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to exist and that's your bloody </v>

1693
01:36:02.921 --> 01:36:07.811
<v Speaker 1>life so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what God's trying to point out</v>

1694
01:36:08.091 --> 01:36:13.091
<v Speaker 1>here is if thou shalt thou not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted,</v>

1695
01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:27.880
<v Speaker 1>and if they'll do a snort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then sin lies at your door.</v>

1696
01:36:28.210 --> 01:36:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>

1697
01:36:29.110 --> 01:36:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I looked at lots of translations for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and actually the next line is an </v>

1698
01:36:34.110 --> 01:36:36.280
<v Speaker 1>unto these unto thee shall be his </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire.</v>

1699
01:36:36.670 --> 01:36:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What God actually says.</v>

1700
01:36:40.191 --> 01:36:41.330
<v Speaker 1>It's something like this is like,</v>

1701
01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:44.540
<v Speaker 1>you know things aren't going so well for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1702
01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:46.190
<v Speaker 1>but if you were behaving properly they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

1703
01:36:46.191 --> 01:36:47.510
<v Speaker 1>but instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you've done.</v>

1704
01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Sin came to your door and send means to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull your Arrow back into miss the </v>

1705
01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:52.670
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sin came to your door,</v>

1706
01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:58.060
<v Speaker 1>but he uses a metaphor and the metaphor </v>
<v Speaker 1>is something like sin came to your door </v>

1707
01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:01.901
<v Speaker 1>like this sexually aroused Cap Predator </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and you invited to Dan first and </v>

1708
01:37:06.291 --> 01:37:11.291
<v Speaker 1>then you let it have its way with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you entered into a creative.</v>

1709
01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:17.170
<v Speaker 1>He uses a sexual metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You entered into a creative exchange </v>

1710
01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:21.251
<v Speaker 1>with it and gave birth to something as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence in that what you gave birth </v>

1711
01:37:21.251 --> 01:37:25.751
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's your life and and you knew </v>

1712
01:37:25.751 --> 01:37:26.450
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your self conscious.</v>

1713
01:37:26.451 --> 01:37:29.750
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you knew you were doing this and you</v>

1714
01:37:32.210 --> 01:37:37.210
<v Speaker 1>conspired with this thing to produce the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that you're in.</v>

1715
01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:43.430
<v Speaker 1>You said something about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar about the Ed Mother's situation.</v>

1716
01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:47.120
<v Speaker 1>It was very politically incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he said,</v>

1717
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:52.550
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single thing that you wrote was </v>

1718
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:54.131
<v Speaker 1>politically incorrect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just how you could tell he was a </v>

1719
01:37:54.131 --> 01:37:57.671
<v Speaker 1>thinker by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talked about the unholy alliance </v>

1720
01:37:59.581 --> 01:38:03.690
<v Speaker 1>between hyper dependent children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mothers and he said,</v>

1721
01:38:03.691 --> 01:38:04.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually because you.</v>

1722
01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought about it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a maternal thing.</v>

1723
01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not putting fried down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud mapped out the whole situation </v>

1724
01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.470
<v Speaker 1>brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not putting four down,</v>

1725
01:38:13.650 --> 01:38:16.840
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young was taking the ideas and expanding</v>

1726
01:38:16.841 --> 01:38:18.300
<v Speaker 1>them outward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1727
01:38:18.330 --> 01:38:23.330
<v Speaker 1>he said that there was an actually an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unholy alliance between a hyper </v>

1728
01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:27.170
<v Speaker 1>dependent child and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they need to pull over dependent </v>

1729
01:38:27.170 --> 01:38:30.141
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the alliance was the mother would </v>

1730
01:38:30.141 --> 01:38:32.691
<v Speaker 1>always offer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe the kid is supposed to go off </v>

1731
01:38:32.691 --> 01:38:33.570
<v Speaker 1>and do something that would require a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of courage and effort</v>

1732
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000
<v Speaker 5>and the mother says,</v>

1733
01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:46.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you sure you're feeling well enough </v>

1734
01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:46.160
<v Speaker 1>to do it?</v>

1735
01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:47.750
<v Speaker 5>And then the child could say yes</v>

1736
01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:50.770
<v Speaker 1>or the child could say no and then</v>

1737
01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:52.820
<v Speaker 5>he put in bed and</v>

1738
01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:54.580
<v Speaker 1>baby did all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

1739
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:58.260
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is the child made the damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision to.</v>

1740
01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:00.240
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's pretty harsh,</v>

1741
01:39:00.241 --> 01:39:05.241
<v Speaker 1>but just because children are little </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean they're stupid and you </v>

1742
01:39:05.241 --> 01:39:10.071
<v Speaker 1>don't know children if you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how children know how to manipulate </v>

1743
01:39:10.071 --> 01:39:14.480
<v Speaker 1>because they are staggeringly good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because they're studying you </v>

1744
01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:16.980
<v Speaker 1>nonstop trying to figure out a what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're up to and B,</v>

1745
01:39:16.981 --> 01:39:19.830
<v Speaker 1>how they can get what they want in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that they wanted.</v>

1746
01:39:19.831 --> 01:39:22.620
<v Speaker 1>And so they can play a manipulative </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

1747
01:39:22.621 --> 01:39:27.621
<v Speaker 1>no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're well schooled in </v>

1748
01:39:27.621 --> 01:39:27.621
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's sort of like that.</v>

1749
01:39:27.621 --> 01:39:27.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe the mother is a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

1750
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:32.750
<v Speaker 1>a little timid and a little inclined to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overprotect and maybe the child is </v>

1751
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:36.330
<v Speaker 1>little manipulative and a little willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not take that courageous step out in </v>

1752
01:39:37.351 --> 01:39:42.090
<v Speaker 1>the world and to regress into infantiles</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependency instead.</v>

1753
01:39:42.091 --> 01:39:47.091
<v Speaker 1>And then you get a terrible dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>building across time that is like a </v>

1754
01:39:47.091 --> 01:39:47.320
<v Speaker 1>vicious circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1755
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:52.330
<v Speaker 1>or like a positive feedback loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just expands and expands and expands </v>

1756
01:39:52.330 --> 01:39:55.491
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes in families you see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper dependent child and a perfectly </v>

1757
01:39:55.491 --> 01:40:00.471
<v Speaker 1>independent child in st mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously same author I mother is </v>

1758
01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:05.720
<v Speaker 1>very complex and mother for child a and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother for child b are not the same </v>

1759
01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:06.630
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they happen to be the same human</v>

1760
01:40:06.631 --> 01:40:08.400
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That literature's quite clear on that,</v>

1761
01:40:08.610 --> 01:40:11.020
<v Speaker 1>but you get my point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God's idea was</v>

1762
01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:16.050
<v Speaker 1>not only are you not doing well because</v>

1763
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not doing well because you've</v>

1764
01:40:19.691 --> 01:40:23.530
<v Speaker 1>actually really spent a lot of work </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to not do well.</v>

1765
01:40:23.531 --> 01:40:28.531
<v Speaker 1>This is like creative effort on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>part and if you read about truly </v>

1766
01:40:28.931 --> 01:40:33.931
<v Speaker 1>malevolent people and you could start </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the columbine killers because they </v>

1767
01:40:33.931 --> 01:40:34.450
<v Speaker 1>left some very interesting diaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind,</v>

1768
01:40:34.630 --> 01:40:36.760
<v Speaker 1>so I would recommend them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

1769
01:40:36.850 --> 01:40:41.850
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of serial killers you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could read about in the people who've </v>

1770
01:40:41.850 --> 01:40:44.640
<v Speaker 1>really gone out and done dark things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read more than my fair share of </v>

1771
01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.400
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing and understand it </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite well.</v>

1772
01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:53.100
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>countenance fall and be wroth 10 years </v>

1773
01:40:53.621 --> 01:40:58.621
<v Speaker 1>of brooding on your own catastrophe sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of alone and letting your fantasies take</v>

1774
01:41:00.701 --> 01:41:05.701
<v Speaker 1>shape and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and egging them on and and allowing them</v>

1775
01:41:06.041 --> 01:41:10.030
<v Speaker 1>to flourish and let's say take </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession of you because that's exactly</v>

1776
01:41:10.031 --> 01:41:15.031
<v Speaker 1>the right way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll get you somewhere like this and </v>

1777
01:41:15.791 --> 01:41:20.791
<v Speaker 1>there are more people who are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you think and your more like that </v>

1778
01:41:20.791 --> 01:41:25.261
<v Speaker 1>than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1779
01:41:25.731 --> 01:41:28.490
<v Speaker 1>so Kane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's obviously not very happy about this</v>

1780
01:41:28.491 --> 01:41:31.640
<v Speaker 1>whole answer obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the last thing you want to hear,</v>

1781
01:41:31.641 --> 01:41:35.960
<v Speaker 1>if your life is turned into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe and you take God to task for</v>

1782
01:41:35.961 --> 01:41:40.961
<v Speaker 1>creating a universe where that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing was allowed is that it's your own </v>

1783
01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:43.010
<v Speaker 1>damn fault and you should straighten up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fly,</v>

1784
01:41:43.011 --> 01:41:44.120
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1785
01:41:44.150 --> 01:41:47.390
<v Speaker 1>and you shouldn't be complaining about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of being,</v>

1786
01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:51.800
<v Speaker 1>but that is the answer he gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what happens?</v>

1787
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to infer that if cain was angry </v>

1788
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:58.880
<v Speaker 1>before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a lot more angry now,</v>

1789
01:41:59.090 --> 01:42:03.620
<v Speaker 1>and of course that's exactly what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story reveals,</v>

1790
01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:05.390
<v Speaker 1>and Cain talked with Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his brother,</v>

1791
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:12.490
<v Speaker 1>and it came to pass when they were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the field that Cain rose up against </v>

1792
01:42:12.490 --> 01:42:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his brother,</v>

1793
01:42:12.490 --> 01:42:12.490
<v Speaker 1>and slew him.</v>

1794
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read you something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1795
01:42:19.190 --> 01:42:24.190
<v Speaker 1>This is foreshadowing again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is from the same chapter by the </v>

1796
01:42:24.190 --> 01:42:24.890
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what is meaningful,</v>

1797
01:42:24.891 --> 01:42:29.891
<v Speaker 1>not what is expedient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus was led into the wilderness </v>

1798
01:42:29.891 --> 01:42:29.891
<v Speaker 1>according to the story to be tempted by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the devil.</v>

1799
01:42:29.891 --> 01:42:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Matthew four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one prior to his crucifixion,</v>

1800
01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:36.470
<v Speaker 1>this is the story of Cain restated </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractly,</v>

1801
01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:40.580
<v Speaker 1>cane as far from happy as we have seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's working hard or so,</v>

1802
01:42:40.581 --> 01:42:42.290
<v Speaker 1>he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God is not pleased.</v>

1803
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>able is dancing away in the daisies.</v>

1804
01:42:45.291 --> 01:42:47.270
<v Speaker 1>His crops flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women love him.</v>

1805
01:42:47.630 --> 01:42:49.670
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a pretty good guy.</v>

1806
01:42:50.150 --> 01:42:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He deserves his good fortune.</v>

1807
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:57.010
<v Speaker 1>All the more reason to hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to joke when I.</v>

1808
01:42:57.010 --> 01:43:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I used to teach at Harvard now and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife would have some of the </v>

1809
01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:04.901
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to joke afterwards because some </v>

1810
01:43:04.901 --> 01:43:04.901
<v Speaker 1>of them were very.</v>

1811
01:43:04.901 --> 01:43:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Many of them were very remarkable kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1812
01:43:06.231 --> 01:43:08.810
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were super smart.</v>

1813
01:43:08.811 --> 01:43:13.811
<v Speaker 1>They were athletic or they had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic ability or they were musicians </v>

1814
01:43:13.811 --> 01:43:17.801
<v Speaker 1>or they done some spectacular charitable</v>
<v Speaker 1>work because he basically to get </v>

1815
01:43:17.801 --> 01:43:21.731
<v Speaker 1>accepted into Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to be top of your damn school </v>

1816
01:43:21.731 --> 01:43:23.600
<v Speaker 1>and then you had to have at least two </v>
<v Speaker 1>other outstanding things going for you,</v>

1817
01:43:23.601 --> 01:43:28.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what was so annoying about most of </v>

1818
01:43:28.601 --> 01:43:28.601
<v Speaker 1>these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was our joke,</v>

1819
01:43:28.601 --> 01:43:30.410
<v Speaker 1>was you really both liked them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>respected them.</v>

1820
01:43:30.411 --> 01:43:31.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1821
01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:36.700
<v Speaker 1>My joke was you'd think they would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>had the good graces to be like </v>

1822
01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:38.030
<v Speaker 1>dislikable sons of bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least with all the,</v>

1823
01:43:38.031 --> 01:43:40.970
<v Speaker 1>all those other great things going for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1824
01:43:40.971 --> 01:43:44.780
<v Speaker 1>They had to add like respectability and </v>
<v Speaker 1>likability to it as well.</v>

1825
01:43:44.781 --> 01:43:45.740
<v Speaker 1>So you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1826
01:43:45.741 --> 01:43:50.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really couldn't happen to a better </v>

1827
01:43:50.741 --> 01:43:50.741
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1828
01:43:50.741 --> 01:43:50.741
<v Speaker 1>good God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

1829
01:43:50.741 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's able to situation,</v>

1830
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:52.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1831
01:43:53.150 --> 01:43:58.150
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the funny thing too is that that's an </v>

1832
01:43:58.150 --> 01:43:58.150
<v Speaker 3>ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the ideal,</v>

1833
01:43:58.150 --> 01:43:58.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because an ideal person,</v>

1834
01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.640
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be someone who you would want to </v>

1835
01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:07.481
<v Speaker 3>be like and someone who is operating in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world like you would want to </v>

1836
01:44:07.481 --> 01:44:12.221
<v Speaker 3>operate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And someone who fortune was smiling on </v>

1837
01:44:12.221 --> 01:44:12.440
<v Speaker 3>and someone who was making the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices.</v>

1838
01:44:12.441 --> 01:44:17.441
<v Speaker 3>It's really what you would want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so cain kills that,</v>

1839
01:44:19.890 --> 01:44:22.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a psychological story too,</v>

1840
01:44:22.170 --> 01:44:27.170
<v Speaker 3>and you see this in the cynicism that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have about people who have done </v>

1841
01:44:27.691 --> 01:44:32.691
<v Speaker 3>well in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always looking for some reason </v>

1842
01:44:32.691 --> 01:44:33.450
<v Speaker 3>why they've done while they must be </v>
<v Speaker 3>crooked or they must be.</v>

1843
01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:36.990
<v Speaker 3>It must be conniving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they must be arrogant or they must be</v>

1844
01:44:36.991 --> 01:44:40.410
<v Speaker 3>psychopathic or and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course all of those things exist,</v>

1845
01:44:40.411 --> 01:44:43.860
<v Speaker 3>but it's very bad trick to play on </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

1846
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:49.070
<v Speaker 3>to make the proposition that the person </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world who represents your own </v>

1847
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:53.070
<v Speaker 3>ideal is that ideal because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>despicable reasons,</v>

1848
01:44:53.071 --> 01:44:58.071
<v Speaker 3>because what you do is train yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the ideal that you should pursue </v>

1849
01:44:58.071 --> 01:44:59.970
<v Speaker 3>can only exist if it's motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 3>despicable reasons.</v>

1850
01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:02.970
<v Speaker 3>And then what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only is Abel your brother,</v>

1851
01:45:02.971 --> 01:45:05.970
<v Speaker 3>dad as your brother in the field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in reality,</v>

1852
01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:09.210
<v Speaker 3>but you've also slaughtered your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideal.</v>

1853
01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Well then what the hell are you going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>work for?</v>

1854
01:45:11.731 --> 01:45:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to live then?</v>

1855
01:45:14.130 --> 01:45:15.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitterly and miserably.</v>

1856
01:45:15.961 --> 01:45:17.550
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitterly,</v>

1857
01:45:17.551 --> 01:45:21.840
<v Speaker 3>miserably and hopelessly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you're going to live and it's</v>

1858
01:45:21.841 --> 01:45:26.841
<v Speaker 3>so rare that I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially publicly that people honestly</v>

1859
01:45:28.351 --> 01:45:30.570
<v Speaker 3>admit with sports figures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll do it.</v>

1860
01:45:30.571 --> 01:45:32.970
<v Speaker 3>That's the one place where that seems to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>

1861
01:45:32.971 --> 01:45:37.971
<v Speaker 3>but it's so uncommon for expressions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>admiration and gratitude to manifest </v>

1862
01:45:41.071 --> 01:45:44.930
<v Speaker 3>themselves in any public communication </v>
<v Speaker 3>of any sort.</v>

1863
01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:46.260
<v Speaker 3>Newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV,</v>

1864
01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:48.660
<v Speaker 3>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>

1865
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:50.160
<v Speaker 3>It's almost always</v>

1866
01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:56.480
<v Speaker 3>undermining and backbiting and criticism</v>
<v Speaker 3>and very often directed to people who </v>

1867
01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:05.220
<v Speaker 3>who have often done little else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but bringing good things into the world </v>

1868
01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:09.720
<v Speaker 3>for other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's part of why this is such a </v>

1869
01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:13.240
<v Speaker 3>profound story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a pretty good guy.</v>

1870
01:46:13.241 --> 01:46:15.370
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He deserves his good fortune.</v>

1871
01:46:15.610 --> 01:46:18.430
<v Speaker 3>All the more reason to hate him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

1872
01:46:18.730 --> 01:46:22.330
<v Speaker 3>Cane bruise on his misfortune like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vulture on an egg.</v>

1873
01:46:22.690 --> 01:46:25.420
<v Speaker 3>He enters the desert wilderness of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>own mind.</v>

1874
01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:28.930
<v Speaker 3>He obsesses over his ill fortune and </v>
<v Speaker 3>betrayal.</v>

1875
01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:34.080
<v Speaker 3>He nourishes his resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indulges in evermore elaborate fantasies</v>

1876
01:46:37.021 --> 01:46:42.021
<v Speaker 3>of revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His arrogance grows to Luciferian </v>

1877
01:46:42.021 --> 01:46:42.021
<v Speaker 3>proportions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm ill,</v>

1878
01:46:42.021 --> 01:46:47.001
<v Speaker 3>used and oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks this is a stupid bloody </v>

1879
01:46:47.001 --> 01:46:48.090
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can go to hell.</v>

1880
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:50.430
<v Speaker 3>And with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he encountered</v>

1881
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:54.270
<v Speaker 5>Satan in the Wilderness and falls prey </v>
<v Speaker 5>to his temptations,</v>

1882
01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:59.730
<v Speaker 5>and he does what he can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And John Milton's unforgettable words to</v>

1883
01:46:59.731 --> 01:47:04.731
<v Speaker 5>confound the race of mankind in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first route and mingle and involve earth</v>

1884
01:47:05.431 --> 01:47:10.431
<v Speaker 5>with hell done all to spite the great </v>
<v Speaker 5>creator.</v>

1885
01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:16.540
<v Speaker 5>He turns to evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to obtain what good forbade him.</v>

1886
01:47:16.810 --> 01:47:21.040
<v Speaker 5>And he does it voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 5>self consciously and with malice.</v>

1887
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:27.950
<v Speaker 5>Let Him who has ears here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the first two human beings.</v>

1888
01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:35.130
<v Speaker 5>They're resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bitter failure,</v>

1889
01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:41.180
<v Speaker 5>taking an ax to the admirable success.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the Lord said Unto Cain,</v>

1890
01:47:47.501 --> 01:47:49.300
<v Speaker 5>where is Abel die brother?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>

1891
01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.220
<v Speaker 5>I know not am I my brother's keeper.</v>

1892
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:53.910
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1893
01:47:55.230 --> 01:47:56.850
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what has he done?</v>

1894
01:47:56.851 --> 01:48:00.720
<v Speaker 5>The Voice of your brother's blood crieth</v>
<v Speaker 5>unto me from the ground.</v>

1895
01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:02.180
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1896
01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:09.060
<v Speaker 5>now are they'll curse from the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which has opened her mouth to receive </v>

1897
01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:12.460
<v Speaker 5>your brother's blood from your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1898
01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:15.880
<v Speaker 5>if you want to understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I would recommend,</v>

1899
01:48:16.150 --> 01:48:18.100
<v Speaker 5>he could read Dostoyevsky's</v>

1900
01:48:20.050 --> 01:48:23.200
<v Speaker 5>crime and punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How it's a great,</v>

1901
01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:29.040
<v Speaker 5>it's a great novel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it might be the greatest novel </v>

1902
01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:29.040
<v Speaker 5>ever written because I haven't read </v>
<v Speaker 5>every novel,</v>

1903
01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:33.310
<v Speaker 5>but in my experience it's the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 5>novel and it is exactly this.</v>

1904
01:48:33.311 --> 01:48:34.000
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1905
01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.240
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it says what happens psychologically if </v>

1906
01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:40.390
<v Speaker 5>you commit the ultimate crime,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>

1907
01:48:40.391 --> 01:48:41.730
<v Speaker 5>It's absolutely amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1908
01:48:41.731 --> 01:48:42.760
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1909
01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:48.870
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no psychologist like Dostoevsky </v>

1910
01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:54.300
<v Speaker 5>when now tell us the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It shall not hence forth yield unto the </v>

1911
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:54.470
<v Speaker 5>her strength of fugitive in a vagabond </v>
<v Speaker 5>shell.</v>

1912
01:48:54.530 --> 01:48:57.310
<v Speaker 5>There'll be in the earth and Cain said </v>
<v Speaker 5>unto the Lord,</v>

1913
01:48:58.090 --> 01:48:59.860
<v Speaker 5>my punishment is greater than I can </v>
<v Speaker 5>bear.</v>

1914
01:49:00.250 --> 01:49:05.250
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that's interesting </v>

1915
01:49:05.250 --> 01:49:05.250
<v Speaker 5>about this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

1916
01:49:05.250 --> 01:49:08.620
<v Speaker 5>I think the punishment that God lays on </v>
<v Speaker 5>cane is.</v>

1917
01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:11.890
<v Speaker 5>It's like the inevitable consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 5>keynes action.</v>

1918
01:49:11.891 --> 01:49:13.180
<v Speaker 5>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1919
01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:14.980
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he killed his brother.</v>

1920
01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:19.960
<v Speaker 5>There's no going back from that man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like good luck.</v>

1921
01:49:19.961 --> 01:49:24.190
<v Speaker 5>Forgiving yourself for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially if he was an ideal,</v>

1922
01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:27.640
<v Speaker 5>especially if he was your ideal because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you haven't just killed your brother and</v>

1923
01:49:27.641 --> 01:49:31.570
<v Speaker 5>of course tortured your parents and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rest of your family.</v>

1924
01:49:31.810 --> 01:49:36.790
<v Speaker 5>You've deprived the community of someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>who is upstanding and you did it for the</v>

1925
01:49:36.791 --> 01:49:39.250
<v Speaker 5>worst possible motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like</v>

1926
01:49:41.210 --> 01:49:44.390
<v Speaker 5>there's no up from there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1927
01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's as close hell as you could manage</v>

1928
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:49.270
<v Speaker 1>on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

1929
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:54.390
<v Speaker 1>and Cain said unto the Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my punishment is greater than I can </v>

1930
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.390
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behold,</v>

1931
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:59.041
<v Speaker 1>thou has driven me out this day from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>face of the earth and from thy face </v>

1932
01:49:59.041 --> 01:49:59.560
<v Speaker 1>shall I be hid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That too.</v>

1933
01:49:59.561 --> 01:50:03.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's also no turning back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to God,</v>

1934
01:50:03.161 --> 01:50:06.700
<v Speaker 1>let's say after an error like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because well,</v>

1935
01:50:08.110 --> 01:50:12.460
<v Speaker 1>you've done everything you possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>could to spite God,</v>

1936
01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:17.640
<v Speaker 1>assuming he exists and the probability </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be able to mend </v>

1937
01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:20.110
<v Speaker 1>that relationship in your now broken </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

1938
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:24.700
<v Speaker 1>When you couldn't mend it to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you did something so terrible,</v>

1939
01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:30.580
<v Speaker 1>starts to move towards zero and it shall</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to pass that everyone that find it </v>

1940
01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:35.141
<v Speaker 1>to me shall slay me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Lord said unto him there for </v>

1941
01:50:35.141 --> 01:50:35.650
<v Speaker 1>whosoever Slayeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelly Cain,</v>

1942
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:40.830
<v Speaker 1>vengeance shall be taken on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven fold and the Lord said to mark </v>

1943
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:40.830
<v Speaker 1>opponent cane list.</v>

1944
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Any finding him should kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting thing.</v>

1945
01:50:43.841 --> 01:50:46.510
<v Speaker 1>I wondered about that for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might think,</v>

1946
01:50:46.511 --> 01:50:49.150
<v Speaker 1>well why would god take cane under his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing so to speak,</v>

1947
01:50:49.151 --> 01:50:54.151
<v Speaker 1>given what's already happened and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it has something to do with the </v>

1948
01:50:54.151 --> 01:50:58.140
<v Speaker 1>emergence of the idea that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary to prevent tit for tat revenge</v>

1949
01:50:58.241 --> 01:51:00.220
<v Speaker 1>slayings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>

1950
01:51:00.221 --> 01:51:05.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's hints of that later in the </v>

1951
01:51:05.221 --> 01:51:05.221
<v Speaker 1>text because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1952
01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:10.440
<v Speaker 1>well I kill your brother and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed two of my brothers and then I </v>

1953
01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:13.000
<v Speaker 1>kill your whole family and then you kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>my whole town and then I kill your whole</v>

1954
01:51:13.001 --> 01:51:14.680
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we blow up the world.</v>

1955
01:51:14.681 --> 01:51:19.681
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably not a very intelligent </v>

1956
01:51:19.681 --> 01:51:22.240
<v Speaker 1>solution to the initial problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the initial problem,</v>

1957
01:51:22.241 --> 01:51:25.030
<v Speaker 1>which might be a murder is not an easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to solve.</v>

1958
01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:30.300
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the last part of the story is </v>

1959
01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:35.850
<v Speaker 1>that's William Blake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Adam and eve have discovered their </v>

1960
01:51:37.471 --> 01:51:42.471
<v Speaker 1>dead son and Kane has become cognizant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

1961
01:51:44.791 --> 01:51:48.210
<v Speaker 1>of what he did and what he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1962
01:51:48.211 --> 01:51:50.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's another entrance into a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness.</v>

1963
01:51:50.881 --> 01:51:52.140
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1964
01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:55.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self consciousness that Adam and eve</v>

1965
01:51:55.171 --> 01:52:00.171
<v Speaker 1>developed was painful enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become aware of their own </v>

1966
01:52:00.171 --> 01:52:01.680
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability and their nakedness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even their capacity for evil,</v>

1967
01:52:02.010 --> 01:52:04.260
<v Speaker 1>but cain becomes aware of his</v>

1968
01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:12.240
<v Speaker 1>voluntary engagement with evil itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sees that as a crucial human </v>

1969
01:52:14.921 --> 01:52:18.550
<v Speaker 1>capability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something modern people,</v>

1970
01:52:18.551 --> 01:52:23.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder we don't take it </v>

1971
01:52:23.551 --> 01:52:25.351
<v Speaker 1>seriously like I know in the academy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and among intellectual circles for </v>

1972
01:52:25.351 --> 01:52:28.090
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of evil has been like,</v>

1973
01:52:28.750 --> 01:52:31.810
<v Speaker 1>what are you medieval or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1974
01:52:31.811 --> 01:52:33.460
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

1975
01:52:33.670 --> 01:52:37.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a nonstarter as an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting place as a,</v>

1976
01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:41.260
<v Speaker 1>as a topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that I've just been</v>

1977
01:52:41.261 --> 01:52:46.261
<v Speaker 1>unable to understand because I cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how you could possibly have </v>

1978
01:52:46.701 --> 01:52:50.510
<v Speaker 1>more than a cursory knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of the 20th century.</v>

1979
01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less a deep knowledge of the </v>

1980
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:58.751
<v Speaker 1>history of the 20th century and to walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>away with any other conclusion then well</v>

1981
01:52:59.870 --> 01:53:03.130
<v Speaker 1>good might not exist but evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1982
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:10.000
<v Speaker 1>the evidence for that is so overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that only willful blindness could </v>

1983
01:53:14.291 --> 01:53:18.490
<v Speaker 1>possibly explain denying its existence,</v>

1984
01:53:22.570 --> 01:53:27.570
<v Speaker 1>and that was actually a useful little </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery for me because I also </v>

1985
01:53:27.570 --> 01:53:32.430
<v Speaker 1>concluded perhaps that if it was true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil existed,</v>

1986
01:53:32.741 --> 01:53:37.741
<v Speaker 1>then it was true by inference that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite existed because the opposite of</v>

1987
01:53:39.101 --> 01:53:44.101
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the evil of the concentration </v>

1988
01:53:44.101 --> 01:53:44.101
<v Speaker 1>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1989
01:53:44.101 --> 01:53:45.310
<v Speaker 1>or we could get more specific about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could say there's this one thing that</v>

1990
01:53:45.311 --> 01:53:50.311
<v Speaker 1>used to happen in Auschwitz where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would take people off the incoming </v>

1991
01:53:51.491 --> 01:53:56.491
<v Speaker 1>trains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who lived that weren't stacked </v>

1992
01:53:56.491 --> 01:53:59.371
<v Speaker 1>around the outside of the train train </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars and froze to death because it was </v>

1993
01:54:02.711 --> 01:54:07.711
<v Speaker 1>too cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know those who only had to be stuck </v>

1994
01:54:07.711 --> 01:54:09.961
<v Speaker 1>in the middle where it was warm enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that maybe the old people died </v>

1995
01:54:09.961 --> 01:54:13.501
<v Speaker 1>because they suffocated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least some of them were alive </v>

1996
01:54:13.501 --> 01:54:14.710
<v Speaker 1>when they made it to Auschwitz and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they took those poor people out.</v>

1997
01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:18.200
<v Speaker 1>One of the tricks that the guards used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to play on them was to have the,</v>

1998
01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:24.180
<v Speaker 1>the newly arrived prisoners hoist like </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 pound sacks of wet salt and carry </v>

1999
01:54:25.301 --> 01:54:29.020
<v Speaker 1>them from one side of the compound and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these compounds were big.</v>

2000
01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:31.450
<v Speaker 1>This was a city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like a gymnasium.</v>

2001
01:54:31.451 --> 01:54:36.451
<v Speaker 1>It was like a city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were tens of thousands of people </v>

2002
01:54:36.451 --> 01:54:38.761
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd have them carry the sack of salt </v>

2003
01:54:38.761 --> 01:54:40.090
<v Speaker 1>from one side of the compound to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and then back.</v>

2004
01:54:41.290 --> 01:54:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was to make a mockery out of </v>

2005
01:54:46.290 --> 01:54:47.620
<v Speaker 1>the notion that work would set you free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2006
01:54:47.621 --> 01:54:48.040
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2007
01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:51.040
<v Speaker 1>you work here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing productive about it.</v>

2008
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:54.550
<v Speaker 1>The whole point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly the opposite of sacrifice.</v>

2009
01:54:54.551 --> 01:54:59.551
<v Speaker 1>In some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so we're going to make you act out </v>

2010
01:54:59.551 --> 01:55:02.491
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all it will do is speed your demise </v>

2011
01:55:02.491 --> 01:55:05.670
<v Speaker 1>and maybe we can decorate it up a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit because not only will it speed up </v>

2012
01:55:05.670 --> 01:55:08.941
<v Speaker 1>your demise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will do it in a very painful way </v>

2013
01:55:08.941 --> 01:55:11.280
<v Speaker 1>while simultaneously increasing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that other people's demises </v>

2014
01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:13.630
<v Speaker 1>will be painful and sped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a work of art,</v>

2015
01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:18.660
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to to to know about that sort of </v>

2016
01:55:18.791 --> 01:55:23.791
<v Speaker 1>thing and not to not regard it as evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>means while you can figure out what it </v>

2017
01:55:23.791 --> 01:55:27.811
<v Speaker 1>means for yourself and Kane wind out </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the presence of the Lord and dwelt </v>

2018
01:55:28.331 --> 01:55:30.100
<v Speaker 1>in the land of nod on the east of Eden</v>

2019
01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:34.410
<v Speaker 1>and Cain knew his wife and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceived,</v>

2020
01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:39.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of the critics that criticism is </v>

2021
01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:41.160
<v Speaker 1>a fairly common criticism of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical stories as well.</v>

2022
01:55:41.161 --> 01:55:46.110
<v Speaker 1>If cain and Abel were the only two </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and from Adam and eve,</v>

2023
01:55:46.111 --> 01:55:51.111
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did all these other people come </v>

2024
01:55:51.111 --> 01:55:52.641
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And doesn't that make the story like </v>

2025
01:55:52.641 --> 01:55:52.641
<v Speaker 1>simple minded?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2026
01:55:52.641 --> 01:55:54.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes the reader simple minded.</v>

2027
01:55:55.770 --> 01:55:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean really that's the best criticism </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>

2028
01:55:58.141 --> 01:56:01.710
<v Speaker 1>You're going to come up with being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

2029
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you missed the point that that would be </v>

2030
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.950
<v Speaker 1>the right response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You missed the point.</v>

2031
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:09.710
<v Speaker 1>And cain knew his wife and she conceived</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bare Enoch and he built it,</v>

2032
01:56:09.711 --> 01:56:14.711
<v Speaker 1>the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's cane that builds the cities </v>

2033
01:56:14.711 --> 01:56:15.630
<v Speaker 1>and starts the civilization and called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty rough too,</v>

2034
01:56:15.631 --> 01:56:20.631
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the first fratricidal murderer </v>

2035
01:56:20.631 --> 01:56:20.850
<v Speaker 1>who builds the cities after the name of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his son,</v>

2036
01:56:20.851 --> 01:56:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Enoch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and onto enoch was born Erad,</v>

2037
01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:24.480
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

2038
01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:26.700
<v Speaker 1>going through the generations.</v>

2039
01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:30.810
<v Speaker 1>And lamach took unto him two wives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The name of the one was done in the name</v>

2040
01:56:30.811 --> 01:56:32.220
<v Speaker 1>of the other Zilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

2041
01:56:32.221 --> 01:56:37.221
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an attempt to flesh out the genealogy </v>

2042
01:56:37.221 --> 01:56:40.191
<v Speaker 1>and to describe how culture started in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense and these tribal communities </v>

2043
01:56:40.191 --> 01:56:45.050
<v Speaker 1>and Ada rebel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was the father of such as dwell </v>

2044
01:56:45.050 --> 01:56:47.781
<v Speaker 1>in tents and have such as have cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his brother's name was Jubal and he </v>

2045
01:56:48.901 --> 01:56:51.190
<v Speaker 1>was the father of all is such handle the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart bend,</v>

2046
01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Zillah.</v>

2047
01:56:52.411 --> 01:56:55.200
<v Speaker 1>She also bear Tubal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an instructor of error.</v>

2048
01:56:55.201 --> 01:57:00.201
<v Speaker 1>Every artificer and brass and iron and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tubal cane traditionally is the first </v>

2049
01:57:01.351 --> 01:57:06.351
<v Speaker 1>person who makes weapons of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lamech back to Mac.</v>

2050
01:57:09.330 --> 01:57:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Descendant of Cain said unto his wives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ada and Zillah hear my voice.</v>

2051
01:57:14.851 --> 01:57:19.851
<v Speaker 1>See Wives of Lamech Hearken unto my </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech for I have slain a man to my </v>

2052
01:57:19.851 --> 01:57:21.960
<v Speaker 1>wounding and a young man to my hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If cane be avenged,</v>

2053
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:25.220
<v Speaker 1>sevenfold truly lamach 77.</v>

2054
01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I see in that is this proclivity of</v>

2055
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:38.990
<v Speaker 1>this murderous capacity of cane as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself as society develops to </v>

2056
01:57:42.690 --> 01:57:47.690
<v Speaker 1>to a murderous intent that transcends </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mere killing of a brother.</v>

2057
01:57:48.450 --> 01:57:50.010
<v Speaker 1>You hurt me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hurt you back.</v>

2058
01:57:50.011 --> 01:57:51.690
<v Speaker 1>It's no you heard me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2059
01:57:52.170 --> 01:57:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and six other people and that thing that</v>

2060
01:57:56.101 --> 01:57:58.860
<v Speaker 1>happens after that is to not make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven people,</v>

2061
01:57:58.861 --> 01:58:03.861
<v Speaker 1>but to make it 70 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this idea that once that </v>

2062
01:58:03.861 --> 01:58:08.480
<v Speaker 1>that first murderous seed is sown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has this proclivity to manifest </v>

2063
01:58:11.431 --> 01:58:16.431
<v Speaker 1>itself exponentially and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning and that's also why I think </v>

2064
01:58:16.431 --> 01:58:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Tubal Kane who was one of keynes </v>
<v Speaker 1>descendants was the first person who </v>

2065
01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:25.791
<v Speaker 1>made weapons of war and that's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much the story of Cain and Abel and it's</v>

2066
01:58:32.951 --> 01:58:37.951
<v Speaker 1>a hell of a story as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's worth thinking about </v>

2067
01:58:38.530 --> 01:58:39.990
<v Speaker 1>pretty much forever because</v>

2068
01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:44.470
<v Speaker 5>there are so many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so many.</v>

2069
01:58:44.471 --> 01:58:46.480
<v Speaker 5>It has so many facets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2070
01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:51.900
<v Speaker 5>and I think the most usefully revealing </v>
<v Speaker 5>of those facets is the potential for </v>

2071
01:58:58.061 --> 01:58:59.620
<v Speaker 5>this story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once understood,</v>

2072
01:58:59.621 --> 01:59:04.621
<v Speaker 5>to shed light on not your own failure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not even on your rejection by being,</v>

2073
01:59:08.351 --> 01:59:13.351
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but by the but on the proclivity to </v>

2074
01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:20.280
<v Speaker 5>murder the best and the best in you for </v>
<v Speaker 5>revenge upon that violation,</v>

2075
01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:31.980
<v Speaker 5>because what that means and we know that</v>
<v Speaker 5>knowledge of good and evil into the </v>

2076
01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:32.770
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak,</v>

2077
01:59:33.010 --> 01:59:38.010
<v Speaker 5>with Adam and Eve's transgression,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that now not only does humanity have </v>

2078
01:59:38.010 --> 01:59:42.451
<v Speaker 5>to contend with tragedy and suffering </v>
<v Speaker 5>and even the unharvested fruits of </v>

2079
01:59:47.081 --> 01:59:52.081
<v Speaker 5>proper sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but with the introduction of real </v>

2080
01:59:52.081 --> 01:59:55.591
<v Speaker 5>malevolence into the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's the fall into history and </v>

2081
02:00:00.641 --> 02:00:05.641
<v Speaker 5>then there's the discovery of sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a medication for the fall and then </v>

2082
02:00:05.801 --> 02:00:10.801
<v Speaker 5>there's a counter position which is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>emergence of malevolence as the enemy of</v>

2083
02:00:11.201 --> 02:00:16.201
<v Speaker 5>proper sacrifice and that's where we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>left at the end of Cain and Abel and </v>

2084
02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:21.490
<v Speaker 5>that's the end of that lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

2085
02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:27.600
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

2086
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:33.350
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you've said that one of your moral </v>

2087
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:35.541
<v Speaker 6>axioms is that pain is bad and so we </v>
<v Speaker 6>should work to eliminate unnecessary </v>

2088
02:00:35.941 --> 02:00:40.941
<v Speaker 6>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Isn't this the basis for a secular </v>

2089
02:00:40.941 --> 02:00:45.081
<v Speaker 6>morality like utilitarianism and can we </v>
<v Speaker 6>therefore be moral without religion?</v>

2090
02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:54.660
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that it's.</v>

2091
02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:58.630
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably two,</v>

2092
02:00:58.650 --> 02:01:03.650
<v Speaker 5>the first question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's also that derivation is </v>

2093
02:01:06.810 --> 02:01:10.870
<v Speaker 5>predicated on the idea that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>only idea you know,</v>

2094
02:01:10.890 --> 02:01:13.980
<v Speaker 5>that I'm putting forward as our ethical </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea and it's not.</v>

2095
02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:19.640
<v Speaker 5>If that was the only idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well then you could derive from that if </v>

2096
02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:20.550
<v Speaker 5>fairly straightforward brand of utility </v>
<v Speaker 5>utilitarianism,</v>

2097
02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:26.060
<v Speaker 5>but then also I think to push the </v>
<v Speaker 5>argument in that direction also </v>

2098
02:01:30.510 --> 02:01:35.510
<v Speaker 5>necessitates that reduction of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>might constitute pain to something to </v>

2099
02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:42.730
<v Speaker 5>unidimensional because I think suffering</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a better term than pain.</v>

2100
02:01:42.731 --> 02:01:45.560
<v Speaker 5>All the pain in some senses at the core </v>
<v Speaker 5>of suffering,</v>

2101
02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:51.760
<v Speaker 5>suffering is a multidimensional </v>
<v Speaker 5>phenomena and I don't think that you can</v>

2102
02:01:52.311 --> 02:01:57.311
<v Speaker 5>draw a simple utilitarian argument from </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2103
02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:05.920
<v Speaker 5>Either the existence of suffering or the</v>
<v Speaker 5>observation that it's the reduction of </v>

2104
02:02:06.531 --> 02:02:09.140
<v Speaker 5>unnecessary suffering might be a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2105
02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:15.580
<v Speaker 5>So I'm also leery of those c,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not reasonable in some sense to </v>

2106
02:02:20.571 --> 02:02:25.571
<v Speaker 5>reduce a complex set of ideas to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>single proposition and then say the </v>

2107
02:02:27.351 --> 02:02:32.351
<v Speaker 5>ideas that I've been putting forward and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then to reduce another complex </v>

2108
02:02:32.351 --> 02:02:35.141
<v Speaker 5>philosophical set of ideas to a single </v>
<v Speaker 5>proposition and then say aren't those </v>

2109
02:02:35.141 --> 02:02:39.431
<v Speaker 5>two things the same?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they are to reduce them to the two </v>

2110
02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:42.320
<v Speaker 5>simple axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or you could argue that they're the same</v>

2111
02:02:42.321 --> 02:02:43.900
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you.</v>

2112
02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:49.180
<v Speaker 5>But I would say there's a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount left out in the telling and that </v>

2113
02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:50.930
<v Speaker 5>what's left out is relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It kind of reminds me of those.</v>

2114
02:02:51.610 --> 02:02:54.530
<v Speaker 5>It was philosophical games that </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychologists often play.</v>

2115
02:02:54.531 --> 02:02:55.880
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2116
02:02:55.881 --> 02:02:58.160
<v Speaker 5>if there was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think one of.</v>

2117
02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:03.200
<v Speaker 5>What's the one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I can recall this </v>

2118
02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:03.200
<v Speaker 5>properly.</v>

2119
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:06.890
<v Speaker 5>It's the trolley cart problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something like,</v>

2120
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:12.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there was a train that was out of </v>

2121
02:03:12.910 --> 02:03:15.491
<v Speaker 5>control and it was going towards six </v>
<v Speaker 5>people on one track,</v>

2122
02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:21.940
<v Speaker 5>would you flip a switch?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's switched tracks and only killed </v>

2123
02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:22.070
<v Speaker 5>one person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you do that?</v>

2124
02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:26.540
<v Speaker 5>And I read a question like that and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think that's a stupid question.</v>

2125
02:03:27.230 --> 02:03:32.230
<v Speaker 5>And the reason I think that is because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't take a situation like that and</v>

2126
02:03:33.351 --> 02:03:37.730
<v Speaker 5>render it properly by reducing it to </v>
<v Speaker 5>that question.</v>

2127
02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:43.180
<v Speaker 5>And then you also can't assume that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>person who answers that question would </v>

2128
02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:46.520
<v Speaker 5>in fact act in the way they answered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't presume any of that.</v>

2129
02:03:46.521 --> 02:03:51.521
<v Speaker 5>It's like because in a situation like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that in a high stress situation like </v>

2130
02:03:51.521 --> 02:03:55.961
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the devil is in the details and I've </v>

2131
02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:59.980
<v Speaker 5>dealt with situations like that a number</v>
<v Speaker 5>of times and know perfectly well that </v>

2132
02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:01.130
<v Speaker 5>the devil's in the details,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I think that there's a.</v>

2133
02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:06.800
<v Speaker 5>there's an intellectual reduction to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make a philosophical point that doesn't </v>

2134
02:04:06.951 --> 02:04:11.951
<v Speaker 5>give the complexity of the topic justice</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there was a second part to that</v>

2135
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:18.070
<v Speaker 5>which was and therefore can't we be </v>
<v Speaker 5>moral without religion?</v>

2136
02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:23.500
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that question also suffers </v>

2137
02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:26.120
<v Speaker 5>in some sense from the same problem of </v>
<v Speaker 5>formulation.</v>

2138
02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:31.380
<v Speaker 5>I I'm very hesitant ever to answer a </v>
<v Speaker 5>question of the form is a merely a </v>

2139
02:04:34.731 --> 02:04:39.731
<v Speaker 5>manifestation of be when and b are very </v>
<v Speaker 5>complex things because the answer to </v>

2140
02:04:40.051 --> 02:04:45.051
<v Speaker 5>that is it depends on what you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 5>moral and what you mean by religious.</v>

2141
02:04:46.590 --> 02:04:51.590
<v Speaker 5>Because see there's an underlying </v>
<v Speaker 5>intellectual maneuver in a question like</v>

2142
02:04:54.871 --> 02:04:59.871
<v Speaker 5>that and the underlying maneuver is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>a priori assumption that something as </v>

2143
02:05:00.511 --> 02:05:05.511
<v Speaker 5>complex as religion or as complex as </v>
<v Speaker 5>morality can be reduced to an object </v>

2144
02:05:06.541 --> 02:05:11.541
<v Speaker 5>with a name and then two objects reduced</v>
<v Speaker 5>to their name can be assessed </v>

2145
02:05:12.571 --> 02:05:15.630
<v Speaker 5>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think that that's the case.</v>

2146
02:05:15.810 --> 02:05:20.810
<v Speaker 5>I think you can say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a triangle a square?</v>

2147
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:26.990
<v Speaker 5>I think you can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think you can say is it </v>

2148
02:05:28.031 --> 02:05:29.950
<v Speaker 5>possible to have morality without </v>
<v Speaker 5>religion?</v>

2149
02:05:30.010 --> 02:05:33.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you can have that question</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it has to be expanded out.</v>

2150
02:05:33.911 --> 02:05:36.010
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you mean by morality exactly.</v>

2151
02:05:36.370 --> 02:05:38.830
<v Speaker 5>And what do you mean by religion?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because maybe and maybe not.</v>

2152
02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:39.880
<v Speaker 5>And so</v>

2153
02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:45.030
<v Speaker 5>and so the answer to that question is </v>
<v Speaker 5>decomposed the question.</v>

2154
02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:03.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2155
02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:10.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't want my young children </v>
<v Speaker 3>indoctrinated with dangerous ideas.</v>

2156
02:06:11.530 --> 02:06:13.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as time marches on,</v>

2157
02:06:13.391 --> 02:06:18.391
<v Speaker 3>I trust public education less and less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that you have strong thoughts on </v>

2158
02:06:18.391 --> 02:06:22.771
<v Speaker 3>the danger of the devouring oedipal </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother who harms your child by </v>

2159
02:06:22.771 --> 02:06:22.771
<v Speaker 3>protecting them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2160
02:06:23.050 --> 02:06:25.330
<v Speaker 3>and that's certainly not what I aspire </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2161
02:06:26.650 --> 02:06:31.650
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if in spite of your idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids need to become tough and learn to </v>

2162
02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:35.641
<v Speaker 3>slay dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have anything good to say about </v>

2163
02:06:35.641 --> 02:06:35.641
<v Speaker 3>the idea of homeschooling.</v>

2164
02:06:35.740 --> 02:06:40.740
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have anything bad to say about </v>

2165
02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:43.131
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do know that the government has </v>

2166
02:06:43.131 --> 02:06:46.250
<v Speaker 5>recently taken moves to make it much </v>
<v Speaker 5>more difficult for people to homeschool </v>

2167
02:06:46.250 --> 02:06:47.850
<v Speaker 5>their children and it's not like five </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

2168
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:52.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 years ago I would have presumed that </v>

2169
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:57.531
<v Speaker 5>the vast majority of people who are home</v>
<v Speaker 5>schooling their children were to be </v>

2170
02:06:57.961 --> 02:06:59.910
<v Speaker 5>viewed with skepticism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Initially.</v>

2171
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:03.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm not so sure about that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2172
02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:07.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2173
02:07:07.751 --> 02:07:12.751
<v Speaker 5>I was sent a poster today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone sent me this link that they </v>

2174
02:07:12.751 --> 02:07:16.621
<v Speaker 5>found in the local junior high school </v>
<v Speaker 5>and one of the media pieces that were </v>

2175
02:07:17.671 --> 02:07:22.671
<v Speaker 5>recommended on this poster was a movie </v>
<v Speaker 5>called Hedwig and the angry inch now </v>

2176
02:07:24.230 --> 02:07:29.230
<v Speaker 5>already thought that was a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>movie even though I'm perfectly capable </v>

2177
02:07:29.230 --> 02:07:30.090
<v Speaker 5>of enjoying bizarre movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>

2178
02:07:30.091 --> 02:07:32.040
<v Speaker 5>So it's a bizarre movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>

2179
02:07:32.041 --> 02:07:35.410
<v Speaker 5>But I also thought it was a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>bitter movie.</v>

2180
02:07:35.770 --> 02:07:36.280
<v Speaker 5>Terrible</v>

2181
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.810
<v Speaker 1>and bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are separate.</v>

2182
02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:39.790
<v Speaker 1>A movie can be bitter and be quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

2183
02:07:40.030 --> 02:07:42.040
<v Speaker 1>but it was a terrible movie and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter movie,</v>

2184
02:07:42.190 --> 02:07:44.350
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you one bloody thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that movie.</v>

2185
02:07:45.010 --> 02:07:47.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not required viewing for 12 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old kids,</v>

2186
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:52.300
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you have increasing reason to</v>

2187
02:07:52.301 --> 02:07:54.400
<v Speaker 1>be skeptical of the public education </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

2188
02:07:54.401 --> 02:07:59.401
<v Speaker 1>I also looked at the Elementary Teachers</v>
<v Speaker 1>Federation of Ontario's guidelines for </v>

2189
02:08:00.731 --> 02:08:05.590
<v Speaker 1>education from kindergarten to grade </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight and what that is in essence,</v>

2190
02:08:05.591 --> 02:08:08.650
<v Speaker 1>and I think I will do a video about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the relatively near future,</v>

2191
02:08:08.890 --> 02:08:13.890
<v Speaker 1>is a blueprint for transforming children</v>
<v Speaker 1>into social justice warriors had </v>

2192
02:08:13.890 --> 02:08:17.901
<v Speaker 1>basically says that it's like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be a conspiracy theory to read </v>

2193
02:08:17.901 --> 02:08:22.261
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have social justice tribunals </v>

2194
02:08:22.261 --> 02:08:22.480
<v Speaker 1>in Ontario and so the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2195
02:08:22.481 --> 02:08:25.570
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to get your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to get people to,</v>

2196
02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:31.830
<v Speaker 1>what would you say favor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equity properly will then you better </v>

2197
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:33.010
<v Speaker 1>start teaching them while they're young.</v>

2198
02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:38.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you.</v>

2199
02:08:39.370 --> 02:08:42.310
<v Speaker 1>You asked that question properly because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

2200
02:08:42.311 --> 02:08:46.900
<v Speaker 1>well to terrible education system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wonderful mother homeschooling,</v>

2201
02:08:46.930 --> 02:08:48.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the danger.</v>

2202
02:08:48.011 --> 02:08:51.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no because it might not be the wonderful</v>

2203
02:08:51.491 --> 02:08:56.491
<v Speaker 1>mother homeschooling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be the pathological mother </v>

2204
02:08:56.491 --> 02:08:59.281
<v Speaker 1>using the pathology of the education </v>
<v Speaker 1>system as an excuse to get her talons </v>

2205
02:08:59.281 --> 02:09:00.340
<v Speaker 1>into her children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2206
02:09:00.341 --> 02:09:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Because that certainly equally possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps even more possible because at</v>

2207
02:09:04.751 --> 02:09:09.700
<v Speaker 1>least in the public education system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some necessity for consensus.</v>

2208
02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:15.180
<v Speaker 1>So that's something that you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>very aware of and work to prevent.</v>

2209
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say if you're going to do</v>

2210
02:09:18.221 --> 02:09:23.221
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably best not to do it on your own </v>

2211
02:09:23.221 --> 02:09:27.330
<v Speaker 1>and you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you need a board of advisors </v>

2212
02:09:27.330 --> 02:09:27.730
<v Speaker 1>or something like that and so maybe it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't just be you and you have to figure</v>

2213
02:09:27.731 --> 02:09:28.300
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what,</v>

2214
02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:33.390
<v Speaker 1>what is they aim and how are you going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to manage that and what makes you think </v>

2215
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:35.860
<v Speaker 1>you can do it even if it's being done </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly publicly,</v>

2216
02:09:35.861 --> 02:09:37.960
<v Speaker 1>what makes you think you could do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>better?</v>

2217
02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my general advice is,</v>

2218
02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:41.350
<v Speaker 1>and people have asked me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

2219
02:09:41.351 --> 02:09:46.351
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was tiling my backyard this morning </v>

2220
02:09:46.351 --> 02:09:49.930
<v Speaker 1>about something his son had said to him </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was taught at school recently,</v>

2221
02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:54.790
<v Speaker 1>which really made the tyler who had come</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a rather authoritarian country,</v>

2222
02:09:55.210 --> 02:10:00.210
<v Speaker 1>step back on his heels and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so sure I should be sending my </v>

2223
02:10:00.210 --> 02:10:03.631
<v Speaker 1>kid to public school anymore and maybe I</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be living in Toronto even you </v>

2224
02:10:03.631 --> 02:10:08.071
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my general advice is keep an eye on </v>

2225
02:10:08.071 --> 02:10:12.091
<v Speaker 1>your kids and discuss with them what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're learning and and help equip them</v>

2226
02:10:13.181 --> 02:10:18.181
<v Speaker 1>with the tools to not only to articulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own viewpoint in response to what </v>

2227
02:10:21.881 --> 02:10:26.881
<v Speaker 1>they're being taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is you might not have </v>

2228
02:10:26.881 --> 02:10:29.581
<v Speaker 1>the time nor the ability to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no simple thing and increasingly </v>

2229
02:10:29.581 --> 02:10:33.751
<v Speaker 1>if you're unwilling to have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>children participate in what is </v>

2230
02:10:33.861 --> 02:10:37.100
<v Speaker 1>increasingly indoctrination and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

2231
02:10:37.101 --> 02:10:42.101
<v Speaker 1>thanks to in no small part to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Institute of the studies on </v>

2232
02:10:42.101 --> 02:10:46.151
<v Speaker 1>Education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an institution that I </v>

2233
02:10:46.151 --> 02:10:48.941
<v Speaker 1>particularly despise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that all it does is </v>

2234
02:10:48.941 --> 02:10:51.440
<v Speaker 1>almost all it does now is produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>indoctrinate of children.</v>

2235
02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:57.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easily easy problem to </v>

2236
02:10:57.700 --> 02:11:00.911
<v Speaker 1>solve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so more more power to you wanting to</v>

2237
02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:08.380
<v Speaker 1>put your children in a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not being indoctrinated,</v>

2238
02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:12.910
<v Speaker 1>but the alternative is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated and difficult.</v>

2239
02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:18.390
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2240
02:11:25.870 --> 02:11:30.870
<v Speaker 4>I was wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is likely,</v>

2241
02:11:34.070 --> 02:11:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say generally speaking,</v>

2242
02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:43.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a shamonic basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two to almost old the religious </v>

2243
02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:47.981
<v Speaker 1>traditions because that's the mill you </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of which the religious traditions </v>

2244
02:11:47.981 --> 02:11:52.960
<v Speaker 1>emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can't say much more than that </v>

2245
02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:55.150
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know and no one does </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2246
02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:57.590
<v Speaker 1>The particularities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might say,</v>

2247
02:11:57.591 --> 02:12:01.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there an illusion to the ingestion of</v>

2248
02:12:01.221 --> 02:12:04.160
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive chemicals in the Adam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eve story?</v>

2249
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:07.970
<v Speaker 1>And people have made that case and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been powerful cases made.</v>

2250
02:12:07.971 --> 02:12:09.110
<v Speaker 1>So there's a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2251
02:12:09.111 --> 02:12:12.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called Soma by a guy named </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gordon West Saul,</v>

2252
02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:17.440
<v Speaker 1>who was the first person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an amateur psychologist who was the </v>

2253
02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:20.801
<v Speaker 1>first person to propose that the Soma of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hindus was we're at emoney to </v>

2254
02:12:21.591 --> 02:12:23.780
<v Speaker 1>miscarry mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a.</v>

2255
02:12:24.170 --> 02:12:29.170
<v Speaker 1>those are the red mushrooms with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>white dots that you always see on fairy </v>

2256
02:12:29.170 --> 02:12:29.170
<v Speaker 1>tales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the cute ones,</v>

2257
02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:33.230
<v Speaker 1>toadstools flies like to eat them.</v>

2258
02:12:33.230 --> 02:12:37.460
<v Speaker 1>They're called fly a garrick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also lie seem to like getting stoned.</v>

2259
02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I know that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's weird thing to say,</v>

2260
02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:45.700
<v Speaker 1>but there's a good book on animal use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics and more animals use them </v>

2261
02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:46.880
<v Speaker 1>then you might think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

2262
02:12:47.150 --> 02:12:51.240
<v Speaker 1>there is some evidence that you know of </v>
<v Speaker 1>use of,</v>

2263
02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:57.010
<v Speaker 1>of the ingest node,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say metaphorically speaking as an </v>

2264
02:12:57.010 --> 02:13:00.050
<v Speaker 1>aid to the transformation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that goes back so far that</v>

2265
02:13:00.530 --> 02:13:03.800
<v Speaker 1>well forever as far as human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

2266
02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:08.090
<v Speaker 1>But to specifically tie that to the Adam</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Eve story,</v>

2267
02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been able to see any evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would definitively linkedin.</v>

2268
02:13:13.190 --> 02:13:14.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2269
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:16.610
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of interesting books </v>
<v Speaker 1>written about that.</v>

2270
02:13:16.611 --> 02:13:20.930
<v Speaker 1>There's one that was quite a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird hit and I think in the early,</v>

2271
02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:22.970
<v Speaker 1>late sixties might've been early </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

2272
02:13:23.100 --> 02:13:25.430
<v Speaker 1>It sort of got brushed off as a hippie </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

2273
02:13:25.431 --> 02:13:30.431
<v Speaker 1>but it really wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the sacred mushroom and the </v>

2274
02:13:30.431 --> 02:13:30.431
<v Speaker 1>cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really,</v>

2275
02:13:30.431 --> 02:13:31.290
<v Speaker 1>that's the sort of book you read and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

2276
02:13:31.710 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2277
02:13:33.650 --> 02:13:35.850
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what to do about that.</v>

2278
02:13:36.090 --> 02:13:37.970
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea what to do about that </v>
<v Speaker 5>look.</v>

2279
02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:41.040
<v Speaker 5>So that's all I can say about that.</v>

2280
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2281
02:13:49.570 --> 02:13:52.030
<v Speaker 7>My is about martyrdom.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

2282
02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:57.360
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what do you think murdered him or the </v>

2283
02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:57.610
<v Speaker 7>willingness to suffer and die for what </v>
<v Speaker 7>you believe,</v>

2284
02:13:57.850 --> 02:14:02.850
<v Speaker 7>if anything says of the convictions and </v>
<v Speaker 7>what do you think is the benefit for the</v>

2285
02:14:03.101 --> 02:14:07.120
<v Speaker 7>murder which is at least traditionally </v>
<v Speaker 7>in immaterial and transcendent?</v>

2286
02:14:07.121 --> 02:14:12.121
<v Speaker 7>Good compared to the regular sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 7>or practical sacrifice which is ordered </v>

2287
02:14:13.571 --> 02:14:16.930
<v Speaker 7>to the future material,</v>
<v Speaker 7>psychological or economic good</v>

2288
02:14:18.890 --> 02:14:21.140
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys really come up with some wicked</v>

2289
02:14:21.141 --> 02:14:26.141
<v Speaker 5>question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it depends to some degree on how</v>

2290
02:14:29.041 --> 02:14:32.130
<v Speaker 5>you define martyrdom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2291
02:14:33.220 --> 02:14:36.030
<v Speaker 5>cause you could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could define a dose.</v>

2292
02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2293
02:14:38.110 --> 02:14:42.640
<v Speaker 5>The tendency to pathologically self </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggrandize yourself on public display,</v>

2294
02:14:43.390 --> 02:14:47.830
<v Speaker 5>or you could say it's the decision to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>immovable about a set of principles.</v>

2295
02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:49.210
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's go with that one.</v>

2296
02:14:49.630 --> 02:14:52.570
<v Speaker 5>Forget about the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2297
02:14:52.571 --> 02:14:55.150
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2298
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:56.500
<v Speaker 5>Get in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2299
02:14:57.550 --> 02:15:02.550
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

2300
02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:04.490
<v Speaker 5>That's a really tough one.</v>

2301
02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:10.320
<v Speaker 5>People asked me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll make it personal.</v>

2302
02:15:10.321 --> 02:15:15.321
<v Speaker 5>I suppose people asked me when I first </v>
<v Speaker 5>got involved in all this political </v>

2303
02:15:15.321 --> 02:15:16.830
<v Speaker 5>controversy back in September,</v>
<v Speaker 5>October.</v>

2304
02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:18.210
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they asked me a couple of things.</v>

2305
02:15:18.211 --> 02:15:23.211
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they asked me if this was the hill that </v>

2306
02:15:23.211 --> 02:15:25.071
<v Speaker 5>I really would choose to die on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like pronouns and the transgender issue.</v>

2307
02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:28.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well it's not what I want.</v>

2308
02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:31.680
<v Speaker 5>I would have picked and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean it was about language,</v>

2309
02:15:31.681 --> 02:15:32.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that,</v>

2310
02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:37.700
<v Speaker 5>that makes it nontrivial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Bill [inaudible] was passed this </v>

2311
02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:37.700
<v Speaker 5>week as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when.</v>

2312
02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:39.060
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that was quite </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting about that,</v>

2313
02:15:39.061 --> 02:15:41.790
<v Speaker 5>and I will answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was that Brenda Cossman,</v>

2314
02:15:41.791 --> 02:15:45.060
<v Speaker 5>who was the woman that I debated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's</v>

2315
02:15:46.570 --> 02:15:51.570
<v Speaker 5>one of the persons that I debate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't like to be referred to as a </v>

2316
02:15:51.570 --> 02:15:51.610
<v Speaker 5>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't think it was Brenda.</v>

2317
02:15:52.330 --> 02:15:57.330
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she wrote an ipad and I believe it was </v>

2318
02:15:57.330 --> 02:16:00.061
<v Speaker 5>in the globe and Mail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it might've been the national post </v>

2319
02:16:00.061 --> 02:16:02.400
<v Speaker 5>saying as I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she would say that bill [inaudible] was </v>

2320
02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:06.211
<v Speaker 5>just the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have plenty of work left to do and </v>

2321
02:16:06.211 --> 02:16:08.200
<v Speaker 5>yes you can bloody well be sure that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>have plenty of work left to do.</v>

2322
02:16:08.530 --> 02:16:13.530
<v Speaker 5>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was asked during that period of time </v>

2323
02:16:13.530 --> 02:16:13.530
<v Speaker 5>whether or not I was being a martyr,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2324
02:16:13.530 --> 02:16:18.480
<v Speaker 5>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it's not really one of my </v>

2325
02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:18.480
<v Speaker 5>ambitions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2326
02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:21.601
<v Speaker 5>it's like that sort of torn to the lions</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing doesn't sound like exactly </v>

2327
02:16:21.601 --> 02:16:26.251
<v Speaker 5>something you might aim for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think,</v>

2328
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:35.190
<v Speaker 1>well sometimes you find out in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>may be that there's something you won't </v>

2329
02:16:35.190 --> 02:16:39.841
<v Speaker 1>do and one thing and then maybe you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it no matter what the </v>

2330
02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:44.020
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe how I don't know because you know,</v>

2331
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been pushed to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there have been people who have been</v>

2332
02:16:47.081 --> 02:16:49.960
<v Speaker 1>pushed to that point in history and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically said,</v>

2333
02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't care why you do to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that,</v>

2334
02:16:53.230 --> 02:16:58.230
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe some of them were suicidal and </v>

2335
02:16:58.230 --> 02:17:01.111
<v Speaker 1>some of them are psychotic and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them had whatever other problems that </v>

2336
02:17:01.111 --> 02:17:01.111
<v Speaker 1>people might have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2337
02:17:01.111 --> 02:17:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I do have this suspicion now and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them were just kind of serious </v>

2338
02:17:05.730 --> 02:17:08.941
<v Speaker 1>about saying no and there's some utility</v>
<v Speaker 1>in being serious about saying no and </v>

2339
02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:13.060
<v Speaker 1>that sort of revealed itself to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose to some degree,</v>

2340
02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:18.420
<v Speaker 1>back in September when I read a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation that said I would have to </v>

2341
02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:21.310
<v Speaker 1>use some words that were legislated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government and I thought,</v>

2342
02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:26.400
<v Speaker 1>there's no god damn way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do that under any </v>

2343
02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:28.180
<v Speaker 1>conditions that I can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2344
02:17:28.181 --> 02:17:33.181
<v Speaker 1>There are conditions and I have a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>good imagination for unimaginable </v>

2345
02:17:33.181 --> 02:17:34.960
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't see it because I thought that</v>

2346
02:17:34.961 --> 02:17:39.961
<v Speaker 1>if I did that I would break through </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever would be left of me after </v>

2347
02:17:39.961 --> 02:17:42.820
<v Speaker 1>having done that would no longer be me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2348
02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what that would be like.</v>

2349
02:17:48.350 --> 02:17:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I actually do know what that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like and I'm not interested in that.</v>

2350
02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:56.680
<v Speaker 1>I would rather have whatever else </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens happens and people have said to </v>

2351
02:17:57.081 --> 02:17:57.920
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2352
02:17:57.921 --> 02:18:00.080
<v Speaker 1>you're so courageous for taking this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand.</v>

2353
02:18:00.081 --> 02:18:00.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2354
02:18:00.651 --> 02:18:03.050
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not going to claim any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other world courage.</v>

2355
02:18:03.051 --> 02:18:04.310
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can see,</v>

2356
02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:08.450
<v Speaker 1>but one thing I do know the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between these different forms of hell,</v>

2357
02:18:08.630 --> 02:18:13.630
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way and there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell that maybe I might be dragged </v>

2358
02:18:13.630 --> 02:18:14.000
<v Speaker 1>through if I don't</v>

2359
02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:20.480
<v Speaker 1>agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't act in accordance with this law </v>

2360
02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:24.070
<v Speaker 1>and there's the hell that I would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragged through if I did act in </v>

2361
02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:27.131
<v Speaker 1>accordance with the law and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>vastly prefer the first hell to the </v>

2362
02:18:27.131 --> 02:18:30.911
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the isn't clear to me that that </v>

2363
02:18:30.911 --> 02:18:31.790
<v Speaker 1>actually constitutes courage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it useful?</v>

2364
02:18:31.791 --> 02:18:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Because that's also the question about </v>
<v Speaker 1>martyrdom.</v>

2365
02:18:33.651 --> 02:18:38.651
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very useful for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that someone will say there's no </v>

2366
02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:43.990
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no conceivable way that you can </v>

2367
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:45.630
<v Speaker 1>get me to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2368
02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:49.490
<v Speaker 1>and I've thought long and hard about </v>
<v Speaker 1>such things too because I've taught very</v>

2369
02:18:49.491 --> 02:18:54.491
<v Speaker 1>many people to negotiate and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things I always teach them is you don't </v>

2370
02:18:54.491 --> 02:18:58.781
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you negotiate from a position of </v>

2371
02:18:58.781 --> 02:19:00.551
<v Speaker 1>weakness because you lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if I say no to something and I </v>

2372
02:19:02.361 --> 02:19:05.210
<v Speaker 1>mean no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean no,</v>

2373
02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I bloody well won't do it.</v>

2374
02:19:07.250 --> 02:19:12.250
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if there are people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>also agreed that such things aren't </v>

2375
02:19:12.250 --> 02:19:17.051
<v Speaker 1>appropriate to have the example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who says no and means it </v>

2376
02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:21.050
<v Speaker 1>actually turns out to be useful and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I would say,</v>

2377
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:26.230
<v Speaker 1>well that's an inclination in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential direction of martyrdom and but</v>

2378
02:19:27.561 --> 02:19:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how to distinguish that from</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually just having the courage of your</v>

2379
02:19:31.341 --> 02:19:33.560
<v Speaker 1>convictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes you might say,</v>

2380
02:19:33.561 --> 02:19:38.561
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person who has sufficient courage in </v>

2381
02:19:38.561 --> 02:19:38.630
<v Speaker 1>their convictions will sometimes be put </v>
<v Speaker 1>to death.</v>

2382
02:19:39.350 --> 02:19:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the definition of a martyr,</v>

2383
02:19:41.031 --> 02:19:43.550
<v Speaker 1>then sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not all,</v>

2384
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:48.730
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good thing and one of </v>

2385
02:19:48.730 --> 02:19:48.730
<v Speaker 1>the things I really liked about Social </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nixon's book,</v>

2386
02:19:48.730 --> 02:19:51.470
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag Archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an I refer to it often,</v>

2387
02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:56.710
<v Speaker 1>is an absolutely staggering book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that he put in many,</v>

2388
02:19:57.081 --> 02:20:02.081
<v Speaker 1>many stories of people who were in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gulag and they were often religious </v>

2389
02:20:02.081 --> 02:20:06.581
<v Speaker 1>believers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a shock to him because he was </v>

2390
02:20:06.581 --> 02:20:06.581
<v Speaker 1>an atheistic communist.</v>

2391
02:20:06.581 --> 02:20:09.850
<v Speaker 1>When when he first entered the camps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were often religious believers and </v>

2392
02:20:09.850 --> 02:20:13.820
<v Speaker 1>they were people who said no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were things they would not do.</v>

2393
02:20:13.850 --> 02:20:18.850
<v Speaker 1>They would not participate in what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regime was asking them to do and he.</v>

2394
02:20:19.340 --> 02:20:22.190
<v Speaker 1>You have to read it because the devil's </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the stories,</v>

2395
02:20:22.191 --> 02:20:23.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The details in the stories,</v>

2396
02:20:23.511 --> 02:20:28.511
<v Speaker 1>but soldier Nixon in the camps grew to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have tremendous admiration for such </v>

2397
02:20:30.021 --> 02:20:35.021
<v Speaker 1>people and actually viewed them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>exemplars of the mode of being that was </v>

2398
02:20:37.011 --> 02:20:42.011
<v Speaker 1>necessary for him to escape both the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist propaganda that had shaped him</v>

2399
02:20:42.051 --> 02:20:47.051
<v Speaker 1>as an individual and also the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitterness and sorrow and anger that he </v>

2400
02:20:47.051 --> 02:20:51.611
<v Speaker 1>experienced as a consequence of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>flung into the terrible concentration </v>

2401
02:20:51.611 --> 02:20:53.120
<v Speaker 1>camp conditions of the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 1>archipelago.</v>

2402
02:20:53.720 --> 02:20:54.230
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2403
02:20:56.820 --> 02:20:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2404
02:21:04.750 --> 02:21:07.990
<v Speaker 6>Hey Doc.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thanks for staying alive and potentially</v>

2405
02:21:07.991 --> 02:21:10.950
<v Speaker 6>saving humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

2406
02:21:10.951 --> 02:21:12.350
<v Speaker 6>that's good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2407
02:21:12.370 --> 02:21:14.350
<v Speaker 6>wondering about a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Firstly,</v>

2408
02:21:14.351 --> 02:21:16.620
<v Speaker 6>who won that childhood fight?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yukata.</v>

2409
02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:19.420
<v Speaker 6>Let that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let that just slide.</v>

2410
02:21:19.450 --> 02:21:20.920
<v Speaker 6>So I'm thinking it's a big l.</v>

2411
02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:26.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you because he was a tough </v>

2412
02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:26.070
<v Speaker 1>little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2413
02:21:26.071 --> 02:21:27.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my,</v>

2414
02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:30.060
<v Speaker 1>my remembrance of him was that he could </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

2415
02:21:30.061 --> 02:21:32.730
<v Speaker 1>pound me out pretty pretty effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2416
02:21:32.731 --> 02:21:33.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2417
02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:36.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was vernon switching enoch.</v>

2418
02:21:37.770 --> 02:21:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a really good friend of mine and </v>

2419
02:21:42.770 --> 02:21:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Vernon's still lives in </v>

2420
02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:45.760
<v Speaker 1>fairview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

2421
02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:45.760
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2422
02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:49.970
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he hears of this then maybe he'll </v>

2423
02:21:49.970 --> 02:21:49.970
<v Speaker 1>remember that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2424
02:21:49.970 --> 02:21:49.970
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2425
02:21:50.100 --> 02:21:53.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so probably he would have won.</v>

2426
02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:56.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't win that many physical fights </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid.</v>

2427
02:21:56.100 --> 02:21:56.490
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2428
02:21:56.930 --> 02:22:00.160
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not the only questions anyway.</v>

2429
02:22:00.161 --> 02:22:00.930
<v Speaker 6>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2430
02:22:00.940 --> 02:22:05.940
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure if you've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you've actually been asked this </v>

2431
02:22:05.940 --> 02:22:06.640
<v Speaker 6>before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've missed the last two lectures,</v>

2432
02:22:06.641 --> 02:22:09.130
<v Speaker 6>but I'm wondering what your thoughts are</v>
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>

2433
02:22:09.300 --> 02:22:12.340
<v Speaker 6>on token jr token and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his work,</v>

2434
02:22:12.341 --> 02:22:14.380
<v Speaker 6>not just lord of the rings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the silmarillion,</v>

2435
02:22:14.381 --> 02:22:19.381
<v Speaker 6>which is basically like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm seeing all this and I'm thinking </v>

2436
02:22:19.381 --> 02:22:23.371
<v Speaker 6>it's like the modern Bible in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's got the weird names like to ball </v>

2437
02:22:23.371 --> 02:22:26.791
<v Speaker 6>cane and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then specifically when were talking </v>

2438
02:22:26.791 --> 02:22:30.591
<v Speaker 6>about Caine just now and how he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>things just moving and when he was </v>

2439
02:22:30.721 --> 02:22:31.840
<v Speaker 6>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2440
02:22:31.890 --> 02:22:36.890
<v Speaker 6>how he felt like betrayed by God and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>spent his whole life working a,</v>

2441
02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:41.680
<v Speaker 6>it's a spite him essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he kind of set the path for,</v>

2442
02:22:41.681 --> 02:22:46.681
<v Speaker 6>for the darkness in humanity that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>almost exactly melcor which was in the </v>

2443
02:22:47.931 --> 02:22:52.931
<v Speaker 6>similar really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And basically what's would spawn </v>

2444
02:22:52.931 --> 02:22:53.070
<v Speaker 6>everything evil in middle earth and more</v>
<v Speaker 6>door and whatnot.</v>

2445
02:22:53.071 --> 02:22:55.840
<v Speaker 6>And I don't even know as much as go on </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking.</v>

2446
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:59.210
<v Speaker 5>Was it a student of mythology and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2447
02:22:59.390 --> 02:23:00.170
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2448
02:23:00.171 --> 02:23:01.100
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2449
02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:02.440
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2450
02:23:02.930 --> 02:23:07.610
<v Speaker 5>the story of the Hobbit is a retelling </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Beowulf in large part.</v>

2451
02:23:07.611 --> 02:23:11.900
<v Speaker 5>And that's a dragon slaying myth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And and so the,</v>

2452
02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:17.050
<v Speaker 5>the reason that Tolkien and rolling for </v>
<v Speaker 5>that matter are so popular is because </v>

2453
02:23:17.571 --> 02:23:22.571
<v Speaker 5>they've done a very good job of making </v>
<v Speaker 5>the old myths new and,</v>

2454
02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:28.480
<v Speaker 5>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look what's happened with the marvel </v>

2455
02:23:28.480 --> 02:23:30.490
<v Speaker 5>series.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the same thing with star wars and </v>

2456
02:23:30.490 --> 02:23:31.970
<v Speaker 5>all of that is that you can't not </v>
<v Speaker 5>respond to these stories.</v>

2457
02:23:32.510 --> 02:23:37.510
<v Speaker 5>Now you're gonna find them in one form </v>
<v Speaker 5>or another in sometimes well with the </v>

2458
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:38.150
<v Speaker 5>biblical stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

2459
02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:43.480
<v Speaker 5>the mythological,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the meaning of the mythological content </v>

2460
02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:46.871
<v Speaker 5>has become invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's partly the death of God that </v>

2461
02:23:46.871 --> 02:23:49.541
<v Speaker 5>Nisha was referring to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't mean that the stories </v>

2462
02:23:49.541 --> 02:23:51.080
<v Speaker 5>themselves vanished because people have </v>
<v Speaker 5>an eternal hunger for them.</v>

2463
02:23:51.740 --> 02:23:56.740
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem with them emerging in let's </v>

2464
02:23:56.740 --> 02:23:59.081
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more literary or less sophisticated </v>

2465
02:23:59.081 --> 02:24:02.411
<v Speaker 5>form,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's take the marvel movies as an </v>

2466
02:24:02.411 --> 02:24:04.601
<v Speaker 5>example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that they're not surrounded by an </v>

2467
02:24:04.601 --> 02:24:05.720
<v Speaker 5>articulated culture the same way the </v>
<v Speaker 5>biblical stories are.</v>

2468
02:24:06.050 --> 02:24:09.320
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not surrounded by something like</v>

2469
02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:11.500
<v Speaker 5>paradise lost by John Milton,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which or,</v>

2470
02:24:11.501 --> 02:24:12.170
<v Speaker 5>or Dante,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2471
02:24:12.171 --> 02:24:15.170
<v Speaker 5>inferno,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which are works of ill,</v>

2472
02:24:15.470 --> 02:24:20.470
<v Speaker 5>unlimited depth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you throw away something of great</v>

2473
02:24:20.601 --> 02:24:25.601
<v Speaker 5>value and reacquire it in a different </v>
<v Speaker 5>place with less value perhaps,</v>

2474
02:24:26.331 --> 02:24:27.960
<v Speaker 5>but more comprehensive ability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a,</v>

2475
02:24:28.010 --> 02:24:33.010
<v Speaker 5>it's not a great trait that is not a </v>
<v Speaker 5>critique of talking and it's not a </v>

2476
02:24:33.010 --> 02:24:36.161
<v Speaker 5>critique of anybody who's drawing on </v>
<v Speaker 5>mythological stories for their </v>

2477
02:24:36.161 --> 02:24:39.520
<v Speaker 5>narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to do that to be a good </v>

2478
02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:41.111
<v Speaker 5>storyteller.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's nice to go as close to the </v>

2479
02:24:41.111 --> 02:24:42.620
<v Speaker 5>source as you can as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

2480
02:24:43.490 --> 02:24:48.490
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the overlaps that you described </v>

2481
02:24:48.490 --> 02:24:48.490
<v Speaker 5>while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2482
02:24:48.490 --> 02:24:50.831
<v Speaker 5>it's exactly what you'd expect because </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you deal with great mythological </v>

2483
02:24:50.831 --> 02:24:55.090
<v Speaker 5>themes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you start to get the archetypes are at </v>

2484
02:24:55.090 --> 02:24:56.330
<v Speaker 5>the bottom of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so if,</v>

2485
02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:00.170
<v Speaker 5>if the story goes down far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it runs into the archetypes.</v>

2486
02:25:00.190 --> 02:25:04.130
<v Speaker 5>And that was the youngest claim.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think he got that exactly right.</v>

2487
02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:04.610
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2488
02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:07.760
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2489
02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:15.410
<v Speaker 6>last one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2490
02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:21.340
<v Speaker 6>there's a passage in paradise lost were </v>
<v Speaker 6>the demons are building pandemonium </v>

2491
02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:27.400
<v Speaker 6>under mammon's sort of guidance and they</v>
<v Speaker 6>crack open the what's not really earth </v>

2492
02:25:28.301 --> 02:25:33.301
<v Speaker 6>but hell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they take out the gold and they </v>

2493
02:25:33.301 --> 02:25:35.731
<v Speaker 6>build pandemonium,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the most sophisticated </v>

2494
02:25:35.731 --> 02:25:37.930
<v Speaker 6>architectural wonder of all time in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in Milton's language,</v>

2495
02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:39.610
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this,</v>

2496
02:25:39.820 --> 02:25:43.380
<v Speaker 6>this conception of taking material and </v>
<v Speaker 6>turning it into a,</v>

2497
02:25:43.390 --> 02:25:45.840
<v Speaker 6>a temple to oneself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2498
02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:51.660
<v Speaker 6>was interpreted by Humphrey Jennings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who was the founder of the mass </v>

2499
02:25:51.660 --> 02:25:54.871
<v Speaker 6>observation movement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if anyone saw the opening to the </v>

2500
02:25:54.871 --> 02:25:58.230
<v Speaker 6>Britains 2012 games,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the history of the industrial </v>

2501
02:25:58.421 --> 02:25:59.830
<v Speaker 6>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

2502
02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:04.860
<v Speaker 6>was encapsulated by this passage in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Milton where you have demons building a </v>

2503
02:26:05.801 --> 02:26:10.801
<v Speaker 6>temple for themselves out of matter and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that mankind in Milton's language was,</v>

2504
02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:16.020
<v Speaker 6>was taught to do this or that they </v>
<v Speaker 6>learned it first by this example.</v>

2505
02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:22.180
<v Speaker 6>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let not envy the devils have riches and </v>

2506
02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:22.180
<v Speaker 6>hell.</v>

2507
02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:23.500
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I see things in this one,</v>

2508
02:26:23.501 --> 02:26:28.501
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the gnostic idea that somehow the world </v>

2509
02:26:28.501 --> 02:26:31.171
<v Speaker 6>itself that we inhabit as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then that matter is not our true </v>

2510
02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:33.730
<v Speaker 6>place of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of existence,</v>

2511
02:26:33.731 --> 02:26:38.731
<v Speaker 6>but somewhere sort of platonic and also </v>
<v Speaker 6>the festie and sort of bargain that </v>

2512
02:26:39.701 --> 02:26:44.701
<v Speaker 6>people made around 16,</v>
<v Speaker 6>66 two to get a world of stuff and </v>

2513
02:26:44.701 --> 02:26:49.621
<v Speaker 6>things and possessions by losing the </v>
<v Speaker 6>soul or what existed before that.</v>

2514
02:26:51.731 --> 02:26:53.170
<v Speaker 6>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if that,</v>

2515
02:26:53.380 --> 02:26:58.380
<v Speaker 6>I play with that a lot in my own thought</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I wonder if that's something that </v>

2516
02:26:58.380 --> 02:27:01.111
<v Speaker 6>you found in Milton and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and what you think of that passage in </v>

2517
02:27:01.111 --> 02:27:01.111
<v Speaker 6>particular.</v>

2518
02:27:01.111 --> 02:27:02.200
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Milton was definitely a prophetic voice,</v>

2519
02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:03.390
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I.</v>

2520
02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:08.400
<v Speaker 5>and I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a perfectly reasonable retelling </v>

2521
02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:12.571
<v Speaker 5>of that section.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also very much a kin to the story </v>

2522
02:27:12.571 --> 02:27:14.350
<v Speaker 5>of the Tower of Babel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll talk about next week.</v>

2523
02:27:14.790 --> 02:27:15.140
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2524
02:27:19.950 --> 02:27:20.220
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2525
02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:25.530
<v Speaker 5>See the problem with the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

2526
02:27:25.531 --> 02:27:30.531
<v Speaker 5>it's so complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See what one of the things that young </v>

2527
02:27:30.531 --> 02:27:32.840
<v Speaker 5>said about the transformation of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first millennium of Christianity into </v>

2528
02:27:33.091 --> 02:27:35.060
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the second millennium of Christianity,</v>

2529
02:27:35.090 --> 02:27:38.820
<v Speaker 5>is that Christianity had promised </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like redemption,</v>

2530
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:42.860
<v Speaker 5>universal redemption from suffering </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe in the afterlife.</v>

2531
02:27:42.870 --> 02:27:45.360
<v Speaker 5>But that was kind of a cop out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

2532
02:27:45.361 --> 02:27:48.180
<v Speaker 5>because it didn't really solve the </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem of suffering here and now,</v>

2533
02:27:48.450 --> 02:27:53.450
<v Speaker 5>and you believe that as people had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although although it did,</v>

2534
02:27:54.061 --> 02:27:56.670
<v Speaker 5>many did many positive things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's not,</v>

2535
02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:02.000
<v Speaker 5>let's not forget that it's civilized </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in a way that they hadn't been </v>

2536
02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.320
<v Speaker 5>before or you could make that case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then there was this underground.</v>

2537
02:28:05.950 --> 02:28:10.950
<v Speaker 5>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this denial of the utility of </v>

2538
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:14.100
<v Speaker 5>material reality that went along with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the spiritualization of mankind in that </v>

2539
02:28:14.100 --> 02:28:15.130
<v Speaker 5>in that first in the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 5>millennium,</v>

2540
02:28:16.180 --> 02:28:21.180
<v Speaker 5>there was value left in material because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it had been ignored and so young </v>

2541
02:28:21.621 --> 02:28:23.550
<v Speaker 5>believer that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2542
02:28:23.620 --> 02:28:26.300
<v Speaker 5>the collective unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>broadly speaking,</v>

2543
02:28:26.990 --> 02:28:31.990
<v Speaker 5>began to be attracted to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to what had been rejected by the hyper </v>

2544
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:35.480
<v Speaker 5>spiritualization and started to question</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether or not additional value could be</v>

2545
02:28:35.481 --> 02:28:40.481
<v Speaker 5>extracted from the material.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe as a adjunct to the spiritual </v>

2546
02:28:40.481 --> 02:28:45.280
<v Speaker 5>because maybe true redemption was </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like a proper meeting of the </v>

2547
02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:47.120
<v Speaker 5>spiritual and the material,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which wasn't something that seemed to be</v>

2548
02:28:47.150 --> 02:28:49.520
<v Speaker 5>part and parcel of Christian Christian </v>
<v Speaker 5>doctrine.</v>

2549
02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:54.820
<v Speaker 5>Up to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now maybe what Milton was warning </v>

2550
02:28:54.861 --> 02:28:57.140
<v Speaker 5>against was a swing too far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

2551
02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:02.500
<v Speaker 5>and I think Milton's point is well taken</v>
<v Speaker 5>because one of the things that's worth </v>

2552
02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:06.350
<v Speaker 5>noting is that you can be perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 5>miserable in a house of gold,</v>

2553
02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:07.400
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2554
02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:09.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've known very many wealthy people,</v>

2555
02:29:09.591 --> 02:29:10.880
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very wealthy people,</v>

2556
02:29:10.881 --> 02:29:13.790
<v Speaker 5>and the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

2557
02:29:13.791 --> 02:29:18.791
<v Speaker 5>the thing is is that money just doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>solve that many problems that people </v>

2558
02:29:18.791 --> 02:29:19.550
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People wish it would.</v>

2559
02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:25.300
<v Speaker 5>People who want to be rich think it will</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the people who want to redistribute </v>

2560
02:29:25.300 --> 02:29:25.300
<v Speaker 5>money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think it will,</v>

2561
02:29:25.300 --> 02:29:28.160
<v Speaker 5>and I know that there's nothing to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>said for abject poverty,</v>

2562
02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:33.460
<v Speaker 5>but the problem is that there are many </v>
<v Speaker 5>serious problems that human beings have </v>

2563
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:39.070
<v Speaker 5>that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Material Comfort alone does nothing to </v>

2564
02:29:40.341 --> 02:29:44.420
<v Speaker 5>address or almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can be perfectly.</v>

2565
02:29:44.570 --> 02:29:47.790
<v Speaker 5>You can have a perfectly miserable </v>
<v Speaker 5>family life and $20,</v>

2566
02:29:47.791 --> 02:29:51.740
<v Speaker 5>million dollars and the buffer that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>$20,000,000</v>

2567
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:56.090
<v Speaker 5>puts between you and the misery is </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes it's not even a buffer.</v>

2568
02:29:56.091 --> 02:30:01.091
<v Speaker 5>It's a magnifier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Milton would warn against the </v>

2569
02:30:03.561 --> 02:30:07.880
<v Speaker 5>creation of even the idea of a material </v>
<v Speaker 5>utopia.</v>

2570
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:12.910
<v Speaker 5>Even in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something Dostoevsky also recognized is </v>

2571
02:30:12.910 --> 02:30:16.810
<v Speaker 5>an error,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you cannot solve the problem in that </v>

2572
02:30:16.810 --> 02:30:20.801
<v Speaker 5>manner and maybe the demonic idea is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is propaganda that you could now </v>

2573
02:30:24.951 --> 02:30:29.951
<v Speaker 5>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe there is a balance of some sort </v>

2574
02:30:29.951 --> 02:30:31.220
<v Speaker 5>because I don't understand if we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to build the city of God,</v>

2575
02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:36.280
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well a huge part of the endeavor would </v>

2576
02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:39.110
<v Speaker 5>have to be spiritual and to me that a </v>
<v Speaker 5>huge part of that would be,</v>

2577
02:30:39.470 --> 02:30:42.920
<v Speaker 5>it would have to be something predicated</v>
<v Speaker 5>if not on truth,</v>

2578
02:30:42.921 --> 02:30:47.921
<v Speaker 5>at least not at least on the willingness</v>
<v Speaker 5>of people not to lie to one another.</v>

2579
02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:54.040
<v Speaker 5>Without that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the material wellbeing in the world </v>

2580
02:30:54.040 --> 02:30:55.460
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a facade.</v>

2581
02:30:55.940 --> 02:30:58.490
<v Speaker 5>It's like gilding a corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2582
02:30:58.550 --> 02:31:03.550
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that's partly what Melton </v>

2583
02:31:03.550 --> 02:31:05.450
<v Speaker 5>was warning against.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean Milton was doing many more things</v>

2584
02:31:05.451 --> 02:31:10.451
<v Speaker 5>than he knew of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he was a poetic genius of </v>

2585
02:31:10.451 --> 02:31:14.030
<v Speaker 5>incalculable genius.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2586
02:31:14.090 --> 02:31:14.840
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

2587
02:31:15.050 --> 02:31:15.680
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2588
02:31:15.860 --> 02:31:18.680
<v Speaker 5>well you've obviously thought about such</v>
<v Speaker 5>things very much.</v>

2589
02:31:18.681 --> 02:31:20.990
<v Speaker 5>So that was a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

2590
02:31:21.290 --> 02:31:22.250
<v Speaker 5>All right everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

2591
02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
