1
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully we're going to get past </v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis one today.</v>

2
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:25.311
<v Speaker 1>That's the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I finished my new book yesterday.</v>

3
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

4
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

5
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.440
<v Speaker 1>that's taken about three years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

6
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.510
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a long time to write </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

7
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done except for the mopping up,</v>

8
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>copy editing and that sort of thing.</v>

9
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:49.000
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully it's as good as I can make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

10
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:54.001
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's any good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's as good as I can make it </v>

11
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:54.001
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

12
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.691
<v Speaker 1>so this is the stories that I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you tonight.</v>

13
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well like the ones last week for that </v>

14
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.920
<v Speaker 1>matter for very long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think these even longer and one of</v>

15
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:08.080
<v Speaker 1>the things that I just do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

16
00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:13.081
<v Speaker 1>I cannot fathom this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot understand how there can be so </v>

17
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:16.510
<v Speaker 1>much information in such tiny little </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

18
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.790
<v Speaker 1>especially the story of Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That story.</v>

19
00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Just every time I read it it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>flattens me because it,</v>

20
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>it's only like a paragraph long.</v>

21
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.430
<v Speaker 1>There's just nothing to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>and I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about it and I think about it </v>

23
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>and I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I think about it,</v>

24
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.250
<v Speaker 1>another layer comes out from underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then another layer comes out from</v>

25
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>underneath it and I can't figure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

26
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:46.321
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rational approach that I've been </v>

27
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:49.770
<v Speaker 1>describing to you is predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that these stories have somehow </v>

28
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.541
<v Speaker 1>encapsulated wisdom that we generated </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpersonally on behaviorally and then</v>

29
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:59.950
<v Speaker 1>an image over very vast stretches of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and then condensed it into very,</v>

30
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:04.870
<v Speaker 1>very dense articulated words that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>then further refined by the act of being</v>

31
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>remembered and transmitted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembered and transmitted,</v>

32
00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 1>remembered and transmitted over vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretches of time.</v>

33
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's a pretty good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to.</v>

34
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to go with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still never ceases to amaze me </v>

35
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>how much information such tiny little </v>
<v Speaker 1>passages can can contain.</v>

36
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Speaker 1>So we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll take that apart today.</v>

37
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's especially true with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of Cain and Abel because it works </v>

38
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.400
<v Speaker 1>on the individual level and it works on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the familial level in.</v>

39
00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:44.401
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the political level and it works at </v>

40
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:45.730
<v Speaker 1>the level of warfare and it works at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of economics and it's.</v>

41
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot for a little tiny one </v>
<v Speaker 1>paragraph story to cover,</v>

42
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:54.121
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know you could object well with </v>

43
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know what you're reading into </v>

44
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>it and once in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

45
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>That's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it the postmodern dilemma and</v>

46
00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>fair enough</v>

47
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.490
<v Speaker 3>and there's really no answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore than there is an answer to how </v>

48
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 3>do you know your interpretation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world is well,</v>

49
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 3>let's not say correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sufficient.</v>

50
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 3>There's some answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sufficient in if you can act it out</v>

51
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:18.421
<v Speaker 3>in the world and other people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>object too much and you don't die and </v>

52
00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 3>nature doesn't take a bite out of you </v>
<v Speaker 3>any more often than necessary.</v>

53
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:25.531
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the constraints within which </v>

54
00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:27.091
<v Speaker 3>we live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have some way of determining </v>

55
00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 3>whether your interpretation is at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>functionally successful and that's.</v>

56
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 3>And that's not trivial</v>

57
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.210
<v Speaker 3>and I guess you could say the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the interpretations that might be </v>

58
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.050
<v Speaker 3>laid out on these stories and at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment that's probably good enough.</v>

59
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.860
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully you find the interpretations </v>
<v Speaker 3>functionally significant at multiple </v>

60
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.990
<v Speaker 3>levels and I also think the chance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>managing that by chance is very,</v>

61
00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:49.890
<v Speaker 3>very small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

62
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:54.891
<v Speaker 3>to to be able to pull off an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of a story that works at </v>

63
00:03:54.891 --> 00:03:58.760
<v Speaker 3>multiple levels simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think with each level that it </v>

64
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.961
<v Speaker 3>applies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chances that you've stumbled across </v>

65
00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:05.691
<v Speaker 3>something by chance have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>decreasing right now that there's a </v>

66
00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:07.290
<v Speaker 3>technical term for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In psychology it's called something like</v>

67
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:12.291
<v Speaker 3>multi-method multi trait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A method of determining whether or not </v>

68
00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:16.581
<v Speaker 3>something is accurate and the idea is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the more ways that you can measure it </v>

69
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.760
<v Speaker 3>and get the same result,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more confident you can be.</v>

70
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:24.510
<v Speaker 3>That you're not just deluding yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your a priori hypothesis.</v>

71
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's actually something out </v>

72
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.341
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess that's another part of this </v>

73
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:31.620
<v Speaker 3>method is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also a method that I use in my,</v>

74
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.860
<v Speaker 3>in my speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I don't try to tell people </v>

75
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.410
<v Speaker 3>anything that isn't personally relevant </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you should know why you are </v>

76
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.040
<v Speaker 3>being taught something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

77
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.390
<v Speaker 3>you should know what the fact is good </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

78
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.280
<v Speaker 3>and then it should be good for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>personally,</v>

79
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:46.650
<v Speaker 3>at least in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you act it out in the world,</v>

80
00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:51.651
<v Speaker 3>it should be good for your family and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe should have some significance for </v>

81
00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:51.651
<v Speaker 3>the broader community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

82
00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:56.491
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what meaning means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't really see the utility in </v>

83
00:04:56.491 --> 00:05:00.170
<v Speaker 3>being taught things that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful facts that aren't meaningful </v>

84
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.440
<v Speaker 3>because there's an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>facts and there's no way you're going to</v>

85
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 3>remember all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to be.</v>

86
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.540
<v Speaker 3>They have to have the aspect of tools </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>

87
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we are a tool using creatures </v>

88
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.140
<v Speaker 3>while these these stories have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect is as far as I can tell,</v>

89
00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:18.141
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that.</v>

90
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.400
<v Speaker 3>So here's the stories in genesis two </v>
<v Speaker 3>very famous stories.</v>

91
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:28.401
<v Speaker 3>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually everybody who's even vaguely </v>

92
00:05:28.401 --> 00:05:29.040
<v Speaker 3>versed in western,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

93
00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:34.041
<v Speaker 3>western Western culture knows these </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories and that's something that's </v>

94
00:05:35.011 --> 00:05:37.680
<v Speaker 3>interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stories can be so foundational that</v>

95
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:42.681
<v Speaker 3>everybody shares them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can say the same thing about </v>

96
00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:42.681
<v Speaker 3>a fairly large handful of fairytales as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

97
00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:44.340
<v Speaker 3>or you could at least until recently,</v>

98
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.230
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that stories are </v>
<v Speaker 3>foundational,</v>

99
00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:51.500
<v Speaker 3>I think also means that they have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>given a kind of,</v>

100
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.800
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't give them any respect,</v>

101
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 3>you have to at least treat them as </v>
<v Speaker 3>curiosities.</v>

102
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.150
<v Speaker 3>Why those stories and why did they stick</v>
<v Speaker 3>around and why does everybody know them </v>

103
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.651
<v Speaker 3>and it's not self evident by any stretch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the imagination and you can use </v>

104
00:06:08.651 --> 00:06:10.030
<v Speaker 3>explanations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can use the Freudian explanation.</v>

105
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 3>Freud sort of thought that the Judaeo </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian was predicated on the idea </v>

106
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 3>that the figure of the father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the familial father,</v>

107
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.660
<v Speaker 3>was expanded up into cosmic dimension so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mankind existed in the same </v>

108
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.741
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the cosmic father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that an infant or a small </v>

109
00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:33.941
<v Speaker 3>child existed in relationship to his or </v>
<v Speaker 3>her own father and that's a reasonable </v>

110
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 3>critique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say to some degree,</v>

111
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 3>but it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and,</v>

112
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 3>and this was purposeful.</v>

113
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.530
<v Speaker 3>It does imply more than imply in Freud's</v>
<v Speaker 3>case that people who adopt a religious </v>

114
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:56.051
<v Speaker 3>belief that has a persona figure as at </v>
<v Speaker 3>its apex are essentially acting out the </v>

115
00:06:56.211 --> 00:07:01.211
<v Speaker 3>role of dependent children and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought about that critique for a long</v>

116
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 3>time and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been a powerful critique.</v>

117
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:08.861
<v Speaker 3>One of the best books I ever read called</v>
<v Speaker 3>the denial of death by Ernest Becker I </v>

118
00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 3>think took that line of argumentation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It developed it as well as any,</v>

119
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.620
<v Speaker 3>any book I've ever seen argue it back or</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to bring closure to Freudian </v>

120
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 3>psychoanalysis on religion and he did a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty wicked job of it.</v>

121
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Speaker 3>Like I think the book is seriously </v>
<v Speaker 3>flawed and wrong,</v>

122
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.770
<v Speaker 3>but it's really a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some books are well,</v>

123
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 3>some books are wrong and really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways,</v>

124
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make a powerful,</v>

125
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:34.940
<v Speaker 3>powerful argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They really take it to its extreme.</v>

126
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.210
<v Speaker 3>I think Becker missed the point and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>missed it in the same way that Freud,</v>

127
00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 3>Mrs [inaudible] point and Becker who </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote this book on the psychology,</v>

128
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.840
<v Speaker 3>the psychoanalysis of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never referred to except very briefly in</v>

129
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:54.440
<v Speaker 3>the introduction and I think that was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>major mistake,</v>

130
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.500
<v Speaker 3>but becker took the argument that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis of God is nothing but an </v>

131
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:06.401
<v Speaker 3>attempt by human beings to recreate a </v>
<v Speaker 3>infant infantile state of dependency and</v>

132
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.420
<v Speaker 3>to be able to rely on an all knowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>father and to thereby recovered the </v>

133
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.961
<v Speaker 3>comfort perhaps that we experienced when</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were young and had a hypothetically </v>

134
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:23.021
<v Speaker 3>all knowing father for those of us who </v>
<v Speaker 3>were lucky to have someone who rigged </v>

135
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 3>vaguely resembled death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the more I thought about that,</v>

136
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:30.650
<v Speaker 3>the more that that struck me as quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>implausible across time.</v>

137
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:35.651
<v Speaker 3>Charles Taylor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Charles Taylor wrote an </v>

138
00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 3>interesting book called the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was called the origins of the</v>

139
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:38.180
<v Speaker 3>modern self.</v>

140
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:42.680
<v Speaker 3>He's a philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't necessarily call him a friend</v>

141
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 3>of classic religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>

142
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.660
<v Speaker 3>He made a very interesting point about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity in particular.</v>

143
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

144
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.110
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to invent a religion </v>
<v Speaker 3>that offered you nothing but infant tile</v>

145
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.120
<v Speaker 3>comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why in the world would you bother </v>

146
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.230
<v Speaker 3>conceptualizing hell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That just seems like an unnecessary </v>

147
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 3>detail to add to the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

148
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:02.190
<v Speaker 3>If it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's all about comfort,</v>

149
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.760
<v Speaker 3>why would you hypothesize that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of of serious error was </v>

150
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 3>eternal torment?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't really sound very.</v>

151
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 3>It isn't the sort of thing that that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely to make you feel comfortable.</v>

152
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.520
<v Speaker 3>James Joyce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he wrote about that city,</v>

153
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.530
<v Speaker 3>had terrible nightmares when he was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>child because of the Hellfire to </v>

154
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 3>sermons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The jesuits used to spout,</v>

155
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
<v Speaker 3>spew forth let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he wrote down what he remembered of </v>

156
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 3>them and they were pretty hair raising.</v>

157
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 3>I think in James Joyce's book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was portrait of the artist as</v>

158
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:36.360
<v Speaker 3>a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

159
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:41.361
<v Speaker 3>He talked about the jesuits telling them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and telling them that hell was a like a </v>

160
00:09:41.361 --> 00:09:45.621
<v Speaker 3>prison with walls that were seven miles </v>
<v Speaker 3>thick that was always in darkness and </v>

161
00:09:45.621 --> 00:09:50.360
<v Speaker 3>consumed by fire and that the people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are trapped there were continually burnt</v>

162
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:55.881
<v Speaker 3>by this dark fire that gave New Light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which also simultaneously rejuvenated </v>

163
00:09:55.881 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 3>their flesh so that it could be burned </v>
<v Speaker 3>off eternally in case you were wondering</v>

164
00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 3>how it was going to be burned off </v>
<v Speaker 3>eternally.</v>

165
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.520
<v Speaker 3>That's apparently the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy for me to see that as an </v>

166
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 3>infant tile wish fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid now you could.</v>

167
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.560
<v Speaker 3>Well you could be a cynic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Elaine pagels who who wrote a book </v>

168
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 3>on the devil was cynical about it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this manner.</v>

169
00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:17.910
<v Speaker 3>She thought that the Christians so to </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak,</v>

170
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 3>invented hell as a place to put their </v>
<v Speaker 3>enemies and you know.</v>

171
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>

172
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:27.210
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not accurate really.</v>

173
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Although it's convenient to have a place</v>
<v Speaker 3>to put your enemies.</v>

174
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.250
<v Speaker 3>Charles Taylor did point out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

175
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:37.251
<v Speaker 3>that the modern terror of loss of self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say the existential loss of self </v>

176
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:43.401
<v Speaker 3>and loss of meaning was perhaps roughly </v>
<v Speaker 3>paralleled by the medieval terror of </v>

177
00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:44.250
<v Speaker 3>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

178
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:47.010
<v Speaker 3>in terms of existential intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it wasn't.</v>

179
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Hell wasn't merely a place where those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you didn't care for,</v>

180
00:10:49.901 --> 00:10:51.840
<v Speaker 3>it would end up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the place where you were going to</v>

181
00:10:51.841 --> 00:10:56.841
<v Speaker 3>go if you didn't walk the line properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't think Freud's Freud's </v>

182
00:10:57.511 --> 00:11:02.070
<v Speaker 3>critique really holds water in the final</v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis and then marks his critique,</v>

183
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:07.071
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that religion was the opiate of the </v>

184
00:11:07.071 --> 00:11:07.290
<v Speaker 3>masses and he made an argument that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar to Freud's,</v>

185
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:12.291
<v Speaker 3>although somewhat earlier and made the </v>
<v Speaker 3>based upon the presupposition that </v>

186
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.780
<v Speaker 3>religious police were stories told to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gullible masses in order to keep </v>

187
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.630
<v Speaker 3>them pacified and happy.</v>

188
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Well they're corporate overlords for </v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of a better purpose,</v>

189
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.520
<v Speaker 3>continue to exploit them and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

190
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.520
<v Speaker 3>and weaken them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

191
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:37.070
<v Speaker 3>I find that I find the critique of human</v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions as driven entirely by power</v>

192
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.790
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say questionable to say the least.</v>

193
00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:45.630
<v Speaker 3>And of course every human institution is</v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupted by,</v>

194
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.830
<v Speaker 3>corrupted his corrupt by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for one reason or another.</v>

195
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:55.220
<v Speaker 3>And it's also corrupt specifically by </v>
<v Speaker 3>such things as deception and arrogance </v>

196
00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.990
<v Speaker 3>and the demand for unearned power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the same thing of course can be </v>

197
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.801
<v Speaker 3>applied to religious systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that they are in </v>

198
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 3>some special way characteristic of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>faults.</v>

199
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 3>And maybe you think they are and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

200
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 3>maybe you could make a case for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not primary.</v>

201
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:17.860
<v Speaker 3>I think that's how you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evident that that is.</v>

202
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 3>That also is a particularly useful </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticism.</v>

203
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it.</v>

204
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.890
<v Speaker 3>I think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's far too cynical.</v>

205
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.920
<v Speaker 3>I think that the people who wrote these </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories,</v>

206
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do?</v>

207
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:36.301
<v Speaker 3>You're going to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to run a bloody conspiracy </v>

208
00:12:36.301 --> 00:12:36.301
<v Speaker 3>for 3000 years successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

209
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.820
<v Speaker 3>good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't run a conspiracy for 15 minutes </v>

210
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 3>without somebody ratting you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know it's,</v>

211
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.900
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whatever's at the basis of the </v>

212
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 3>construction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only of these stories,</v>

213
00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:51.760
<v Speaker 3>but of the dogmatic structures that </v>
<v Speaker 3>emerged from them,</v>

214
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:57.180
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's a terrible mistake to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reduce them to unit dimensional </v>

215
00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:57.180
<v Speaker 3>explanations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

216
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.590
<v Speaker 3>I generally think that reducing any </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex human behavior to unidimensional</v>

217
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.450
<v Speaker 3>explanation is often a sign of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously limited thinker.</v>

218
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.180
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

219
00:13:05.181 --> 00:13:08.830
<v Speaker 3>I say that with some caution because </v>
<v Speaker 3>Freud did do that with religion at least</v>

220
00:13:08.831 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 3>to some degree in Freud was a serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinker and marks,</v>

221
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:13.810
<v Speaker 3>I suppose was a serious thinker too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though.</v>

222
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:21.810
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's someone you just,</v>

223
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 3>if you have any sense marks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just leaves you speechless.</v>

224
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.720
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>

225
00:13:30.721 --> 00:13:35.721
<v Speaker 3>so that's all to say that I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's any simple explanation for how </v>

226
00:13:35.721 --> 00:13:36.490
<v Speaker 3>these stories have the power that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

227
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:42.550
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can reduce it to </v>

228
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.550
<v Speaker 3>political conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

229
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can reduce it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological infantile ism.</v>

230
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.940
<v Speaker 3>I think you can make a case like I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they are repositories of the </v>

231
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.291
<v Speaker 3>collective wisdom of the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had an interesting letter this week </v>

232
00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:57.490
<v Speaker 3>from someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get a lot of interesting letters.</v>

233
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:02.510
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm going to make an archive out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them and put them on the web at some </v>

234
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.940
<v Speaker 3>point with people's permission </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>

235
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:09.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said that he'd been following my </v>

236
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.661
<v Speaker 3>lectures and noted that I'd been making </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you might describe as a quasi </v>

237
00:14:12.661 --> 00:14:16.530
<v Speaker 3>biological or evolutionary case for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the emergence of the information </v>

238
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:18.130
<v Speaker 3>that the stories contained.</v>

239
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.630
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

240
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.890
<v Speaker 3>how do you know that someone from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different religious tradition or </v>

241
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.471
<v Speaker 3>speaking of a different religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition couldn't do exactly the same </v>

242
00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:28.471
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

243
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

244
00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:32.770
<v Speaker 3>to some degree they could because there </v>
<v Speaker 3>is overlap.</v>

245
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.050
<v Speaker 3>Like I've talked to you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Dallas,</v>

246
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.930
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

247
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.320
<v Speaker 3>in the Dallas view of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being as,</v>

248
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the eternal balance between chaos and </v>

249
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:43.890
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing I didn't tell you,</v>

250
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:44.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

251
00:14:44.541 --> 00:14:49.541
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a neuropsychologist named </v>

252
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:50.830
<v Speaker 3>Elkanah and Goldberg who is a student of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alexander Luria.</v>

253
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Luria was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the greatest neuro psychologist </v>

254
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.881
<v Speaker 3>of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a Russian and he was one of the </v>

255
00:14:57.881 --> 00:15:01.541
<v Speaker 3>first people to really determine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in large part the function of the </v>

256
00:15:01.541 --> 00:15:06.070
<v Speaker 3>frontal Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was quite a mystery for a very </v>

257
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:06.070
<v Speaker 3>long period of time.</v>

258
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:06.260
<v Speaker 3>And Goldberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

259
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.850
<v Speaker 3>you know how we have two hemispheres,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

260
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:09.530
<v Speaker 3>We have a left hemisphere and right </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere.</v>

261
00:15:09.531 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 3>And people often think of the left for </v>
<v Speaker 3>right handed people,</v>

262
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.500
<v Speaker 3>right handed males more particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because women are more neurologically </v>

263
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.180
<v Speaker 3>diffuse a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the things that makes it </v>

264
00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:21.470
<v Speaker 3>more robust to head injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>

265
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:22.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

266
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Speaker 3>and maybe men are less diffused and </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat more specialized,</v>

267
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:29.390
<v Speaker 3>which makes them a bit more specialized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a little more subject to damage.</v>

268
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.780
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have two hemispheres left and the </v>

269
00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.601
<v Speaker 3>right and no one exactly knows why and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that they housed quasi </v>

270
00:15:37.601 --> 00:15:39.800
<v Speaker 3>independent consciousnesses because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you divide the Corpus callosum that,</v>

271
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:45.110
<v Speaker 3>that unites them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was done to in cases of </v>

272
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.070
<v Speaker 3>intractable epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

273
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:50.060
<v Speaker 3>that each hemisphere is capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>developing its own consciousness to some</v>

274
00:15:50.061 --> 00:15:55.061
<v Speaker 3>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right generally nonverbal and the </v>

275
00:15:55.061 --> 00:15:55.061
<v Speaker 3>left verbal.</v>

276
00:15:55.061 --> 00:15:58.600
<v Speaker 3>And so there has been this idea that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>left is a verbal hemisphere and the </v>

277
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.661
<v Speaker 3>right is a nonverbal hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that can't be right because of </v>

278
00:16:01.661 --> 00:16:03.230
<v Speaker 3>course animals don't talk and they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bifurcated hemisphere.</v>

279
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:06.680
<v Speaker 3>So if it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not causally right.</v>

280
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:12.180
<v Speaker 3>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goldberg hypothesized instead that the </v>

281
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.160
<v Speaker 3>hemispheres we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a specialized for route and </v>

282
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.901
<v Speaker 3>ization and non routinized or for </v>
<v Speaker 3>novelty and familiarity or for chaos and</v>

283
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:21.500
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's pretty damn cool.</v>

284
00:16:21.501 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 3>When I ran across that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also thought about that as a,</v>

285
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 3>as a signal of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what would you call it,</v>

286
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:32.650
<v Speaker 3>multi-method multi trait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>construct validation because I'd never </v>

287
00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:38.741
<v Speaker 3>thought of the hemispheres is operating </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way and Goldberg came up with this </v>

288
00:16:38.741 --> 00:16:42.350
<v Speaker 3>in a in a historical pathway that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely independent from any </v>

289
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.200
<v Speaker 3>mythologically inspired thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely independent fact.</v>

290
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.730
<v Speaker 3>It was motivated more by materialist </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian neuro-psychology,</v>

291
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.410
<v Speaker 3>which was materialist for political </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons and also for scientific reasons,</v>

292
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.950
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is that we have one </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere that reacts very rapidly to </v>

293
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.610
<v Speaker 3>things we don't know and it's more </v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginative and diffuse and it,</v>

294
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.480
<v Speaker 3>and it's associated more with negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion because negative emotion is what</v>

295
00:17:05.481 --> 00:17:08.420
<v Speaker 3>you should feel immediately when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>encounter something you don't understand</v>

296
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.400
<v Speaker 3>because it's a form of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

297
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:15.550
<v Speaker 3>Negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm somewhere where things </v>

298
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 3>aren't what they should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right hemisphere does.</v>

299
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 3>That generates images very rapidly to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help you figure out what might be there,</v>

300
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
<v Speaker 3>and then the left hemisphere takes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and develops it into something that's </v>

301
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.160
<v Speaker 3>more articulated and an algorithmic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fully understood.</v>

302
00:17:28.161 --> 00:17:33.161
<v Speaker 3>And so then there's this dynamic balance</v>
<v Speaker 3>between the right and the left </v>

303
00:17:33.161 --> 00:17:36.041
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere where the left tries to </v>
<v Speaker 3>impose order on the world that's </v>

304
00:17:36.041 --> 00:17:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Ramachandran who is a neurologist and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>

305
00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:43.451
<v Speaker 3>very famous neuro neuro neuro </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurologist who also developed a theory </v>

306
00:17:43.611 --> 00:17:48.611
<v Speaker 3>light Goldberg's who said that the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere imposes routinized order on </v>

307
00:17:48.611 --> 00:17:51.600
<v Speaker 3>the world and the right hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 3>generates novelty and,</v>

308
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.400
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and reacts to novelty and generates </v>

309
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:57.400
<v Speaker 3>novel hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he thought,</v>

310
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.260
<v Speaker 3>and there is some good evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

311
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.530
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's happening during the dream is </v>

312
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.601
<v Speaker 3>that information has moved from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right hemisphere to the left hemisphere </v>

313
00:18:05.601 --> 00:18:09.530
<v Speaker 3>in small doses basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that the novel revelations of the </v>

314
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.280
<v Speaker 3>Right Hemisphere don't demolish the </v>
<v Speaker 3>algorithmic structures that the left </v>

315
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.370
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere has so carefully put </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

316
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.420
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

317
00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:28.570
<v Speaker 3>and I like that theory too because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>also does help justify the hypothesis </v>

318
00:18:29.701 --> 00:18:31.530
<v Speaker 3>that I been laying out for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that,</v>

319
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:37.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's part of us that extends </v>

320
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.201
<v Speaker 3>ourselves out into the world and try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what we don't know and that </v>

321
00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:42.830
<v Speaker 3>that part extends itself out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior and also with emotion and also </v>

322
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.790
<v Speaker 3>image.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then maybe with poetry and then </v>

323
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:47.010
<v Speaker 3>maybe with storytelling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then as that develops,</v>

324
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:52.011
<v Speaker 3>then we develop more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>articulated representations of that </v>

325
00:18:52.011 --> 00:18:55.940
<v Speaker 3>emergent knowledge and so you can map </v>
<v Speaker 3>that quite nicely onto the neurologists </v>

326
00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 3>and the neuropsychologist's presumption </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what constitutes the reason for </v>

327
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.330
<v Speaker 3>the hemispheric differentiation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the other thing that's so cool about</v>

328
00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:05.790
<v Speaker 3>the hemispheric differentiation argument</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

329
00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:08.010
<v Speaker 3>and this is really this is worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about man,</v>

330
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:10.290
<v Speaker 3>because it's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a real.</v>

331
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.120
<v Speaker 3>There's a word that ned ned flanders </v>
<v Speaker 3>uses for that Norgen scratcher.</v>

332
00:19:17.121 --> 00:19:19.760
<v Speaker 3>I think it's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>

333
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:25.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do make the assumption that what it </v>

334
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.520
<v Speaker 3>is that we are biologically adapted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>his reality,</v>

335
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually an axiomatic definition if</v>

336
00:19:28.731 --> 00:19:31.140
<v Speaker 3>you're a Darwinian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because nature is what?</v>

337
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Select by definition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what nature is.</v>

338
00:19:33.831 --> 00:19:38.831
<v Speaker 3>It's what select and if the nature that </v>
<v Speaker 3>selects is forced upon you a dual </v>

339
00:19:38.931 --> 00:19:41.990
<v Speaker 3>hemispheric structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because half of you has to deal with the</v>

340
00:19:41.991 --> 00:19:44.510
<v Speaker 3>chaos in half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half of you has to deal with order.</v>

341
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Then you can make a pretty damn strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>influential case that the world is made </v>

342
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:49.840
<v Speaker 3>out of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And order,</v>

343
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:54.850
<v Speaker 3>and that's really something to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really something to think about </v>

344
00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:54.850
<v Speaker 3>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

345
00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:55.700
<v Speaker 3>so you can think about that for a while </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want.</v>

346
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.270
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>

347
00:19:59.271 --> 00:20:01.280
<v Speaker 3>there is a lot packed into these </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

348
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.190
<v Speaker 3>And so let's investigate a couple more </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

349
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.860
<v Speaker 3>We'll start with this story of Adam and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eve.</v>

350
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Now you may remember that the Bible is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>series of books.</v>

351
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Bible actually means something akin to </v>
<v Speaker 3>library.</v>

352
00:20:15.411 --> 00:20:19.400
<v Speaker 3>And these books are written by all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of different people and groups of people</v>

353
00:20:19.401 --> 00:20:24.401
<v Speaker 3>and groups of editors and groups of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who edited over and over across </v>

354
00:20:24.501 --> 00:20:26.120
<v Speaker 3>the very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very large periods of time.</v>

355
00:20:26.121 --> 00:20:29.600
<v Speaker 3>So they are authored by no one and many </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time.</v>

356
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:30.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

357
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.520
<v Speaker 3>there was a tradition for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the earliest books were written by </v>

358
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:36.520
<v Speaker 3>Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

359
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:42.040
<v Speaker 3>that's probably not technically correct </v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it might be dramatically </v>

360
00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:42.770
<v Speaker 3>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

361
00:20:42.771 --> 00:20:45.530
<v Speaker 3>or correct in the way that a fairytale </v>
<v Speaker 3>is correct.</v>

362
00:20:45.531 --> 00:20:50.531
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to put down fairy tales </v>

363
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:52.960
<v Speaker 3>by saying that there's a number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>authors in the way the authors have been</v>

364
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:57.961
<v Speaker 3>identified tentatively is by certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>stylistic commonalities across the </v>

365
00:20:57.961 --> 00:21:02.641
<v Speaker 3>different stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different uses of words like the words </v>

366
00:21:02.641 --> 00:21:02.680
<v Speaker 3>for God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different poetic styles,</v>

367
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.830
<v Speaker 3>different topics and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people have been working for </v>

368
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.950
<v Speaker 3>probably 200 years roughly that to try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort out who wrote what and how that </v>

369
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:16.831
<v Speaker 3>was all cobbled together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't really matter for our </v>

370
00:21:16.831 --> 00:21:16.831
<v Speaker 3>purposes.</v>

371
00:21:16.831 --> 00:21:20.250
<v Speaker 3>What matters is that it's an aggregation</v>
<v Speaker 3>of collected narrative traditions and </v>

372
00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:25.150
<v Speaker 3>maybe you could say it's an aggregation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of collective narrative wisdom.</v>

373
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:30.210
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to go that far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can at least say it's aggregated </v>

374
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.971
<v Speaker 3>narrative traditions and that there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>some reason that those traditions and </v>

375
00:21:32.971 --> 00:21:36.541
<v Speaker 3>all the others were kept in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were some reasons complex though </v>

376
00:21:36.541 --> 00:21:39.481
<v Speaker 3>they may have been why they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>sequenced in the order that they were </v>

377
00:21:39.481 --> 00:21:42.511
<v Speaker 3>sequenced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because one of the things that's really </v>

378
00:21:42.511 --> 00:21:43.840
<v Speaker 3>remarkable about the Bible as an as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>document is that it actually has a plot.</v>

379
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.700
<v Speaker 3>And that's really something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

380
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:48.820
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sprawling and it goes many places,</v>

381
00:21:48.821 --> 00:21:53.821
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that something's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>cobbled together over several thousand </v>

382
00:21:53.821 --> 00:21:53.821
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 4,000</v>

383
00:21:53.821 --> 00:21:54.850
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe longer than that,</v>

384
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:59.851
<v Speaker 3>if you include the oral traditions that </v>
<v Speaker 3>preceded it and god only knows how old </v>

385
00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:03.370
<v Speaker 3>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that collective imagination part of</v>

386
00:22:03.371 --> 00:22:08.371
<v Speaker 3>the human collective imagination has </v>
<v Speaker 3>cobbled together a library with a plot </v>

387
00:22:08.371 --> 00:22:09.850
<v Speaker 3>and like I see the Bible as an attempt.</v>

388
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:15.150
<v Speaker 3>A collective attempt by humanity is </v>
<v Speaker 3>solve the deepest problems that we have </v>

389
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.370
<v Speaker 3>and I think those problems are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems of pro primary.</v>

390
00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.860
<v Speaker 3>That the problem of self consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that not only do we are,</v>

391
00:22:21.861 --> 00:22:23.950
<v Speaker 3>we are mortal and that we die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we know it.</v>

392
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:29.310
<v Speaker 3>And that's the unique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the unique predicament of human </v>

393
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:35.131
<v Speaker 3>beings and it makes all the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's laid out in Adam and </v>

394
00:22:35.131 --> 00:22:37.921
<v Speaker 3>eve in the story of Adam and eve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason that that makes us </v>

395
00:22:37.921 --> 00:22:41.740
<v Speaker 3>unique and is laid out in that story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and interestingly,</v>

396
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.610
<v Speaker 3>I really realized this only after I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the last three lectures.</v>

397
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.660
<v Speaker 3>So the Bible presents a cataclysmic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A cataclysm at the beginning of the of </v>

398
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.680
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the emergence of self </v>

399
00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.821
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which puts a rift into the structure of </v>

400
00:22:59.821 --> 00:23:03.121
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the right way to think about it </v>

401
00:23:03.121 --> 00:23:03.121
<v Speaker 3>and that's really given cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance.</v>

402
00:23:03.121 --> 00:23:04.870
<v Speaker 3>Now you can dispense with that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

403
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:09.970
<v Speaker 3>nothing that happens to human beings as </v>
<v Speaker 3>of cosmic significance because we're </v>

404
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:09.970
<v Speaker 3>these short lived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

405
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.640
<v Speaker 3>mold like entities that are like cancers</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this tiny little planet that's </v>

406
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:19.770
<v Speaker 3>rotating out in the middle of nowhere on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the edge of some unknown galaxy in the </v>

407
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.910
<v Speaker 3>middle of infinite space and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens to us matters and it's fine</v>

408
00:23:22.911 --> 00:23:24.700
<v Speaker 3>and you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can walk down that road if you want.</v>

409
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.960
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

410
00:23:27.961 --> 00:23:32.961
<v Speaker 3>and that's part of the reason I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that for all intents and purposes it's </v>

411
00:23:32.961 --> 00:23:32.961
<v Speaker 3>untrue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

412
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:38.100
<v Speaker 3>it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't a road you can walk down and </v>

413
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:38.100
<v Speaker 3>live well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

414
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.120
<v Speaker 3>I think if you really walk down that </v>
<v Speaker 3>road and you really take it seriously,</v>

415
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:43.930
<v Speaker 3>you end up not living at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's certainly very reminiscent.</v>

416
00:23:43.931 --> 00:23:48.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to lots of people are </v>

417
00:23:48.931 --> 00:23:48.931
<v Speaker 3>suicidal and seriously suicidal and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

418
00:23:48.931 --> 00:23:53.260
<v Speaker 3>the kind of conclusions that they draw </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the utility of life prior to </v>

419
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.041
<v Speaker 3>wishing for its cessation are very much </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the kind of conclusions that you </v>

420
00:23:57.041 --> 00:23:57.041
<v Speaker 3>draw.</v>

421
00:23:57.041 --> 00:23:59.480
<v Speaker 3>If you walk down that particular line of</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasoning long enough,</v>

422
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.290
<v Speaker 3>if you're interested in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could read Tolstoy's confession,</v>

423
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Leo Tolstoy's confession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very short book.</v>

424
00:24:05.091 --> 00:24:06.530
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a killer man.</v>

425
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a powerful book.</v>

426
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very short.</v>

427
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.960
<v Speaker 3>And tolstoy describes his obsession with</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide when he was at the height of his</v>

428
00:24:14.061 --> 00:24:17.060
<v Speaker 3>fame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most well known author in the world,</v>

429
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge family,</v>

430
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.940
<v Speaker 3>international fame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth beyond anyone's imagining at that</v>

431
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:23.770
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

432
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 3>influential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>admired,</v>

433
00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:30.131
<v Speaker 3>he had everything that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly imagine that everyone could </v>

434
00:24:30.131 --> 00:24:32.861
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for years he was afraid to go out </v>

435
00:24:32.861 --> 00:24:35.261
<v Speaker 3>into his barn with a rope or a gun </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he thought he'd either hang </v>

436
00:24:35.261 --> 00:24:36.590
<v Speaker 3>himself or shoot himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he did get out of that.</v>

437
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.010
<v Speaker 3>He and he describes why that happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>and where he went,</v>

438
00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:43.000
<v Speaker 3>when that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're interested in that,</v>

439
00:24:43.001 --> 00:24:44.410
<v Speaker 3>that that's a very good book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

440
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:51.090
<v Speaker 3>so the biblical stories and starting </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Adam and eve,</v>

441
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:56.100
<v Speaker 3>they present a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They present the emergence of self </v>

442
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.880
<v Speaker 3>consciousness in human beings as </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmically cataclysmic event,</v>

443
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.260
<v Speaker 3>and you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

444
00:25:01.261 --> 00:25:06.261
<v Speaker 3>what do we have to do with the cosmos?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is it depends on </v>

445
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:09.201
<v Speaker 3>what you think consciousness has to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the cosmos and perhaps that's </v>

446
00:25:09.201 --> 00:25:12.381
<v Speaker 3>nothing and perhaps it's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go with everything because </v>

447
00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:13.230
<v Speaker 3>that's how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

448
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:18.500
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone who wishes to as welcome to </v>

449
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:18.540
<v Speaker 3>disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you believe that consciousness is</v>

450
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.450
<v Speaker 3>a force of cosmic significance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which which,</v>

451
00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which being itself is dependent on in </v>

452
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 3>any real sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in any experiential sense,</v>

453
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:31.611
<v Speaker 3>that it's not unreasonable to assume </v>
<v Speaker 3>that radical restructurings of </v>

454
00:25:31.611 --> 00:25:36.591
<v Speaker 3>consciousness can worthy be granted some</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of cosmic or metaphysical </v>

455
00:25:37.171 --> 00:25:42.171
<v Speaker 3>significance and even if it's not true </v>
<v Speaker 3>from outside the human perspective,</v>

456
00:25:42.661 --> 00:25:47.661
<v Speaker 3>whatever that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bloody well true from within the </v>

457
00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:47.661
<v Speaker 3>human perspective.</v>

458
00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:47.790
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the.</v>

459
00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:53.060
<v Speaker 3>That's the initial event in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the creation is the cataclysmic </v>

460
00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.171
<v Speaker 3>fall and then the entire rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible is an attempt to figure out what </v>

461
00:25:57.171 --> 00:25:58.350
<v Speaker 3>the hell to do about that and everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it is is,</v>

462
00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.630
<v Speaker 3>and so you could say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the earliest in in,</v>

463
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:06.650
<v Speaker 3>in the old testament stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what seems to happen is that the state </v>

464
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.960
<v Speaker 3>of Israel is is founded and it rises and</v>
<v Speaker 3>falls and rises and falls,</v>

465
00:26:09.961 --> 00:26:13.800
<v Speaker 3>and so there's this experimentation for </v>
<v Speaker 3>centuries,</v>

466
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.040
<v Speaker 3>millennia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even with the idea that the way that you</v>

467
00:26:17.041 --> 00:26:20.490
<v Speaker 3>protect yourself against the tragic </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of self consciousness is by</v>

468
00:26:20.491 --> 00:26:25.491
<v Speaker 3>organizing yourself into a state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then what happens is the state </v>

469
00:26:25.491 --> 00:26:28.790
<v Speaker 3>itself begins to reveal its pathologies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and as those pathologies mount,</v>

470
00:26:28.791 --> 00:26:31.770
<v Speaker 3>the state becomes unstable and collapses</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it</v>

471
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:38.490
<v Speaker 3>rises back up and becomes unstable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapses and then it rises back up </v>

472
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:42.750
<v Speaker 3>after it does this a number of times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is primarily from northrop prize </v>

473
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:46.051
<v Speaker 3>interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People start wondering if there's not </v>

474
00:26:46.051 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 3>something wrong with the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>state itself is.</v>

475
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:51.561
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the pathway is the place of </v>

476
00:26:51.561 --> 00:26:55.161
<v Speaker 3>redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there's something wrong with that </v>

477
00:26:55.161 --> 00:26:56.040
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then I think on the heels of that</v>

478
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.880
<v Speaker 3>comes the Christian revolution with its </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis that it's not the state </v>

479
00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:04.410
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the place of salvation.</v>

480
00:27:04.411 --> 00:27:08.670
<v Speaker 3>It's the individual psyche and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

481
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.140
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

482
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.170
<v Speaker 3>an ethic that goes along with that too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is quite interesting.</v>

483
00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:18.171
<v Speaker 3>So the ethic of redemption after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>state experiment fails,</v>

484
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:23.700
<v Speaker 3>let's say is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

485
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.720
<v Speaker 3>it's within the individual that </v>
<v Speaker 3>redemption can be manifested,</v>

486
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:32.780
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even in so far as the state is </v>

487
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.121
<v Speaker 3>concerned because the state's proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>functioning is dependent on the proper </v>

488
00:27:35.121 --> 00:27:36.300
<v Speaker 3>functioning of the individual rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the reverse.</v>

489
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Most fundamentally and that the proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>motive,</v>

490
00:27:38.791 --> 00:27:43.791
<v Speaker 3>individual being that's redemptive is </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth and truth is the antidote to this </v>

491
00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:47.940
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that emerges with the fall of man</v>

492
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:53.630
<v Speaker 3>in the story of Adam and eve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that relates back to the </v>

493
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.691
<v Speaker 3>chapters that we've already talked about</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's this insistence in </v>

494
00:27:56.691 --> 00:28:01.190
<v Speaker 3>genesis one that it's the word in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>form of the of truth that generates </v>

495
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:04.440
<v Speaker 3>order out of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even more importantly,</v>

496
00:28:04.441 --> 00:28:07.050
<v Speaker 3>and this is something I like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I most clearly realized just doing these</v>

497
00:28:07.051 --> 00:28:11.610
<v Speaker 3>lectures for the last three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is God continues to say as he speaks,</v>

498
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.640
<v Speaker 3>order into being with truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the being he speaks into being is </v>

499
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.870
<v Speaker 3>good and so there's this insistence that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the being that spoke into being through </v>

500
00:28:21.151 --> 00:28:23.970
<v Speaker 3>truth is good and so there's a hint </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

501
00:28:23.971 --> 00:28:25.530
<v Speaker 3>It's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a hint there,</v>

502
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:30.830
<v Speaker 3>right at the beginning of the story that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the state of being that Adam and </v>

503
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:36.441
<v Speaker 3>eve inhabited before they fail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before they became self consciousness </v>

504
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.500
<v Speaker 3>conscious in so far as they were made in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the image of God and acting out the </v>

505
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.671
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the being itself was properly </v>

506
00:28:46.671 --> 00:28:49.100
<v Speaker 3>balanced and it takes the entire Bible </v>
<v Speaker 3>to rediscover that which is a,</v>

507
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.970
<v Speaker 3>which is a journey back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning.</v>

508
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that that's a classic theme.</v>

509
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:58.280
<v Speaker 3>It's a classic mythological theme that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the wise person is the person who finds </v>

510
00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.030
<v Speaker 3>what they lost in childhood and regains </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

511
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.970
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's A.</v>

512
00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.210
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a Jewish idea that Zadie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>

513
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:11.330
<v Speaker 3>it was a messiah figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the person who finds what he lost in </v>

514
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.320
<v Speaker 3>childhood and regains it to this idea of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this return to the beginning,</v>

515
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:18.321
<v Speaker 3>except that the return is you don't fall</v>
<v Speaker 3>backwards into childhood and </v>

516
00:29:18.321 --> 00:29:21.240
<v Speaker 3>unconsciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You returned voluntarily to the state of</v>

517
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.840
<v Speaker 3>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well awake and then determined to </v>

518
00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.460
<v Speaker 3>participate through truth in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifestation of proper being.</v>

519
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.640
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a psychologist and I've taught </v>

520
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.790
<v Speaker 3>personality theory for a very long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know a personality theories that </v>

521
00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:41.721
<v Speaker 3>profound personality theories pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>well and I'm reasonably well versed in </v>

522
00:29:41.721 --> 00:29:45.021
<v Speaker 3>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although not as well versed as I should </v>

523
00:29:45.021 --> 00:29:47.401
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can tell you in all the things </v>

524
00:29:47.401 --> 00:29:47.401
<v Speaker 3>I've ever read or encountered or thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

525
00:29:47.401 --> 00:29:51.931
<v Speaker 3>I have never once found an idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>matches that in terms of profundity but </v>

526
00:29:51.931 --> 00:29:53.920
<v Speaker 3>not only profundity also in </v>
<v Speaker 3>believability.</v>

527
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Because the other thing I see as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinician,</v>

528
00:29:56.021 --> 00:30:01.021
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is very characteristic </v>
<v Speaker 3>of clinical experience and also very </v>

529
00:30:01.021 --> 00:30:04.240
<v Speaker 3>much described explicitly by the great </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinicians,</v>

530
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:09.300
<v Speaker 3>is that what cures in therapy is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the curative.</v>

531
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Now there's exposure to the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're afraid of and avoiding as well,</v>

532
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:17.461
<v Speaker 3>but I would say that's a form of enacted</v>
<v Speaker 3>truth because if you know there's </v>

533
00:30:17.461 --> 00:30:19.990
<v Speaker 3>something you should do by your own set </v>
<v Speaker 3>of rules and you're avoiding it,</v>

534
00:30:19.991 --> 00:30:22.540
<v Speaker 3>then you're enacting a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you're not telling one,</v>

535
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:24.400
<v Speaker 3>but you're acting out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same damn thing.</v>

536
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:29.610
<v Speaker 3>So if I can get you to face what it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're confronting that you know </v>

537
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be avoiding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what's happening is that we're both</v>

538
00:30:32.651 --> 00:30:37.651
<v Speaker 3>partaking in the process of attempting </v>
<v Speaker 3>to act out your deepest truth and what </v>

539
00:30:37.651 --> 00:30:41.050
<v Speaker 3>happens is that that improves people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives and it improves them radically and</v>

540
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.630
<v Speaker 3>the evidence for the clinical evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that is overwhelming.</v>

541
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:49.020
<v Speaker 3>We know that if you expose people to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things they're afraid of but that </v>

542
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.261
<v Speaker 3>they're avoiding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get better and you have to do it </v>

543
00:30:52.261 --> 00:30:53.290
<v Speaker 3>carefully and cautiously and with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own participation and all of that,</v>

544
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:57.790
<v Speaker 3>but of all the things that clinicians </v>
<v Speaker 3>have established that's credible,</v>

545
00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:02.850
<v Speaker 3>that's number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's nested inside this deeper </v>

546
00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.510
<v Speaker 3>realization that the clinical experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>is redemptive,</v>

547
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:09.690
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it is designed to address </v>

548
00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.821
<v Speaker 3>suffering in so far as the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are engaged in the process are both </v>

549
00:31:11.821 --> 00:31:12.490
<v Speaker 3>telling each other the truth and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

550
00:31:12.491 --> 00:31:17.491
<v Speaker 3>well obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you have some problems and </v>

551
00:31:17.491 --> 00:31:19.330
<v Speaker 3>you come to talk to me about them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well first of all just by coming to talk</v>

552
00:31:19.331 --> 00:31:21.310
<v Speaker 3>to me about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've admitted that they exist.</v>

553
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.750
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty good start.</v>

554
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.360
<v Speaker 3>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if you tell me about them,</v>

555
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:28.270
<v Speaker 3>then we know what they are and then if </v>
<v Speaker 3>we know what they are,</v>

556
00:31:28.271 --> 00:31:33.271
<v Speaker 3>we can maybe start to lay out some </v>
<v Speaker 3>solutions and then you can go act out </v>

557
00:31:33.271 --> 00:31:33.430
<v Speaker 3>the solution to see if they work.</v>

558
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.820
<v Speaker 3>But if you don't admit they're there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't tell me what they are.</v>

559
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.540
<v Speaker 3>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like posturing and,</v>

560
00:31:39.541 --> 00:31:44.541
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and acting egotistically and taking the </v>

561
00:31:44.541 --> 00:31:44.541
<v Speaker 3>upper hand in all of that in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions.</v>

562
00:31:44.541 --> 00:31:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the hell is that going to work?</v>

563
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be comfortable moment to moment</v>

564
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:50.500
<v Speaker 3>while we stay encapsulated in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>delusion,</v>

565
00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:55.501
<v Speaker 3>but it's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of that seems to think it </v>

566
00:31:55.501 --> 00:31:55.810
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems pretty self evident.</v>

567
00:31:55.811 --> 00:31:59.260
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freud thought that repression was at the</v>

568
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.800
<v Speaker 3>heart of much mental suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference between repression and </v>

569
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 3>deception is a matter of degree and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all.</v>

570
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:09.520
<v Speaker 3>It's technical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a technical differentiation.</v>

571
00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.840
<v Speaker 3>And Alfred Adler who was one of Freud's </v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest associates,</v>

572
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.640
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and much under appreciated,</v>

573
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:20.641
<v Speaker 3>I would say he thought that people got </v>
<v Speaker 3>into problems because they started to </v>

574
00:32:20.641 --> 00:32:20.641
<v Speaker 3>act out a life lie.</v>

575
00:32:20.641 --> 00:32:25.440
<v Speaker 3>That's what he called it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a life lie that's worth looking up </v>

576
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:25.480
<v Speaker 3>because Adler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although not as charismatic as Freud,</v>

577
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.080
<v Speaker 3>was very practical and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

578
00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:31.580
<v Speaker 3>and really foreshadowed a lot of later </v>
<v Speaker 3>developments in cybernetic theory.</v>

579
00:32:31.581 --> 00:32:36.581
<v Speaker 3>And of course young believed that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could bypass psychotherapy entirely by </v>

580
00:32:36.761 --> 00:32:39.800
<v Speaker 3>merely making a proper moral effort in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own life.</v>

581
00:32:39.801 --> 00:32:44.801
<v Speaker 3>And Carl Rogers believed that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>honest communication mediated through </v>

582
00:32:44.801 --> 00:32:49.601
<v Speaker 3>dialogue that had redemptive </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences and the behaviors believe </v>

583
00:32:49.601 --> 00:32:53.501
<v Speaker 3>that you do a careful micro analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the problems that are laid before you </v>

584
00:32:53.501 --> 00:32:54.860
<v Speaker 3>would help introduce people to what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're avoiding.</v>

585
00:32:55.070 --> 00:33:00.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like all of those things to me are </v>
<v Speaker 3>just secular variations of the notion </v>

586
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.880
<v Speaker 3>that truth will set you free </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>

587
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.030
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

588
00:33:05.031 --> 00:33:10.031
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty powerful story and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

589
00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:12.440
<v Speaker 3>it's not that easy to dispense with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And B,</v>

590
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.020
<v Speaker 3>the other thing is you dispense with it </v>
<v Speaker 3>at your peril.</v>

591
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.820
<v Speaker 3>Because what I have seen as well as </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

592
00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.150
<v Speaker 3>the people that I've seen have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>really hurt,</v>

593
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:25.390
<v Speaker 3>have been hurt mostly by deceit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's also worth thinking about </v>

594
00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:26.750
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get walloped by life.</v>

595
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:29.450
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely no doubt about that.</v>

596
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.810
<v Speaker 3>But I thought for a long time that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

597
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.900
<v Speaker 3>maybe people can hang handle earthquakes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and cancer and even death meaning,</v>

598
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.860
<v Speaker 3>but they can't handle betrayal and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't handle deception.</v>

599
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.340
<v Speaker 3>It can't handle having the rug pulled </v>
<v Speaker 3>out from underneath and by people that </v>

600
00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.250
<v Speaker 3>they love and trust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just does them in,</v>

601
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

602
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:50.570
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

603
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.310
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes them ill,</v>

604
00:33:52.311 --> 00:33:55.780
<v Speaker 3>but it does where it hurts the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychophysiological,</v>

605
00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.320
<v Speaker 3>it damages them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more than that,</v>

606
00:33:57.321 --> 00:34:00.530
<v Speaker 3>it makes them cynical and bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>vicious and resentful,</v>

607
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:05.800
<v Speaker 3>and then they also start to act all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>out in the world and that makes it </v>

608
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:05.800
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

609
00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.140
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story starts.</v>

610
00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:14.170
<v Speaker 3>God uses the spoken truth to create </v>
<v Speaker 3>being that is good and then the </v>

611
00:34:15.561 --> 00:34:20.561
<v Speaker 3>cataclysm occurs and then human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>spend untold millennia trying to sort </v>

612
00:34:21.681 --> 00:34:26.681
<v Speaker 3>out exactly what to do about the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they've become self conscious and </v>

613
00:34:26.681 --> 00:34:30.150
<v Speaker 3>you know by the way we have right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are in fact self conscious.</v>

614
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:34.760
<v Speaker 3>No other animal has that distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you'll read that chimpanzees can,</v>

615
00:34:34.761 --> 00:34:38.000
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you put lipstick on a chimpanzee,</v>

616
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.730
<v Speaker 3>just kind of a strange thing to do.</v>

617
00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:50.260
<v Speaker 3>Well I won't pursue that any further,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the chimpanzee chimpanzee will wipe </v>

618
00:34:50.871 --> 00:34:52.760
<v Speaker 3>off the lipstick if you show it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mirror.</v>

619
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:57.200
<v Speaker 3>And Dolphin seemed to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize themselves in mirrors.</v>

620
00:34:57.201 --> 00:35:02.201
<v Speaker 3>And there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is the glimmerings of self </v>

621
00:35:02.201 --> 00:35:05.351
<v Speaker 3>conscious recognition in other animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to put that in the same conceptual </v>

622
00:35:05.351 --> 00:35:09.230
<v Speaker 3>category as human self consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 3>into my way of thinking.</v>

623
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:11.160
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

624
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.350
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uninformed to say the least,</v>

625
00:35:15.351 --> 00:35:20.351
<v Speaker 3>but I also think that it's motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's motivated by a kind of anti </v>

626
00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 3>humanistic underlying an underlying </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation.</v>

627
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Because our self consciousness is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly developed compared to that,</v>

628
00:35:27.381 --> 00:35:29.350
<v Speaker 3>that they're hardly in the St conceptual</v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

629
00:35:29.351 --> 00:35:30.890
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like comparing the.</v>

630
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.880
<v Speaker 3>The alarm cries of vervet monkeys when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they see a Predator to the language of </v>

631
00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.560
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

632
00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:38.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

633
00:35:38.311 --> 00:35:39.450
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some similarities,</v>

634
00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.100
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their utterances,</v>

635
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:46.340
<v Speaker 3>they're utterances with meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not language and the self </v>

636
00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.131
<v Speaker 3>consciousness of animals is protos self </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and it's only there and a </v>

637
00:35:49.131 --> 00:35:49.290
<v Speaker 3>very small number of animals.</v>

638
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:54.290
<v Speaker 3>And if it's nothing like ours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not aware of the future like we </v>

639
00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.110
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not aware of their boundaries in</v>

640
00:35:55.111 --> 00:35:57.750
<v Speaker 3>space and time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the critical thing.</v>

641
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:02.751
<v Speaker 3>And most particularly time human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered time and when we discovered </v>

642
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:08.781
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we discovered the end of each of our </v>

643
00:36:08.781 --> 00:36:11.481
<v Speaker 3>being and that made all the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the story of Adam and </v>

644
00:36:11.481 --> 00:36:15.471
<v Speaker 3>Eve is about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So genesis one is derived from the </v>

645
00:36:16.021 --> 00:36:20.130
<v Speaker 3>priestly source where God is known as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>low him or El Shaddai,</v>

646
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.990
<v Speaker 3>and there's God in the singular and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gods in the plural,</v>

647
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:29.991
<v Speaker 3>and I suppose that's because it seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you analyze the history of the </v>

648
00:36:29.991 --> 00:36:34.911
<v Speaker 3>development of monotheistic ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that monotheism emerges out of a </v>

649
00:36:34.911 --> 00:36:38.961
<v Speaker 3>plurality of gods and as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because the gods represent </v>

650
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:44.150
<v Speaker 3>fundamental forces at minimum and those </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental forces have to be </v>

651
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:47.571
<v Speaker 3>hierarchically organized for some with </v>
<v Speaker 3>something absolutely at the top because </v>

652
00:36:48.331 --> 00:36:50.040
<v Speaker 3>otherwise they do nothing but war.</v>

653
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to organize your values </v>

654
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:55.100
<v Speaker 3>hierarchically or you stay confused and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

655
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 3>If you're an individual in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

656
00:36:56.881 --> 00:37:01.881
<v Speaker 3>If your estate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know what the next thing </v>

657
00:37:01.881 --> 00:37:03.600
<v Speaker 3>you should do is then there's 50 things </v>
<v Speaker 3>you should do and then how are you going</v>

658
00:37:03.601 --> 00:37:04.770
<v Speaker 3>to do any of them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

659
00:37:04.771 --> 00:37:07.260
<v Speaker 3>You have to prioritize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something has to be above.</v>

660
00:37:07.261 --> 00:37:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Something else has to be arranged in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy for it not to be chaotic,</v>

661
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:16.160
<v Speaker 3>and so there's some principal at the top</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the hierarchy and maybe the </v>

662
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.101
<v Speaker 3>organization of the gods over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the battle of gods that Murcia </v>

663
00:37:19.101 --> 00:37:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Eliana talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're interested in that,</v>

664
00:37:20.101 --> 00:37:22.710
<v Speaker 3>you could read a history of religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>

665
00:37:22.711 --> 00:37:25.050
<v Speaker 3>which I would really recommend it to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three volume book.</v>

666
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:30.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually quite as straightforward </v>

667
00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:32.630
<v Speaker 3>read as far as these things go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Eliana does a very nice job of </v>

668
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:36.680
<v Speaker 3>describing how and even why polytheism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ken's towards monotheism,</v>

669
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:41.750
<v Speaker 3>even in polytheistic cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a strong tendency for the gods </v>

670
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.490
<v Speaker 3>to organize themselves in a hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>with one God at the top in a,</v>

671
00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.180
<v Speaker 3>in a monotheistic culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some,</v>

672
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:48.480
<v Speaker 3>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the other gods just disappear across</v>

673
00:37:48.481 --> 00:37:50.340
<v Speaker 3>time and there's nothing left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the top God.</v>

674
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:55.790
<v Speaker 3>But even in a polytheistic society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a hierarchy of power among the </v>

675
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.650
<v Speaker 3>gods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first story is newer than the second</v>

676
00:37:58.651 --> 00:38:00.240
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the story I'm going to tell you today</v>

677
00:38:00.241 --> 00:38:02.160
<v Speaker 3>is actually older than the one I already</v>
<v Speaker 3>told you,</v>

678
00:38:02.161 --> 00:38:06.120
<v Speaker 3>even though their order was flipped by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the redactor,</v>

679
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:10.200
<v Speaker 3>who's the hypothetical person or persons</v>
<v Speaker 3>who edited these stories together and we</v>

680
00:38:10.201 --> 00:38:12.590
<v Speaker 3>don't know exactly why he or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>committee or what,</v>

681
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.820
<v Speaker 3>I suspect it was a single person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who knows?</v>

682
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:20.240
<v Speaker 3>We don't know why the stories were </v>
<v Speaker 3>edited together in the order that they </v>

683
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:23.130
<v Speaker 3>were edit together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we could infer,</v>

684
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were added together in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>order because the editor thought they </v>

685
00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.490
<v Speaker 3>made sense that way because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>an editor does,</v>

686
00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:34.491
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>An editor tends to take diverse ideas </v>

687
00:38:34.491 --> 00:38:34.980
<v Speaker 3>and then to organize them in some manner</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes.</v>

688
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.440
<v Speaker 3>And part of the manner that makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you can tell them to people and </v>

689
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:44.281
<v Speaker 3>the people stay interested and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell them to people and people remember </v>

690
00:38:44.281 --> 00:38:44.281
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

691
00:38:44.281 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the ways you can tell if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got an argument,</v>

692
00:38:46.721 --> 00:38:51.721
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's communicable and </v>

693
00:38:51.721 --> 00:38:51.721
<v Speaker 3>understandable and memorable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he,</v>

694
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
<v Speaker 3>this person was let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motivated by intuition to organize the </v>

695
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.381
<v Speaker 3>stories in this particular manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the second the yard was strand </v>

696
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:08.700
<v Speaker 3>contains the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the classic stories in the pentitude </v>

697
00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:08.700
<v Speaker 3>that's five books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genesis,</v>

698
00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 3>exodus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leviticus,</v>

699
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:10.060
<v Speaker 3>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Deuteronomy,</v>

700
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:14.050
<v Speaker 3>which we'll try to get through perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 3>in these 12 lectures was,</v>

701
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.810
<v Speaker 3>we'll see how that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's strongly on through poor morphic.</v>

702
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:20.170
<v Speaker 3>So the God in the West account is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all intents and purposes,</v>

703
00:39:20.171 --> 00:39:22.250
<v Speaker 3>a sort of metta person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

704
00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.230
<v Speaker 3>and I dealt with that a little bit last </v>
<v Speaker 3>week because people tend to,</v>

705
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of that as unsophisticated,</v>

706
00:39:28.601 --> 00:39:33.601
<v Speaker 3>but when you think that the mind that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground of consciousness is the most </v>

707
00:39:34.931 --> 00:39:39.931
<v Speaker 3>complex thing that we know of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's not so unsophisticated to </v>

708
00:39:39.931 --> 00:39:42.250
<v Speaker 3>assume that the most complex thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there might be is like that,</v>

709
00:39:42.251 --> 00:39:44.580
<v Speaker 3>or it's at least it's as good as we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with our imaginations.</v>

710
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.580
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't think it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so a,</v>

711
00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.420
<v Speaker 3>it's so unsophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also the case,</v>

712
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.320
<v Speaker 3>and this is practically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it is not at all unreasonable to</v>

713
00:39:56.321 --> 00:40:01.321
<v Speaker 3>think of God the father as the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that arises from the crowd that exists </v>

714
00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:03.730
<v Speaker 3>into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

715
00:40:03.731 --> 00:40:08.731
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about that in relationship to </v>

716
00:40:08.731 --> 00:40:08.731
<v Speaker 3>the idea of sacrifice at least a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit more,</v>

717
00:40:08.731 --> 00:40:12.790
<v Speaker 3>or we're going to make sacrifices in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>present so that the future is happy with</v>

718
00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:14.320
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the question is,</v>

719
00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:16.960
<v Speaker 3>what is that future that would be happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you?</v>

720
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.770
<v Speaker 3>And answer to that is it's the spirit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>

721
00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:25.860
<v Speaker 3>That's who you're negotiating with </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you make the assumption that if </v>

722
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.910
<v Speaker 3>you forgo impulsive pleasure and get </v>
<v Speaker 3>your medical degree,</v>

723
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.240
<v Speaker 3>that when you're done in 10 years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a physician,</v>

724
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.680
<v Speaker 3>humanity as such will honor your </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice and commitment and open the </v>

725
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 3>doors to you.</v>

726
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.360
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're treating the future as if it's</v>

727
00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:45.361
<v Speaker 3>a single being and you're also treating </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as if it's some something like a </v>

728
00:40:45.361 --> 00:40:49.231
<v Speaker 3>compassionate judge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're acting that out and maybe we had </v>

729
00:40:49.231 --> 00:40:52.420
<v Speaker 3>to imagine God in that form before we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could understand.</v>

730
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Once we started to understand that there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a future,</v>

731
00:40:55.211 --> 00:41:00.211
<v Speaker 3>perhaps we had to imagine God in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>form in order to concretize something </v>

732
00:41:00.211 --> 00:41:02.710
<v Speaker 3>that we could bargain with so that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could figure out how to use sacrifice to</v>

733
00:41:02.711 --> 00:41:07.711
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to guide ourselves into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the future because as sacrifice is a </v>

734
00:41:07.711 --> 00:41:11.131
<v Speaker 3>contract with the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a contract with any </v>

735
00:41:11.131 --> 00:41:11.131
<v Speaker 3>particular person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

736
00:41:11.131 --> 00:41:13.270
<v Speaker 3>It's a contract with the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity as such.</v>

737
00:41:13.271 --> 00:41:16.300
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so when you think about it that way,</v>

738
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:21.690
<v Speaker 3>that should make you faint with </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazement because that is such a bloody </v>

739
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.010
<v Speaker 3>amazing idea to come up with that idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can bargain with the future.</v>

740
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:25.720
<v Speaker 3>That is some idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

741
00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.480
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like the major idea of human,</v>

742
00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.670
<v Speaker 3>of humankind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We suffer.</v>

743
00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:35.700
<v Speaker 3>What do we do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We figured out how to bargain with the </v>

744
00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:36.020
<v Speaker 3>future and we minimize suffering in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>manner.</v>

745
00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 3>It's like no other animal does that </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

746
00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:38.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the lions,</v>

747
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:42.170
<v Speaker 3>they just eat everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a wolf can eat 40 pounds of meat</v>

748
00:41:42.171 --> 00:41:43.850
<v Speaker 3>in a single city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

749
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:45.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's some meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat it.</v>

750
00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like not like save some mammoth for</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow.</v>

751
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:51.290
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not a wolf thing,</v>

752
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:53.420
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a human thing and that might mean</v>

753
00:41:53.421 --> 00:41:55.940
<v Speaker 3>you have to be hungry today or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a farmer,</v>

754
00:41:55.941 --> 00:41:57.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>several thousand years ago,</v>

755
00:41:57.771 --> 00:41:59.030
<v Speaker 3>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago or so,</v>

756
00:41:59.031 --> 00:42:02.720
<v Speaker 3>what agriculture first got going and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're starving to death waiting for the</v>

757
00:42:02.721 --> 00:42:06.140
<v Speaker 3>spring planting and you think we bill it</v>
<v Speaker 3>bloody well better not eat those seeds.</v>

758
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.800
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's really something to be able </v>

759
00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:11.800
<v Speaker 3>to control yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make the future real,</v>

760
00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:15.500
<v Speaker 3>to put off what you could use today and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not just in some impulsive manner,</v>

761
00:42:15.501 --> 00:42:17.360
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe your kids are starving to death.</v>

762
00:42:17.361 --> 00:42:22.361
<v Speaker 3>You think we are not touching the seeds </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we need for the future and for </v>

763
00:42:22.361 --> 00:42:27.221
<v Speaker 3>human beings to have discovered that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then to also have figured out that we </v>

764
00:42:27.221 --> 00:42:27.221
<v Speaker 3>could bargain with the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

765
00:42:27.221 --> 00:42:29.150
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's something and I think that that.</v>

766
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:34.390
<v Speaker 3>I think that the stories that are laid </v>
<v Speaker 3>out in this book actually describe at </v>

767
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.580
<v Speaker 3>least in part the process by which that </v>
<v Speaker 3>occurred.</v>

768
00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.660
<v Speaker 3>They always stories begin with genesis </v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

769
00:42:38.661 --> 00:42:43.661
<v Speaker 3>four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the account of the heavens and </v>

770
00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:45.911
<v Speaker 3>the earth when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's two real creation stories at </v>

771
00:42:45.911 --> 00:42:45.911
<v Speaker 3>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the newer one,</v>

772
00:42:45.911 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 3>which is the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the older one,</v>

773
00:42:46.761 --> 00:42:51.761
<v Speaker 3>which is the second one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the older one begins in chapter two </v>

774
00:42:51.761 --> 00:42:51.761
<v Speaker 3>and that's the story that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

775
00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:53.270
<v Speaker 3>that we're getting into now.</v>

776
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.440
<v Speaker 3>Adam and eve are in that Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Noah,</v>

777
00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:01.340
<v Speaker 3>the Tower of Babel in the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>strand exodus numbers along,</v>

778
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.320
<v Speaker 3>and there's some of the priestly version</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there too,</v>

779
00:43:03.321 --> 00:43:05.980
<v Speaker 3>as well as the 10 commandments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

780
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:10.520
<v Speaker 3>there's some lovely representations of </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Paradise.</v>

781
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:16.160
<v Speaker 3>This is a garden of earthly delights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's his name?</v>

782
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.370
<v Speaker 3>Say That Bosch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

783
00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.080
<v Speaker 3>Hieronymus Bosch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has that crazy.</v>

784
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:26.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How he didn't get burnt at the stake is </v>

785
00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.050
<v Speaker 3>absolutely beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

786
00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of you know about Salvador Dali,</v>

787
00:43:29.601 --> 00:43:34.601
<v Speaker 3>I suppose most of you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean delis a piker compared to </v>

788
00:43:34.601 --> 00:43:34.601
<v Speaker 3>Hieronymus Bosch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

789
00:43:34.601 --> 00:43:38.800
<v Speaker 3>you could spend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's three pieces of this </v>

790
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.921
<v Speaker 3>particular painting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could spend a very bizarre and </v>

791
00:43:42.981 --> 00:43:47.000
<v Speaker 3>surreal month looking at that painting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it was with Bosch,</v>

792
00:43:47.001 --> 00:43:51.650
<v Speaker 3>but he was some sort of creature that </v>
<v Speaker 3>only popped up once and probably for the</v>

793
00:43:51.651 --> 00:43:52.160
<v Speaker 3>best.</v>

794
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:57.740
<v Speaker 3>And so there's been very many </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations of paradise.</v>

795
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:59.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God only knows what that is.</v>

796
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:03.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like I could probably guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I won't.</v>

797
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.530
<v Speaker 3>And then look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

798
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.560
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the lion lying down with the </v>

799
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:11.560
<v Speaker 3>lamb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

800
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.291
<v Speaker 3>So that's this idea that's maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>projected back in time that there was a </v>

801
00:44:14.291 --> 00:44:15.480
<v Speaker 3>time or maybe will be a time when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the,</v>

802
00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:20.180
<v Speaker 3>when the horrors of life are no longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary for life itself to exist.</v>

803
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the horrors of life or of course </v>

804
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.871
<v Speaker 3>that everything eats everything else and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that everything dies and that </v>

805
00:44:28.871 --> 00:44:29.900
<v Speaker 3>everything's born and the whole bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>places a charnel house and it's,</v>

806
00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:35.040
<v Speaker 3>it's a catastrophe beginning to end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is the vision of it being.</v>

807
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.130
<v Speaker 3>Other than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

808
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:42.170
<v Speaker 3>there was a strong idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was also in implicit in the </v>

809
00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:45.711
<v Speaker 3>alchemical ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's also implicit in the </v>

810
00:44:45.711 --> 00:44:48.111
<v Speaker 3>scientific revolution that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>can interact with reality in such a way </v>

811
00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:54.591
<v Speaker 3>so that the tragic and evil elements of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be mitigated and so that we can </v>

812
00:44:54.591 --> 00:44:57.570
<v Speaker 3>move somewhat closer to a state that </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be characterized well,</v>

813
00:44:57.571 --> 00:45:02.571
<v Speaker 3>that's obviously images stick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might be characterized by </v>

814
00:45:02.571 --> 00:45:03.870
<v Speaker 3>something like that where we have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits of actual existence without all</v>

815
00:45:03.871 --> 00:45:06.120
<v Speaker 3>of the catastrophe that seems to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>along with it.</v>

816
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:11.120
<v Speaker 3>And Carl Young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he wrote about the emergence of </v>

817
00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Alchemy or the emergence of science from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alchemy,</v>

818
00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:15.900
<v Speaker 3>he thought of science as being motivated</v>
<v Speaker 3>by a dream because for you dream was the</v>

819
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.420
<v Speaker 3>dream was the manifestation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>instincts.</v>

820
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:20.670
<v Speaker 3>That was the boundary between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>instincts and thinking.</v>

821
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:21.510
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

822
00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:25.560
<v Speaker 3>sciences nested inside a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the dream is that if we investigated</v>

823
00:45:25.561 --> 00:45:29.370
<v Speaker 3>the structures of material reality with </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficient attention and truth,</v>

824
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 3>that we could then learn enough about </v>
<v Speaker 3>material reality to alleviate suffering,</v>

825
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To produce the philosopher's stone,</v>

826
00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:38.130
<v Speaker 3>to make everybody wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make everybody healthy,</v>

827
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:41.820
<v Speaker 3>to make everyone live as long as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to live for perhaps forever.</v>

828
00:45:41.821 --> 00:45:46.821
<v Speaker 3>That that's the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to alleviate the catastrophe of </v>

829
00:45:46.821 --> 00:45:48.590
<v Speaker 3>existence and that that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that mysteries,</v>

830
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:53.870
<v Speaker 3>the solution to the mysteries of life </v>
<v Speaker 3>that might enable us to develop such a </v>

831
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:57.870
<v Speaker 3>substance or let's say a multitude of </v>
<v Speaker 3>substances provided the motive force for</v>

832
00:45:57.871 --> 00:46:00.390
<v Speaker 3>the development of science and young </v>
<v Speaker 3>trace,</v>

833
00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:05.391
<v Speaker 3>that the development of that mode of </v>
<v Speaker 3>force really over a thousand years and </v>

834
00:46:05.391 --> 00:46:06.060
<v Speaker 3>if you're interested in reading his </v>
<v Speaker 3>books on Alchemy,</v>

835
00:46:06.061 --> 00:46:11.061
<v Speaker 3>which are extraordinarily difficult and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really saying something about </v>

836
00:46:11.061 --> 00:46:12.180
<v Speaker 3>young because all of his books are </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult and then the books on Alchemy,</v>

837
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.040
<v Speaker 3>they kind of take a quantum leap.</v>

838
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.020
<v Speaker 3>That's actually a very small leap </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice.</v>

839
00:46:16.021 --> 00:46:20.250
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't say that they take a massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>leap into a whole different dimension of</v>

840
00:46:20.251 --> 00:46:22.050
<v Speaker 3>complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what he was trying to get at.</v>

841
00:46:22.051 --> 00:46:26.100
<v Speaker 3>He went back into the ELC chemical texts</v>
<v Speaker 3>and interpreted them as if they were the</v>

842
00:46:26.101 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 3>dream on which science was founded and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Newton was an outcome is by the way,</v>

843
00:46:29.881 --> 00:46:34.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean have hypotheses are certainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>well supported by the historical facts.</v>

844
00:46:35.701 --> 00:46:39.200
<v Speaker 3>Science did emerge out of alchemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is what were the alchemists</v>

845
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:44.210
<v Speaker 3>up to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were trying to produce the </v>

846
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:45.681
<v Speaker 3>philosopher's stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was the universal medica meant </v>

847
00:46:45.681 --> 00:46:48.111
<v Speaker 3>for mankind's pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Young felt at what had happened was </v>

848
00:46:48.111 --> 00:46:48.111
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

849
00:46:48.111 --> 00:46:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Christianity had promised that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cessation of suffering promised it for a</v>

850
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.670
<v Speaker 3>thousand years and yet suffering went on</v>
<v Speaker 3>unabated.</v>

851
00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:59.090
<v Speaker 3>And at the same times Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had attempted to really put emphasis </v>

852
00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:03.141
<v Speaker 3>on spiritual development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say at the expensive material </v>

853
00:47:03.141 --> 00:47:03.141
<v Speaker 3>development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

854
00:47:03.141 --> 00:47:05.340
<v Speaker 3>Thinking of material development as </v>
<v Speaker 3>something akin to a sin,</v>

855
00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.990
<v Speaker 3>trying to get a control of impulsivity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

856
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:11.640
<v Speaker 3>and all the things that went along with </v>
<v Speaker 3>a two embodied existence.</v>

857
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.820
<v Speaker 3>There was a reason for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that by about a thousand add the </v>

858
00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.860
<v Speaker 3>European mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhat educated by that point,</v>

859
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:25.040
<v Speaker 3>somewhat able to concentrate on a single</v>
<v Speaker 3>point perhaps because of a very long </v>

860
00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:29.631
<v Speaker 3>history of intense religious training </v>
<v Speaker 3>turned its dream to the unexplored </v>

861
00:47:30.371 --> 00:47:31.510
<v Speaker 3>material world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And thought,</v>

862
00:47:31.511 --> 00:47:32.320
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

863
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:37.530
<v Speaker 3>the spiritual redemption that we've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeking didn't appear to produce the </v>

864
00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:40.951
<v Speaker 3>result that was promised or intended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so maybe there's another place that </v>

865
00:47:40.951 --> 00:47:45.001
<v Speaker 3>we should look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was in the damned material </v>

866
00:47:45.001 --> 00:47:45.001
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

867
00:47:45.001 --> 00:47:45.001
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

868
00:47:45.001 --> 00:47:49.860
<v Speaker 3>which was supposed to be at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>according to some elements of classic </v>

869
00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:50.410
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing about the creation of the devil.</v>

870
00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:53.140
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the three point I'm making is that,</v>

871
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:56.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to underestimate the</v>

872
00:47:56.471 --> 00:48:01.471
<v Speaker 3>amount of human motivation that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>embedded in the attempt to alleviate </v>

873
00:48:01.661 --> 00:48:03.820
<v Speaker 3>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to eradicate disease,</v>

874
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:08.190
<v Speaker 3>to help people live a healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy life and will,</v>

875
00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:13.200
<v Speaker 3>that's the disease obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to live a long life as well and to </v>

876
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:13.200
<v Speaker 3>make things as peaceful as possible.</v>

877
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can be cynical about people </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

878
00:48:14.561 --> 00:48:18.220
<v Speaker 3>you can talk about them as motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and being corrupt and all of those</v>

879
00:48:18.221 --> 00:48:23.221
<v Speaker 3>things and all of those things are true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you shouldn't throw away the baby </v>

880
00:48:23.221 --> 00:48:26.191
<v Speaker 3>with the bathwater because we have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>striving for a very long time to set </v>

881
00:48:26.191 --> 00:48:29.881
<v Speaker 3>things right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've done to actually not too bad </v>

882
00:48:29.881 --> 00:48:31.861
<v Speaker 3>at job of it for half starving crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>insect written chimpanzees with </v>

883
00:48:32.531 --> 00:48:35.710
<v Speaker 3>lifespans of 50 to 70 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

884
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:40.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could deserve a bit of sympathy for </v>

885
00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:40.770
<v Speaker 3>our position as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

886
00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:52.360
<v Speaker 3>some other representations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one I liked the one on the left.</v>

887
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:57.690
<v Speaker 3>That's paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paradise is a walled garden and that's </v>

888
00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:57.690
<v Speaker 3>what paradise means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's paradise that was,</v>

889
00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:59.110
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the language.</v>

890
00:48:59.111 --> 00:48:59.600
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

891
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:00.460
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

892
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:03.470
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's associated with Persian parodies.</v>

893
00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:06.460
<v Speaker 3>That means walled garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why a walled garden?</v>

894
00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes back to the chaos order idea.</v>

895
00:49:08.591 --> 00:49:13.591
<v Speaker 3>So this is where God puts man in woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the creation in a walled garden </v>

896
00:49:13.591 --> 00:49:17.940
<v Speaker 3>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Wall is culture in order and the </v>

897
00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.191
<v Speaker 3>garden is nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is the proper huet and </v>

898
00:49:20.191 --> 00:49:20.191
<v Speaker 3>habitat is nature and culture in </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance.</v>

899
00:49:20.191 --> 00:49:21.910
<v Speaker 3>And while we like gardens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why?</v>

900
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:26.911
<v Speaker 3>Because well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not completely covered with </v>

901
00:49:26.911 --> 00:49:26.911
<v Speaker 3>weeds and mosquitoes and black flies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

902
00:49:26.911 --> 00:49:28.270
<v Speaker 3>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're civilized a little bit,</v>

903
00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:31.090
<v Speaker 3>but still within that civilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>

904
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:36.490
<v Speaker 3>it's more benevolent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys is encouraged to flourish and </v>

905
00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:36.490
<v Speaker 3>people find that rejuvenating.</v>

906
00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:40.980
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea that paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the proper habitat of a human being is </v>

907
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:45.251
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a walled garden is a good one and </v>

908
00:49:45.251 --> 00:49:45.251
<v Speaker 3>it's walled because while you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep things out,</v>

909
00:49:45.251 --> 00:49:46.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean raccoons for example,</v>

910
00:49:46.241 --> 00:49:47.620
<v Speaker 3>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to keep those things out,</v>

911
00:49:47.621 --> 00:49:48.910
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it's impossible.</v>

912
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.830
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

913
00:49:50.831 --> 00:49:52.090
<v Speaker 3>you don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

914
00:49:52.091 --> 00:49:53.830
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of things you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want in your garden,</v>

915
00:49:53.831 --> 00:49:56.620
<v Speaker 3>like snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walls don't seem to be much used against</v>

916
00:49:56.621 --> 00:50:01.621
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that paradise is a walled </v>

917
00:50:01.621 --> 00:50:02.880
<v Speaker 3>garden is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>

918
00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:06.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an echo back to the chaos order idea,</v>

919
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.290
<v Speaker 3>walls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

920
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:13.500
<v Speaker 3>right garden nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the proper human habitat is a </v>

921
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.160
<v Speaker 3>properly tended garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

922
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:20.580
<v Speaker 3>the radical left leaning anti theist </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmentalist's tend to make the case</v>

923
00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:28.291
<v Speaker 3>that the predations of the Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalist system are a consequence of </v>

924
00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:34.721
<v Speaker 3>the injunction that was delivered in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Genesis by God to man to go out and </v>

925
00:50:36.321 --> 00:50:37.340
<v Speaker 3>dominate the earth.</v>

926
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:40.490
<v Speaker 3>David Suzuki has talked a lot about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

927
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:46.870
<v Speaker 3>They believe that that statement has </v>
<v Speaker 3>given rise to our inappropriate </v>

928
00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:53.350
<v Speaker 3>assumption that we have the right to </v>
<v Speaker 3>exert control over the world and that </v>

929
00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:57.941
<v Speaker 3>that's what's turned us into these </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible predatory monsters sometimes </v>

930
00:50:57.941 --> 00:51:02.360
<v Speaker 3>described as cancers on the face of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth or viruses that have inhabited the</v>

931
00:51:02.361 --> 00:51:07.361
<v Speaker 3>entire ecosystem who are doing nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>but one wandering everywhere and </v>

932
00:51:07.361 --> 00:51:08.570
<v Speaker 3>wreaking havoc as rapidly as we possibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

933
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Which is another perspective on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>essential element of human kind that I </v>

934
00:51:14.481 --> 00:51:18.320
<v Speaker 3>find absolutely deplorable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

935
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.510
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the historical record,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

936
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.150
<v Speaker 3>even casually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll find out that as early as,</v>

937
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.370
<v Speaker 3>as late as the late 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

938
00:51:25.371 --> 00:51:26.330
<v Speaker 3>95,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thereabouts,</v>

939
00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Thomas Huxley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was Elvis Huxley's grandfather and a</v>

940
00:51:29.091 --> 00:51:34.091
<v Speaker 3>great defender of Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prepared a report for the British </v>

941
00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:37.751
<v Speaker 3>government on ocean sustainability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his conclusion was fish away.</v>

942
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

943
00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:44.860
<v Speaker 3>there's so many fish out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The oceans are so inexhaustible that no </v>

944
00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.970
<v Speaker 3>matter how hard humanity tried for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for any number of years,</v>

945
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:52.150
<v Speaker 3>the probability that we could do more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than put a dent in what was out there </v>

946
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:54.050
<v Speaker 3>was zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now Huxley turned out to be wrong.</v>

947
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.110
<v Speaker 3>He didn't realize that our population </v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to spike so dramatically,</v>

948
00:51:57.111 --> 00:52:02.111
<v Speaker 3>partly because we got a little bit rich </v>
<v Speaker 3>and our children's stopped dying at the </v>

949
00:52:02.111 --> 00:52:03.830
<v Speaker 3>rate of like 60 percent before they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>one years old.</v>

950
00:52:03.831 --> 00:52:08.831
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually managed to populate the </v>

951
00:52:08.831 --> 00:52:12.040
<v Speaker 3>earth with a few people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't really until 1960 or so </v>

952
00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:15.371
<v Speaker 3>that we woke up to the fact that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>were so many of us that we actually had </v>

953
00:52:15.371 --> 00:52:15.890
<v Speaker 3>to start paying attention to what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing to the planet.</v>

954
00:52:15.891 --> 00:52:18.110
<v Speaker 3>And that's like what 50 years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

955
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.350
<v Speaker 3>we've just started to develop the </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>

956
00:52:21.351 --> 00:52:25.880
<v Speaker 3>have the wherewithal to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole world might be well considered</v>

957
00:52:25.881 --> 00:52:30.881
<v Speaker 3>a garden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we need to live inside the proper </v>

958
00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:31.520
<v Speaker 3>balance between culture and order or </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture and,</v>

959
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:33.230
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and chaos.</v>

960
00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were spending all of our time just </v>

961
00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:40.430
<v Speaker 3>trying not to die and usually very </v>
<v Speaker 3>unsuccessfully.</v>

962
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:41.540
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

963
00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:48.530
<v Speaker 3>So I don't agree with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of the opening section of</v>

964
00:52:48.531 --> 00:52:53.531
<v Speaker 3>Genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that it's given human </v>

965
00:52:53.531 --> 00:52:54.440
<v Speaker 3>being is the right to act as super </v>
<v Speaker 3>predators on the planet.</v>

966
00:52:54.441 --> 00:52:59.441
<v Speaker 3>I think that instead the proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment for human beings is </v>

967
00:52:59.441 --> 00:53:01.970
<v Speaker 3>presented quite properly as a garden and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the role of people,</v>

968
00:53:01.971 --> 00:53:05.030
<v Speaker 3>and that's explicitly stated in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the second story of Adam and eve,</v>

969
00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:10.031
<v Speaker 3>was to tend the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that means to make the proper </v>

970
00:53:10.031 --> 00:53:12.860
<v Speaker 3>decisions and to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything thrives and flourishes and so</v>

971
00:53:12.861 --> 00:53:15.860
<v Speaker 3>that it's good for the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>living there that aren't just people,</v>

972
00:53:15.861 --> 00:53:18.260
<v Speaker 3>but also good for the people too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fine.</v>

973
00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:23.261
<v Speaker 3>I think we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could at least note that that's a </v>

974
00:53:23.261 --> 00:53:26.770
<v Speaker 3>slightly different take on the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the ultimately cynical </v>

975
00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:28.770
<v Speaker 3>interpretation that's so commonly put </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward today.</v>

976
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:34.220
<v Speaker 3>Now inside that walled garden is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of trees and Adam and eve and </v>

977
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:40.760
<v Speaker 3>some animals and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and unfortunately the tree happens to </v>

978
00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:40.760
<v Speaker 3>have a snake wrapped around it.</v>

979
00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.530
<v Speaker 3>Now that's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk about that a lot and</v>

980
00:53:43.531 --> 00:53:47.490
<v Speaker 3>the snake in both of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations is no ordinary snake say</v>

981
00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:49.830
<v Speaker 3>it's got a human head and it's got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human head there too.</v>

982
00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:52.650
<v Speaker 3>So whatever that snake is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

983
00:53:52.651 --> 00:53:56.730
<v Speaker 3>let forget about looking at this from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious perspective,</v>

984
00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:01.760
<v Speaker 3>like if you can just imagine that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>an anthropologist and you've never seen </v>

985
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:01.760
<v Speaker 3>this image before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

986
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.160
<v Speaker 3>what do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

987
00:54:02.161 --> 00:54:06.090
<v Speaker 3>you see walls and you see something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fairly pleasant enclosure,</v>

988
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:08.730
<v Speaker 3>and then you see a tree and people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating from the tree,</v>

989
00:54:08.731 --> 00:54:10.950
<v Speaker 3>but the tree has the snake in it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has a human head,</v>

990
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 3>and so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

991
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.570
<v Speaker 3>what's a snake with a human head?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you think,</v>

992
00:54:15.571 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's half snake and half human.</v>

993
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:20.990
<v Speaker 3>That's hardly revelatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just self evidence.</v>

994
00:54:20.991 --> 00:54:23.160
<v Speaker 3>So whatever that snake is isn't just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>snake.</v>

995
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:25.850
<v Speaker 3>It snake and human or it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

996
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:29.040
<v Speaker 3>it's a snake and partakes in whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings are.</v>

997
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:30.720
<v Speaker 3>And that's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll continue.</v>

998
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:35.750
<v Speaker 3>We'll consider that later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see the same thing here and you </v>

999
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:39.650
<v Speaker 3>see in this particular version,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the head is one also has wings </v>

1000
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.660
<v Speaker 3>and so this is a wing snake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like a dragon.</v>

1001
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.920
<v Speaker 3>And so it crawls on the ground like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reptile and it's got an aerial aspect or</v>

1002
00:54:46.921 --> 00:54:49.050
<v Speaker 3>a spiritual aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here it's a snake,</v>

1003
00:54:49.051 --> 00:54:51.540
<v Speaker 3>which is like the lowest form of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Reptilian life.</v>

1004
00:54:51.541 --> 00:54:56.541
<v Speaker 3>Say something that crawls on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that's human and </v>

1005
00:54:56.541 --> 00:54:56.541
<v Speaker 3>something that's spiritual at the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1006
00:54:56.541 --> 00:54:59.970
<v Speaker 3>And it inhabits the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which look a lot like magic mushrooms by</v>

1007
00:54:59.971 --> 00:55:01.100
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1008
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:07.610
<v Speaker 3>you can look that up if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's quite an interesting little </v>

1009
00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:07.610
<v Speaker 3>rabbit hole to wander down if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>curious about it.</v>

1010
00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1011
00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:13.570
<v Speaker 3>but there's an idea here too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there was something in the </v>

1012
00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:14.880
<v Speaker 3>garden at the beginning of time that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a snake that was like a person that</v>

1013
00:55:14.881 --> 00:55:17.910
<v Speaker 3>was like something that was winged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something spiritual.</v>

1014
00:55:17.911 --> 00:55:22.911
<v Speaker 3>So it's spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human and Reptilian all at the same </v>

1015
00:55:22.911 --> 00:55:25.401
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the animating spirit of the </v>

1016
00:55:25.401 --> 00:55:25.401
<v Speaker 3>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1017
00:55:25.401 --> 00:55:26.040
<v Speaker 3>So keep that in mind.</v>

1018
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:29.880
<v Speaker 3>Thus the heavens and the earth were </v>
<v Speaker 3>finished.</v>

1019
00:55:29.881 --> 00:55:32.580
<v Speaker 3>This is in relationship to genesis one </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the host of them.</v>

1020
00:55:32.581 --> 00:55:35.340
<v Speaker 3>And on the seventh day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God ended his work which he had made.</v>

1021
00:55:35.341 --> 00:55:37.530
<v Speaker 3>And he rested on the seventh day from </v>
<v Speaker 3>all his work,</v>

1022
00:55:37.531 --> 00:55:42.531
<v Speaker 3>which he had made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And God blessed the seventh day and </v>

1023
00:55:42.531 --> 00:55:43.050
<v Speaker 3>sanctified it because that in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had rested from all his work,</v>

1024
00:55:43.051 --> 00:55:46.050
<v Speaker 3>which God created the maid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's wisdom in that one too.</v>

1025
00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:47.680
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea of the sabbath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1026
00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:52.730
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things I've worked </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a lot of people who were hyper </v>

1027
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:55.971
<v Speaker 3>conscientious and thing about hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientious people is that they'll </v>

1028
00:55:55.971 --> 00:55:59.661
<v Speaker 3>just work till they die and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually not very productive because </v>

1029
00:55:59.661 --> 00:56:02.841
<v Speaker 3>then they're dead and they can't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what you have to do with hyper </v>

1030
00:56:02.841 --> 00:56:02.880
<v Speaker 3>conscientious people is you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1031
00:56:02.881 --> 00:56:07.881
<v Speaker 3>I know you'd rather do nothing but work </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you're just as guilty as you </v>

1032
00:56:07.881 --> 00:56:07.881
<v Speaker 3>can possibly be when you're not working.</v>

1033
00:56:07.881 --> 00:56:10.110
<v Speaker 3>But let's figure out what you're up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what you're up to.</v>

1034
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:14.880
<v Speaker 3>In all probability is the attempt to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>productive in the least problematic,</v>

1035
00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:20.090
<v Speaker 3>longest sustaining possible manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that might mean you have to take a </v>

1036
00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:24.321
<v Speaker 3>rest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things I used to work </v>

1037
00:56:24.321 --> 00:56:27.291
<v Speaker 3>with lawyers with people who had risen </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the top of large law firms and they </v>

1038
00:56:27.291 --> 00:56:31.531
<v Speaker 3>were hyper productive types and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>often trying to hit their impossible </v>

1039
00:56:31.531 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 3>quota for yearly hours and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and burning themselves to a frazzle.</v>

1040
00:56:35.111 --> 00:56:37.240
<v Speaker 3>As a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that we used to do</v>

1041
00:56:37.241 --> 00:56:40.600
<v Speaker 3>was he couldn't work fewer hours a day </v>
<v Speaker 3>that just didn't work.</v>

1042
00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:43.090
<v Speaker 3>But what we did was we'd have them take </v>
<v Speaker 3>more time off,</v>

1043
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:45.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a four day weekend every two months</v>

1044
00:56:45.461 --> 00:56:47.800
<v Speaker 3>or something that was plotted out into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>

1045
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.250
<v Speaker 3>And then we track their billable hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is their degree of productivity.</v>

1046
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:56.250
<v Speaker 3>It would actually increase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was so cool because you could </v>

1047
00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:56.250
<v Speaker 3>take hardworking people and you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1048
00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:56.350
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1049
00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.690
<v Speaker 3>take break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1050
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you'll be more productive if you</v>

1051
00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 3>take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1052
00:57:02.531 --> 00:57:07.531
<v Speaker 3>that couldn't possibly be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should just work flat out all the </v>

1053
00:57:07.531 --> 00:57:07.531
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1054
00:57:07.531 --> 00:57:07.531
<v Speaker 3>let's test that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take a break now.</v>

1055
00:57:07.531 --> 00:57:08.590
<v Speaker 3>And that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1056
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:11.410
<v Speaker 3>what happened was their productivity </v>
<v Speaker 3>would increase often by 10 percent.</v>

1057
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:13.450
<v Speaker 3>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's wisdom here too,</v>

1058
00:57:13.451 --> 00:57:18.451
<v Speaker 3>which is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is alludes to the Adam and Eve </v>

1059
00:57:18.451 --> 00:57:19.960
<v Speaker 3>story near the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1060
00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.580
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're self conscious,</v>

1061
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:24.220
<v Speaker 3>you discover the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to work well.</v>

1062
00:57:24.221 --> 00:57:25.840
<v Speaker 3>Then the question is how much should you</v>
<v Speaker 3>work?</v>

1063
00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:30.930
<v Speaker 3>And one answer is you better bloody well</v>
<v Speaker 3>work all the time because no matter how </v>

1064
00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:31.540
<v Speaker 3>much work you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not solving your problems.</v>

1065
00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:33.130
<v Speaker 3>They're coming along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1066
00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:34.990
<v Speaker 3>and you can stack up all the money you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

1067
00:57:34.991 --> 00:57:36.370
<v Speaker 3>you can stack up all the wealth you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

1068
00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:38.770
<v Speaker 3>it is not going to protect you in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>final analysis.</v>

1069
00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:44.040
<v Speaker 3>So you better be hitting the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>running and you better run flat out all </v>

1070
00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:44.040
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or what happens if you do that?</v>

1071
00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Well then you die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a good solution.</v>

1072
00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:52.380
<v Speaker 3>So maybe you should rest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so how does that risk get </v>

1073
00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:52.380
<v Speaker 3>instantiated?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1074
00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:55.630
<v Speaker 3>it's not an easy to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one way to do it,</v>

1075
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:57.490
<v Speaker 3>let's say conceptually is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1076
00:57:57.491 --> 00:58:02.491
<v Speaker 3>even God had to rest one day a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you don't have to be so </v>

1077
00:58:02.491 --> 00:58:06.121
<v Speaker 3>presumptuous to assume that if God had </v>
<v Speaker 3>to rest one day a week that maybe you </v>

1078
00:58:06.121 --> 00:58:10.711
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are allowed to work nonstop without </v>

1079
00:58:11.651 --> 00:58:13.840
<v Speaker 3>a break at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1080
00:58:13.841 --> 00:58:15.820
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think our culture has slipped into</v>

1081
00:58:15.821 --> 00:58:19.120
<v Speaker 3>that in quite a dangerous way because </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is open all the time.</v>

1082
00:58:19.121 --> 00:58:19.630
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1083
00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:22.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm find that just as convenient as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of you,</v>

1084
00:58:22.151 --> 00:58:25.660
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so strange to talk to modern people</v>

1085
00:58:25.661 --> 00:58:27.310
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things they always </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you,</v>

1086
00:58:27.311 --> 00:58:27.700
<v Speaker 3>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1087
00:58:27.701 --> 00:58:29.260
<v Speaker 3>how are you and what do they always say?</v>

1088
00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:30.970
<v Speaker 3>They don't say good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't say bad.</v>

1089
00:58:30.971 --> 00:58:32.710
<v Speaker 3>They say busy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1090
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:33.400
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1091
00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:39.690
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where genesis two starts and we </v>

1092
00:58:39.791 --> 00:58:44.791
<v Speaker 3>finally got there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the generations of the </v>

1093
00:58:44.791 --> 00:58:47.101
<v Speaker 3>heavens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>end of the earth when they were created </v>

1094
00:58:47.101 --> 00:58:48.490
<v Speaker 3>in the day that the Lord God made the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Earth and the heavens and every plant of</v>

1095
00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:53.491
<v Speaker 3>the field before it was in the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and every herb of the field before it </v>

1096
00:58:53.491 --> 00:58:56.281
<v Speaker 3>grew for the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God had not caused it to rain upon the </v>

1097
00:58:56.281 --> 00:58:56.860
<v Speaker 3>earth and there was not a man to till </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground,</v>

1098
00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:00.770
<v Speaker 3>but they're wind type of mist from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth and water,</v>

1099
00:59:00.771 --> 00:59:05.771
<v Speaker 3>the whole face of the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Lord God formed man of the dust </v>

1100
00:59:05.771 --> 00:59:07.450
<v Speaker 3>of the ground and breathed into his </v>
<v Speaker 3>nostrils the breath of life.</v>

1101
00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.450
<v Speaker 3>And man became a living soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1102
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:12.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some archaic thinking in there.</v>

1103
00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.420
<v Speaker 3>The breath is life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1104
00:59:13.421 --> 00:59:14.800
<v Speaker 3>That psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that spirit,</v>

1105
00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:16.660
<v Speaker 3>that's inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's respiration,</v>

1106
00:59:16.661 --> 00:59:18.940
<v Speaker 3>that's all associates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Numa,</v>

1107
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:24.210
<v Speaker 3>pneumatic tire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's breath and the reason that people </v>

1108
00:59:24.210 --> 00:59:24.610
<v Speaker 3>associated life with breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1109
00:59:24.611 --> 00:59:25.870
<v Speaker 3>that's not so foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1110
00:59:25.890 --> 00:59:30.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're breathing man and </v>
<v Speaker 3>something you do all the time and when </v>

1111
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:34.421
<v Speaker 3>you die you start breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea that there's something </v>

1112
00:59:34.421 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 3>integral to life about breathing is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly reasonable supposition.</v>

1113
00:59:36.021 --> 00:59:41.021
<v Speaker 3>It actually happens to be very true and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll tend to associate the act of </v>

1114
00:59:41.021 --> 00:59:45.360
<v Speaker 3>creation with the active first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inspiration and respiration and,</v>

1115
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:47.030
<v Speaker 3>and the breathing of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1116
00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:49.040
<v Speaker 3>of life into something that was inanna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is,</v>

1117
00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:54.090
<v Speaker 3>is well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you expect for a one sentence </v>

1118
00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:54.090
<v Speaker 3>description?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bad one sentence description,</v>

1119
00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:58.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so and the Lord God planted a garden </v>

1120
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:59.870
<v Speaker 3>eastward and eaten and eaten means </v>
<v Speaker 3>well-watered place.</v>

1121
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.870
<v Speaker 3>And that's particularly relevant I </v>
<v Speaker 3>suppose if you're a desert dweller,</v>

1122
01:00:02.871 --> 01:00:07.871
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the issue there is can you get </v>

1123
01:00:07.871 --> 01:00:09.410
<v Speaker 3>enough water to make things grow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the walled garden,</v>

1124
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:11.000
<v Speaker 3>which is paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is also Eden,</v>

1125
01:00:11.001 --> 01:00:14.600
<v Speaker 3>which is a well watered place and water </v>
<v Speaker 3>has the element of chaos.</v>

1126
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.300
<v Speaker 3>We already saw that in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 3>genesis one,</v>

1127
01:00:17.301 --> 01:00:21.380
<v Speaker 3>where the underlying chaos was often </v>
<v Speaker 3>assimilated symbolically to water.</v>

1128
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:26.710
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea too is that a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of chaos has to be brought into </v>

1129
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:27.770
<v Speaker 3>the order in order for it to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>fruitful.</v>

1130
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:32.771
<v Speaker 3>And you can see that in the form of of </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowing in the water and out of the </v>

1131
01:00:32.771 --> 01:00:36.971
<v Speaker 3>ground made the Lord God to grow every </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree that is pleasant to the sight and </v>

1132
01:00:36.971 --> 01:00:40.871
<v Speaker 3>good for food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tree of life also in the midst of </v>

1133
01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:41.510
<v Speaker 3>the garden and the tree of the knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 3>of good and evil.</v>

1134
01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 3>So two trees are marked out among the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rest.</v>

1135
01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:48.200
<v Speaker 3>One is the tree of life and one is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</v>

1136
01:00:48.201 --> 01:00:53.201
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you read something like </v>

1137
01:00:53.201 --> 01:00:53.201
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're thinking about it,</v>

1138
01:00:53.201 --> 01:00:57.341
<v Speaker 3>that you're in a metaphorical space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we've got to be careful about </v>

1139
01:00:57.341 --> 01:00:58.650
<v Speaker 3>metaphors because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could say,</v>

1140
01:00:58.651 --> 01:01:01.730
<v Speaker 3>and he had that the chaos order idea is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a metaphor,</v>

1141
01:01:01.731 --> 01:01:03.170
<v Speaker 3>but then I also said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1142
01:01:03.171 --> 01:01:04.940
<v Speaker 3>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a metaphor,</v>

1143
01:01:04.941 --> 01:01:07.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's also what your brain is adapted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to and so you know,</v>

1144
01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:12.731
<v Speaker 3>let's just not be pushing the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's merely a metaphor to heart and the </v>

1145
01:01:12.731 --> 01:01:14.690
<v Speaker 3>same thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is here is happening here.</v>

1146
01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:19.691
<v Speaker 3>These are metaphors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tree of life and the tree of the </v>

1147
01:01:19.691 --> 01:01:23.351
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't exactly mean that </v>

1148
01:01:23.351 --> 01:01:24.380
<v Speaker 3>they're mere metaphors because </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes,</v>

1149
01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:30.100
<v Speaker 3>as I mentioned before and abs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a set of things and you </v>

1150
01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:33.821
<v Speaker 3>abstract out from them a common element,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make a strong case that the </v>

1151
01:01:33.821 --> 01:01:36.440
<v Speaker 3>common element is more real than the set</v>
<v Speaker 3>of things from which you extracted it.</v>

1152
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:38.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole utility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That abstraction.</v>

1153
01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.800
<v Speaker 3>Why would you bother with it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>

1154
01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:41.930
<v Speaker 3>if you can't take a set of things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1155
01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:46.931
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something in common across this </v>

1156
01:01:46.931 --> 01:01:46.931
<v Speaker 3>set of things that's more important than</v>
<v Speaker 3>the differences between them,</v>

1157
01:01:46.931 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 3>then you wouldn't bother abstracting at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1158
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:53.530
<v Speaker 3>And so the tree of life and the tree of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the knowledge of good and evil are </v>

1159
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:53.530
<v Speaker 3>abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1160
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:55.700
<v Speaker 3>one of the questions is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a tough one,</v>

1161
01:01:55.701 --> 01:01:56.360
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying.</v>

1162
01:01:56.361 --> 01:02:01.361
<v Speaker 3>I tried to figure out for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>why have fruit and something you eat </v>

1163
01:02:01.361 --> 01:02:06.281
<v Speaker 3>would be associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation of psychology because </v>

1164
01:02:06.281 --> 01:02:07.490
<v Speaker 3>that's basically what happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam and Eve story.</v>

1165
01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:09.530
<v Speaker 3>Why would it be something that you eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>

1166
01:02:09.531 --> 01:02:11.570
<v Speaker 3>Eric Norman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was one of young students,</v>

1167
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:14.210
<v Speaker 3>had written a fair bit about this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>God a fairways with it.</v>

1168
01:02:14.211 --> 01:02:15.230
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1169
01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:17.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do have noted,</v>

1170
01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.470
<v Speaker 3>we've noticed forever that the act of </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating,</v>

1171
01:02:19.471 --> 01:02:21.690
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're starving,</v>

1172
01:02:21.691 --> 01:02:24.030
<v Speaker 3>produces a rapid spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>

1173
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1174
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.670
<v Speaker 3>some of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is worth knowing.</v>

1175
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.450
<v Speaker 3>You probably have a crabby partner or </v>
<v Speaker 3>child because everyone does.</v>

1176
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.960
<v Speaker 3>And one thing you might try is that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get erratic during the day and get </v>

1177
01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:40.230
<v Speaker 3>all volatile about nothing at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's given them something to eat.</v>

1178
01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.640
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>

1179
01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:42.610
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the this solves for.</v>

1180
01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 3>I do this with my clinical clients all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1181
01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1182
01:02:46.111 --> 01:02:47.820
<v Speaker 3>I fly off the handle at the littlest </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1183
01:02:47.821 --> 01:02:48.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1184
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:49.800
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just try this for a week.</v>

1185
01:02:49.801 --> 01:02:54.801
<v Speaker 3>When you're crabby and unreasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat a piece of cheese or eat a peanut </v>

1186
01:02:54.801 --> 01:02:56.040
<v Speaker 3>butter sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat something that's high protein,</v>

1187
01:02:56.041 --> 01:02:58.470
<v Speaker 3>high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then just wait 10 minutes and see if</v>

1188
01:02:58.471 --> 01:03:03.471
<v Speaker 3>you're saying and you'll find out that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying after you eat so often </v>

1189
01:03:03.471 --> 01:03:06.300
<v Speaker 3>that you just can't believe how crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are when you're hungry.</v>

1190
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.920
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's.</v>

1191
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:10.830
<v Speaker 3>It's really absolutely bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>remarkable.</v>

1192
01:03:10.831 --> 01:03:12.240
<v Speaker 3>So I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try this.</v>

1193
01:03:12.241 --> 01:03:12.790
<v Speaker 3>It'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll,</v>

1194
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:15.150
<v Speaker 3>it'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you don't eat breakfast,</v>

1195
01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.660
<v Speaker 3>this will change your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so here,</v>

1196
01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:21.180
<v Speaker 3>here's the practical bit of information </v>
<v Speaker 3>for you to,</v>

1197
01:03:21.181 --> 01:03:24.090
<v Speaker 3>for all of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>antisocial types who are going to end up</v>

1198
01:03:24.091 --> 01:03:29.091
<v Speaker 3>in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're in prison and you want to </v>

1199
01:03:29.521 --> 01:03:31.200
<v Speaker 3>go on parole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1200
01:03:31.201 --> 01:03:33.690
<v Speaker 3>so you have to go in front of the judge </v>
<v Speaker 3>and tell them why you're not going to do</v>

1201
01:03:33.691 --> 01:03:35.250
<v Speaker 3>it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's the deal.</v>

1202
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really matter what you did </v>

1203
01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:40.530
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't really matter what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>promise.</v>

1204
01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:44.490
<v Speaker 3>What matters is whether you see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>judge before lunch or after lunch,</v>

1205
01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:46.920
<v Speaker 3>because if you see the judge after </v>
<v Speaker 3>lunch,</v>

1206
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:50.190
<v Speaker 3>the probability that you will get parole</v>
<v Speaker 3>is 60 percent higher.</v>

1207
01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1208
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:56.250
<v Speaker 3>That is just like so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never have an argument with your partner</v>

1209
01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:57.750
<v Speaker 3>when you're hungry or when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>hungry.</v>

1210
01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you want something from </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1211
01:03:59.641 --> 01:04:01.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the sandwich.</v>

1212
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.480
<v Speaker 3>They'll eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there'll be happy.</v>

1213
01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:06.540
<v Speaker 3>Then you can manipulate them before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before that,</v>

1214
01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:07.110
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1215
01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.590
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1216
01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:17.680
<v Speaker 3>it's not that unreasonable to think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a spirit in food because food </v>

1217
01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.310
<v Speaker 3>rejuvenates and it just doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>rejuvenate you physically.</v>

1218
01:04:19.311 --> 01:04:24.311
<v Speaker 3>It rejuvenates you spiritually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course there's the other </v>

1219
01:04:24.311 --> 01:04:27.071
<v Speaker 3>things that we consume that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly like food that have a walloping </v>

1220
01:04:27.071 --> 01:04:28.490
<v Speaker 3>spiritual impact like alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1221
01:04:28.491 --> 01:04:31.600
<v Speaker 3>which is a spirit and is regarded as </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

1222
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:32.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1223
01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:37.420
<v Speaker 3>it's the god of the vine and the god of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the vine and possesses you in and makes </v>

1224
01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.090
<v Speaker 3>you act all the fun ways that alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you act.</v>

1225
01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:43.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fun ways that you regret the next </v>

1226
01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:43.120
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1227
01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.360
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's the spiritual element of that</v>

1228
01:04:44.361 --> 01:04:46.130
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

1229
01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:51.220
<v Speaker 3>but there's something even deeper that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think is so cool that's associated with </v>

1230
01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:54.641
<v Speaker 3>food and information because the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Adam and Eve represents the fruit as </v>

1231
01:04:56.330 --> 01:04:58.250
<v Speaker 3>producing a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>

1232
01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:03.280
<v Speaker 3>And so the tree of the knowledge of good</v>
<v Speaker 3>and evil is an abstraction across trees </v>

1233
01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.800
<v Speaker 3>and it's trying to say here's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's common across trees.</v>

1234
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:10.400
<v Speaker 3>It's a fruit that's common across trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>

1235
01:05:10.401 --> 01:05:15.020
<v Speaker 3>And so the fruit across it's common </v>
<v Speaker 3>across trees is something you might call</v>

1236
01:05:15.021 --> 01:05:16.460
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>

1237
01:05:16.461 --> 01:05:21.461
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's something that's even more </v>

1238
01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:23.821
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The food that's stable across the entire</v>

1239
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:26.770
<v Speaker 3>domain of food isn't food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's information,</v>

1240
01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:32.520
<v Speaker 3>it's information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we use the same bloody circuits in </v>

1241
01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.731
<v Speaker 3>our brain to forage for information that</v>
<v Speaker 3>squirrels used to forage for food that </v>

1242
01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:36.730
<v Speaker 3>animals use to forage for food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same circuit.</v>

1243
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:41.910
<v Speaker 3>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we figured out that knowing </v>

1244
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:42.400
<v Speaker 3>where things is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing where the food is more important</v>

1245
01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:44.080
<v Speaker 3>than having the food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1246
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.880
<v Speaker 3>so knowing where the food is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a form of mat,</v>

1247
01:05:46.881 --> 01:05:51.100
<v Speaker 3>of food information is a form of food </v>
<v Speaker 3>and once you,</v>

1248
01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.050
<v Speaker 3>well that's why we're information </v>
<v Speaker 3>foragers.</v>

1249
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:58.230
<v Speaker 3>And so once you grasp that and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas is embedded into the story of Adam</v>

1250
01:05:58.331 --> 01:06:03.331
<v Speaker 3>and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so whatever it is that they ingest is a </v>

1251
01:06:03.331 --> 01:06:03.331
<v Speaker 3>form of Metta food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1252
01:06:03.331 --> 01:06:03.340
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's information.</v>

1253
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.490
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1254
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:06.370
<v Speaker 3>we'll trade food for information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1255
01:06:06.371 --> 01:06:10.030
<v Speaker 3>So if you're stuck on the edge of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highway and you know your,</v>

1256
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:15.510
<v Speaker 3>your hoods up and you're going places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing has turned into a pile of junk </v>

1257
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:18.210
<v Speaker 3>that you don't understand and somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulls beside,</v>

1258
01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:23.310
<v Speaker 3>pulls up beside you and they're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanic and they point to something to </v>

1259
01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:23.310
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1260
01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:26.341
<v Speaker 3>just put that wire back on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will immediately give them a </v>

1261
01:06:26.341 --> 01:06:26.341
<v Speaker 3>sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1262
01:06:26.341 --> 01:06:27.730
<v Speaker 3>Or you offer them something in return.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1263
01:06:27.731 --> 01:06:32.731
<v Speaker 3>Because they've provided you with </v>
<v Speaker 3>information that has value and it has </v>

1264
01:06:32.731 --> 01:06:34.210
<v Speaker 3>value because it actually provides you </v>
<v Speaker 3>with energy because information provides</v>

1265
01:06:34.211 --> 01:06:39.211
<v Speaker 3>you with energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because otherwise why would we bother </v>

1266
01:06:39.211 --> 01:06:41.191
<v Speaker 3>with it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so food provides energy but so does </v>

1267
01:06:41.191 --> 01:06:41.350
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's the,</v>

1268
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:44.560
<v Speaker 3>there's the idea of food that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstract from everything you can eat,</v>

1269
01:06:44.561 --> 01:06:49.561
<v Speaker 3>but then there's the idea of what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could abstract from all sources of food </v>

1270
01:06:49.561 --> 01:06:51.730
<v Speaker 3>and the answer to that would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and the trees that are being</v>

1271
01:06:51.731 --> 01:06:54.280
<v Speaker 3>referred to an Adam and eve are these </v>
<v Speaker 3>method trees.</v>

1272
01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:57.460
<v Speaker 3>They're not ordinary trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like paradise is.</v>

1273
01:06:57.461 --> 01:07:02.461
<v Speaker 3>No ordinary place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like Adam and eve are no ordinary </v>

1274
01:07:02.461 --> 01:07:05.281
<v Speaker 3>people and just like the logos that God </v>
<v Speaker 3>is using at the beginning of time is no </v>

1275
01:07:05.281 --> 01:07:09.361
<v Speaker 3>ordinary conception and these aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not metaphors there more than </v>

1276
01:07:09.361 --> 01:07:13.741
<v Speaker 3>metaphors there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of them as hyper realities is </v>

1277
01:07:13.741 --> 01:07:16.740
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there more real than what you see </v>

1278
01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:19.411
<v Speaker 3>there are more real than the reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>that presents itself to you and lots of </v>

1279
01:07:19.411 --> 01:07:19.411
<v Speaker 3>things that are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1280
01:07:19.411 --> 01:07:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Numbers are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We wouldn't think or abstract if there </v>

1281
01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.000
<v Speaker 3>weren't things that were more real than </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we can see.</v>

1282
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:31.510
<v Speaker 3>So what's most real well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's partly what we're trying to </v>

1283
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:33.961
<v Speaker 3>figure out and out of the ground made </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Lord God to grow every tree that is </v>

1284
01:07:33.961 --> 01:07:34.780
<v Speaker 3>pleasant to this sight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And good for food,</v>

1285
01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:40.350
<v Speaker 3>the tree of life also in the midst of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the garden and the tree of knowledge of </v>

1286
01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:44.281
<v Speaker 3>good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a river went out of Eden to water </v>

1287
01:07:44.281 --> 01:07:44.281
<v Speaker 3>the garden.</v>

1288
01:07:44.281 --> 01:07:46.770
<v Speaker 3>And from then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was part of and became into </v>

1289
01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:48.541
<v Speaker 3>foreheads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's produced a tremendous amount of </v>

1290
01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:48.541
<v Speaker 3>speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1291
01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:52.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the garden of Eden is also the holy </v>

1292
01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:52.890
<v Speaker 3>city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another way of thinking about,</v>

1293
01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:53.470
<v Speaker 3>or it's Jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1294
01:07:53.471 --> 01:07:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Or it's the ideal state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which could be the ideal city,</v>

1295
01:07:56.081 --> 01:07:59.620
<v Speaker 3>or it could be an ideal state of being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or could be the ideal psyche or it's all</v>

1296
01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:01.480
<v Speaker 3>of those things stacked up at the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1297
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.040
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a Mandela,</v>

1298
01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:05.350
<v Speaker 3>and this is the Mandela form that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1299
01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:10.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call hypothesized that </v>

1300
01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:12.910
<v Speaker 3>constituted the structure of paradise?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows it's got this cross form that's</v>

1301
01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:15.440
<v Speaker 3>eating itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's the center eden,</v>

1302
01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:17.720
<v Speaker 3>and there's the rivers are rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not snakes.</v>

1303
01:08:17.721 --> 01:08:22.721
<v Speaker 3>Those are the rivers that go out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're turned into these Mandela </v>

1304
01:08:22.721 --> 01:08:23.900
<v Speaker 3>images that are representative of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you described as the self,</v>

1305
01:08:23.901 --> 01:08:28.901
<v Speaker 3>which would be the center element of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being that he associates of conscious </v>

1306
01:08:28.901 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 3>being that he associated with divinity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

1307
01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.270
<v Speaker 3>but also with the idea of the holy city.</v>

1308
01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:37.330
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm just showing you that to show</v>
<v Speaker 3>you what were the imagination has taken </v>

1309
01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:42.191
<v Speaker 3>ideas of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the name of the river is pies and </v>

1310
01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 3>that is which compensates the whole land</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Avila,</v>

1311
01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:48.170
<v Speaker 3>whether is gold and the gold of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>land is good.</v>

1312
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:53.410
<v Speaker 3>There's Bedelia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the onyx stone and the name of </v>

1313
01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:55.841
<v Speaker 3>the second reverse jihad the same isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>that compass at the whole land of </v>

1314
01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:59.051
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the name of the third river is </v>

1315
01:08:59.051 --> 01:08:59.051
<v Speaker 3>headache cal or had echo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1316
01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:01.230
<v Speaker 3>That is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which goes towards the east of Assyria.</v>

1317
01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:06.310
<v Speaker 3>And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's this strange intermingling </v>

1318
01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:08.270
<v Speaker 3>there of geography with mythical </v>
<v Speaker 3>geography.</v>

1319
01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which you see happen fairly frequently </v>

1320
01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.251
<v Speaker 3>in the books and the Lord God took the </v>
<v Speaker 3>man and put them in the garden of Eden </v>

1321
01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:16.760
<v Speaker 3>to dress it and keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1322
01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.830
<v Speaker 3>So that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good command.</v>

1323
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:21.380
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're supposed to do is </v>
<v Speaker 3>take care of the damn thing.</v>

1324
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:23.060
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot of work to make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1325
01:09:23.061 --> 01:09:28.061
<v Speaker 3>Took a whole week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Lord God commanded the man </v>

1326
01:09:29.151 --> 01:09:32.600
<v Speaker 3>saying of every tree of the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thou mayest freely eat,</v>

1327
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:35.210
<v Speaker 3>but of the tree of the knowledge of good</v>
<v Speaker 3>and evil,</v>

1328
01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.840
<v Speaker 3>thou shalt not eat of it for the day </v>
<v Speaker 3>that thou eat thereof,</v>

1329
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:43.870
<v Speaker 3>thou shalt surely die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While there's this bunch of questions </v>

1330
01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:47.780
<v Speaker 3>there that people have been puzzling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>puzzling over for a long time.</v>

1331
01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Goddy he's a tricky character in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story of Adam and eve.</v>

1332
01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:52.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1333
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:53.990
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we can't eat the damn thing while why</v>

1334
01:09:53.991 --> 01:09:56.330
<v Speaker 3>put it in the garden to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be one question.</v>

1335
01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.760
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you made us.</v>

1336
01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:03.761
<v Speaker 3>And then you told us not to eat this </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing perfectly well that the first </v>

1337
01:10:03.761 --> 01:10:05.240
<v Speaker 3>thing we were going to do is eat it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people are of exactly that type,</v>

1338
01:10:05.241 --> 01:10:09.200
<v Speaker 3>which is that if you say to them with </v>
<v Speaker 3>their insatiable satiable curiosity,</v>

1339
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:14.590
<v Speaker 3>this is all fine and nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but over here is something you should </v>

1340
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:14.590
<v Speaker 3>never look at.</v>

1341
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:15.770
<v Speaker 3>And then you leave the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like everybody is over there trying</v>

1342
01:10:15.771 --> 01:10:18.050
<v Speaker 3>to figure out what the hell that thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is instantly,</v>

1343
01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:19.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we're curious,</v>

1344
01:10:19.761 --> 01:10:20.840
<v Speaker 3>curious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>curious,</v>

1345
01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:25.841
<v Speaker 3>curious creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you have to wonder exactly what </v>

1346
01:10:25.841 --> 01:10:27.410
<v Speaker 3>God was up to here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's gnostic speculation that the</v>

1347
01:10:27.411 --> 01:10:30.110
<v Speaker 3>original God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one was not really a very good God.</v>

1348
01:10:30.111 --> 01:10:35.111
<v Speaker 3>He was kind of an unconscious evil God </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that he wanted his creation to be </v>

1349
01:10:35.111 --> 01:10:37.520
<v Speaker 3>unconscious and so for bade them from </v>
<v Speaker 3>developing consciousness and that it was</v>

1350
01:10:37.521 --> 01:10:42.521
<v Speaker 3>a higher God who and maybe in the form </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the serpent who tempted human beings </v>

1351
01:10:42.521 --> 01:10:45.200
<v Speaker 3>towards consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know that that idea got scrubbed</v>

1352
01:10:45.201 --> 01:10:46.970
<v Speaker 3>out of classic Christianity Pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>early.</v>

1353
01:10:46.971 --> 01:10:51.971
<v Speaker 3>Although there's something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting about it and there are </v>

1354
01:10:51.971 --> 01:10:53.210
<v Speaker 3>remnants of it in different forums that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stayed inside this story.</v>

1355
01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:58.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm like the idea that the fall was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible tragedy,</v>

1356
01:10:58.791 --> 01:11:02.540
<v Speaker 3>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the precondition for the greatest</v>

1357
01:11:02.541 --> 01:11:07.541
<v Speaker 3>event in history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the birth of Christ and the </v>

1358
01:11:07.541 --> 01:11:07.541
<v Speaker 3>redemption of mankind.</v>

1359
01:11:07.541 --> 01:11:09.590
<v Speaker 3>And so it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's put it that way.</v>

1360
01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.520
<v Speaker 3>God only knows what God was up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

1361
01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:17.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a good example of that </v>

1362
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:17.130
<v Speaker 3>ambivalence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to me again,</v>

1363
01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:21.101
<v Speaker 3>that it's an indication of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophistication of the people who put </v>

1364
01:11:21.101 --> 01:11:23.931
<v Speaker 3>these stories together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also considered this somewhat </v>

1365
01:11:23.931 --> 01:11:23.931
<v Speaker 3>miraculous because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1366
01:11:23.931 --> 01:11:25.230
<v Speaker 3>if you're just a simple propagandist of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts,</v>

1367
01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:27.660
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't leave this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>complexity in the text.</v>

1368
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:30.360
<v Speaker 3>You just get rid of that because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a propagandist,</v>

1369
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:33.320
<v Speaker 3>everything is supposed to make sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>along the ideological plane.</v>

1370
01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Here God is supposed to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1371
01:11:35.251 --> 01:11:37.620
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we better get there to that line because</v>

1372
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.080
<v Speaker 3>something's up with it and it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>obvious what it is,</v>

1373
01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:45.081
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't what people did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to me that indicates that that they </v>

1374
01:11:45.081 --> 01:11:48.351
<v Speaker 3>were doing two things as they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying not to be too careless with the </v>

1375
01:11:49.651 --> 01:11:52.470
<v Speaker 3>traditions that they were handed they </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

1376
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:54.570
<v Speaker 3>they were touching them at their peril.</v>

1377
01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:59.570
<v Speaker 3>They were very careful with them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also that they were actually trying to </v>

1378
01:11:59.570 --> 01:11:59.760
<v Speaker 3>understand what was going on because why</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise keep this?</v>

1379
01:11:59.761 --> 01:12:04.761
<v Speaker 3>Why not just simplify it or maybe just </v>
<v Speaker 3>attribute this to the devil that would </v>

1380
01:12:04.761 --> 01:12:09.090
<v Speaker 3>be easier and having God do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then the Lord God said,</v>

1381
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.720
<v Speaker 3>it is not good that man should be alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will make a help meet for him.</v>

1382
01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:18.230
<v Speaker 3>None of the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Lord God formed every beast of the </v>

1383
01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:20.361
<v Speaker 3>field and every fall of the air and </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought them unto Adam to see what he </v>

1384
01:12:20.361 --> 01:12:23.631
<v Speaker 3>would call them and whatsoever Adam </v>
<v Speaker 3>called every living creature that was </v>

1385
01:12:23.631 --> 01:12:25.140
<v Speaker 3>the name thereof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Adam gave names to all the cattle in</v>

1386
01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:27.990
<v Speaker 3>the fall of the catecholamines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Animals basically and to the fall of the</v>

1387
01:12:27.991 --> 01:12:31.080
<v Speaker 3>error and to every beast of the field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for Adam,</v>

1388
01:12:31.081 --> 01:12:32.610
<v Speaker 3>there was not found to help meet for </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1389
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1390
01:12:33.721 --> 01:12:36.240
<v Speaker 3>a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their speculations,</v>

1391
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:41.510
<v Speaker 3>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like why does God care what Adam </v>

1392
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:44.181
<v Speaker 3>calls the animals and the answer to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to be that it's associated again </v>

1393
01:12:44.181 --> 01:12:45.570
<v Speaker 3>with the magic of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1394
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:50.630
<v Speaker 3>so that we know according to the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>that human beings were already made in </v>

1395
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:54.591
<v Speaker 3>the image of God and that God used </v>
<v Speaker 3>language in order to call order from </v>

1396
01:12:54.591 --> 01:12:56.190
<v Speaker 3>chaos and that human beings were made in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that image,</v>

1397
01:12:56.340 --> 01:13:01.340
<v Speaker 3>and so there's an echo of that here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it's from an independent </v>

1398
01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:04.101
<v Speaker 3>tradition and the echo is the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't quite real until you name it and </v>

1399
01:13:04.101 --> 01:13:04.240
<v Speaker 3>that's quite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1400
01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:08.460
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting thing and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly know how far that extends.</v>

1401
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:13.550
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly the case that like seem </v>
<v Speaker 3>things often exist in a strange </v>

1402
01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:17.820
<v Speaker 3>potential form interconnected forum </v>
<v Speaker 3>where everything's confusing,</v>

1403
01:13:17.821 --> 01:13:20.850
<v Speaker 3>like a massive confusion before you put </v>
<v Speaker 3>your finger on it,</v>

1404
01:13:20.851 --> 01:13:23.430
<v Speaker 3>name it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on here?</v>

1405
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:24.570
<v Speaker 3>You name it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it.</v>

1406
01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:30.250
<v Speaker 3>It carves it out from all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>underlying chaos and makes it into a </v>

1407
01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:32.550
<v Speaker 3>grippable entity that you can then </v>
<v Speaker 3>contend with.</v>

1408
01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.480
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1409
01:13:33.481 --> 01:13:35.490
<v Speaker 3>it was real before you named it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1410
01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:37.440
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1411
01:13:37.441 --> 01:13:42.210
<v Speaker 3>it was real before you named it the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>way things are there when there's no one</v>

1412
01:13:42.211 --> 01:13:47.211
<v Speaker 3>there to perceive them and it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>obvious how things are there when you're</v>

1413
01:13:47.311 --> 01:13:52.311
<v Speaker 3>not there to perceive the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you something bloody weird </v>

1414
01:13:52.311 --> 01:13:52.311
<v Speaker 3>about perception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can look this up and John Wheeler,</v>

1415
01:13:52.311 --> 01:13:53.290
<v Speaker 3>John,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaders of physicists,</v>

1416
01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:58.360
<v Speaker 3>so here's a really cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you go outside at night and </v>

1417
01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:02.001
<v Speaker 3>you look up and you see a star and so a </v>
<v Speaker 3>photon from that star enters your eye </v>

1418
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:05.980
<v Speaker 3>and maybe that Fulton has been cruising </v>
<v Speaker 3>along for like $30,</v>

1419
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:10.990
<v Speaker 3>million years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that that photon would not </v>

1420
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:12.370
<v Speaker 3>have been emitted from star at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>

1421
01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:17.370
<v Speaker 3>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't there at that time to receive </v>

1422
01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:17.370
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

1423
01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:21.390
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how in the hell can that because it </v>

1424
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.390
<v Speaker 3>happened 20 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1425
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:24.360
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it can be to tell you </v>

1426
01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.101
<v Speaker 3>the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that John Wheeler has done a </v>

1427
01:14:26.101 --> 01:14:28.711
<v Speaker 3>very good job of detailing out why </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true and necessarily true and so </v>

1428
01:14:28.711 --> 01:14:33.321
<v Speaker 3>in wheeler is also the physicist who </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed the notion of it from bit and </v>

1429
01:14:33.321 --> 01:14:37.621
<v Speaker 3>he believes that the world is best </v>
<v Speaker 3>construed as the potential of the world </v>

1430
01:14:38.261 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Speaker 3>is best construed as a place of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

1431
01:14:40.481 --> 01:14:45.481
<v Speaker 3>It's something like latent information </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that what consciousness does is </v>

1432
01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:47.950
<v Speaker 3>transform the latent interest in </v>
<v Speaker 3>information into something like concrete</v>

1433
01:14:47.951 --> 01:14:51.700
<v Speaker 3>reality and he doesn't mean that </v>
<v Speaker 3>metaphorically and one of the cases that</v>

1434
01:14:51.701 --> 01:14:56.701
<v Speaker 3>he makes in that regard is this story </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I just told you is that the photon </v>

1435
01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:58.810
<v Speaker 3>couldn't have left from where it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>unless it had a place to go.</v>

1436
01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:04.470
<v Speaker 3>Now it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's complicated and confusing because </v>

1437
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:05.110
<v Speaker 3>from the perspective of a beam of light </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a full time,</v>

1438
01:15:05.111 --> 01:15:08.250
<v Speaker 3>there is no time and there's no distance</v>
<v Speaker 3>from one point to another one.</v>

1439
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:13.470
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's completely impossible to </v>

1440
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:13.470
<v Speaker 3>understand too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from the perspective of a Photon,</v>

1441
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:17.760
<v Speaker 3>the universe is completely flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perpendicular to the direction that the </v>

1442
01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.360
<v Speaker 3>photon is traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's there and here at the same time.</v>

1443
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:22.000
<v Speaker 3>For us it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like 20 million years ago,</v>

1444
01:15:22.001 --> 01:15:24.310
<v Speaker 3>but for the photon it's all here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1445
01:15:24.490 --> 01:15:29.490
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason I'm telling you all that is </v>

1446
01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:31.450
<v Speaker 3>because the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and reality is by no means</v>

1447
01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:34.810
<v Speaker 3>straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is seriously not straightforward.</v>

1448
01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:40.140
<v Speaker 3>And physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physicists debate what the relationship </v>

1449
01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:44.371
<v Speaker 3>is between consciousness and reality and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they debate about what the sort of </v>

1450
01:15:44.371 --> 01:15:48.361
<v Speaker 3>phenomena that I just described mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not really qualified to enter </v>

1451
01:15:48.361 --> 01:15:48.400
<v Speaker 3>into that debate because I'm not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>physicist,</v>

1452
01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:53.640
<v Speaker 3>but I do know and I've read a fair bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>of wheeler is about as much of it as I </v>

1453
01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.150
<v Speaker 3>can understand and I do at least know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's what he claimed.</v>

1454
01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:00.070
<v Speaker 3>And I also know that that claim is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a claim that it's taken seriously</v>

1455
01:16:00.071 --> 01:16:03.640
<v Speaker 3>among physicists of the caliber of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>physicist who can understand wheeler.</v>

1456
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:06.520
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1457
01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:11.820
<v Speaker 3>there is emphasis again on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>importance of naming in order to make </v>

1458
01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:11.820
<v Speaker 3>things real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1459
01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:15.520
<v Speaker 3>when sometimes people won't name things </v>
<v Speaker 3>just so they don't become real.</v>

1460
01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.620
<v Speaker 3>So you know if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

1461
01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.680
<v Speaker 3>if you have a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which undoubtedly you do and it has </v>

1462
01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:22.680
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which undoubtedly it does,</v>

1463
01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.030
<v Speaker 3>you bloody well know that lots of times </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something under the carpet that </v>

1464
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.030
<v Speaker 3>no one wants to name and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

1465
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:28.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as we don't name it,</v>

1466
01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:33.151
<v Speaker 3>it's not really there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in some sense it really isn't there </v>

1467
01:16:33.151 --> 01:16:36.121
<v Speaker 3>because you can act as if it's not there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and get away with it at least for short </v>

1468
01:16:36.121 --> 01:16:36.880
<v Speaker 3>periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as soon as you name that thing,</v>

1469
01:16:36.881 --> 01:16:41.881
<v Speaker 3>it's like you give it form and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and no one can ignore it and </v>

1470
01:16:41.881 --> 01:16:45.241
<v Speaker 3>that's annoying because then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with it or an or or face the </v>

1471
01:16:45.241 --> 01:16:45.241
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

1472
01:16:45.241 --> 01:16:46.960
<v Speaker 3>But the reason I'm telling you that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we have a,</v>

1473
01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:52.480
<v Speaker 3>an intuition even that we can have </v>
<v Speaker 3>things not exist by not naming them.</v>

1474
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:57.630
<v Speaker 3>You name it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it comes forward with staggering </v>

1475
01:16:57.630 --> 01:16:58.330
<v Speaker 3>clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not as if naming it is the only</v>

1476
01:16:58.331 --> 01:17:03.331
<v Speaker 3>thing that gives it reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is something like it sharpens it </v>

1477
01:17:03.331 --> 01:17:06.160
<v Speaker 3>and brings it into focus and it gives it</v>
<v Speaker 3>borders and barriers and borders and </v>

1478
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.300
<v Speaker 3>boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so anyways,</v>

1479
01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 3>God's interested enough in what Adam has</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>

1480
01:17:09.771 --> 01:17:13.400
<v Speaker 3>that he has a name all the animals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of makes them into animals.</v>

1481
01:17:13.401 --> 01:17:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Now there's more to the linguistic story</v>
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>

1482
01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:19.490
<v Speaker 3>So social psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roger Brown was one of them,</v>

1483
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:24.760
<v Speaker 3>studied this really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomena which is associated with a </v>

1484
01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:26.000
<v Speaker 3>relationship between perception and </v>
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>

1485
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:29.000
<v Speaker 3>You know how a kid will call a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular animal,</v>

1486
01:17:29.001 --> 01:17:30.440
<v Speaker 3>a cat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1487
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:33.110
<v Speaker 3>the word cat is very short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the word dog.</v>

1488
01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.930
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1489
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:40.390
<v Speaker 3>you could think that we could perceive </v>
<v Speaker 3>cats as multicellular organisms.</v>

1490
01:17:40.461 --> 01:17:43.130
<v Speaker 3>Like we could see the self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could see the molecules,</v>

1491
01:17:43.131 --> 01:17:48.131
<v Speaker 3>we could see the atoms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could see where we could see the </v>

1492
01:17:48.131 --> 01:17:48.350
<v Speaker 3>ecosystem that the cat is part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't.</v>

1493
01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.520
<v Speaker 3>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe the broader mammalian </v>

1494
01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.081
<v Speaker 3>classification that it's part of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could perceive that as the unit of </v>

1495
01:17:56.081 --> 01:17:56.240
<v Speaker 3>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we don't.</v>

1496
01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:01.480
<v Speaker 3>We perceive things at the level of cat </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can tell the perceptual level </v>

1497
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:06.970
<v Speaker 3>that people naturally perceive that </v>
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't seem to be socio </v>

1498
01:18:06.970 --> 01:18:07.760
<v Speaker 3>culturally determined to any great </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree by the way,</v>

1499
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:11.840
<v Speaker 3>because the words are often short and </v>
<v Speaker 3>easily remembered and early learned,</v>

1500
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:17.350
<v Speaker 3>and so there's this level of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of all the possible levels of </v>

1501
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:21.911
<v Speaker 3>analysis that the world does exist as we</v>
<v Speaker 3>perceive it at a certain level of </v>

1502
01:18:21.911 --> 01:18:26.381
<v Speaker 3>analysis and that level of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to have something to do with the </v>

1503
01:18:26.381 --> 01:18:26.381
<v Speaker 3>world's functional utility.</v>

1504
01:18:26.381 --> 01:18:31.210
<v Speaker 3>For us at that level and the perception </v>
<v Speaker 3>at that level and the naming at that </v>

1505
01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:33.440
<v Speaker 3>level gives things a reality at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

1506
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:38.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the thing about things is that </v>

1507
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.830
<v Speaker 3>they're not easily separable from other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1508
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:43.631
<v Speaker 3>They tangled together and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange ways and yet when we cast our </v>

1509
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:47.180
<v Speaker 3>eye and and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and use our language to orient ourselves</v>

1510
01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:52.181
<v Speaker 3>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we cut things up into discrete </v>

1511
01:18:52.181 --> 01:18:52.910
<v Speaker 3>discriminate objects that we can then </v>
<v Speaker 3>utilize.</v>

1512
01:18:52.911 --> 01:18:57.911
<v Speaker 3>And there's something about that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes them real in a way that they're </v>

1513
01:18:57.911 --> 01:19:01.060
<v Speaker 3>interconnected potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The interconnected potential that they </v>

1514
01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:01.520
<v Speaker 3>were before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it's not,</v>

1515
01:19:01.521 --> 01:19:04.880
<v Speaker 3>it's not real in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least I think it's even less real.</v>

1516
01:19:04.881 --> 01:19:07.580
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a right way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it even though it's not completely</v>

1517
01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:10.280
<v Speaker 3>unreal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's an eco.</v>

1518
01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:13.070
<v Speaker 3>Adam's a little God at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little God,</v>

1519
01:19:13.071 --> 01:19:15.370
<v Speaker 3>the father and God's already done the </v>
<v Speaker 3>groundwork,</v>

1520
01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:17.150
<v Speaker 3>but Adam has to come along and says say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1521
01:19:17.151 --> 01:19:17.870
<v Speaker 3>that's a cat.</v>

1522
01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:21.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like poof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever that is is now a cat and a dog,</v>

1523
01:19:21.411 --> 01:19:24.080
<v Speaker 3>and that's a sheep and you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives them.</v>

1524
01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:26.600
<v Speaker 3>It gives them something like pragmatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>form,</v>

1525
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:33.550
<v Speaker 3>but for Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was not found a help meet for him </v>

1526
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:37.660
<v Speaker 3>and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall upon Adam and he slept and he and </v>

1527
01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:39.230
<v Speaker 3>God took one of his ribs and closed up </v>
<v Speaker 3>the flesh instead thereof,</v>

1528
01:19:39.231 --> 01:19:42.860
<v Speaker 3>and the rib which the Lord God had taken</v>
<v Speaker 3>from man made he a woman and brought her</v>

1529
01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:44.540
<v Speaker 3>unto the man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Adam said,</v>

1530
01:19:44.541 --> 01:19:46.970
<v Speaker 3>this is now bone of my bones and flesh </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my flesh.</v>

1531
01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:49.730
<v Speaker 3>She shall be called woman because she </v>
<v Speaker 3>was taken out of man.</v>

1532
01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.870
<v Speaker 3>Therefore shall a man leave his father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his mother and shall cleave unto his</v>

1533
01:19:53.871 --> 01:19:58.871
<v Speaker 3>wife and they shall be one flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought walloping statement to put in </v>

1534
01:19:58.871 --> 01:20:02.561
<v Speaker 3>there at the end of those three </v>
<v Speaker 3>sentences mean that therefore it comes </v>

1535
01:20:02.561 --> 01:20:02.561
<v Speaker 3>as somewhat of a surprise.</v>

1536
01:20:02.561 --> 01:20:03.710
<v Speaker 3>But there's an injunction there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1537
01:20:03.711 --> 01:20:05.030
<v Speaker 3>it's a good injunction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1538
01:20:05.530 --> 01:20:07.040
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who don't,</v>

1539
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:09.540
<v Speaker 3>that they have a hell of a time in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage.</v>

1540
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:12.750
<v Speaker 3>And so this is a good thing to know if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are married or if you're planning to</v>

1541
01:20:12.751 --> 01:20:16.990
<v Speaker 3>get married is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1542
01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.280
<v Speaker 3>we have very strong orientation towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>our parents and for good reason.</v>

1543
01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:24.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like the injunction here is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>secondary,</v>

1544
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:29.820
<v Speaker 3>soon as you're married and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and failure to do that makes your </v>

1545
01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:33.801
<v Speaker 3>marriage collapse and then you deserve </v>
<v Speaker 3>it to collapse too as far as I'm </v>

1546
01:20:33.801 --> 01:20:37.791
<v Speaker 3>concerned because it's a reflection of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your pathological immaturity and your </v>

1547
01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:41.070
<v Speaker 3>unwillingness to extract yourself from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the grip of parents who are a little bit</v>

1548
01:20:41.071 --> 01:20:43.800
<v Speaker 3>too much on the interfering side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the injunction,</v>

1549
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:45.390
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a deep injunction here.</v>

1550
01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:50.160
<v Speaker 3>It's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the ideas is that the original</v>

1551
01:20:50.161 --> 01:20:54.330
<v Speaker 3>Adam wasn't a man like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a separate band.</v>

1552
01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:59.620
<v Speaker 3>It was more like a hermaphroditic being </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in that Hymn Afra Didik being there </v>

1553
01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:03.351
<v Speaker 3>was a kind of undifferentiated </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfection and then that was split into </v>

1554
01:21:03.351 --> 01:21:07.580
<v Speaker 3>male and female and then that part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the goal of human beings is to reunite </v>

1555
01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:11.901
<v Speaker 3>that as the singular unity that </v>
<v Speaker 3>reestablishes the initial perfection and</v>

1556
01:21:11.911 --> 01:21:14.430
<v Speaker 3>that's actually the goal of marriage </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a spiritual perspective.</v>

1557
01:21:14.431 --> 01:21:19.431
<v Speaker 3>And you could read about that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>read young because he wrote quite a bit </v>

1558
01:21:19.431 --> 01:21:19.431
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So lovely.</v>

1559
01:21:19.431 --> 01:21:23.271
<v Speaker 3>It's such a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had these friends that went to </v>

1560
01:21:23.271 --> 01:21:24.090
<v Speaker 3>Sweden to get married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were more.</v>

1561
01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:26.490
<v Speaker 3>They were from northern Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his heritage,</v>

1562
01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.900
<v Speaker 3>they're both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their heritage is were Swedish,</v>

1563
01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Swedish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in this ceremony they did this cool </v>

1564
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:37.071
<v Speaker 3>thing as they were being married and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to hold a candle up between </v>

1565
01:21:37.071 --> 01:21:37.890
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right while they were being married.</v>

1566
01:21:37.891 --> 01:21:38.610
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1567
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:39.840
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's The candle?</v>

1568
01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:43.440
<v Speaker 3>That's a source of light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>source of illumination,</v>

1569
01:21:43.730 --> 01:21:45.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Source of enlightenment.</v>

1570
01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:48.510
<v Speaker 3>It's the candle that you put on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christmas trees and in Europe.</v>

1571
01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:51.630
<v Speaker 3>So it's the light that emerges in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>darkness and the depth of winter.</v>

1572
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:53.290
<v Speaker 3>It's a symbol of life in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1573
01:21:53.291 --> 01:21:56.310
<v Speaker 3>in darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the reemergence of the sun that the</v>

1574
01:21:56.690 --> 01:21:58.920
<v Speaker 3>at the darkest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coldest time of the year,</v>

1575
01:21:58.921 --> 01:22:01.370
<v Speaker 3>which is also associated symbolically </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

1576
01:22:01.570 --> 01:22:04.470
<v Speaker 3>with the birth of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all sorts of complicated reasons.</v>

1577
01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:06.030
<v Speaker 3>And so the candles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>

1578
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.550
<v Speaker 3>And then the next question is why do you</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold it above you?</v>

1579
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:11.100
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is because what's above </v>
<v Speaker 3>you is what?</v>

1580
01:22:11.101 --> 01:22:16.101
<v Speaker 3>You're below two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it singles to simplify something </v>

1581
01:22:16.101 --> 01:22:16.290
<v Speaker 3>transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so why do you both hold onto it?</v>

1582
01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're both supposed to hold </v>

1583
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.510
<v Speaker 3>onto the light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1584
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:22.380
<v Speaker 3>And you're supposed to be subordinate to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the light.</v>

1585
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:23.760
<v Speaker 3>And so you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1586
01:22:23.761 --> 01:22:25.170
<v Speaker 3>who's in charge of the marriage?</v>

1587
01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the light,</v>

1588
01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:29.460
<v Speaker 3>that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you come together as one thing.</v>

1589
01:22:29.461 --> 01:22:34.461
<v Speaker 3>You're no longer two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't what's good for you and it's </v>

1590
01:22:34.461 --> 01:22:35.430
<v Speaker 3>not what's good for your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what's good for the marriage.</v>

1591
01:22:35.431 --> 01:22:37.830
<v Speaker 3>And the marriage is about the combined </v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

1592
01:22:37.831 --> 01:22:40.280
<v Speaker 3>which is the reassembly of the original </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hermes,</v>

1593
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:41.400
<v Speaker 3>Hermes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Herma,</v>

1594
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:44.580
<v Speaker 3>phronetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hermaphroditic being at the beginning of</v>

1595
01:22:44.581 --> 01:22:46.410
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea.</v>

1596
01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:49.320
<v Speaker 3>And that's all packed into like these </v>
<v Speaker 3>four sentences.</v>

1597
01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:50.220
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1598
01:22:50.221 --> 01:22:51.610
<v Speaker 3>there's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1599
01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:56.720
<v Speaker 3>all of these sentences have tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 3>history of interpretation associated </v>

1600
01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:56.720
<v Speaker 3>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1601
01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:57.870
<v Speaker 3>It's just endless and endless and </v>
<v Speaker 3>endless.</v>

1602
01:22:57.871 --> 01:23:01.890
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's also an antidote to the idea</v>

1603
01:23:01.891 --> 01:23:05.100
<v Speaker 3>that women taken out of man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is obviously the reverse.</v>

1604
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:09.400
<v Speaker 3>The biological process by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes women in some sense subordinate to</v>

1605
01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:12.790
<v Speaker 3>men that is not built into this text.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't see that at all,</v>

1606
01:23:12.791 --> 01:23:16.290
<v Speaker 3>is built into the text and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something else that's associated with it</v>

1607
01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1608
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:19.330
<v Speaker 3>And there's the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1609
01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:21.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1610
01:23:21.881 --> 01:23:23.530
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in sleeping beauty,</v>

1611
01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:25.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleeping beauty goes to sleep.</v>

1612
01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:31.320
<v Speaker 3>And the reason she goes to sleep is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to remember what </v>

1613
01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:34.411
<v Speaker 3>happens is she has parents who are quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>old and so they're pretty desperate to </v>

1614
01:23:34.411 --> 01:23:38.581
<v Speaker 3>have a child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like so many people are now and they </v>

1615
01:23:38.581 --> 01:23:39.010
<v Speaker 3>only have one child like so many people </v>
<v Speaker 3>do now.</v>

1616
01:23:39.370 --> 01:23:42.520
<v Speaker 3>And they don't want to think it happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this child because like,</v>

1617
01:23:42.521 --> 01:23:47.521
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a miracle and there's only one of </v>

1618
01:23:47.521 --> 01:23:47.521
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1619
01:23:47.521 --> 01:23:51.330
<v Speaker 3>and she's the princess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's like we're not letting </v>

1620
01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:51.430
<v Speaker 3>anything around her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have a big christening party,</v>

1621
01:23:51.431 --> 01:23:53.020
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the invite everybody,</v>

1622
01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:58.330
<v Speaker 3>but they don't invite maleficent and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maleficent is the terrible mother.</v>

1623
01:23:58.331 --> 01:24:03.331
<v Speaker 3>She's nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like the thing that goes bump in </v>

1624
01:24:03.331 --> 01:24:03.490
<v Speaker 3>the night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's the devil herself,</v>

1625
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:04.360
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

1626
01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.000
<v Speaker 3>She's everything that you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 3>your child to encounter.</v>

1627
01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:08.560
<v Speaker 3>So the king and queen saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1628
01:24:08.561 --> 01:24:10.090
<v Speaker 3>we just want to invite her to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christening.</v>

1629
01:24:10.091 --> 01:24:10.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1630
01:24:10.691 --> 01:24:13.210
<v Speaker 3>good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an eatable story,</v>

1631
01:24:13.211 --> 01:24:18.211
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The eatable mother is the mother who </v>

1632
01:24:18.211 --> 01:24:20.371
<v Speaker 3>devours her child by refusing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by overprotecting him or her so that </v>

1633
01:24:20.371 --> 01:24:23.620
<v Speaker 3>instead of being strengthened by an </v>
<v Speaker 3>encounter with the terrible world,</v>

1634
01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:29.100
<v Speaker 3>they're weakened by too much protection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when they're let out into the </v>

1635
01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:29.100
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they cannot live.</v>

1636
01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:32.680
<v Speaker 3>And that's the story of sleeping beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the king and Queen do.</v>

1637
01:24:32.890 --> 01:24:37.890
<v Speaker 3>And they apologize to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Melissa sent when she first shows up </v>

1638
01:24:37.890 --> 01:24:37.890
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1639
01:24:37.890 --> 01:24:42.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a bunch of halfway to the </v>

1640
01:24:42.631 --> 01:24:42.631
<v Speaker 3>excuses why they don't invite her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We forgot.</v>

1641
01:24:42.631 --> 01:24:42.631
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

1642
01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:46.000
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't forget something like that and</v>

1643
01:24:46.001 --> 01:24:47.380
<v Speaker 3>she kind of makes that point.</v>

1644
01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.480
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole horror of life.</v>

1645
01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.150
<v Speaker 3>You don't forget about that when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a child that's for sure.</v>

1646
01:24:52.151 --> 01:24:53.710
<v Speaker 3>You might wish that it would stay at </v>
<v Speaker 3>bay,</v>

1647
01:24:53.711 --> 01:24:55.750
<v Speaker 3>but you do not forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>

1648
01:24:55.751 --> 01:25:00.751
<v Speaker 3>do you invite it to the party and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer is it bloody well depends how </v>

1649
01:25:00.751 --> 01:25:04.651
<v Speaker 3>unconscious you want your child to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you want your child to be </v>

1650
01:25:04.651 --> 01:25:08.131
<v Speaker 3>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then you have the added advantage </v>

1651
01:25:08.131 --> 01:25:10.051
<v Speaker 3>that maybe they won't leave home and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can take advantage of them for the </v>

1652
01:25:10.051 --> 01:25:12.010
<v Speaker 3>rest of your sad life instead of going </v>
<v Speaker 3>off to find something to do for yourself</v>

1653
01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.400
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course you can take revenge </v>

1654
01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.681
<v Speaker 3>on them if they do have any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any what would you call impetus towards </v>

1655
01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:22.921
<v Speaker 3>courage that you sacrificed yourself 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago and want to stamp out as soon </v>

1656
01:25:22.921 --> 01:25:23.110
<v Speaker 3>as you see it developing your child.</v>

1657
01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:25.120
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing that would be quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>pleasant,</v>

1658
01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.610
<v Speaker 3>and so that's what happens in sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>beauty.</v>

1659
01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:28.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1660
01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:31.840
<v Speaker 3>none of this is pleasant and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens in that story as pleasant,</v>

1661
01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.880
<v Speaker 3>so sleeping beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's naive as hell.</v>

1662
01:25:33.881 --> 01:25:38.881
<v Speaker 3>They put her out in the forest and have </v>
<v Speaker 3>raised by these three like goody two </v>

1663
01:25:38.881 --> 01:25:42.121
<v Speaker 3>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ferries that are also completely devoid </v>

1664
01:25:42.121 --> 01:25:42.121
<v Speaker 3>of any real potency and power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1665
01:25:42.121 --> 01:25:43.930
<v Speaker 3>There's no nothing maleficent about </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1666
01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:46.480
<v Speaker 3>And then the first idiot prince that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanders by,</v>

1667
01:25:46.481 --> 01:25:51.481
<v Speaker 3>she falls in love with so badly that she</v>
<v Speaker 3>has post traumatic stress disorder </v>

1668
01:25:51.481 --> 01:25:52.240
<v Speaker 3>really rides off on his horse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1669
01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.700
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she,</v>

1670
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:58.150
<v Speaker 3>then she goes into the castle and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all freaked out because she met the love</v>

1671
01:25:58.151 --> 01:26:00.670
<v Speaker 3>of her life for like five minutes for </v>
<v Speaker 3>God's sake.</v>

1672
01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:02.800
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when the spinning wheel,</v>

1673
01:26:02.801 --> 01:26:06.260
<v Speaker 3>that's the wheel of fate pops up and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>picks her finger right.</v>

1674
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:08.000
<v Speaker 3>They tried to get rid of all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spinning wheels.</v>

1675
01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:10.670
<v Speaker 3>They tried to get rid of all the wheels </v>
<v Speaker 3>of fate with their pointed end,</v>

1676
01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:15.940
<v Speaker 3>but she finds it poked her fingers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>finger falls down unconscious while she </v>

1677
01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:17.870
<v Speaker 3>wants to be unconscious and no bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder.</v>

1678
01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:23.020
<v Speaker 3>She was protected her whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She so damn naive that her first love </v>

1679
01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:26.501
<v Speaker 3>affair just about kills her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wants to go to sleep and never wake </v>

1680
01:26:26.501 --> 01:26:26.501
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's exactly what happened.</v>

1681
01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.240
<v Speaker 3>And then she has to wait for the prince </v>
<v Speaker 3>to come and rescue her.</v>

1682
01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.850
<v Speaker 3>What you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how sexist can you get that story?</v>

1683
01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>

1684
01:26:33.051 --> 01:26:35.400
<v Speaker 3>because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way that that would be red.</v>

1685
01:26:35.401 --> 01:26:39.110
<v Speaker 3>And in the modern world it's like she </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't need a prince to rescue her.</v>

1686
01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.860
<v Speaker 3>That's why Disney made frozen that </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely appalling piece of rubbish.</v>

1687
01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.040
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>

1688
01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:57.041
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the princess doesn't need a prince </v>

1689
01:26:57.041 --> 01:26:57.041
<v Speaker 3>to rescue her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1690
01:26:57.041 --> 01:27:01.021
<v Speaker 3>that's a bone headed way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the story because the prince isn't just </v>

1691
01:27:01.021 --> 01:27:02.360
<v Speaker 3>a man who's coming to rescue the woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>and believe me,</v>

1692
01:27:02.361 --> 01:27:03.500
<v Speaker 3>he's got his own problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1693
01:27:03.501 --> 01:27:05.750
<v Speaker 3>He's got a hold God damn dragon he has </v>
<v Speaker 3>to contend with.</v>

1694
01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:11.040
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the prince also represents the </v>

1695
01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.500
<v Speaker 3>woman's own consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That consciousness is presented very </v>

1696
01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.740
<v Speaker 3>frequently in stories as symbolically </v>
<v Speaker 3>masculine as it is with the logo idea.</v>

1697
01:27:16.770 --> 01:27:21.770
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is that without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without that forward going courageous </v>

1698
01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:26.021
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman herself will drift into </v>

1699
01:27:26.021 --> 01:27:27.080
<v Speaker 3>unconsciousness and terror and so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can read it as well.</v>

1700
01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:32.260
<v Speaker 3>The woman who's sleeping needs a man to </v>
<v Speaker 3>wake her up and of course just like a </v>

1701
01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:36.221
<v Speaker 3>man needs a woman to wake him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same damn thing that's the </v>

1702
01:27:36.221 --> 01:27:36.221
<v Speaker 3>dragon fight in sleeping beauty.</v>

1703
01:27:36.221 --> 01:27:39.110
<v Speaker 3>But it's also the case that if she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>only unconscious,</v>

1704
01:27:39.111 --> 01:27:44.111
<v Speaker 3>all she can do is lay there and sleep </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sleep of the naive and damned she </v>

1705
01:27:44.111 --> 01:27:49.091
<v Speaker 3>has to wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wake herself up and bring her own </v>

1706
01:27:49.091 --> 01:27:52.721
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own masculine consciousness into </v>

1707
01:27:52.721 --> 01:27:52.730
<v Speaker 3>the forefront so that she can survive in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

1708
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:54.920
<v Speaker 3>And of course women are trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like mad.</v>

1709
01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.620
<v Speaker 3>But that's partly what's represented in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the story like that.</v>

1710
01:27:57.890 --> 01:28:02.890
<v Speaker 3>And that's partly what's implicit in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea is that unless the woman is </v>

1711
01:28:02.890 --> 01:28:04.490
<v Speaker 3>taken out of man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

1712
01:28:04.491 --> 01:28:07.340
<v Speaker 3>then she isn't a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just a creature.</v>

1713
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:10.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's partly what's embedded in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this story.</v>

1714
01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:13.340
<v Speaker 3>So you don't want to read it as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchal,</v>

1715
01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:19.070
<v Speaker 3>don't want to read anything that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So really it's really,</v>

1716
01:28:19.071 --> 01:28:19.530
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1717
01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.170
<v Speaker 3>I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't bother with that,</v>

1718
01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:23.150
<v Speaker 3>but really we can do better than that </v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1719
01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Therefore shall a man leave his father </v>
<v Speaker 3>and his mother and shall cleave unto his</v>

1720
01:28:26.541 --> 01:28:28.700
<v Speaker 3>wife and they shall be one flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1721
01:28:28.701 --> 01:28:29.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finger.</v>

1722
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:32.420
<v Speaker 3>The other thing about marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is really worth knowing too,</v>

1723
01:28:32.421 --> 01:28:35.240
<v Speaker 3>is that I learned this in part from </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading youngest,</v>

1724
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:36.650
<v Speaker 3>like what do you do when you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>married?</v>

1725
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:41.950
<v Speaker 3>That's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take someone who's just as useless </v>

1726
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:45.311
<v Speaker 3>and horrible as you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you shackle yourself to them </v>

1727
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:50.350
<v Speaker 3>and then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not running away no matter what </v>

1728
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:51.440
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1729
01:28:51.441 --> 01:28:54.110
<v Speaker 3>Well that's perfect because then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get to run away.</v>

1730
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:57.110
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like if you can run away,</v>

1731
01:28:57.111 --> 01:29:02.111
<v Speaker 3>you can't tell each other the truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you tell someone the truth </v>

1732
01:29:02.111 --> 01:29:02.111
<v Speaker 3>about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't run away.</v>

1733
01:29:02.111 --> 01:29:05.400
<v Speaker 3>They weren't listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you don't have someone around,</v>

1734
01:29:05.401 --> 01:29:07.470
<v Speaker 3>they can't run away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can't tell them the truth.</v>

1735
01:29:07.890 --> 01:29:09.660
<v Speaker 3>And so that's part of the purpose of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage.</v>

1736
01:29:09.661 --> 01:29:10.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1737
01:29:10.291 --> 01:29:12.060
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll bet on you.</v>

1738
01:29:12.061 --> 01:29:13.530
<v Speaker 3>You bet on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a losing battle.</v>

1739
01:29:13.531 --> 01:29:16.680
<v Speaker 3>We both know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but given our current circumstances were</v>

1740
01:29:16.681 --> 01:29:19.050
<v Speaker 3>unlikely to find anyone better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

1741
01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.850
<v Speaker 2>No</v>

1742
01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:26.720
<v Speaker 3>two things that come off of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is,</v>

1743
01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are waiting around to find Mr and</v>

1744
01:29:28.761 --> 01:29:29.450
<v Speaker 3>Mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1745
01:29:29.451 --> 01:29:31.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's something to think about,</v>

1746
01:29:31.071 --> 01:29:32.420
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to put yourself on your feet.</v>

1747
01:29:32.421 --> 01:29:37.421
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you went to a party and you found Mr </v>

1748
01:29:37.421 --> 01:29:37.421
<v Speaker 3>Wright and he looked at you and didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>run away screaming,</v>

1749
01:29:37.421 --> 01:29:39.920
<v Speaker 3>that would indicate that he wasn't Mr </v>
<v Speaker 3>Wright at all.</v>

1750
01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the old Nietzschean joke.</v>

1751
01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:48.970
<v Speaker 3>If someone loves you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that should immediately disenchant you </v>

1752
01:29:48.970 --> 01:29:49.090
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1753
01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or it's the woody Allen joke.</v>

1754
01:29:50.541 --> 01:29:53.150
<v Speaker 3>I never belonged to a club that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>take me as a member.</v>

1755
01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:55.180
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1756
01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:57.740
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very interesting thing to think</v>

1757
01:29:57.741 --> 01:30:02.741
<v Speaker 3>about and so you're going to shackle </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself to someone who's just as far as</v>

1758
01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:07.470
<v Speaker 3>imperfect as you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the issue is you,</v>

1759
01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:12.660
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be in a situation where you </v>

1760
01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:12.660
<v Speaker 3>can actually negotiate because you might</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1761
01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:17.980
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some things about you that </v>

1762
01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:17.980
<v Speaker 3>aren't going so.</v>

1763
01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:19.810
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's some things about me that </v>

1764
01:30:19.810 --> 01:30:19.850
<v Speaker 3>aren't going so right and we're bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>well stuck with the consequences for the</v>

1765
01:30:19.851 --> 01:30:21.620
<v Speaker 3>next 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can.</v>

1766
01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:26.680
<v Speaker 3>We can either straighten this out or we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can suffer through it for the next five </v>

1767
01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:31.211
<v Speaker 3>decades and you know people are of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort that without that degree of </v>

1768
01:30:31.211 --> 01:30:32.600
<v Speaker 3>seriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those problems will not be solved.</v>

1769
01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:37.810
<v Speaker 3>You'll leave things unnamed because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always an out and this the same </v>

1770
01:30:37.810 --> 01:30:37.820
<v Speaker 3>thing when you're living together with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>

1771
01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:43.060
<v Speaker 3>You know that people who live together </v>
<v Speaker 3>before they're married are more likely </v>

1772
01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:43.060
<v Speaker 3>to get divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not less likely.</v>

1773
01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:47.410
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what exactly are you saying to one </v>

1774
01:30:47.410 --> 01:30:47.510
<v Speaker 3>another when you live with each other?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just think about it.</v>

1775
01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:53.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for now you're better than anything </v>

1776
01:30:54.531 --> 01:30:55.670
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can trick,</v>

1777
01:30:57.410 --> 01:31:02.410
<v Speaker 3>but I'd love to reserve the right to </v>
<v Speaker 3>trade you in conveniently.</v>

1778
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:08.990
<v Speaker 3>If someone beat her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to stumble into me,</v>

1779
01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can.</v>

1780
01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:20.450
<v Speaker 3>How could someone not be insulted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>their core by an offer like that?</v>

1781
01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Now they're willing to play along with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it because they're going to do the same </v>

1782
01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:25.660
<v Speaker 3>thing with you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1783
01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:25.660
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1784
01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:26.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1785
01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:31.150
<v Speaker 3>I know you're not going to commit to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that means you don't value me or our </v>

1786
01:31:31.150 --> 01:31:32.660
<v Speaker 3>relationship above everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as long as I get to escape,</v>

1787
01:31:32.661 --> 01:31:34.610
<v Speaker 3>if I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm willing to put up with that.</v>

1788
01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a hell of a thing.</v>

1789
01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might think,</v>

1790
01:31:37.161 --> 01:31:39.710
<v Speaker 3>how stupid is it to shackle yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone?</v>

1791
01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:40.640
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's stupid,</v>

1792
01:31:40.641 --> 01:31:41.840
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that.</v>

1793
01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:47.080
<v Speaker 3>But compared to the alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty damn good because without </v>

1794
01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:51.371
<v Speaker 3>that shackling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are things you will never ever </v>

1795
01:31:51.371 --> 01:31:54.551
<v Speaker 3>learned because you'll avoid them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can always leave and if you can </v>

1796
01:31:54.551 --> 01:31:55.130
<v Speaker 3>leave then you don't have to tell each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other the truth.</v>

1797
01:31:55.460 --> 01:32:00.460
<v Speaker 3>It's as simple as that because you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>just leave and then you don't have </v>

1798
01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:00.460
<v Speaker 3>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell the truth too.</v>

1799
01:32:06.170 --> 01:32:09.710
<v Speaker 3>So there's some representations of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of the original.</v>

1800
01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:11.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't all Adam,</v>

1801
01:32:11.031 --> 01:32:13.460
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an old Chinese symbol.</v>

1802
01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:15.560
<v Speaker 3>I think it's fuck and new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1803
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:18.650
<v Speaker 3>I think I have the pronunciation wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really cool.</v>

1804
01:32:18.651 --> 01:32:19.100
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1805
01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:23.150
<v Speaker 3>See the snakes down here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're kind of like a DNA symbol,</v>

1806
01:32:23.151 --> 01:32:28.151
<v Speaker 3>which I find very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's the original cosmic </v>

1807
01:32:28.151 --> 01:32:32.530
<v Speaker 3>serpent that's sort of the potential out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of which that emerges and then that's </v>

1808
01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:35.831
<v Speaker 3>the differentiation of that into male </v>
<v Speaker 3>and female and so that's like the </v>

1809
01:32:35.831 --> 01:32:37.550
<v Speaker 3>predatory unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

1810
01:32:37.551 --> 01:32:41.030
<v Speaker 3>That's the most fundamental conception </v>
<v Speaker 3>of mankind is something like that is the</v>

1811
01:32:41.031 --> 01:32:46.031
<v Speaker 3>predatory unknown and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bifurcation of that into the two </v>

1812
01:32:46.031 --> 01:32:46.910
<v Speaker 3>fundamental cognitive elements of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>perception,</v>

1813
01:32:46.911 --> 01:32:49.520
<v Speaker 3>masculine and female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you see the same thing here.</v>

1814
01:32:49.670 --> 01:32:51.150
<v Speaker 3>This is Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Egypt,</v>

1815
01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:52.640
<v Speaker 3>also extraordinarily old.</v>

1816
01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:57.880
<v Speaker 3>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the great serpent that underlies </v>

1817
01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:59.810
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ma indicating itself into Isis,</v>

1818
01:32:59.930 --> 01:33:04.930
<v Speaker 3>queen of the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Cyrus King of the King of King of </v>

1819
01:33:04.930 --> 01:33:05.360
<v Speaker 3>King Pharaoh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>King of order.</v>

1820
01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.580
<v Speaker 3>You see the same thing in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dow chemical symbol.</v>

1821
01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:12.700
<v Speaker 3>I love this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it looks quite a lot like the </v>

1822
01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:12.700
<v Speaker 3>little thing that Harry Potter chases </v>
<v Speaker 3>around A.</v>

1823
01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:14.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's not accidental by the way,</v>

1824
01:33:14.061 --> 01:33:19.061
<v Speaker 3>because the seeker is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that chases this and the </v>

1825
01:33:19.061 --> 01:33:22.721
<v Speaker 3>seeker that chases this and catches that</v>
<v Speaker 3>wind and that's a really old idea and </v>

1826
01:33:22.721 --> 01:33:26.591
<v Speaker 3>how the Hell j Dot k rowling knew that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot figure out because that is a </v>

1827
01:33:26.591 --> 01:33:26.591
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very archaic symbol,</v>

1828
01:33:26.591 --> 01:33:30.830
<v Speaker 3>arcane symbol on Google.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the round chaos and the only</v>

1829
01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:36.220
<v Speaker 3>reference to the round chaos that I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>find on Google is on my webpage and so I</v>

1830
01:33:36.531 --> 01:33:39.050
<v Speaker 3>have no idea how Rollin came up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1831
01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:40.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know she looked at a lot of old texts,</v>

1832
01:33:40.881 --> 01:33:44.330
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that if you play the </v>
<v Speaker 3>metagame and you catch this,</v>

1833
01:33:44.331 --> 01:33:46.730
<v Speaker 3>you win all the Games is exactly right </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that.</v>

1834
01:33:46.731 --> 01:33:49.640
<v Speaker 3>And that's the for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the name of that quidditch?</v>

1835
01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:52.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's the potential that's like the</v>

1836
01:33:52.461 --> 01:33:57.461
<v Speaker 3>potential out of which God made the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world at the beginning of time and what </v>

1837
01:33:57.461 --> 01:33:58.190
<v Speaker 3>emerges out of that is some kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a dragon.</v>

1838
01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:03.600
<v Speaker 3>The dragon fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's partly the serpent that's in the </v>

1839
01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.240
<v Speaker 3>garden of Eden and then that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifestation of masculine and feminine.</v>

1840
01:34:05.241 --> 01:34:08.840
<v Speaker 3>Out of that potential predatory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unknown,</v>

1841
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:11.540
<v Speaker 3>masculine and feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a single.</v>

1842
01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:16.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like a single representation of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary history of human cognitive </v>

1843
01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.780
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so cool,</v>

1844
01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.180
<v Speaker 3>and then it's also an image of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideal.</v>

1845
01:34:20.181 --> 01:34:25.181
<v Speaker 3>It's the Union of sun and moon and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>this hyper creature hermaphroditic </v>

1846
01:34:25.181 --> 01:34:29.920
<v Speaker 3>that's also the Adam and eve that </v>
<v Speaker 3>existed at the beginning of time before </v>

1847
01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:30.860
<v Speaker 3>the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the purpose of marriage.</v>

1848
01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:34.190
<v Speaker 3>All of that as a sacrament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of that in these images.</v>

1849
01:34:34.191 --> 01:34:39.191
<v Speaker 3>It's just absolutely unbelievable what </v>
<v Speaker 3>images can pack into them and there's </v>

1850
01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:44.030
<v Speaker 3>some more classical representations of </v>
<v Speaker 3>eve being extracted from Adam</v>

1851
01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:50.340
<v Speaker 3>and this is a cool line and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>both naked.</v>

1852
01:34:50.341 --> 01:34:52.200
<v Speaker 3>The man and his wife and were not </v>
<v Speaker 3>ashamed.</v>

1853
01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:58.400
<v Speaker 3>Well that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See someone who wrote that would only </v>

1854
01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:01.251
<v Speaker 3>write that like that if they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>surprised that they weren't ashamed </v>

1855
01:35:01.251 --> 01:35:01.251
<v Speaker 3>because why would you point it out </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise?</v>

1856
01:35:01.251 --> 01:35:03.710
<v Speaker 3>And so there's this intimation that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>two things.</v>

1857
01:35:03.711 --> 01:35:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Number one is there was a point at time </v>
<v Speaker 3>in time when human beings were naked and</v>

1858
01:35:08.301 --> 01:35:13.301
<v Speaker 3>they weren't ashamed of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there is a point of time which is </v>

1859
01:35:13.301 --> 01:35:13.610
<v Speaker 3>now where they're naked and they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>ashamed of it.</v>

1860
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:15.130
<v Speaker 3>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1861
01:35:15.131 --> 01:35:17.570
<v Speaker 3>what's the association with nakedness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shame?</v>

1862
01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.500
<v Speaker 3>And that's often given a sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>connotation in,</v>

1863
01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:26.360
<v Speaker 3>in classic interpretations of the Adam </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Eve story because of its association</v>

1864
01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.650
<v Speaker 3>with nudity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I presume.</v>

1865
01:35:27.651 --> 01:35:29.930
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's a lot more complicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>

1866
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:34.940
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I noticed my daughter,</v>

1867
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:38.390
<v Speaker 3>she probably won't be very happy that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm revealing this in this lecture,</v>

1868
01:35:38.391 --> 01:35:43.391
<v Speaker 3>but my daughter was never really </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned about nudity when she was a </v>

1869
01:35:43.391 --> 01:35:44.600
<v Speaker 3>little kid and it was all the same to </v>
<v Speaker 3>her one way or another.</v>

1870
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:48.890
<v Speaker 3>But my son by the time he was three man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kid was private.</v>

1871
01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:49.810
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1872
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:52.250
<v Speaker 3>his bedroom door was shut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bathroom door was shut.</v>

1873
01:35:52.251 --> 01:35:57.251
<v Speaker 3>It was like get the hell out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that seemed to just happen of its </v>

1874
01:35:57.251 --> 01:35:57.251
<v Speaker 3>own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1875
01:35:57.251 --> 01:35:58.940
<v Speaker 3>we had two children and one was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and the other one wasn't.</v>

1876
01:35:58.941 --> 01:36:00.530
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think we had much to do with it</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

1877
01:36:00.531 --> 01:36:03.200
<v Speaker 3>But it was really fascinating to watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>that emerge in him.</v>

1878
01:36:03.650 --> 01:36:08.650
<v Speaker 3>And you know that that sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of self consciousness does seem to </v>

1879
01:36:08.650 --> 01:36:09.530
<v Speaker 3>emerge in children somewhere around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>age of three.</v>

1880
01:36:09.710 --> 01:36:14.710
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's generally also when we start </v>

1881
01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:16.571
<v Speaker 3>thinking that maybe having your baby </v>
<v Speaker 3>wander around naked on a beach isn't </v>

1882
01:36:16.571 --> 01:36:16.571
<v Speaker 3>exactly the best idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1883
01:36:16.571 --> 01:36:17.630
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something like that.</v>

1884
01:36:17.631 --> 01:36:22.631
<v Speaker 3>It's the nudity in children is generally</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay under some circumstances in public </v>

1885
01:36:22.631 --> 01:36:22.631
<v Speaker 3>display.</v>

1886
01:36:22.631 --> 01:36:27.190
<v Speaker 3>We seem to think of that as merely I </v>
<v Speaker 3>succeptible why might,</v>

1887
01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:32.340
<v Speaker 3>I dunno why it stops being acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that has something to do with </v>

1888
01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:34.250
<v Speaker 3>sexuality obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very complicated phenomena.</v>

1889
01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:36.830
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole nudity thing is the,</v>

1890
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:38.840
<v Speaker 3>is a very complicated thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1891
01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:40.810
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are kind of strange because we're</v>

1892
01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:43.580
<v Speaker 3>hairless roughly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1893
01:36:43.730 --> 01:36:47.180
<v Speaker 3>compared to most animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we don't know why that is.</v>

1894
01:36:47.181 --> 01:36:52.181
<v Speaker 3>Some people think it's because we lost </v>
<v Speaker 3>our hair when we were wandering around </v>

1895
01:36:52.181 --> 01:36:55.001
<v Speaker 3>in the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the desert running around in Africa </v>

1896
01:36:55.001 --> 01:36:55.001
<v Speaker 3>because we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good runners.</v>

1897
01:36:55.001 --> 01:36:57.530
<v Speaker 3>We can run down animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say like a human being in good shape can</v>

1898
01:36:57.531 --> 01:37:02.531
<v Speaker 3>run a horse to death in a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can really run man and had a lot of </v>

1899
01:37:02.531 --> 01:37:03.980
<v Speaker 3>our ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Kalahari Bushman still do this.</v>

1900
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:09.250
<v Speaker 3>They just run an animal for it till it </v>
<v Speaker 3>dies and that Bushman doesn't die.</v>

1901
01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:12.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean they also sometimes shoot them </v>
<v Speaker 3>with poison arrows but they can just run</v>

1902
01:37:12.381 --> 01:37:17.381
<v Speaker 3>them until they die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have tremendous endurance and you </v>

1903
01:37:17.381 --> 01:37:20.500
<v Speaker 3>and you have to be able to get rid of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of heat if you're going to run </v>

1904
01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:20.500
<v Speaker 3>around in the desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we don't have much hair.</v>

1905
01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:25.091
<v Speaker 3>That's one explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Buckminster Fuller had an </v>

1906
01:37:25.091 --> 01:37:27.521
<v Speaker 3>interesting explanation which was he </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinks that at some point during our </v>

1907
01:37:27.521 --> 01:37:29.270
<v Speaker 3>evolution we spend a lot of time near </v>
<v Speaker 3>the water and so we're like fish apes,</v>

1908
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:30.800
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1909
01:37:30.801 --> 01:37:35.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we like to be on the beach and there's </v>

1910
01:37:35.801 --> 01:37:37.301
<v Speaker 3>lots of food there and we like to swim </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're really good at swimming for </v>

1911
01:37:37.301 --> 01:37:38.300
<v Speaker 3>terrestrial creatures and we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we cry salt.</v>

1912
01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Here's like some seagoing creatures too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And women have a layer of subcutaneous </v>

1913
01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:47.291
<v Speaker 3>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some going creature stew and we </v>

1914
01:37:47.291 --> 01:37:47.291
<v Speaker 3>have kind of our feet are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are very odd.</v>

1915
01:37:47.291 --> 01:37:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Things are kind of good for flapping in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the water,</v>

1916
01:37:49.881 --> 01:37:54.881
<v Speaker 3>although we can also walk with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he thought that maybe that </v>

1917
01:37:54.881 --> 01:37:55.300
<v Speaker 3>adaptation was to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1918
01:37:55.410 --> 01:38:00.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a water existence like seals and so </v>

1919
01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:02.991
<v Speaker 3>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we kind of went back to the ocean </v>

1920
01:38:02.991 --> 01:38:02.991
<v Speaker 3>but not quite and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyways,</v>

1921
01:38:02.991 --> 01:38:05.010
<v Speaker 3>the evolution of that hairlessness is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting thing,</v>

1922
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:10.310
<v Speaker 3>but it certainly does make us exposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world in a way that animals that </v>

1923
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:12.060
<v Speaker 3>have a covering a for art and then we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>upright,</v>

1924
01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:15.750
<v Speaker 3>which is very strange because most </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals aren't there on all fours.</v>

1925
01:38:15.751 --> 01:38:20.751
<v Speaker 3>And so they're very vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Parts are protected and not exposed to </v>

1926
01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:21.900
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course,</v>

1927
01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.640
<v Speaker 3>when you're standing up nude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1928
01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:25.880
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fears,</v>

1929
01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:30.240
<v Speaker 3>let's call it your psychophysiological </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality is on painful display,</v>

1930
01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:35.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people complain about that all the </v>

1931
01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:35.780
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1932
01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:35.970
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the feminist tack for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

1933
01:38:35.971 --> 01:38:40.971
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that women have eating </v>

1934
01:38:40.971 --> 01:38:42.861
<v Speaker 3>disorders is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is directly attributed to the presence </v>

1935
01:38:42.861 --> 01:38:44.760
<v Speaker 3>of too many beautiful women on the cover</v>
<v Speaker 3>of magazines.</v>

1936
01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though women by those magazines and</v>

1937
01:38:48.361 --> 01:38:53.361
<v Speaker 3>they're attracted to the band,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their mood goes up when they purchase </v>

1938
01:38:53.361 --> 01:38:54.600
<v Speaker 3>them and the if the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the stimulus was a negative,</v>

1939
01:38:54.601 --> 01:38:56.520
<v Speaker 3>that women would avoid the magazines and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not by them.</v>

1940
01:38:56.521 --> 01:38:58.770
<v Speaker 3>So as a theory it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very bad one,</v>

1941
01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.560
<v Speaker 3>but it's still the case that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1942
01:39:01.561 --> 01:39:03.750
<v Speaker 3>it's still the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that standards of beauty,</v>

1943
01:39:03.751 --> 01:39:05.810
<v Speaker 3>shame people and that's for sure and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>

1944
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:07.830
<v Speaker 3>because if you're not ugly now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1945
01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:09.570
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be at some point in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1946
01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:14.130
<v Speaker 3>So that's kind of a rough thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>contend with.</v>

1947
01:39:14.131 --> 01:39:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1948
01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:16.770
<v Speaker 3>it's a rough thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know that,</v>

1949
01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:19.660
<v Speaker 3>that there's an ideal that you could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe even once we're,</v>

1950
01:39:19.661 --> 01:39:21.560
<v Speaker 3>that you're not going to be for long or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

1951
01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:26.840
<v Speaker 3>or never were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's really an appalling issue </v>

1952
01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:29.430
<v Speaker 3>because I think it's harder on women </v>
<v Speaker 3>because women are judged by men more for</v>

1953
01:39:29.431 --> 01:39:32.850
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their youth and fertility.</v>

1954
01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:35.580
<v Speaker 3>That's how it turns out from an </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary point of view.</v>

1955
01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Men are judged more on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>socioeconomic status by women.</v>

1956
01:39:38.850 --> 01:39:41.370
<v Speaker 3>It's harsh both ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so anyways,</v>

1957
01:39:41.371 --> 01:39:41.840
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1958
01:39:41.841 --> 01:39:46.841
<v Speaker 3>it's a terrible thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to carry the knowledge with you that </v>

1959
01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:52.610
<v Speaker 3>you're exposed to the most serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible evaluation of the quality of </v>

1960
01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:56.511
<v Speaker 3>your being that you can possibly be </v>
<v Speaker 3>exposed to all the time and that that's </v>

1961
01:39:56.511 --> 01:39:58.230
<v Speaker 3>further amplified if you're without </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothing.</v>

1962
01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.440
<v Speaker 3>And so part of clothing is protection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a tremendous amount of it is merely </v>

1963
01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:06.270
<v Speaker 3>stopping other people from evaluating </v>
<v Speaker 3>you too harshly all the time.</v>

1964
01:40:06.271 --> 01:40:10.800
<v Speaker 3>It just gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1965
01:40:10.810 --> 01:40:11.950
<v Speaker 3>this store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1966
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:17.290
<v Speaker 3>this story makes the case that at some </v>
<v Speaker 3>point we weren't like that.</v>

1967
01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals aren't like that.</v>

1968
01:40:18.521 --> 01:40:21.850
<v Speaker 3>So it seems perfectly plausible in at </v>
<v Speaker 3>some point we weren't like that,</v>

1969
01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:23.410
<v Speaker 3>but at some point that changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1970
01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:29.160
<v Speaker 3>and they were both naked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the man and his wife and were not </v>

1971
01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:29.160
<v Speaker 3>ashamed.</v>

1972
01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:31.760
<v Speaker 3>Now the serpent was more subtle than any</v>
<v Speaker 3>beast of the field,</v>

1973
01:40:31.761 --> 01:40:34.820
<v Speaker 3>which the Lord God had made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said unto the woman,</v>

1974
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:37.370
<v Speaker 3>yea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have God said you shall not eat of every</v>

1975
01:40:37.371 --> 01:40:39.200
<v Speaker 3>tree of the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like this.</v>

1976
01:40:39.201 --> 01:40:40.220
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um.</v>

1977
01:40:41.290 --> 01:40:43.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember who did the etching.</v>

1978
01:40:43.021 --> 01:40:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is it?</v>

1979
01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Dra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1980
01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Delray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1981
01:40:46.170 --> 01:40:51.170
<v Speaker 3>Hee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He duray did etchings for paradise lost </v>

1982
01:40:51.170 --> 01:40:52.560
<v Speaker 3>that are absolutely remarkable and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is Satan and this is the snake here.</v>

1983
01:40:52.561 --> 01:40:57.561
<v Speaker 3>And of course in the genesis story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Satan is weirdly associated with the </v>

1984
01:40:57.561 --> 01:40:58.240
<v Speaker 3>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll tell you that's a.</v>

1985
01:40:58.650 --> 01:41:03.650
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a tough one to sort out because </v>

1986
01:41:03.650 --> 01:41:06.750
<v Speaker 3>in the story of Adam and eve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there no indication whatsoever that the </v>

1987
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:10.291
<v Speaker 3>serpent who cam see there's also Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the author of all evil and how in the </v>

1988
01:41:11.201 --> 01:41:13.210
<v Speaker 3>world those two stories got tangled </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

1989
01:41:13.570 --> 01:41:16.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I figured that out and I'm going</v>

1990
01:41:16.301 --> 01:41:21.301
<v Speaker 3>to tell you that tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it took a very long time to figure </v>

1991
01:41:21.301 --> 01:41:21.301
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>

1992
01:41:21.301 --> 01:41:21.400
<v Speaker 3>And it's absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so bloody brilliant.</v>

1993
01:41:21.401 --> 01:41:23.350
<v Speaker 3>I just can't believe that people figured</v>
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>

1994
01:41:23.351 --> 01:41:28.351
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so unbelievably spectacularly </v>

1995
01:41:28.351 --> 01:41:28.351
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a,</v>

1996
01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.280
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an intimation of that idea,</v>

1997
01:41:30.281 --> 01:41:32.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there's a kinship between these two</v>

1998
01:41:32.051 --> 01:41:33.970
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1999
01:41:33.971 --> 01:41:36.310
<v Speaker 3>the serpent was more subtle than any </v>
<v Speaker 3>beast of the field.</v>

2000
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:37.750
<v Speaker 3>Subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an interesting word.</v>

2001
01:41:37.751 --> 01:41:39.790
<v Speaker 3>This is from the Oxford English </v>
<v Speaker 3>dictionary.</v>

2002
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:44.170
<v Speaker 3>So [inaudible] will amplify the word </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this is what you do in union dream</v>

2003
01:41:44.171 --> 01:41:45.430
<v Speaker 3>interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2004
01:41:45.431 --> 01:41:49.150
<v Speaker 3>is to kind of look at the connotations </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the concepts that are associated with</v>

2005
01:41:49.151 --> 01:41:53.020
<v Speaker 3>the dream subtle of a person or animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>and action behavior.</v>

2006
01:41:53.230 --> 01:41:54.220
<v Speaker 3>Crafty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cunning,</v>

2007
01:41:54.221 --> 01:41:55.330
<v Speaker 3>sly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>treacherous.</v>

2008
01:41:55.331 --> 01:41:56.950
<v Speaker 3>So it's something that's sort of sneaks </v>
<v Speaker 3>along,</v>

2009
01:41:56.951 --> 01:41:57.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

2010
01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:01.870
<v Speaker 3>it's not something that you really pick </v>
<v Speaker 3>up on that easily have a look or glance.</v>

2011
01:42:01.871 --> 01:42:04.480
<v Speaker 3>Sly Furtive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>surreptitious of a person,</v>

2012
01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:08.020
<v Speaker 3>skillful expert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clever of a work of art,</v>

2013
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:11.830
<v Speaker 3>mechanical device cleverly made or </v>
<v Speaker 3>designed ingenious well that that's.</v>

2014
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:15.540
<v Speaker 3>I think that's all fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those terms so far,</v>

2015
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:19.670
<v Speaker 3>fairly well attributed to snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they are very cool things and and</v>

2016
01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:24.680
<v Speaker 3>they are very well designed and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite remarkable and they're also very </v>

2017
01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.811
<v Speaker 3>subtle on the nature of or involving </v>
<v Speaker 3>careful discrimination of fine points or</v>

2018
01:42:29.111 --> 01:42:34.111
<v Speaker 3>five points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Difficult to understand and abstruse of </v>

2019
01:42:34.361 --> 01:42:39.361
<v Speaker 3>a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mind or intellectual activity,</v>

2020
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:43.930
<v Speaker 3>intellectual activity characterized by </v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom or perceptiveness.</v>

2021
01:42:43.931 --> 01:42:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Discriminating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discerning and true.</v>

2022
01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:50.550
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting because Milton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Satan is also the intellect and you </v>

2023
01:42:51.401 --> 01:42:52.780
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see that very often.</v>

2024
01:42:52.781 --> 01:42:54.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so often the bad guys,</v>

2025
01:42:54.221 --> 01:42:55.510
<v Speaker 3>an evil scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2026
01:42:55.780 --> 01:43:00.780
<v Speaker 3>and there's something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the same thing in the lion king </v>

2027
01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:01.570
<v Speaker 3>with scar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean scars and intellect and arrogant,</v>

2028
01:43:01.571 --> 01:43:04.630
<v Speaker 3>deceitful intellect piece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing stupid about scar.</v>

2029
01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:06.490
<v Speaker 3>He's not wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's the.</v>

2030
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:11.550
<v Speaker 3>He's the evil voice that's always </v>
<v Speaker 3>whispering in the king's ear and that's </v>

2031
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:14.140
<v Speaker 3>associated with the pride of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellect and the Catholics had warned,</v>

2032
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:17.620
<v Speaker 3>warned humanity about the pride of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellect for centuries.</v>

2033
01:43:17.970 --> 01:43:22.970
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's partly what produced somewhat of </v>

2034
01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:22.970
<v Speaker 3>the schism between Catholicism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

2035
01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:24.550
<v Speaker 3>although that's much overstated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the historical record,</v>

2036
01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:28.540
<v Speaker 3>the idea was that the intellect has its </v>
<v Speaker 3>own particular.</v>

2037
01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:33.600
<v Speaker 3>It's a remarkable faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it's the highest angel in </v>

2038
01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.330
<v Speaker 3>God's heavenly kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the way that Milton portrayed it,</v>

2039
01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:39.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the thing that can go most</v>
<v Speaker 3>terribly wrong because intellect,</v>

2040
01:43:39.970 --> 01:43:44.970
<v Speaker 3>the intellect can become arrogant about </v>
<v Speaker 3>its own existence and accomplishments </v>

2041
01:43:44.970 --> 01:43:49.320
<v Speaker 3>and it can fall in love with its own </v>
<v Speaker 3>products and that's what happens when </v>

2042
01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:51.890
<v Speaker 3>you're ideologically possessed because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you end up with a dogma like say a human</v>

2043
01:43:51.891 --> 01:43:54.830
<v Speaker 3>constructed dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mine Solzhenitsyn's words that possesses</v>

2044
01:43:54.831 --> 01:43:58.940
<v Speaker 3>you completely have which you believe is</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent right.</v>

2045
01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:04.150
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it eradicates the necessity for </v>

2046
01:44:04.150 --> 01:44:05.981
<v Speaker 3>anything transcendent and so that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>element of the intellect that's </v>

2047
01:44:05.981 --> 01:44:09.020
<v Speaker 3>associated symbolically with the snake </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the garden of paradise,</v>

2048
01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:12.170
<v Speaker 3>of a feeling sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensation,</v>

2049
01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.890
<v Speaker 3>acute and keen involving distinctions </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are find her delicate especially to</v>

2050
01:44:15.891 --> 01:44:18.530
<v Speaker 3>such an extent as to be difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 3>discern or analyze.</v>

2051
01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:23.300
<v Speaker 3>Also almost imperceptible and elusive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having little thickness or breadth,</v>

2052
01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:26.450
<v Speaker 3>thin fine sub teal matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2053
01:44:26.451 --> 01:44:29.780
<v Speaker 3>historical rarefied matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>barely there at all,</v>

2054
01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:33.680
<v Speaker 3>and the woman said unto the serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we may eat of the fruit,</v>

2055
01:44:33.681 --> 01:44:34.700
<v Speaker 3>of the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the garden,</v>

2056
01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:37.280
<v Speaker 3>but of the fruit of the tree which is in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the midst of the garden,</v>

2057
01:44:37.281 --> 01:44:38.480
<v Speaker 3>Goth is God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has said,</v>

2058
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:41.240
<v Speaker 3>you shall not eat of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neither shall you touch it,</v>

2059
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:43.940
<v Speaker 3>lest you die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The serpent said to the woman,</v>

2060
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Ye shall not surely die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For God doth know in the day that you </v>

2061
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:53.201
<v Speaker 3>eat thereof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then your eyes shall be opened and you </v>

2062
01:44:53.201 --> 01:44:54.200
<v Speaker 3>shall be as gods knowing good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sneaky,</v>

2063
01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.140
<v Speaker 3>subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a nice story.</v>

2064
01:44:56.530 --> 01:45:00.410
<v Speaker 3>The first thing is the for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The instant implication is,</v>

2065
01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:02.510
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't trust God,</v>

2066
01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:05.630
<v Speaker 3>so that's pretty sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the next is what he's trying to.</v>

2067
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:08.840
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to pull a fast one on you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the next one is what?</v>

2068
01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:13.840
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to do that because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>jealous and he doesn't want you to know </v>

2069
01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.991
<v Speaker 3>things that he knows because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be so good and he's lying to </v>

2070
01:45:16.991 --> 01:45:17.270
<v Speaker 3>you anyways because you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>die,</v>

2071
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:21.380
<v Speaker 3>and if you eat it contrary to what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been informed,</v>

2072
01:45:21.381 --> 01:45:26.381
<v Speaker 3>then all that's going to happen is your </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes will be open and you'll be like </v>

2073
01:45:26.381 --> 01:45:27.230
<v Speaker 3>gods knowing good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds pretty damn good.</v>

2074
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:29.780
<v Speaker 3>So you know a night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean eve,</v>

2075
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:31.310
<v Speaker 3>but does she know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2076
01:45:31.311 --> 01:45:35.990
<v Speaker 3>It's no wonder she's susceptible to such</v>
<v Speaker 3>blandishments and it's quite interesting</v>

2077
01:45:35.991 --> 01:45:40.991
<v Speaker 3>too because Adam and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God tells Adam and eve not eat the damn </v>

2078
01:45:40.991 --> 01:45:42.050
<v Speaker 3>fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they never promise not to write,</v>

2079
01:45:42.051 --> 01:45:45.210
<v Speaker 3>so they haven't promised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've just been told to and well,</v>

2080
01:45:45.211 --> 01:45:46.340
<v Speaker 3>we should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They be obedient.</v>

2081
01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how obedient do you want your children </v>

2082
01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:53.171
<v Speaker 3>to be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want them to be obedient enough so </v>

2083
01:45:53.171 --> 01:45:55.361
<v Speaker 3>they don't get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but disobedient enough so that they go </v>

2084
01:45:55.361 --> 01:45:57.821
<v Speaker 3>out in the world and do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>courageous and they break some rules </v>

2085
01:45:57.821 --> 01:45:57.910
<v Speaker 3>that they learned some things and so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know it's,</v>

2086
01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:00.170
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very paradoxical story.</v>

2087
01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:01.690
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the serpent,</v>

2088
01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:06.290
<v Speaker 3>when wins this round man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so eve pays attention to the snake.</v>

2089
01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:13.030
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have the same set of images,</v>

2090
01:46:13.031 --> 01:46:14.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have an adamant,</v>

2091
01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:16.840
<v Speaker 3>we have eve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have this tree,</v>

2092
01:46:16.841 --> 01:46:20.040
<v Speaker 3>and we have this strange serpent that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a dragon like form there,</v>

2093
01:46:20.050 --> 01:46:25.050
<v Speaker 3>a sphinx like form that's associated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the tree snakes eternally </v>

2094
01:46:25.050 --> 01:46:25.750
<v Speaker 3>associated with a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2095
01:46:25.930 --> 01:46:28.150
<v Speaker 3>the snake was eternally associated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tree.</v>

2096
01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:32.320
<v Speaker 3>We spent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God only knows how many tens of millions</v>

2097
01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:37.320
<v Speaker 3>of years as tree dwelling primates and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the primary or one of our primary </v>

2098
01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.530
<v Speaker 3>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had three primary predators,</v>

2099
01:46:39.310 --> 01:46:41.500
<v Speaker 3>snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>birds,</v>

2100
01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:47.220
<v Speaker 3>cats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the snake has been associated </v>

2101
01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:47.220
<v Speaker 3>with the tree for a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very long time.</v>

2102
01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:52.620
<v Speaker 3>And the lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the snake tells people you bloody well </v>

2103
01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:52.620
<v Speaker 3>better wake up or something you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2104
01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:54.840
<v Speaker 3>we'll get you and who's going to be more</v>
<v Speaker 3>susceptible,</v>

2105
01:46:54.841 --> 01:46:57.270
<v Speaker 3>susceptible to paying attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>snake,</v>

2106
01:46:57.570 --> 01:47:02.570
<v Speaker 3>and that's going to be eve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is eve has </v>

2107
01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:05.970
<v Speaker 3>offspring and there's nothing tastier to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a snake than a child.</v>

2108
01:47:06.690 --> 01:47:11.690
<v Speaker 3>And so eve had every reason to be self </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious and neurotic and women are </v>

2109
01:47:11.690 --> 01:47:13.680
<v Speaker 3>more self conscious and neurotic than </v>
<v Speaker 3>men by quite a substantial amount.</v>

2110
01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:17.010
<v Speaker 3>And that's true cross culturally and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>emerges out of puberty.</v>

2111
01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:19.590
<v Speaker 3>And part of the reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as we can tell,</v>

2112
01:47:19.591 --> 01:47:21.720
<v Speaker 3>is that women are more sexually </v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable.</v>

2113
01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:25.520
<v Speaker 3>There are also smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a problem if you're engaged in</v>

2114
01:47:25.521 --> 01:47:28.050
<v Speaker 3>any physical alteration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But most importantly,</v>

2115
01:47:28.051 --> 01:47:33.051
<v Speaker 3>I think is that why would you ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>assume that a human females nervous </v>

2116
01:47:33.481 --> 01:47:36.720
<v Speaker 3>system is adapted to her or her </v>
<v Speaker 3>wellbeing?</v>

2117
01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you assume a stead that her</v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous system is adapted to the female </v>

2118
01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:43.950
<v Speaker 3>infant dyad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if it isn't,</v>

2119
01:47:43.951 --> 01:47:46.560
<v Speaker 3>then the infants die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you might take,</v>

2120
01:47:46.561 --> 01:47:50.040
<v Speaker 3>while women are way more susceptible to </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression and anxiety than men are.</v>

2121
01:47:50.170 --> 01:47:53.180
<v Speaker 3>And that's a hell of a burden to bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's also true cross-culturally,</v>

2122
01:47:53.370 --> 01:47:53.790
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

2123
01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:58.880
<v Speaker 3>And it also kicks into puberty and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest differences are in Scandinavia </v>

2124
01:47:58.880 --> 01:47:59.610
<v Speaker 3>for those of you who think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>socio-cultural,</v>

2125
01:47:59.730 --> 01:48:02.130
<v Speaker 3>which it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2126
01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:03.810
<v Speaker 3>but there's reasons for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2127
01:48:03.811 --> 01:48:08.811
<v Speaker 3>I didn't also at puberty when men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men and women start to become sexually </v>

2128
01:48:08.811 --> 01:48:11.370
<v Speaker 3>dimorphic in terms of size and men are </v>
<v Speaker 3>way more powerful in their upper bodies.</v>

2129
01:48:11.490 --> 01:48:16.490
<v Speaker 3>It's in comparatively more powerful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that makes them a lot more dangerous </v>

2130
01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:20.031
<v Speaker 3>and human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The human primary human defense </v>

2131
01:48:20.031 --> 01:48:21.990
<v Speaker 3>mechanism is punching like with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kangaroos for because there's some other</v>

2132
01:48:21.991 --> 01:48:24.300
<v Speaker 3>animals that punch chimps can punch too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but human beings,</v>

2133
01:48:24.301 --> 01:48:29.301
<v Speaker 3>it's a punch and most of the forest and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that his upper body and shoulder and so </v>

2134
01:48:29.301 --> 01:48:31.560
<v Speaker 3>a woman's no match for a man in a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she has every reason to be nervous,</v>

2135
01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:36.680
<v Speaker 3>especially when you add that to that her</v>
<v Speaker 3>additional sexual vulnerability and the </v>

2136
01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:37.800
<v Speaker 3>fact that she has to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily dependent.</v>

2137
01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Infants were extremely fragile for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very long period of time and so she had </v>

2138
01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:44.790
<v Speaker 3>every and women are more self conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>than man.</v>

2139
01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.740
<v Speaker 3>The empirical literature on that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>clear.</v>

2140
01:48:46.890 --> 01:48:51.890
<v Speaker 3>It's associated with trait neuroticism </v>
<v Speaker 3>because self consciousness is actually </v>

2141
01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:53.010
<v Speaker 3>an unpleasant emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who wants to be self conscious?</v>

2142
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:55.500
<v Speaker 3>If I'm self conscious on the stage </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to you,</v>

2143
01:48:55.501 --> 01:48:57.150
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden I can't even talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>

2144
01:48:57.330 --> 01:49:02.330
<v Speaker 3>All I'm doing is thinking about me in </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the things that are wrong with me </v>

2145
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:03.020
<v Speaker 3>and I fall inside myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like selfconsciousness,</v>

2146
01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:05.850
<v Speaker 3>although it's a great gift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say is nothing pleasant.</v>

2147
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.010
<v Speaker 3>It's associated primarily with anxiety.</v>

2148
01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:13.500
<v Speaker 3>So we've had every reason to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to the snake,</v>

2149
01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:17.130
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I read this week that among,</v>

2150
01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:19.080
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember which tribesmen at </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it was,</v>

2151
01:49:19.081 --> 01:49:24.081
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I did put a footnote in my new </v>

2152
01:49:24.081 --> 01:49:24.081
<v Speaker 3>book about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2153
01:49:24.081 --> 01:49:29.020
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these were jungle dwelling tribal </v>

2154
01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:32.451
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five percent of the adults had been </v>

2155
01:49:32.451 --> 01:49:35.061
<v Speaker 3>attacked by a python and a substantial </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of children had been killed by </v>

2156
01:49:35.061 --> 01:49:36.840
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So snake predation was no joke.</v>

2157
01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:41.220
<v Speaker 3>It's shaped our evolutionary past and </v>
<v Speaker 3>still is no joke in many places.</v>

2158
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:44.010
<v Speaker 3>And so we're attuned to snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is,</v>

2159
01:49:44.250 --> 01:49:46.680
<v Speaker 3>as Lynn has bell pointed out now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anthropologists,</v>

2160
01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:50.410
<v Speaker 3>we got really good at detecting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>camouflage patterns of snakes,</v>

2161
01:49:50.411 --> 01:49:53.410
<v Speaker 3>especially in the lower half of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>visual field.</v>

2162
01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:57.400
<v Speaker 3>And there's evidence that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason that human beings have such acute</v>

2163
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:59.980
<v Speaker 3>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means that our eyes opened,</v>

2164
01:49:59.981 --> 01:50:01.960
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because we were,</v>

2165
01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:07.440
<v Speaker 3>we call evolved with snakes and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned how to see them and then the </v>

2166
01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:11.161
<v Speaker 3>price we paid for seeing was that our </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain grew because you need a lot of </v>

2167
01:50:11.161 --> 01:50:12.040
<v Speaker 3>brain to be able to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the consequence of our brain growing</v>

2168
01:50:12.041 --> 01:50:17.041
<v Speaker 3>is one day we woke up and discovered the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future and the future is where all the </v>

2169
01:50:17.041 --> 01:50:18.400
<v Speaker 3>snakes might live instead of where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>live right now.</v>

2170
01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:25.750
<v Speaker 3>So there's that same thing in the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So interesting.</v>

2171
01:50:25.751 --> 01:50:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these images you see in this one,</v>

2172
01:50:28.810 --> 01:50:33.810
<v Speaker 3>you have the specter of death in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree with the snake and the fruit and </v>

2173
01:50:33.810 --> 01:50:37.290
<v Speaker 3>fruit is interesting to already make the</v>
<v Speaker 3>case that there's a tight linkage </v>

2174
01:50:37.290 --> 01:50:38.560
<v Speaker 3>between what you eat and information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2175
01:50:38.561 --> 01:50:40.480
<v Speaker 3>A conceptual link as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>practical link.</v>

2176
01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:42.790
<v Speaker 3>But it's also the case that we can see </v>
<v Speaker 3>colors.</v>

2177
01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:48.540
<v Speaker 3>And the question is why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is because we evolved to </v>

2178
01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:49.570
<v Speaker 3>see ripe fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the story of Adam and Eve,</v>

2179
01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:54.630
<v Speaker 3>human beings are given vision by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>snake and the fruit and that turns out </v>

2180
01:50:54.630 --> 01:50:56.500
<v Speaker 3>to be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So isn't that something?</v>

2181
01:50:56.620 --> 01:51:01.620
<v Speaker 3>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what role do women play in relationship </v>

2182
01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:01.620
<v Speaker 3>to men?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2183
01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:03.460
<v Speaker 3>first they make themselves conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's not ever forget about that because</v>

2184
01:51:03.461 --> 01:51:08.461
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say the primary role that women </v>

2185
01:51:08.461 --> 01:51:08.461
<v Speaker 3>have in relationship to men is to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>them self conscious.</v>

2186
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:13.470
<v Speaker 3>And men don't precisely like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that will make a man </v>

2187
01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:15.250
<v Speaker 3>more self conscious than being rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why?</v>

2188
01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Because why is he rejected?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2189
01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:21.940
<v Speaker 3>obviously mother nature in the guise of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that particular woman has said,</v>

2190
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:27.390
<v Speaker 3>you're not so bad for a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no reason that your genetic </v>

2191
01:51:27.390 --> 01:51:27.400
<v Speaker 3>material should propagate itself into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>

2192
01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:33.770
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2193
01:51:33.771 --> 01:51:36.060
<v Speaker 3>and it's not like men are exactly happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>about being made,</v>

2194
01:51:36.210 --> 01:51:38.300
<v Speaker 3>made self conscious by women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2195
01:51:38.301 --> 01:51:43.301
<v Speaker 3>It's a major source of continual tension</v>
<v Speaker 3>between men and women and it's no </v>

2196
01:51:43.301 --> 01:51:46.781
<v Speaker 3>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the case and this is </v>

2197
01:51:46.781 --> 01:51:46.781
<v Speaker 3>something really cool and interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

2198
01:51:46.781 --> 01:51:47.850
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do,</v>

2199
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:50.750
<v Speaker 3>you've divulged dive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>divulged,</v>

2200
01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:52.160
<v Speaker 3>die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2201
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:57.430
<v Speaker 3>That's it diverged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We diverged from the common ancestor </v>

2202
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:58.790
<v Speaker 3>between us and chimpanzees about 6 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million years ago.</v>

2203
01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Here's why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in part,</v>

2204
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:03.530
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzee females are non discriminant </v>
<v Speaker 3>maters.</v>

2205
01:52:03.710 --> 01:52:06.950
<v Speaker 3>They'll mate with any mail when they go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into heat,</v>

2206
01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:12.010
<v Speaker 3>which human females don't when they go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into heat than any male is allowed </v>

2207
01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:18.280
<v Speaker 3>access.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the dominant males chased the </v>

2208
01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:20.801
<v Speaker 3>subordinate males away and so the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominant males are more likely to leave </v>

2209
01:52:20.801 --> 01:52:23.861
<v Speaker 3>offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not because of the female </v>

2210
01:52:23.861 --> 01:52:23.861
<v Speaker 3>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the case with human beings.</v>

2211
01:52:23.861 --> 01:52:26.290
<v Speaker 3>Human females engage in hyper and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypoglycemia is the,</v>

2212
01:52:26.330 --> 01:52:31.330
<v Speaker 3>and this is also true cross culturally </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's also quite as extensive in </v>

2213
01:52:31.731 --> 01:52:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Scandinavia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not quite.</v>

2214
01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:34.640
<v Speaker 3>There's a bit of attenuation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not much.</v>

2215
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:37.370
<v Speaker 3>Women mate across and up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dominance hierarchies,</v>

2216
01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:40.080
<v Speaker 3>manmade across and down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2217
01:52:40.081 --> 01:52:45.081
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that has to be the case because it </v>

2218
01:52:45.081 --> 01:52:45.081
<v Speaker 3>obviously has to work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If one goes up,</v>

2219
01:52:45.081 --> 01:52:49.871
<v Speaker 3>the has to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The socioeconomic status of a woman is </v>

2220
01:52:49.871 --> 01:52:53.780
<v Speaker 3>almost determined almost zero of her </v>
<v Speaker 3>attractiveness towards a man.</v>

2221
01:52:54.230 --> 01:52:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the socioeconomic status of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>man is a major determinant of his </v>

2222
01:52:59.230 --> 01:53:01.010
<v Speaker 3>attractiveness towards a woman and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't as well either because that's been</v>

2223
01:53:01.011 --> 01:53:06.011
<v Speaker 3>tested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's his capacity to generate and be </v>

2224
01:53:06.011 --> 01:53:07.910
<v Speaker 3>productive and to share because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>beats the hell out of wealth.</v>

2225
01:53:07.970 --> 01:53:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Wealth can disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2226
01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:11.690
<v Speaker 3>but the capacity to be productive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>share,</v>

2227
01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:14.960
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a much more important element and</v>

2228
01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:20.020
<v Speaker 3>why not be chosen on the basis of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially because women have to have </v>

2229
01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:22.991
<v Speaker 3>infants and infants make the women </v>
<v Speaker 3>dependent and the woman is just looking </v>

2230
01:53:22.991 --> 01:53:27.281
<v Speaker 3>logically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rationally and from an evolutionary </v>

2231
01:53:27.281 --> 01:53:28.300
<v Speaker 3>perspective for someone who is useful </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to give a hint to lend a hand.</v>

2232
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.690
<v Speaker 3>So women make intense demands on men and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's no wonder,</v>

2233
01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:36.440
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is is that because women </v>
<v Speaker 3>engaged in hyperglycemia,</v>

2234
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:41.470
<v Speaker 3>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we diverge quite rapidly from </v>

2235
01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:43.901
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzees because the selection </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure that women placed on men </v>

2236
01:53:43.901 --> 01:53:48.160
<v Speaker 3>develop the entire species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's two things that happened as </v>

2237
01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:48.980
<v Speaker 3>far as I could tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The men competed for competence,</v>

2238
01:53:48.981 --> 01:53:53.981
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the male hierarchy is a mechanism </v>

2239
01:53:53.981 --> 01:53:55.670
<v Speaker 3>that pushes the best man to the top </v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually by definition,</v>

2240
01:53:55.970 --> 01:54:00.970
<v Speaker 3>and then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the effect of that is multiplied </v>

2241
01:54:00.970 --> 01:54:04.361
<v Speaker 3>by the fact that women who are Pergamon </v>
<v Speaker 3>as peel from the top and so that the </v>

2242
01:54:04.361 --> 01:54:08.111
<v Speaker 3>males who are the most competent are </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more likely to leave offspring and </v>

2243
01:54:08.111 --> 01:54:09.860
<v Speaker 3>that seemed to be what drove our </v>
<v Speaker 3>cortical expansion,</v>

2244
01:54:09.861 --> 01:54:10.970
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which happened very,</v>

2245
01:54:10.971 --> 01:54:13.130
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly over the course of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary time.</v>

2246
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:18.350
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when the woman saw that the tree was</v>

2247
01:54:18.351 --> 01:54:23.351
<v Speaker 3>good for food and that it was pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the eyes and a tree to be desired to </v>

2248
01:54:23.351 --> 01:54:27.911
<v Speaker 3>make one wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she took of the fruit thereof and did </v>

2249
01:54:27.911 --> 01:54:28.760
<v Speaker 3>eat and gave also unto her husband with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

2250
01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:30.080
<v Speaker 3>And he did eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

2251
01:54:30.081 --> 01:54:34.010
<v Speaker 3>And women share food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very strange thing because most</v>

2252
01:54:34.190 --> 01:54:35.300
<v Speaker 3>creatures don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2253
01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:37.220
<v Speaker 3>Most animals don't share food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>

2254
01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:39.350
<v Speaker 3>if you're a wolf and you bring down </v>
<v Speaker 3>something in a hunt,</v>

2255
01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:42.830
<v Speaker 3>you eat your fill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dominant creatures eat their fill.</v>

2256
01:54:42.831 --> 01:54:45.040
<v Speaker 3>And then if there's some leftover,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this subordinate t too,</v>

2257
01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:47.870
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't how human beings work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We share food.</v>

2258
01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:53.200
<v Speaker 3>Now you can imagine how that evolved </v>
<v Speaker 3>because lots of female creature share </v>

2259
01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:54.200
<v Speaker 3>food with their offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

2260
01:54:54.201 --> 01:54:59.201
<v Speaker 3>You don't need much of a twist in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>from an evolutionary perspective until </v>

2261
01:54:59.201 --> 01:55:00.260
<v Speaker 3>you start to share food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only with your offspring say,</v>

2262
01:55:00.261 --> 01:55:03.050
<v Speaker 3>but with your mate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's another way that you entice a</v>

2263
01:55:03.051 --> 01:55:08.051
<v Speaker 3>mate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're going to be better </v>

2264
01:55:08.051 --> 01:55:08.051
<v Speaker 3>together than alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2265
01:55:08.051 --> 01:55:08.180
<v Speaker 3>that's the offering of the fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2266
01:55:08.181 --> 01:55:09.530
<v Speaker 3>what's the self conscious part?</v>

2267
01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's part of the bargain.</v>

2268
01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:16.660
<v Speaker 3>You know I'm going to wake you up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>partly I'm going to wake you up because </v>

2269
01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:20.231
<v Speaker 3>you need to be woken up because I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>this infant that needs some damn care </v>

2270
01:55:20.231 --> 01:55:23.090
<v Speaker 3>and so you bloody well better be awake </v>
<v Speaker 3>and part of the bargain is all offer you</v>

2271
01:55:23.091 --> 01:55:25.580
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll offer you some food and in response</v>

2272
01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:28.040
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make a team and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the deal.</v>

2273
01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:33.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the human deal and that's why </v>

2274
01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:35.021
<v Speaker 3>we're more or less monogamous by why we </v>
<v Speaker 3>more or less pair of bond and why </v>

2275
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:38.210
<v Speaker 3>something approximating marriage is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human universal.</v>

2276
01:55:38.630 --> 01:55:40.970
<v Speaker 3>It's cross cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you can find exceptions,</v>

2277
01:55:40.971 --> 01:55:42.950
<v Speaker 3>but who the hell cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vast,</v>

2278
01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:44.610
<v Speaker 3>really man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>

2279
01:55:45.070 --> 01:55:49.050
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the vast pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vast pattern,</v>

2280
01:55:49.051 --> 01:55:54.051
<v Speaker 3>while in the price we pay for having </v>
<v Speaker 3>large brains is that we are very </v>

2281
01:55:54.051 --> 01:55:54.870
<v Speaker 3>dependent and it takes a long time for </v>
<v Speaker 3>us to get programmed and because of that</v>

2282
01:55:55.080 --> 01:56:00.080
<v Speaker 3>we need relatively stable family bonding</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's basically what we've evolved </v>

2283
01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:04.910
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get that without making men </v>

2284
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:05.880
<v Speaker 3>self conscious because male creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not impregnate and run?</v>

2285
01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:08.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean why the hell not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's something to really,</v>

2286
01:56:08.821 --> 01:56:10.890
<v Speaker 3>no kidding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's the thing to think about.</v>

2287
01:56:11.070 --> 01:56:13.380
<v Speaker 3>It is not why men abandoned their </v>
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

2288
01:56:13.381 --> 01:56:17.400
<v Speaker 3>That's the mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's why any men ever stick with them.</v>

2289
01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:22.970
<v Speaker 3>That's the mystery because you just have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to look at the animal kingdom and the </v>

2290
01:56:22.970 --> 01:56:24.660
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The simplest and easiest thing is always</v>

2291
01:56:24.661 --> 01:56:28.770
<v Speaker 3>the most likely thing to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the exception.</v>

2292
01:56:28.771 --> 01:56:30.900
<v Speaker 3>That longterm commitment that needs </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation.</v>

2293
01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:37.340
<v Speaker 3>She took of the fruit thereof and did </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat and gave also unto her husband with </v>

2294
01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:38.850
<v Speaker 3>her and he did eat the eyes of both of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them were opened.</v>

2295
01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:43.440
<v Speaker 3>Implying that before that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>closed and they knew they were naked and</v>

2296
01:56:43.441 --> 01:56:45.720
<v Speaker 3>they sewed fig leaves together and made </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves aprons.</v>

2297
01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:47.910
<v Speaker 3>So that's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So their eyes are open,</v>

2298
01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.890
<v Speaker 3>which indicates that they weren't to </v>
<v Speaker 3>begin with.</v>

2299
01:56:49.891 --> 01:56:54.891
<v Speaker 3>So whatever God created to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 3>was kind of blind in but not blind in </v>

2300
01:56:54.891 --> 01:56:57.060
<v Speaker 3>some strange way because they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously wanting to run into garden,</v>

2301
01:56:57.061 --> 01:56:58.110
<v Speaker 3>bumping into trees.</v>

2302
01:56:58.350 --> 01:57:03.350
<v Speaker 3>It was some sort of metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 3>blindness that's been removed by </v>

2303
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:04.560
<v Speaker 3>whatever has just happened and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever's just happened.</v>

2304
01:57:04.561 --> 01:57:06.300
<v Speaker 3>Also made them realize that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>naked.</v>

2305
01:57:06.570 --> 01:57:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what sort of eye opening is that?</v>

2306
01:57:08.910 --> 01:57:13.910
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean to realize that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>naked means to realize that you're </v>

2307
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:16.110
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what people discovered.</v>

2308
01:57:16.111 --> 01:57:17.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2309
01:57:17.790 --> 01:57:22.790
<v Speaker 3>we can be hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're a zebra in a herd of zebras </v>

2310
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:24.600
<v Speaker 3>and there's a bunch of lions around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're laying on the grass.</v>

2311
01:57:24.690 --> 01:57:28.380
<v Speaker 3>You don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are laying down lions,</v>

2312
01:57:28.530 --> 01:57:33.530
<v Speaker 3>laying down lines or no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It standing up hunting lions that are </v>

2313
01:57:33.530 --> 01:57:37.071
<v Speaker 3>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not smart enough to figure out </v>

2314
01:57:37.071 --> 01:57:37.260
<v Speaker 3>that laying down lines turn into </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing up hunting lions,</v>

2315
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:40.620
<v Speaker 3>so you're not building a fort to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lions out.</v>

2316
01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:44.160
<v Speaker 3>You're just mindlessly eating grass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not very awake,</v>

2317
01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:49.340
<v Speaker 3>but that's not what happens to human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings is they wake up and they think </v>

2318
01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:49.340
<v Speaker 3>we're vulnerable permanently.</v>

2319
01:57:49.650 --> 01:57:51.810
<v Speaker 3>It's never going away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2320
01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:57.020
<v Speaker 3>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the recognition of that internal </v>

2321
01:57:57.020 --> 01:57:57.150
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>

2322
01:57:57.151 --> 01:57:58.860
<v Speaker 3>The first thing they do is clothe </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

2323
01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens when you're naked?</v>

2324
01:58:01.081 --> 01:58:03.180
<v Speaker 3>When you need protection from the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>will obviously.</v>

2325
01:58:03.390 --> 01:58:04.950
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all wearing clothes.</v>

2326
01:58:05.190 --> 01:58:07.710
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2327
01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:10.320
<v Speaker 3>we've been doing that for a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very long period of time.</v>

2328
01:58:10.321 --> 01:58:12.240
<v Speaker 3>It's tens of thousands of years at </v>
<v Speaker 3>minimum.</v>

2329
01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:15.510
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can track more or less when clothing</v>

2330
01:58:15.511 --> 01:58:19.140
<v Speaker 3>developed because you can do DNA testing</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the kind of life that cleaned clothes</v>

2331
01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:24.300
<v Speaker 3>rather than heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have a pretty good idea of when </v>

2332
01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:25.080
<v Speaker 3>clothing emerged and have different </v>
<v Speaker 3>types as well,</v>

2333
01:58:25.110 --> 01:58:30.110
<v Speaker 3>so that's quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point is they're naked and they </v>

2334
01:58:30.110 --> 01:58:31.320
<v Speaker 3>think that's not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're vulnerable so their eyes were open</v>

2335
01:58:31.321 --> 01:58:36.321
<v Speaker 3>enough so they become self conscious and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they recognize their own vulnerability </v>

2336
01:58:36.321 --> 01:58:38.400
<v Speaker 3>and the first thing they do is the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>step of culture is to protect themselves</v>

2337
01:58:38.401 --> 01:58:41.950
<v Speaker 3>with something from the world and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>protect yourself from the world and from</v>

2338
01:58:41.951 --> 01:58:43.390
<v Speaker 3>the prying eyes of other people.</v>

2339
01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:49.860
<v Speaker 3>This is the book by Lynn Bell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why we see so well from the temptation </v>

2340
01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:51.130
<v Speaker 3>of eve to the venomous murder of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mighty thor.</v>

2341
01:58:51.131 --> 01:58:56.131
<v Speaker 3>The serpent appears throughout time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture as a figure of mischief and </v>

2342
01:58:56.131 --> 01:58:59.200
<v Speaker 3>mystery misery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worldwide prominence of snakes in </v>

2343
01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:02.251
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>myth and foreclosure underscores our </v>

2344
01:59:02.251 --> 01:59:02.251
<v Speaker 3>deep connection to the serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>

2345
01:59:02.251 --> 01:59:03.880
<v Speaker 3>When so few of us have firsthand </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2346
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:10.030
<v Speaker 3>The surprising answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this book suggests lies in the singular </v>

2347
01:59:10.030 --> 01:59:12.550
<v Speaker 3>effect of snakes on primate evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Predation pressure from snakes,</v>

2348
01:59:12.551 --> 01:59:17.551
<v Speaker 3>Lynn is tells us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is ultimately responsible for this </v>

2349
01:59:17.551 --> 01:59:20.261
<v Speaker 3>superior vision and large brain of </v>
<v Speaker 3>primates and for a critical aspect of </v>

2350
01:59:20.261 --> 01:59:22.060
<v Speaker 3>human evolution that was tested </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>

2351
01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:27.420
<v Speaker 3>Psychologists have known for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people are can learn fear to </v>

2352
01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:28.480
<v Speaker 3>snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they discovered in primates recently</v>

2353
01:59:28.481 --> 01:59:29.830
<v Speaker 3>a set of neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul Dinner,</v>

2354
01:59:29.831 --> 01:59:34.090
<v Speaker 3>neural neurons which are specialized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an old,</v>

2355
01:59:34.150 --> 01:59:39.150
<v Speaker 3>old perceptual systems revealed </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurobiological evidence of past </v>

2356
01:59:39.150 --> 01:59:42.430
<v Speaker 3>selection for rapid detection of snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's from 2013,</v>

2357
01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:45.340
<v Speaker 3>so the snake definitely woke us up.</v>

2358
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:50.440
<v Speaker 3>Color Vision as an adaptation to fruit </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating in primates.</v>

2359
01:59:50.890 --> 01:59:54.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not by accident that women make </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves look like ripe fruit in order</v>

2360
01:59:54.521 --> 01:59:57.010
<v Speaker 3>to be attractive to men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2361
01:59:57.640 --> 02:00:00.280
<v Speaker 3>And that's also not socio-cultural in </v>
<v Speaker 3>origin.</v>

2362
02:00:00.850 --> 02:00:04.630
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they heard the voice of the Lord God</v>

2363
02:00:04.631 --> 02:00:06.460
<v Speaker 3>walking in the garden in the cool of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

2364
02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:11.760
<v Speaker 3>and Adam and his wife hid themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the presence of the Lord God </v>

2365
02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:12.040
<v Speaker 3>amongst the trees of the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

2366
02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:18.120
<v Speaker 3>So what's the implication prior to being</v>
<v Speaker 3>woken up prior to recognizing nakedness </v>

2367
02:00:18.941 --> 02:00:21.850
<v Speaker 3>and vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no reason for God,</v>

2368
02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:26.880
<v Speaker 3>for man and woman to hide from God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now where they're hiding from God while </v>

2369
02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:27.790
<v Speaker 3>they're naked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're vulnerable.</v>

2370
02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:29.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so think about this.</v>

2371
02:00:29.291 --> 02:00:34.291
<v Speaker 3>Think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like imagine that you have the </v>

2372
02:00:34.291 --> 02:00:37.170
<v Speaker 3>capacity to live truthfully and </v>
<v Speaker 3>courageously and forthrightly.</v>

2373
02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:41.970
<v Speaker 3>Just imagine that and then imagine why </v>
<v Speaker 3>you might not do that and then imagined,</v>

2374
02:00:42.150 --> 02:00:43.510
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about fear and shame?</v>

2375
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:44.740
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would that work?</v>

2376
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that the idea of living </v>

2377
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.131
<v Speaker 3>forthright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee and truthfully and courageously is </v>

2378
02:00:53.131 --> 02:00:56.251
<v Speaker 3>analogous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given what we already know about these </v>

2379
02:00:56.251 --> 02:00:56.251
<v Speaker 3>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to walking with God in the garden.</v>

2380
02:00:56.251 --> 02:00:56.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what stops people from doing that?</v>

2381
02:00:56.981 --> 02:00:59.140
<v Speaker 3>What stops people from hiding?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2382
02:00:59.141 --> 02:01:01.690
<v Speaker 3>it's their own rates or recognition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own inadequacy.</v>

2383
02:01:01.691 --> 02:01:06.430
<v Speaker 3>They look at themselves and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how in the world is a creature cinches I</v>

2384
02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:11.700
<v Speaker 3>supposed to live properly in this world </v>
<v Speaker 3>with everything that's wrong with me,</v>

2385
02:01:12.250 --> 02:01:13.810
<v Speaker 3>and so what do you hide from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2386
02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:16.360
<v Speaker 3>you go home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sit on your bed for five minutes and</v>

2387
02:01:16.361 --> 02:01:18.520
<v Speaker 3>ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what have you hidden from in your life?</v>

2388
02:01:18.730 --> 02:01:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll have books of knowledge reveal </v>

2389
02:01:23.730 --> 02:01:23.730
<v Speaker 3>themselves to you and your imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2390
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:24.250
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2391
02:01:24.251 --> 02:01:25.840
<v Speaker 3>why are you hiding?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2392
02:01:25.841 --> 02:01:29.380
<v Speaker 3>it's no wonder you're hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no wonder that people hide.</v>

2393
02:01:29.530 --> 02:01:31.780
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that's so terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this story.</v>

2394
02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:33.910
<v Speaker 3>We woke up and we thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2395
02:01:33.911 --> 02:01:35.890
<v Speaker 3>look at this place like this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

2396
02:01:36.250 --> 02:01:41.250
<v Speaker 3>There's some serious trouble here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in some serious trouble and we're </v>

2397
02:01:41.250 --> 02:01:42.920
<v Speaker 3>not what we could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we hide and that's what the story</v>

2398
02:01:42.921 --> 02:01:44.060
<v Speaker 3>says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People woke up,</v>

2399
02:01:44.061 --> 02:01:49.061
<v Speaker 3>they became self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They recognized their own vulnerability </v>

2400
02:01:49.061 --> 02:01:52.300
<v Speaker 3>and that made the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Made them hide from manifesting their </v>

2401
02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:52.400
<v Speaker 3>divine destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2402
02:01:52.401 --> 02:01:53.600
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly right,</v>

2403
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:58.870
<v Speaker 3>and the Lord God there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love this part of the story and it's </v>

2404
02:01:58.870 --> 02:02:00.230
<v Speaker 3>so funny and the Lord God called and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could use a little humor at this point,</v>

2405
02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:04.670
<v Speaker 3>and the Lord God called Unto Adam and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said unto him where Art Thou?</v>

2406
02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:10.360
<v Speaker 3>And Adam said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard that voice in the garden and I </v>

2407
02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:12.770
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was afraid because I was naked.</v>

2408
02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:14.630
<v Speaker 3>So in case there was any doubt about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2409
02:02:14.631 --> 02:02:19.631
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I hid myself and God said,</v>

2410
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:30.310
<v Speaker 3>who told you that you were naked?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you eat of the tree whereof I </v>

2411
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:35.231
<v Speaker 3>commanded you that you should not eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is where Adam shows himself in </v>

2412
02:02:35.231 --> 02:02:38.090
<v Speaker 3>all his post fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heroic glory.</v>

2413
02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:42.590
<v Speaker 3>And the man said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the woman</v>

2414
02:02:51.110 --> 02:02:56.110
<v Speaker 3>whom now gave us to be with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she gave me of the tree and I did eat.</v>

2415
02:02:56.750 --> 02:03:00.170
<v Speaker 3>So that set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that set that it's so,</v>

2416
02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:01.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2417
02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:07.120
<v Speaker 3>there's a modern feminist interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the story of Adam and eve that makes </v>

2418
02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:11.891
<v Speaker 3>the claim that eve was portrayed as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universal bad guy of humanity for </v>

2419
02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:15.350
<v Speaker 3>disobeying God and eating the Apple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2420
02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:16.820
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2421
02:03:17.290 --> 02:03:22.290
<v Speaker 3>it looks like she slipped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then she tempted her husband and you </v>

2422
02:03:22.290 --> 02:03:23.360
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes her even worse.</v>

2423
02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Although he's was foolish enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately eat.</v>

2424
02:03:26.931 --> 02:03:31.931
<v Speaker 3>So it just means she was a little more </v>
<v Speaker 3>courageous than him then got there </v>

2425
02:03:31.931 --> 02:03:32.690
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's Adam who comes across as really</v>

2426
02:03:32.691 --> 02:03:35.500
<v Speaker 3>one sad creature in this story as far as</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned about.</v>

2427
02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:37.790
<v Speaker 3>He manages in one sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2428
02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:39.410
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't him.</v>

2429
02:03:39.411 --> 02:03:42.410
<v Speaker 3>It was the woman and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can even blames God.</v>

2430
02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:48.240
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just the woman who was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was that woman and you gave her to </v>

2431
02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:48.240
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2432
02:03:49.890 --> 02:03:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Then she gave me of the tree and I did </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat.</v>

2433
02:03:51.721 --> 02:03:52.860
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so hay Adams,</v>

2434
02:03:52.861 --> 02:03:57.861
<v Speaker 3>all innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except now he's not only is he naked and</v>

2435
02:03:58.110 --> 02:04:03.110
<v Speaker 3>disobedient and cowardly and ashamed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's also sniffily backbiting.</v>

2436
02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Think he writes her out like the second </v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets the opportunity and then he </v>

2437
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:12.390
<v Speaker 3>blames God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2438
02:04:12.391 --> 02:04:14.460
<v Speaker 3>and that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right,</v>

2439
02:04:14.461 --> 02:04:16.470
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go online and you read,</v>

2440
02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:21.860
<v Speaker 3>you read the commentary that men write </v>
<v Speaker 3>about women when they're resentful and </v>

2441
02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:21.990
<v Speaker 3>bitter about women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You read it.</v>

2442
02:04:21.991 --> 02:04:23.250
<v Speaker 3>It's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2443
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:25.530
<v Speaker 3>it's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's those bitches.</v>

2444
02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:27.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

2445
02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:28.650
<v Speaker 3>It's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's them.</v>

2446
02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:31.290
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are bloody world,</v>

2447
02:04:31.291 --> 02:04:34.500
<v Speaker 3>this is in which they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly the same thing.</v>

2448
02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:38.910
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly the same thing and it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely pathetic.</v>

2449
02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:40.110
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2450
02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:51.700
<v Speaker 1>and the Lord God said unto the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this that thou has done?</v>

2451
02:04:51.701 --> 02:04:56.701
<v Speaker 1>And the woman said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the serpent beguiled me and I did eat </v>

2452
02:04:56.701 --> 02:04:56.701
<v Speaker 1>while he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has a bloody excuse.</v>

2453
02:04:56.701 --> 02:04:57.910
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a snake.</v>

2454
02:04:57.911 --> 02:04:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things aren't.</v>

2455
02:04:58.810 --> 02:05:03.810
<v Speaker 1>We already found out there is subtle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>second it turns out that the damn snake </v>

2456
02:05:03.810 --> 02:05:04.660
<v Speaker 1>is Satan himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2457
02:05:04.661 --> 02:05:09.661
<v Speaker 1>when he's rather treacherous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that she got tangled up in </v>

2458
02:05:09.661 --> 02:05:10.510
<v Speaker 1>his mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

2459
02:05:10.630 --> 02:05:15.630
<v Speaker 1>is well problematic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot better excuse that Adam </v>

2460
02:05:15.851 --> 02:05:19.240
<v Speaker 1>has and the Lord God says unto the </v>
<v Speaker 1>serpent,</v>

2461
02:05:19.241 --> 02:05:24.241
<v Speaker 1>because thou has done done this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cursed above all cattle and above every </v>

2462
02:05:24.241 --> 02:05:28.201
<v Speaker 1>beast of the field upon thy belly shalt </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll go and dust shalt thou eat all </v>

2463
02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>the days of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And snakes by the way,</v>

2464
02:05:32.111 --> 02:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>are lizards that lost their legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know.</v>

2465
02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:41.400
<v Speaker 1>And I will put enmity between the and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman and between thy seed and her </v>

2466
02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:45.811
<v Speaker 1>seed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt </v>

2467
02:05:45.811 --> 02:05:46.780
<v Speaker 1>bruise his heel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love these pictures.</v>

2468
02:05:46.781 --> 02:05:48.160
<v Speaker 1>They're so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2469
02:05:49.030 --> 02:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>strip the religious context from them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just look at them for a second.</v>

2470
02:05:53.530 --> 02:05:58.530
<v Speaker 1>What do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the eternal mother holding her </v>

2471
02:05:58.530 --> 02:06:02.740
<v Speaker 1>infant away from the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See it down there,</v>

2472
02:06:04.210 --> 02:06:07.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crocodile snake.</v>

2473
02:06:09.070 --> 02:06:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Everything predatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been after us for like 60 million</v>

2474
02:06:11.950 --> 02:06:16.950
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason we're here is because of </v>

2475
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.950
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's a sacred image.</v>

2476
02:06:18.370 --> 02:06:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Now this one I like even better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See down there,</v>

2477
02:06:22.031 --> 02:06:27.031
<v Speaker 1>there's something like the moon and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this a reptile down there that </v>

2478
02:06:27.031 --> 02:06:27.050
<v Speaker 1>even standing on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really old.</v>

2479
02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I showed you this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's so cool.</v>

2480
02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:32.020
<v Speaker 1>She's coming out of this thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a hole in the sky,</v>

2481
02:06:32.021 --> 02:06:32.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it it.</v>

2482
02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:36.460
<v Speaker 1>It indicates the eternal presence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this figure.</v>

2483
02:06:36.461 --> 02:06:39.160
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eternal recurrence of this figure.</v>

2484
02:06:39.310 --> 02:06:42.070
<v Speaker 1>It's an archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the the,</v>

2485
02:06:42.410 --> 02:06:44.140
<v Speaker 1>the potential out of which she is </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging.</v>

2486
02:06:44.141 --> 02:06:49.141
<v Speaker 1>These are all musical instruments back </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and so what the artist is </v>

2487
02:06:49.141 --> 02:06:52.441
<v Speaker 1>representing is the great pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity of being and the emergence of</v>

2488
02:06:53.730 --> 02:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>of the protective mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From that background,</v>

2489
02:06:56.380 --> 02:06:59.470
<v Speaker 1>protecting the infant eternally against </v>
<v Speaker 1>predation.</v>

2490
02:07:00.010 --> 02:07:05.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can that not be a holy image if it </v>

2491
02:07:05.010 --> 02:07:05.010
<v Speaker 1>isn't the holy image?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think it's a holy image,</v>

2492
02:07:05.110 --> 02:07:06.700
<v Speaker 1>then there isn't something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the image.</v>

2493
02:07:07.550 --> 02:07:12.350
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceiver unto the woman.</v>

2494
02:07:12.351 --> 02:07:13.210
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2495
02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>God's just outlining the consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this right now.</v>

2496
02:07:15.890 --> 02:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2497
02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:18.560
<v Speaker 1>well now you've gone and done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've woken up.</v>

2498
02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:22.300
<v Speaker 1>This is what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will greatly multiply that Isaura.</v>

2499
02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:27.050
<v Speaker 1>When I conception in sorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thou shalt bring forth children and they</v>

2500
02:07:27.051 --> 02:07:30.120
<v Speaker 1>desire shall be to that husband and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>shall rule over thee.</v>

2501
02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Say he should says he will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why</v>

2502
02:07:36.210 --> 02:07:38.190
<v Speaker 1>in sorrow shall they'll bring forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

2503
02:07:38.970 --> 02:07:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you develop a brain that big so </v>

2504
02:07:43.970 --> 02:07:48.051
<v Speaker 1>that you can see it's not that easy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give birth anymore and then you produce </v>

2505
02:07:48.691 --> 02:07:53.691
<v Speaker 1>something that's dependent beyond belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the things that you </v>

2506
02:07:53.691 --> 02:07:58.131
<v Speaker 1>would say dooms you to precisely this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's eaves punishment for waking up</v>

2507
02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:05.060
<v Speaker 1>and Adam because thou has hearkened unto</v>
<v Speaker 1>the voice of thy wife and has eaten of </v>

2508
02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:05.700
<v Speaker 1>the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which I commanded thee,</v>

2509
02:08:05.701 --> 02:08:06.900
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thou shalt not eat it.</v>

2510
02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Cursed is the ground for thy Sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in sorrow shall thou eat of it in all </v>

2511
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:14.010
<v Speaker 1>the days of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

2512
02:08:14.190 --> 02:08:15.390
<v Speaker 1>The invention of work.</v>

2513
02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth</v>
<v Speaker 1>to thee and now shall eat the herb of </v>

2514
02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the invention of work.</v>

2515
02:08:22.580 --> 02:08:25.340
<v Speaker 1>What do people do that animals don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>

2516
02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:30.700
<v Speaker 1>What does work mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you sacrifice the present for </v>

2517
02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:33.731
<v Speaker 1>the future and why do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know you're vulnerable and </v>

2518
02:08:33.731 --> 02:08:37.541
<v Speaker 1>because you're awake and so from here on</v>
<v Speaker 1>end and from this point there's no </v>

2519
02:08:37.541 --> 02:08:41.321
<v Speaker 1>return to unconscious paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how many problems you've </v>

2520
02:08:41.321 --> 02:08:44.440
<v Speaker 1>solved so that today's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a lot of problems coming up </v>

2521
02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:48.160
<v Speaker 1>and no bloody matter how much you work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never going to work enough to solve </v>

2522
02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:51.371
<v Speaker 1>them and so all you're going to do from </v>
<v Speaker 1>here on in is be terrified of the </v>

2523
02:08:51.371 --> 02:08:54.761
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the price of waking up and </v>

2524
02:08:54.761 --> 02:08:57.401
<v Speaker 1>that's the end of paradise and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of history and that's how </v>

2525
02:08:57.401 --> 02:09:00.500
<v Speaker 1>that story goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this sweat of thy face,</v>

2526
02:09:00.501 --> 02:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>hell thou eat bread til thou return unto</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground,</v>

2527
02:09:03.091 --> 02:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>for out of it was taken for dust thou </v>
<v Speaker 1>art and unto Dust Thou shall return.</v>

2528
02:09:09.110 --> 02:09:12.900
<v Speaker 1>And Adam called his wife's name Eve </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she was the mother of all living</v>

2529
02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:20.960
<v Speaker 1>unto Adam also and unto his wife did the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord God make coats of skin and clothed </v>

2530
02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.230
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hunted William Blake by the way,</v>

2531
02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:24.180
<v Speaker 1>and the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God said,</v>

2532
02:09:24.690 --> 02:09:29.690
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man is become as one of us to know </v>

2533
02:09:29.690 --> 02:09:31.641
<v Speaker 1>good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now lest he put forth his hand and </v>

2534
02:09:31.641 --> 02:09:31.641
<v Speaker 1>take also of the tree of life and eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and live forever.</v>

2535
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:35.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll go over this again next week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

2536
02:09:35.681 --> 02:09:38.200
<v Speaker 1>the Lord God sent him from the fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth,</v>

2537
02:09:38.201 --> 02:09:40.600
<v Speaker 1>from the garden of Eden to till the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground from whence he was taken.</v>

2538
02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:44.320
<v Speaker 1>So he drove out the man and he placed at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims</v>

2539
02:09:44.980 --> 02:09:48.430
<v Speaker 1>and a flaming sword which turned every </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to keep the way of the tree of life.</v>

2540
02:10:01.650 --> 02:10:06.340
<v Speaker 1>One more thing and then we'll stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

2541
02:10:06.730 --> 02:10:11.730
<v Speaker 1>why in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Adam and eve are tempted by the </v>

2542
02:10:12.951 --> 02:10:13.970
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat the fruit,</v>

2543
02:10:13.971 --> 02:10:15.500
<v Speaker 1>they wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized they're naked.</v>

2544
02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:19.290
<v Speaker 1>They realize that they're vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They realized the future.</v>

2545
02:10:19.291 --> 02:10:21.900
<v Speaker 1>They realized they're gonna die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They realized that they have to work.</v>

2546
02:10:22.950 --> 02:10:27.950
<v Speaker 1>It counts for difficulty in conception </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fall of humankind from </v>

2547
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:29.040
<v Speaker 1>unconscious paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2548
02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:34.760
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the knowledge of good and </v>

2549
02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:34.760
<v Speaker 1>evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in</v>

2550
02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:38.980
<v Speaker 3>the world does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mesopotamians believed that human </v>

2551
02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:40.570
<v Speaker 3>beings were made out of the blood of </v>
<v Speaker 3>king,</v>

2552
02:10:40.571 --> 02:10:42.770
<v Speaker 3>knew who was the worst monster that </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

2553
02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was the goddess of chaos,</v>

2554
02:10:44.690 --> 02:10:49.690
<v Speaker 3>could imagine and then produce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So their idea was that whatever it was </v>

2555
02:10:49.690 --> 02:10:51.560
<v Speaker 3>about humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was something deeply,</v>

2556
02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:54.500
<v Speaker 3>deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply demonically flawed.</v>

2557
02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:02.960
<v Speaker 3>So that's their conception and the sound</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that same value that these stories </v>

2558
02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:07.401
<v Speaker 3>emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is opening your eyes and </v>

2559
02:11:07.401 --> 02:11:09.150
<v Speaker 3>realizing your vulnerability have to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the knowledge of good and evil.</v>

2560
02:11:09.370 --> 02:11:11.370
<v Speaker 3>And really I thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really thought about that.</v>

2561
02:11:11.371 --> 02:11:16.371
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought about that for like 20 years </v>

2562
02:11:16.371 --> 02:11:16.371
<v Speaker 3>because I knew there was something there</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I could not put together.</v>

2563
02:11:16.371 --> 02:11:19.170
<v Speaker 3>And at the same time I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading things.</v>

2564
02:11:19.410 --> 02:11:21.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tell you something truly </v>
<v Speaker 3>awful.</v>

2565
02:11:22.110 --> 02:11:23.780
<v Speaker 3>And so if you need a trigger warning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2566
02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:26.190
<v Speaker 3>you're getting one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And believe me,</v>

2567
02:11:26.370 --> 02:11:31.370
<v Speaker 3>I do not give trigger warnings lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to tell you something he </v>

2568
02:11:31.370 --> 02:11:32.620
<v Speaker 3>will never forget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is what unit seven,</v>

2569
02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:35.460
<v Speaker 3>31 used to do in China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And China is a Japanese unit.</v>

2570
02:11:35.461 --> 02:11:37.480
<v Speaker 3>During the Second World War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2571
02:11:37.590 --> 02:11:42.590
<v Speaker 3>and as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did the most horrific things that </v>

2572
02:11:42.590 --> 02:11:43.650
<v Speaker 3>were done to anyone during World War II </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's really something,</v>

2573
02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:49.220
<v Speaker 3>so this is what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took their prisoners and they would</v>

2574
02:11:50.971 --> 02:11:55.971
<v Speaker 3>put them in a position so that their </v>
<v Speaker 3>arms would freeze solid and then they </v>

2575
02:11:57.091 --> 02:12:02.091
<v Speaker 3>would take them outside and pour hot </v>
<v Speaker 3>water over their arms and then he would </v>

2576
02:12:02.101 --> 02:12:07.101
<v Speaker 3>repeat that until the flesh came off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bones and they were doing that to </v>

2577
02:12:07.101 --> 02:12:10.560
<v Speaker 3>investigate the treatment of frostbite </v>
<v Speaker 3>for soldiers.</v>

2578
02:12:11.490 --> 02:12:14.190
<v Speaker 3>Or you can look up unit seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>31 if you want to have nightmares.</v>

2579
02:12:15.090 --> 02:12:18.390
<v Speaker 3>So that's a unit seven slash 31.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's human beings.</v>

2580
02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Someone thought that up and then people </v>
<v Speaker 3>did it.</v>

2581
02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:26.590
<v Speaker 3>That's knowledge of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the,</v>

2582
02:12:26.650 --> 02:12:27.940
<v Speaker 3>here's the key,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2583
02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:33.610
<v Speaker 3>You know you're vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No other animal knows that you know what</v>

2584
02:12:33.611 --> 02:12:38.140
<v Speaker 3>hurts you because you're vulnerable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>now that you know what hurts you,</v>

2585
02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:41.650
<v Speaker 3>you can figure out what hurts someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

2586
02:12:42.580 --> 02:12:46.000
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as you know what hurts </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else and you can use that,</v>

2587
02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:48.850
<v Speaker 3>you have the knowledge of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2588
02:12:48.851 --> 02:12:53.851
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty good trick that the snake </v>
<v Speaker 3>pose because it doesn't look like it's </v>

2589
02:12:53.851 --> 02:12:56.671
<v Speaker 3>exactly the sort of thing that we might </v>
<v Speaker 3>have wanted if we would've known what </v>

2590
02:12:56.671 --> 02:12:59.611
<v Speaker 3>the consequence was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as soon as a human being as self </v>

2591
02:12:59.611 --> 02:13:00.100
<v Speaker 3>conscious and aware of his own </v>
<v Speaker 3>nakedness,</v>

2592
02:13:00.250 --> 02:13:05.250
<v Speaker 3>that he has the capacity for evil and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is introduced into the world right </v>

2593
02:13:05.250 --> 02:13:06.760
<v Speaker 3>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's the rest of the story.</v>

2594
02:13:08.290 --> 02:13:11.110
<v Speaker 3>So there's the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right in your some tree dwelling primate</v>

2595
02:13:11.111 --> 02:13:11.980
<v Speaker 3>in the snake eats you.</v>

2596
02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:13.750
<v Speaker 3>And that sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's like,</v>

2597
02:13:14.110 --> 02:13:16.420
<v Speaker 3>let's watch out for the damn snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you think,</v>

2598
02:13:16.421 --> 02:13:18.130
<v Speaker 3>well wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain grows and you think,</v>

2599
02:13:18.131 --> 02:13:19.210
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2600
02:13:19.211 --> 02:13:21.910
<v Speaker 3>there's not just snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's were snakes live.</v>

2601
02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:24.850
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we just get the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tree and go hunt down the snakes and</v>

2602
02:13:24.851 --> 02:13:29.851
<v Speaker 3>get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those are sort of like potential </v>

2603
02:13:29.851 --> 02:13:31.891
<v Speaker 3>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the snake becomes potential </v>

2604
02:13:31.891 --> 02:13:34.771
<v Speaker 3>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the same circuit that you're </v>

2605
02:13:34.771 --> 02:13:34.771
<v Speaker 3>using to do this thinking and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get rid of the damn snakes.</v>

2606
02:13:34.771 --> 02:13:37.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like St Patrick chases the mode of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ireland.</v>

2607
02:13:37.801 --> 02:13:39.690
<v Speaker 3>No more snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's paradise.</v>

2608
02:13:39.691 --> 02:13:40.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2609
02:13:40.561 --> 02:13:41.100
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2610
02:13:41.101 --> 02:13:42.600
<v Speaker 3>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not how it works.</v>

2611
02:13:42.601 --> 02:13:43.020
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2612
02:13:43.021 --> 02:13:45.810
<v Speaker 3>now you've got the human snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a tribe.</v>

2613
02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:50.960
<v Speaker 3>You've got tribal enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to defend yourself against </v>

2614
02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:51.450
<v Speaker 3>the human snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2615
02:13:51.451 --> 02:13:55.650
<v Speaker 3>So maybe your empire experience and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get rid of all the human snakes.</v>

2616
02:13:56.010 --> 02:13:57.600
<v Speaker 3>And then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2617
02:13:57.601 --> 02:13:59.400
<v Speaker 3>they start to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>develop inside.</v>

2618
02:13:59.401 --> 02:14:02.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like you get rid of all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>external enemies and you make a big city</v>

2619
02:14:02.791 --> 02:14:07.791
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden there's enemies that</v>
<v Speaker 3>pop up inside because the snake isn't </v>

2620
02:14:07.791 --> 02:14:12.261
<v Speaker 3>just the snake in the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this snake isn't just the possible </v>

2621
02:14:12.261 --> 02:14:12.261
<v Speaker 3>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the snake isn't just the snake.</v>

2622
02:14:12.261 --> 02:14:14.370
<v Speaker 3>That's your enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The snake is your friend,</v>

2623
02:14:16.130 --> 02:14:17.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because your friend can be true.</v>

2624
02:14:18.110 --> 02:14:21.590
<v Speaker 3>And then it's even worse than that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can be true to you.</v>

2625
02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:24.350
<v Speaker 3>And so even if you get rid of all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside snakes,</v>

2626
02:14:24.710 --> 02:14:28.220
<v Speaker 3>you've got an inside snake and God only </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows what it's up to.</v>

2627
02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:33.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's why the bloody Christians </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated the snake in the garden of </v>

2628
02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:37.751
<v Speaker 3>Eden with Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unbelievably brilliant because you </v>

2629
02:14:37.751 --> 02:14:40.140
<v Speaker 3>got to think what's the enemy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2630
02:14:40.250 --> 02:14:42.560
<v Speaker 3>the snake fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2631
02:14:42.561 --> 02:14:44.360
<v Speaker 3>that's good if you're a tree dwelling </v>
<v Speaker 3>primate.</v>

2632
02:14:44.570 --> 02:14:46.640
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a sophisticated human </v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

2633
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:51.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with 6 million years of additional </v>

2634
02:14:51.870 --> 02:14:52.820
<v Speaker 3>evolution and you're really trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>solve the problem of what it is,</v>

2635
02:14:52.821 --> 02:14:55.900
<v Speaker 3>that's the great enemy of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2636
02:14:55.901 --> 02:14:58.460
<v Speaker 3>it's the human propensity for evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2637
02:14:58.550 --> 02:15:00.310
<v Speaker 3>As such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2638
02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:03.170
<v Speaker 3>that's the figure of Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what that figure means.</v>

2639
02:15:03.171 --> 02:15:05.390
<v Speaker 3>Just like there's a logo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the truth,</v>

2640
02:15:05.391 --> 02:15:09.890
<v Speaker 3>that speaks order out of chaos at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of time.</v>

2641
02:15:10.130 --> 02:15:15.080
<v Speaker 3>There's an antithetical spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hostile brother that's cane to able,</v>

2642
02:15:15.081 --> 02:15:16.970
<v Speaker 3>which we'll talk to talk about next </v>
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

2643
02:15:17.210 --> 02:15:22.210
<v Speaker 3>that's doing exactly the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's motivated by absolutely nothing but</v>

2644
02:15:23.091 --> 02:15:28.091
<v Speaker 3>malevolence and the willingness to </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroy and it has every reason for </v>

2645
02:15:28.091 --> 02:15:28.091
<v Speaker 3>doing so.</v>

2646
02:15:30.810 --> 02:15:31.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's</v>

2647
02:15:32.330 --> 02:15:35.570
<v Speaker 3>what's revealed in the next story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And cain and Abel in one paragraph,</v>

2648
02:15:36.290 --> 02:15:41.290
<v Speaker 3>the first glimmerings of that outside of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the strange insistence by the Christian </v>

2649
02:15:41.290 --> 02:15:42.320
<v Speaker 3>mystics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

2650
02:15:42.530 --> 02:15:47.530
<v Speaker 3>on the identity between the snake in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>garden of Eden and the author of all </v>

2651
02:15:47.530 --> 02:15:47.660
<v Speaker 3>evil himself.</v>

2652
02:15:52.530 --> 02:15:57.530
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2653
02:15:58.610 --> 02:16:00.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we only have 15 minutes today.</v>

2654
02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:06.520
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to finish that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So apologies for going over a little </v>

2655
02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:08.630
<v Speaker 3>longer and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2656
02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:13.270
<v Speaker 4>Hi Dr Peterson over the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks and further back,</v>

2657
02:16:13.271 --> 02:16:17.110
<v Speaker 4>you talk a lot about consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the importance of it and I was hoping to</v>

2658
02:16:17.111 --> 02:16:22.111
<v Speaker 4>get your opinion on an issue of </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness that has often seen </v>

2659
02:16:22.111 --> 02:16:25.200
<v Speaker 4>Christianity among other groups and </v>
<v Speaker 4>politics kind of clashed.</v>

2660
02:16:25.201 --> 02:16:30.201
<v Speaker 4>So I'm hoping to get your views on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness or lack thereof of human </v>

2661
02:16:30.201 --> 02:16:30.201
<v Speaker 4>fetus</v>

2662
02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:35.340
<v Speaker 1>and how that's impacted your views on </v>
<v Speaker 1>abortion whenever they are and any </v>

2663
02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:39.640
<v Speaker 1>legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2664
02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2665
02:16:57.931 --> 02:17:00.480
<v Speaker 1>so the first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I have an answer for that?</v>

2666
02:17:00.481 --> 02:17:03.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a good enough answer to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal.</v>

2667
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:06.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2668
02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:11.840
<v Speaker 1>but I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can flail about a little bit around </v>

2669
02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:13.140
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abortion is clearly wrong.</v>

2670
02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Don't think anybody debates that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't recommend that someone that</v>

2671
02:17:18.451 --> 02:17:21.390
<v Speaker 1>you love have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2672
02:17:21.391 --> 02:17:26.391
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having clarified that that mere </v>

2673
02:17:26.491 --> 02:17:29.580
<v Speaker 1>statement doesn't eliminate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity of the situation.</v>

2674
02:17:31.950 --> 02:17:35.280
<v Speaker 1>The first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is should everything wrong be illegal?</v>

2675
02:17:36.390 --> 02:17:40.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that's wrong isn't illegal.</v>

2676
02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the additional complication</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the difference,</v>

2677
02:17:45.631 --> 02:17:50.631
<v Speaker 1>let's say in gravity regarding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem in relationship to men and women</v>

2678
02:17:55.230 --> 02:18:00.230
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know how to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having said that,</v>

2679
02:18:00.341 --> 02:18:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I would say that it's actually the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

2680
02:18:04.330 --> 02:18:07.390
<v Speaker 1>There's something Leonard Cohen said </v>
<v Speaker 1>once he said that in a massacre,</v>

2681
02:18:07.391 --> 02:18:12.391
<v Speaker 1>there's no decent place to stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what he meant by that was sometimes </v>

2682
02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.130
<v Speaker 1>you're aware there is no good decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

2683
02:18:16.270 --> 02:18:17.620
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong.</v>

2684
02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:21.770
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did you get there?</v>

2685
02:18:22.490 --> 02:18:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're in a position where you</v>

2686
02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:28.100
<v Speaker 1>are inclined to seek an abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

2687
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:34.030
<v Speaker 1>how did you get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we have a lot to straighten out </v>

2688
02:18:34.030 --> 02:18:36.590
<v Speaker 1>about sexual relationships between men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women.</v>

2689
02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:40.610
<v Speaker 1>In the modern world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bent and warped and demented out</v>

2690
02:18:40.611 --> 02:18:45.611
<v Speaker 1>of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I see with young </v>

2691
02:18:45.611 --> 02:18:45.611
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2692
02:18:45.611 --> 02:18:48.460
<v Speaker 1>is that they will engage in sexual acts </v>
<v Speaker 1>with one another that they would not </v>

2693
02:18:48.460 --> 02:18:49.430
<v Speaker 1>talk about with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2694
02:18:49.490 --> 02:18:52.040
<v Speaker 1>couples will do that for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like married couples will do that,</v>

2695
02:18:52.041 --> 02:18:54.800
<v Speaker 1>but they're married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different story.</v>

2696
02:18:55.310 --> 02:19:00.310
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that if you are willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to engage in a sexual act with someone </v>

2697
02:19:00.310 --> 02:19:01.010
<v Speaker 1>with whom you would not discuss that </v>
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>

2698
02:19:01.011 --> 02:19:03.140
<v Speaker 1>you probably put the cart before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horse,</v>

2699
02:19:04.130 --> 02:19:09.130
<v Speaker 1>so the discussion regarding the legality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of abortion is nested inside a larger </v>

2700
02:19:11.931 --> 02:19:16.931
<v Speaker 1>discussion about the morality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abortion and that's nested inside a </v>

2701
02:19:18.261 --> 02:19:23.261
<v Speaker 1>larger discussion about the proper place</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sexuality and human behavior and to </v>

2702
02:19:23.811 --> 02:19:27.770
<v Speaker 1>me that's the level at which the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to addressed.</v>

2703
02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't have the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2704
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:34.240
<v Speaker 1>because they all answer was get married </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2705
02:19:34.241 --> 02:19:37.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a good answer and it's an answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people should still listen to,</v>

2706
02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:40.760
<v Speaker 1>but we'll put that aside momentarily.</v>

2707
02:19:42.830 --> 02:19:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I had a client at one point who was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2708
02:19:45.330 --> 02:19:47.230
<v Speaker 1>She was probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2709
02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:49.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to disguise her in a variety </v>
<v Speaker 1>of different ways.</v>

2710
02:19:50.450 --> 02:19:52.260
<v Speaker 1>She was 27,</v>
<v Speaker 1>28,</v>

2711
02:19:52.310 --> 02:19:57.310
<v Speaker 1>thereabouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had come from a relatively conservative </v>

2712
02:19:57.310 --> 02:19:58.850
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a timid or fearful person and also</v>

2713
02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:04.720
<v Speaker 1>not very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not sophisticated in relationship to </v>

2714
02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:06.470
<v Speaker 1>relationships and she'd never had sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2715
02:20:06.471 --> 02:20:07.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things she'd never </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

2716
02:20:08.750 --> 02:20:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2717
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:17.550
<v Speaker 1>the answer from me to her wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>continued to be timid about everything </v>

2718
02:20:18.940 --> 02:20:23.110
<v Speaker 1>because that wasn't working out for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She needed to go have some adventures.</v>

2719
02:20:24.160 --> 02:20:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual adventures like other adventures </v>

2720
02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:32.941
<v Speaker 1>are dangerous and so you have to be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful when you encourage people to go </v>

2721
02:20:32.941 --> 02:20:34.390
<v Speaker 1>out and have adventures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2722
02:20:34.900 --> 02:20:36.310
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but too much.</v>

2723
02:20:36.311 --> 02:20:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Timidity and caution also constitutes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway to perdition.</v>

2724
02:20:40.601 --> 02:20:45.601
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you can't just say to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning world while you know,</v>

2725
02:20:46.541 --> 02:20:51.541
<v Speaker 1>sex till you're married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're going to get married when </v>

2726
02:20:51.541 --> 02:20:51.541
<v Speaker 1>you're very young and perhaps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>

2727
02:20:51.541 --> 02:20:56.401
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that we're mature </v>

2728
02:20:56.501 --> 02:21:00.880
<v Speaker 1>enough as a culture to have a serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about sexual impropriety,</v>

2729
02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:03.010
<v Speaker 1>especially in the aftermath of the birth</v>
<v Speaker 1>control pill.</v>

2730
02:21:03.220 --> 02:21:05.680
<v Speaker 1>And we seriously need to do that and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't.</v>

2731
02:21:05.950 --> 02:21:09.340
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the eternal debate about </v>
<v Speaker 1>abortion,</v>

2732
02:21:09.341 --> 02:21:11.920
<v Speaker 1>horrible as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

2733
02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:16.490
<v Speaker 1>it's the surface manifestation of a much</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper problem.</v>

2734
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked a little bit today about the </v>

2735
02:21:22.570 --> 02:21:22.570
<v Speaker 1>utility of marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the spiritual utility of marriage,</v>

2736
02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:27.640
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that I think we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>so immaturely cynical as a culture,</v>

2737
02:21:28.641 --> 02:21:33.641
<v Speaker 1>like we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not wise enough to look at an </v>

2738
02:21:33.641 --> 02:21:35.831
<v Speaker 1>institution like marriage and to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about what it means and what it </v>

2739
02:21:35.831 --> 02:21:37.490
<v Speaker 1>signifies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It signifies a place that people can tie</v>

2740
02:21:37.491 --> 02:21:39.650
<v Speaker 1>the ropes of their lives together so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're stronger.</v>

2741
02:21:39.651 --> 02:21:42.110
<v Speaker 1>It signifies a place where people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the truth to one another.</v>

2742
02:21:42.350 --> 02:21:46.580
<v Speaker 1>It signifies a place where sexuality can</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly be integrated into life.</v>

2743
02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:49.010
<v Speaker 1>That's no easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no easy task.</v>

2744
02:21:49.370 --> 02:21:51.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a place where children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>

2745
02:21:51.561 --> 02:21:55.010
<v Speaker 1>it can be put first and foremost as they</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be once they exist.</v>

2746
02:21:55.490 --> 02:22:00.260
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a much broader discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has to happen.</v>

2747
02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:05.320
<v Speaker 1>I think before any concentration on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>legality of abortion is labeled to get </v>

2748
02:22:05.601 --> 02:22:08.150
<v Speaker 1>anywhere at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

2749
02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:10.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's the best I can do with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

2750
02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2751
02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson earlier you showed a picture</v>

2752
02:22:24.780 --> 02:22:26.930
<v Speaker 1>of and newer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2753
02:22:27.260 --> 02:22:28.320
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2754
02:22:28.380 --> 02:22:31.470
<v Speaker 1>oh cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in your maps of meaning lectures,</v>

2755
02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:36.950
<v Speaker 1>you also explained that cultures around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world have these twin snakes that </v>

2756
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:37.950
<v Speaker 1>are were everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2757
02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you mentioned that you believe </v>

2758
02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:44.700
<v Speaker 1>this is a representation of DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would bring that up to Jesus.</v>

2759
02:22:44.701 --> 02:22:47.390
<v Speaker 1>What is it with you guys tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2760
02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:48.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2761
02:22:48.061 --> 02:22:49.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I believe that.</v>

2762
02:22:49.501 --> 02:22:51.870
<v Speaker 1>I have my suspicions that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be it.</v>

2763
02:22:51.871 --> 02:22:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because believe is too strong a word,</v>

2764
02:22:54.001 --> 02:22:55.950
<v Speaker 1>but those representations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

2765
02:22:56.310 --> 02:22:59.730
<v Speaker 1>And read this book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a good one.</v>

2766
02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have to remember the book by an </v>

2767
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:08.601
<v Speaker 1>anthropologist who went down to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon jungle and experimented </v>

2768
02:23:08.601 --> 02:23:10.470
<v Speaker 1>intensively with Iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called the cosmic serpent.</v>

2769
02:23:10.890 --> 02:23:13.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the name of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could read that.</v>

2770
02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:15.090
<v Speaker 1>There's another one called breaking open</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head,</v>

2771
02:23:15.091 --> 02:23:19.740
<v Speaker 1>which is also pretty damn interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's something to those books.</v>

2772
02:23:19.980 --> 02:23:23.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean the cosmic serpent kind of goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>off on a bit of a tangent I would say.</v>

2773
02:23:23.941 --> 02:23:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Although breaking open the head is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better,</v>

2774
02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:32.240
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to stay more constrained and </v>

2775
02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:32.550
<v Speaker 1>tight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

2776
02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:36.570
<v Speaker 1>we don't know the limits of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception,</v>

2777
02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:41.760
<v Speaker 1>especially under certain conditions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people have had intimations of </v>

2778
02:23:42.300 --> 02:23:46.140
<v Speaker 1>DNA as the cosmic serpent for ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

2779
02:23:46.800 --> 02:23:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's like,</v>

2780
02:23:49.860 --> 02:23:53.070
<v Speaker 1>that's way out on the frontiers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>

2781
02:23:53.071 --> 02:23:54.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm,</v>

2782
02:23:54.390 --> 02:23:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing in a dreamlike way when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>making statements like that.</v>

2783
02:23:58.231 --> 02:24:03.231
<v Speaker 1>So because you didn't mention that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>did believe it and that there were sort </v>

2784
02:24:03.231 --> 02:24:07.101
<v Speaker 1>of maybe some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some dreams and interpretations that </v>

2785
02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:12.380
<v Speaker 1>might have emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see how we could have </v>

2786
02:24:12.380 --> 02:24:12.990
<v Speaker 1>perceived DNA as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2787
02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes we did.</v>

2788
02:24:16.290 --> 02:24:21.290
<v Speaker 1>We didn't objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not so sure we didn't </v>

2789
02:24:21.290 --> 02:24:22.170
<v Speaker 1>subjectively and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very strange that these,</v>

2790
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:27.230
<v Speaker 1>that these double helix is exist in so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many places in that they're are often </v>

2791
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:27.990
<v Speaker 1>utilized as healing symbols with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>

2792
02:24:28.350 --> 02:24:30.900
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2793
02:24:30.930 --> 02:24:32.880
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you call that?</v>

2794
02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:37.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm a high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not hypothesizing.</v>

2795
02:24:37.801 --> 02:24:40.020
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speculating.</v>

2796
02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Those are speculations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2797
02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:44.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm operating at the edge of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>

2798
02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:49.470
<v Speaker 1>but our perceptions are very mutable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

2799
02:24:50.010 --> 02:24:55.010
<v Speaker 1>we can see things under some conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you wouldn't think that anybody </v>

2800
02:24:55.010 --> 02:24:55.010
<v Speaker 1>could see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2801
02:24:55.710 --> 02:24:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2802
02:24:58.470 --> 02:25:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2803
02:25:03.050 --> 02:25:06.390
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I was just starting to have a thought</v>

2804
02:25:06.391 --> 02:25:09.990
<v Speaker 5>while you were talking about sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting to the end of the talk about the</v>

2805
02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:15.300
<v Speaker 5>snake and the and the apple and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what you're saying is the moment </v>

2806
02:25:15.751 --> 02:25:17.100
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that uh,</v>

2807
02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:21.420
<v Speaker 5>that Adam and eve eat the apple,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they become nervous or whatever.</v>

2808
02:25:21.421 --> 02:25:23.280
<v Speaker 5>So that's awareness of their own </v>
<v Speaker 5>vulnerability.</v>

2809
02:25:23.290 --> 02:25:28.290
<v Speaker 5>So then like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also awareness of their own </v>

2810
02:25:28.290 --> 02:25:30.721
<v Speaker 5>capacity to do harm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like when they are eating the </v>

2811
02:25:30.721 --> 02:25:33.841
<v Speaker 5>apple then that's them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their immediate sort of a nervous </v>

2812
02:25:33.851 --> 02:25:38.851
<v Speaker 5>reaction is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is because they ate the apple and they </v>

2813
02:25:38.851 --> 02:25:39.430
<v Speaker 5>kind of became evil in that moment or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

2814
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:43.390
<v Speaker 1>So when they woke up and because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they woke up and realized how they could</v>

2815
02:25:43.391 --> 02:25:48.391
<v Speaker 1>be hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they could and would be hurt over </v>

2816
02:25:48.391 --> 02:25:48.391
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the,</v>

2817
02:25:48.391 --> 02:25:49.050
<v Speaker 1>over the upcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over time.</v>

2818
02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:54.540
<v Speaker 1>It's the same as the discovery of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>did the discovery of your own nakedness </v>

2819
02:25:54.540 --> 02:25:57.840
<v Speaker 1>and the discovery of time are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar phenomena mean.</v>

2820
02:26:01.210 --> 02:26:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you know how you can be hurt,</v>

2821
02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:06.550
<v Speaker 1>well you don't have to just consult your</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil fantasies.</v>

2822
02:26:06.551 --> 02:26:08.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like wild really hurt him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2823
02:26:08.441 --> 02:26:09.430
<v Speaker 1>That would work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2824
02:26:09.431 --> 02:26:10.790
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2825
02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:13.840
<v Speaker 1>you just think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen if that happened to me</v>

2826
02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:15.130
<v Speaker 1>that would hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2827
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:18.550
<v Speaker 1>that'll work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll hurt him or her and you know,</v>

2828
02:26:18.850 --> 02:26:21.940
<v Speaker 1>you probably think that way twice a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe twice a day.</v>

2829
02:26:21.970 --> 02:26:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you have an argument with </v>

2830
02:26:26.970 --> 02:26:26.970
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you have to do is look at the back of</v>

2831
02:26:26.970 --> 02:26:27.580
<v Speaker 1>your mind a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to,</v>

2832
02:26:27.581 --> 02:26:29.290
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do,</v>

2833
02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you'll see these sorts of thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes generating constantly.</v>

2834
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2835
02:26:35.081 --> 02:26:38.380
<v Speaker 1>in a back and forth discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly with people you love,</v>

2836
02:26:38.381 --> 02:26:41.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're always looking for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place to put the knife in.</v>

2837
02:26:42.910 --> 02:26:43.880
<v Speaker 1>It seems really similar to.</v>

2838
02:26:44.410 --> 02:26:49.410
<v Speaker 5>Seems like they're kind of discovering </v>
<v Speaker 5>the kind of union shadow within </v>

2839
02:26:49.410 --> 02:26:49.410
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that,</v>

2840
02:26:49.410 --> 02:26:51.860
<v Speaker 5>that is the moment where it got </v>
<v Speaker 5>introduced into the human spirit.</v>

2841
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:57.150
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things about the shadow is </v>

2842
02:26:57.150 --> 02:26:59.981
<v Speaker 5>that it's also when you integrate that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what makes you a substantial </v>

2843
02:26:59.981 --> 02:26:59.981
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2844
02:26:59.981 --> 02:27:03.020
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems to me that on one hand,</v>

2845
02:27:03.021 --> 02:27:08.021
<v Speaker 5>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems like this tragedy that Satan </v>

2846
02:27:08.021 --> 02:27:08.021
<v Speaker 5>the most evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the father of evil,</v>

2847
02:27:08.021 --> 02:27:12.401
<v Speaker 5>whatever has introduced into people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it also seems like without that </v>

2848
02:27:12.401 --> 02:27:15.200
<v Speaker 5>shadow that people are kind of in </v>
<v Speaker 5>substantial.</v>

2849
02:27:15.890 --> 02:27:16.520
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2850
02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:17.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2851
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:18.410
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2852
02:27:18.411 --> 02:27:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2853
02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:25.870
<v Speaker 1>that there's been a multitude of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations emerge as a consequence </v>

2854
02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:27.540
<v Speaker 1>of that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was got up to was,</v>

2855
02:27:27.610 --> 02:27:29.900
<v Speaker 1>was God in fact evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the initial God,</v>

2856
02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:32.540
<v Speaker 1>like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would he create a snake?</v>

2857
02:27:32.570 --> 02:27:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Why would he put it in the garden?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would there be these trees?</v>

2858
02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:38.180
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is going on with the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan thing?</v>

2859
02:27:38.510 --> 02:27:39.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

2860
02:27:39.441 --> 02:27:40.940
<v Speaker 1>very problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2861
02:27:41.090 --> 02:27:45.170
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about it more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this again is,</v>

2862
02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:48.170
<v Speaker 1>let's call it speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2863
02:27:53.070 --> 02:27:55.200
<v Speaker 1>if you want to make something strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you test it.</v>

2864
02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:58.740
<v Speaker 1>And maybe if you want to make something </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately strong,</v>

2865
02:27:58.741 --> 02:28:03.741
<v Speaker 1>you tested ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that there's an aspect of </v>

2866
02:28:03.871 --> 02:28:08.871
<v Speaker 1>being that has that element is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are tested to ultimately</v>

2867
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:16.030
<v Speaker 1>it's partly because we know good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>good and evil now and so that's the </v>

2868
02:28:16.030 --> 02:28:19.430
<v Speaker 1>landscape in which we exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could say the landscape is across</v>

2869
02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:24.520
<v Speaker 1>it's chaos in order and as and evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're stuck in the middle between those </v>

2870
02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:25.130
<v Speaker 1>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very common theme by the way,</v>

2871
02:28:25.131 --> 02:28:27.740
<v Speaker 1>in video games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly that chaos order,</v>

2872
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:29.000
<v Speaker 1>good evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>

2873
02:28:29.090 --> 02:28:34.090
<v Speaker 1>It's the basic plot of endless video </v>
<v Speaker 1>games and that's perhaps because it's </v>

2874
02:28:34.090 --> 02:28:37.211
<v Speaker 1>the basic plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things we have to contend </v>

2875
02:28:37.211 --> 02:28:37.211
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2876
02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I had a vision once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't tell you this,</v>

2877
02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:41.090
<v Speaker 1>but I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

2878
02:28:41.780 --> 02:28:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I had a vision once that I went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven and I was putting in a enrollment</v>

2879
02:28:47.121 --> 02:28:52.121
<v Speaker 1>amphitheater with Satan just like thor </v>
<v Speaker 1>in countering the hulk,</v>

2880
02:28:52.671 --> 02:28:57.671
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's coming up in that new avengers </v>

2881
02:28:57.671 --> 02:28:57.671
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was rather a shock because I</v>

2882
02:28:57.671 --> 02:28:58.910
<v Speaker 1>thought that was a hell of a thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in heaven.</v>

2883
02:28:59.210 --> 02:29:04.210
<v Speaker 1>And so I had this battle and I won in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and I came up to God and said,</v>

2884
02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:10.280
<v Speaker 1>what's with the whole Roman amphitheater</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing there,</v>

2885
02:29:10.281 --> 02:29:12.860
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like a bit over the top to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2886
02:29:12.861 --> 02:29:16.070
<v Speaker 1>why would you put me in a ring with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone thinking like that?</v>

2887
02:29:16.430 --> 02:29:21.430
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I knew you could win and you </v>

2888
02:29:21.430 --> 02:29:25.301
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to make of that one </v>

2889
02:29:25.301 --> 02:29:26.870
<v Speaker 1>thing I should make of it as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't tell you,</v>

2890
02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:29.330
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2891
02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:35.200
<v Speaker 1>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to that in my </v>

2892
02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:35.200
<v Speaker 1>estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2893
02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:37.490
<v Speaker 1>do you protect the people you love or do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to make them strong?</v>

2894
02:29:38.270 --> 02:29:43.270
<v Speaker 1>So you think it's that it's not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily Satan to thank for making a </v>

2895
02:29:43.270 --> 02:29:47.441
<v Speaker 1>substantial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that God gave us Satan in order to </v>

2896
02:29:47.441 --> 02:29:51.881
<v Speaker 1>make a substantial wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd hesitate to say that because you </v>

2897
02:29:51.881 --> 02:29:51.881
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2898
02:29:51.881 --> 02:29:51.881
<v Speaker 1>it's so cut and dried.</v>

2899
02:29:52.430 --> 02:29:57.290
<v Speaker 1>But I would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a strong underlying theme in</v>

2900
02:29:57.291 --> 02:29:59.120
<v Speaker 1>the biblical narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2901
02:29:59.810 --> 02:30:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Now it's certainly not the only theme </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not the only interpretation by </v>

2902
02:30:04.810 --> 02:30:06.550
<v Speaker 1>any stretch of the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is something there.</v>

2903
02:30:06.570 --> 02:30:07.360
<v Speaker 1>There's something there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2904
02:30:07.380 --> 02:30:12.380
<v Speaker 1>at the end we didn't talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God puts up his flaming sword and these </v>

2905
02:30:12.381 --> 02:30:14.930
<v Speaker 1>chairmen to keep you away from the tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>

2906
02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:19.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like it seeing if if paradise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>immortality or the promised land and </v>

2907
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:26.110
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's with the whole flaming angel and </v>

2908
02:30:26.110 --> 02:30:28.871
<v Speaker 1>sword thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could have just had the damn fruit </v>

2909
02:30:28.871 --> 02:30:31.810
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago and not bothered with the </v>

2910
02:30:31.810 --> 02:30:31.810
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2911
02:30:31.810 --> 02:30:32.900
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2912
02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness through tragedy,</v>

2913
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:43.870
<v Speaker 1>clarity through suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe something like that or maybe the </v>

2914
02:30:43.870 --> 02:30:48.221
<v Speaker 1>perfection that lurks as a potential in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future is something that has to be </v>

2915
02:30:48.221 --> 02:30:48.710
<v Speaker 1>earned rather than given.</v>

2916
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it has no value without free </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

2917
02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we have to distinguish between </v>
<v Speaker 1>good and evil.</v>

2918
02:30:53.811 --> 02:30:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Now that we have the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually apprehend them.</v>

2919
02:30:57.080 --> 02:31:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what life is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the separating of the wheat</v>

2920
02:31:00.321 --> 02:31:01.100
<v Speaker 1>from the chaff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2921
02:31:01.101 --> 02:31:02.630
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea and revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2922
02:31:02.930 --> 02:31:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Because when Christ comes back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book of revelation,</v>

2923
02:31:06.350 --> 02:31:11.350
<v Speaker 1>he divides the amd from the saved and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the saved are the people who lived in </v>

2924
02:31:11.691 --> 02:31:14.420
<v Speaker 1>logos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and the damned or those</v>

2925
02:31:14.421 --> 02:31:19.421
<v Speaker 1>who don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's this idea that there's </v>

2926
02:31:19.421 --> 02:31:21.660
<v Speaker 1>this dynamic that underlies experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he is in fact that's sorting.</v>

2927
02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know what to make of that at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

2928
02:31:27.210 --> 02:31:32.210
<v Speaker 1>but that's the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I can make of that is that I.</v>

2929
02:31:33.180 --> 02:31:38.180
<v Speaker 1>I can't put a lever underneath the </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument that I just made tonight about </v>

2930
02:31:38.491 --> 02:31:41.370
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between the development</v>
<v Speaker 1>of vision,</v>

2931
02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:45.240
<v Speaker 1>the snake fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nakedness time,</v>

2932
02:31:45.340 --> 02:31:47.880
<v Speaker 1>future work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most importantly,</v>

2933
02:31:47.881 --> 02:31:50.700
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to me to be.</v>

2934
02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I cannot find a way to undermine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

2935
02:31:55.080 --> 02:32:00.080
<v Speaker 1>It seems I can't break it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I'm always looking for </v>

2936
02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:02.850
<v Speaker 1>when I'm trying to formulate ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to look for something that no</v>

2937
02:32:02.851 --> 02:32:07.851
<v Speaker 1>matter how hard I try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot break and I can't break that </v>

2938
02:32:07.851 --> 02:32:10.500
<v Speaker 1>set of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what the full implication is of that</v>

2939
02:32:10.501 --> 02:32:12.630
<v Speaker 1>set of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows,</v>

2940
02:32:12.810 --> 02:32:14.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2941
02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:21.710
<v Speaker 1>but I could say also practically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2942
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:26.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've observed is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lies and deception destroy people's</v>

2943
02:32:27.031 --> 02:32:32.031
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they start telling the truth </v>

2944
02:32:32.031 --> 02:32:32.810
<v Speaker 1>and acting it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things get a lot better.</v>

2945
02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:35.350
<v Speaker 1>GotTa stop.</v>

2946
02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
