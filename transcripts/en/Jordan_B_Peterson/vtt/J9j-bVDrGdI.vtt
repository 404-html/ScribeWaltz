1
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I called the course personality and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations.</v>

2
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:16.274
<v Speaker 1>And I think you could think about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a restatement of the idea of being </v>

3
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>and becoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you are.</v>

4
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.493
<v Speaker 1>You're for whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're an entity that both is and is </v>

5
00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:26.774
<v Speaker 1>transforming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a rule that goes along with </v>

6
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:30.410
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

7
00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:35.300
<v Speaker 1>which has don't sacrifice who you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be for who you are,</v>

8
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.643
<v Speaker 1>which means if you have to choose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform in a positive direction or </v>

9
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:39.974
<v Speaker 1>maintain your current position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's better to transform in a </v>

10
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:44.174
<v Speaker 1>positive direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might even think of that as the </v>

11
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:47.470
<v Speaker 1>core of your being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a Ph,</v>

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Eddie and idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a union idea as well.</v>

13
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the thing that transforms who you</v>

14
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>are now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're also who you are.</v>

15
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>But on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the thing that transforms who you</v>

16
00:00:57.321 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

17
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that that's,</v>

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>and that's not an arbitrary statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.933
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that modern </v>

20
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:05.264
<v Speaker 1>universities do dreadfully now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced their students that value </v>

21
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:15.290
<v Speaker 1>structures are relative and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a,</v>

22
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>that's a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

23
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.653
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things wrong with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea and one of the things that's wrong </v>

24
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:20.954
<v Speaker 1>with that ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't include what I just </v>

25
00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:25.220
<v Speaker 1>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that's a good moral rule is you</v>

26
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 1>are the thing that is and you're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that becomes,</v>

27
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>and you should put the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes at a higher place than the thing</v>

28
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:32.384
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means you also have to allow </v>

29
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:35.480
<v Speaker 1>yourself to shake off those things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

30
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.553
<v Speaker 1>that you might be pathologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to habits and people for that </v>

31
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:42.080
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways of thinking,</v>

32
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:42.914
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to allow yourself to shake </v>

33
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>those off and that's more like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning,</v>

34
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.713
<v Speaker 1>that's why the Phoenix is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why the Phoenix is the symbol </v>

35
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

36
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.403
<v Speaker 1>It's old and it deteriorates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It bursts into flame and then it's </v>

37
00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:54.440
<v Speaker 1>reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

38
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:55.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to be reborn?</v>

39
00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the question.</v>

40
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:58.424
<v Speaker 1>The question is do you want to burst </v>
<v Speaker 1>into flame and answer to that generally </v>

41
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:03.560
<v Speaker 1>is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the wrong answer.</v>

42
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>The right answer is you let all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense burned away and you know,</v>

43
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.321
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

44
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:13.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I should leave behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An answer to that is that's a lie.</v>

45
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that you should leave</v>

46
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:17.630
<v Speaker 1>behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is ask yourself,</v>

47
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.900
<v Speaker 1>you'll come up with a list instantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a hundred stupid things that you're</v>

48
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:22.910
<v Speaker 1>doing that you know you could stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

49
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Some of them maybe you don't know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could stop doing.</v>

50
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fine,</v>

51
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:26.864
<v Speaker 1>leave those alone for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a bunch of things you </v>

52
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:31.640
<v Speaker 1>perfectly know well that you could stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that would improve your life.</v>

53
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.630
<v Speaker 1>And so do that to see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good,</v>

54
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Speaker 1>that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

55
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.823
<v Speaker 1>so its personality and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations because partly I wanted </v>

56
00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:43.154
<v Speaker 1>to talk to about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to you about what you are as a </v>

57
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:50.660
<v Speaker 1>human being and also as an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also what you could become.</v>

58
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually a crucial question </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the domains of clinical psychology in</v>

59
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:55.664
<v Speaker 1>particular because a lot of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing with people as a clinician is </v>

60
00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure who they could become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

61
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:01.620
<v Speaker 1>You come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

62
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>you have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life isn't what it could be.</v>

63
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.443
<v Speaker 1>It's like fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see what it could be like if we </v>

64
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>changed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure out how to change it.</v>

65
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.910
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta be a negotiated dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

66
00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the hell you should do</v>

67
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can help you figure it out.</v>

68
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we can talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are the person who has to decide</v>

69
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 1>if the things that you're aiming for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>get you out of bed in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's really the,</v>

71
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>that's at least one of the crucial </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

72
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:26.374
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to specify the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you got to specify that </v>

73
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>transformation processes and start </v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing them.</v>

74
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>And you have to understand that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be bad at it,</v>

75
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because bad's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

76
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:40.591
<v Speaker 1>Persistent is what you need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you persist with tiny improvements,</v>

77
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 1>if you persist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you win.</v>

78
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

79
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 1>so in a broader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a broader context,</v>

80
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.300
<v Speaker 1>you can think about this as a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental ontological question.</v>

81
00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:54.134
<v Speaker 1>So one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one question is how you should act in </v>

82
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other question is,</v>

83
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the world?</v>

84
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.543
<v Speaker 1>And that's complicated problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a scientific answer to that </v>

85
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:05.104
<v Speaker 1>question and now is that the world is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection of objective phenomena and </v>

86
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a very powerful perspective.</v>

87
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.713
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have a good method for </v>

88
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>determining what the world is like as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection of objective phenomena.</v>

89
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's made us very technologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful and so more power to us and all</v>

90
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but leaves a question on answered.</v>

91
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.593
<v Speaker 1>the world isn't just a place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective phenomena because it's not a </v>

93
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 1>panoply of inert matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has living conscious creatures in it.</v>

94
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a different order of being.</v>

95
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.993
<v Speaker 1>And the fundamental issue for conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>active creatures is not what is the </v>

96
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:45.814
<v Speaker 1>world from an objective perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how it is that you should conduct </v>

97
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>

98
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.093
<v Speaker 1>and there's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a kind of unbridgeable gap </v>

99
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:54.544
<v Speaker 1>between those two domains of inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is that </v>

100
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific method removes value from</v>

101
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>it's description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually what it does.</v>

102
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>And so once you're left with value free </v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptions,</v>

103
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:07.924
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to extract out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>value proposition from them cause </v>

104
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the scientific method removes the</v>

105
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:14.764
<v Speaker 1>value propositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be left with only </v>

106
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:18.100
<v Speaker 1>that which is objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

107
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And value propositions are in the domain</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the subjective.</v>

108
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.023
<v Speaker 1>So I think the idea that you can derive </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you should be or do from a </v>

109
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 1>collection of facts is flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

110
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:29.404
<v Speaker 1>because the collecting the facts </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves gets rid of the value </v>

111
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:33.160
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But B,</v>

112
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.420
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so which,</v>

113
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to pick which ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>should guide you?</v>

114
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

115
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.553
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do something else that the </v>

116
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>facts do not tell you what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact you need something else to help</v>

117
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 1>you figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.563
<v Speaker 1>it's come to me over the years that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what essentially that's what the </v>

119
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>narrative cognitive framework does.</v>

120
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.653
<v Speaker 1>It's the framework that we use to </v>
<v Speaker 1>specify how we should act in the world </v>

121
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
<v Speaker 1>and so you could divide the world into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world as it is and the world as </v>

122
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.673
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gives you some direction and you </v>

123
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>need that and we know this technically </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

124
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.433
<v Speaker 1>You need direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is its direction </v>

125
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>that produces the primary that produces </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary positive emotion.</v>

126
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 1>And so if you need positive emotion to </v>
<v Speaker 1>move through life,</v>

127
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>which you do cause you can't even move </v>
<v Speaker 1>without positive emotion.</v>

128
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>And also positive emotion is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>ball,</v>

129
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:28.220
<v Speaker 1>work against terror and pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you need those things,</v>

130
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>then you need direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a goal,</v>

131
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.093
<v Speaker 1>you need a value structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that doesn't seem particularly </v>

132
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.650
<v Speaker 1>disputable to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could still say,</v>

133
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 1>well what value structure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

134
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:38.931
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

135
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was,</v>

136
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've thought a lot about that too.</v>

137
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.720
<v Speaker 1>So if we're going to adopt a value </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

138
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of rules that go along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

139
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:47.084
<v Speaker 1>And this is why the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists so wrong as far as I can </v>

140
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:50.054
<v Speaker 1>tell is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't just be my value structure </v>

141
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.620
<v Speaker 1>because I'm stuck with you and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>both stuck with all these other people.</v>

142
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 1>And so if I'm going to lay out a value </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

143
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>which is a way of interpreting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

144
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:03.374
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's an infinite number of </v>

145
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:06.440
<v Speaker 1>potential ways of interpreting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

146
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:07.274
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find no problem except that I have to </v>

147
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>interpret the world in a way that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

148
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dealing with you and the world.</v>

149
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Two of us are dealing with everyone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>

150
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 1>all of you are dealing with everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

151
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.480
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Piagetian game proposition.</v>

152
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be a popular kid on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>playground,</v>

153
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 1>you better play games that other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to play.</v>

154
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 1>That's a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>

155
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.513
<v Speaker 1>brilliant observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I told you that Piaget was trying </v>

156
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:31.710
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

157
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>heal the rift between science and </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

158
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:35.144
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that he did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he thought help do that as a </v>

159
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 1>question is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the moral judgments come from.</v>

160
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they partly come emerge as a consequence</v>

161
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 1>of consensus and it's a bounded domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're gonna,</v>

162
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 1>if we're gonna occupy the same space for</v>
<v Speaker 1>any length of time,</v>

163
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 1>and those are two critical propositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus same space and a long time,</v>

164
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.203
<v Speaker 1>then we have to figure out how to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>an iterative game that doesn't spiral </v>

165
00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 1>downward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully that might even improve that.</v>

166
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 1>We both don't object to because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it's not gonna work.</v>

167
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.733
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll walk away and play another game </v>

168
00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>or the game will will disintegrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophically.</v>

169
00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 1>So there's massive social constraint on </v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes an appropriate frame of</v>

170
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 1>reference.</v>

171
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much for the relativist argument.</v>

172
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.233
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another issue that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally relevant and it's associated </v>

173
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of objective reality to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree.</v>

174
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 1>But it's not exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

175
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly correct because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly objective reality.</v>

176
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.263
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you and I decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupy the same place for some </v>

177
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:35.474
<v Speaker 1>substantial amount of time and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to solve the problem of </v>

178
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:39.074
<v Speaker 1>being together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you and I still have to figure out </v>

179
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:42.284
<v Speaker 1>how to solve the problem of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in a manner that doesn't make </v>

180
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:48.920
<v Speaker 1>the world object too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't just other people,</v>

181
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:50.570
<v Speaker 1>although that's a huge part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

182
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.583
<v Speaker 1>You want them to not object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not even want them to support </v>

183
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:54.950
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would even be better.</v>

184
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 1>But you also have to deal with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

186
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 1>the tendency of matter to object </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

187
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:02.604
<v Speaker 1>so your mode of being in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your interpretive framework as a </v>

188
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:07.584
<v Speaker 1>description of how you should act is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the laying out of a strategy </v>

189
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>that will produce the ends that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicts,</v>

190
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.230
<v Speaker 1>which are the things that you want.</v>

191
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>So this is the pragmatist perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was worked out by William James and</v>

192
00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:23.730
<v Speaker 1>his people back in the late 18 hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>in New England.</v>

193
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 1>The only genuine brand of American </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and what the pragmatists said</v>

194
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:30.330
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you decide if something's true?</v>

195
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 1>The answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

196
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know anything.</v>

197
00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:34.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

198
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:35.754
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't helpful because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck with the problem of how to </v>

199
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 1>be in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

200
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 1>so what you do is you lay out a motive </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation that has an end point and</v>

201
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 1>then you run the mode of interpretation </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied,</v>

202
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause he acted it out.</v>

203
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't produce the outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's not,</v>

204
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

205
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.993
<v Speaker 1>The claims within it aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not true by the definition of </v>

206
00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 1>the game itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

207
00:09:58.591 --> 00:09:59.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a kid on a playground.</v>

208
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:00.990
<v Speaker 1>You want to play a game.</v>

209
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.930
<v Speaker 1>One of the implicit demands is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game is fun.</v>

210
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.300
<v Speaker 1>If it's not fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not worth playing.</v>

211
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:07.830
<v Speaker 1>So you play it for a while and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

212
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that fun?</v>

213
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:11.040
<v Speaker 1>If the answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you keep playing the game.</v>

214
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that game is,</v>

215
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.130
<v Speaker 1>it's good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's accurate enough,</v>

216
00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:14.964
<v Speaker 1>it's true enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you lay out interpretations in </v>

217
00:10:17.521 --> 00:10:20.100
<v Speaker 1>the world and they're subject to massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints.</v>

218
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.023
<v Speaker 1>Other people have to go along with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cooperate with you because if they </v>

219
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:24.660
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then look the hell out.</v>

220
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a major,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious,</v>

221
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:29.310
<v Speaker 1>nontrivial constraint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing is,</v>

222
00:10:29.311 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 1>will social proof isn't good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also has to work in the world outside</v>

223
00:10:33.751 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 1>of the social world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

224
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:36.624
<v Speaker 1>So if you have an illness and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>some hypothesis about how to construe </v>

225
00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:40.320
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

226
00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is my understanding of the illness?</v>

227
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

228
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:46.830
<v Speaker 1>it implies that I take these actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

229
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:47.664
<v Speaker 1>how do you know if it's correct while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take the actions and if the illness </v>

230
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:50.754
<v Speaker 1>gets worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then by the definitions that are </v>

231
00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 1>implicit in the framework of reference </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're using,</v>

232
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.250
<v Speaker 1>you've made an error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's no relativism in that.</v>

233
00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:00.240
<v Speaker 1>You could still say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

234
00:11:00.241 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of potential solutions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>any potential set of problems.</v>

235
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:05.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

236
00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:05.964
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of different ways to play </v>

237
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:09.570
<v Speaker 1>chess on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a single board,</v>

238
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.703
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that any old </v>

239
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Speaker 1>solution is as good as any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

240
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

241
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:17.544
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then we're looking at things two </v>

242
00:11:18.571 --> 00:11:19.620
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to figure out,</v>

243
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:21.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does the world present itself?</v>

244
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:23.580
<v Speaker 1>And then how is it that you should act </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it?</v>

245
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>
<v Speaker 1>while there's other,</v>

246
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.373
<v Speaker 1>there's other constraints on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms of interpretation that you </v>

247
00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:31.800
<v Speaker 1>place in the world.</v>

248
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.760
<v Speaker 1>So we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

249
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.433
<v Speaker 1>you're constrained in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations by the constraints that </v>

250
00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:37.614
<v Speaker 1>other people place on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's internal constraints as </v>

251
00:11:39.421 --> 00:11:40.254
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about those mostly from a </v>

252
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:45.630
<v Speaker 1>biological perspective because you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>also re regard yourself in some sense as</v>

253
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:49.650
<v Speaker 1>a loose internal society and that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a psychoanalytic dictum,</v>

254
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:50.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

255
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.203
<v Speaker 1>you're a collection of subpersonalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could say you're a collection of </v>

256
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:55.690
<v Speaker 1>sub routines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how you,</v>

257
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 1>how you formulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're a unity,</v>

258
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.450
<v Speaker 1>but you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a universe unity.</v>

259
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 1>That brings together a plurality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>subcomponents.</v>

260
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.523
<v Speaker 1>And part of the constraints on how it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you lay out your interpretation of </v>

261
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:12.250
<v Speaker 1>the world is that you have to satisfy </v>
<v Speaker 1>those internal subsystems,</v>

262
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're the ego,</v>

263
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's more like you're the captain of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ship full of people who were rowing.</v>

264
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:19.030
<v Speaker 1>You got to keep the people rowing.</v>

265
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:19.930
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

266
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.170
<v Speaker 1>you're not tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not omnipotent tyrant of your own</v>

267
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 1>destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're constrained by the nature of your</v>

268
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:27.820
<v Speaker 1>own being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to provide yourself with</v>

269
00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:28.654
<v Speaker 1>food and you have to provide yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>with shelter and you have to provide </v>

270
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:32.650
<v Speaker 1>yourself with water and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

271
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:33.484
<v Speaker 1>And those are demands that are laid on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you by the nature of your internal </v>

272
00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:37.870
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

273
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:38.973
<v Speaker 1>how they lay themselves out as demands </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what the appropriate solutions to </v>

274
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:44.700
<v Speaker 1>that is to those problems are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

275
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.613
<v Speaker 1>is debatable infinitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can see the constraints stack </v>

276
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:49.324
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to satisfy your internal </v>

277
00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:51.454
<v Speaker 1>constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have to be brought into a unity </v>

278
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:54.784
<v Speaker 1>that seems to happen at least in part by</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the ages of two and something </v>

279
00:12:58.031 --> 00:13:00.340
<v Speaker 1>like between the ages of birth and four </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

280
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe even two years old.</v>

281
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.463
<v Speaker 1>You bring yourself together into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's sort of functioning as </v>

282
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:05.164
<v Speaker 1>a unity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to turn that unity into a </v>

283
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:07.954
<v Speaker 1>unity that can function in the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and with increasing breadth and </v>

284
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:12.244
<v Speaker 1>that unity in the social world has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a unity that can function inside the </v>

285
00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 1>natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

286
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.373
<v Speaker 1>So it's you're stacking up these games </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a hierarchy of increasing </v>

287
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:22.354
<v Speaker 1>complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the questions that emerges </v>

288
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:25.480
<v Speaker 1>from that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

289
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.280
<v Speaker 1>what should be at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy?</v>

290
00:13:27.281 --> 00:13:28.114
<v Speaker 1>If it's a hierarchical structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be a hierarchical structure </v>

291
00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:34.450
<v Speaker 1>because some things have to be worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing more than others or you can't act,</v>

292
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.583
<v Speaker 1>which is another thing I really don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like about the postmodernist ethos </v>

293
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.890
<v Speaker 1>because it claims that value structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>are there to eliminate,</v>

294
00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:44.740
<v Speaker 1>to exclude in Oh press and never once </v>
<v Speaker 1>notices that.</v>

295
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Well Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

296
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.313
<v Speaker 1>But value structures are also there so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know which way to walk because </v>

297
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:51.454
<v Speaker 1>you can't figure out which way to walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>without saying that that direction is </v>

298
00:13:53.921 --> 00:13:54.754
<v Speaker 1>preferable to that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She stuck with the damn things and they </v>

299
00:13:57.911 --> 00:14:01.210
<v Speaker 1>do exclude obviously category structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>exclude.</v>

300
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:03.280
<v Speaker 1>The question is if you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a value structure,</v>

301
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:07.470
<v Speaker 1>how is it that it should be can </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituted when we're already described</v>

302
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.313
<v Speaker 1>some of the constraints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if your value structure is </v>

303
00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:13.540
<v Speaker 1>perfectly functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that you don't get enough to eat,</v>

304
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.150
<v Speaker 1>that turns out to actually to be a fatal</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

305
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it might be,</v>

306
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.480
<v Speaker 1>you can run into all sorts of fatal </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

307
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.880
<v Speaker 1>You're too lonesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it means you're,</v>

308
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.850
<v Speaker 1>let's say that your value structures too</v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic,</v>

309
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.400
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of reasons to be lonesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that might be one of them.</v>

310
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Or you're too timid or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

311
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:30.363
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to be informed by your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own internal biological mechanisms when </v>

312
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:38.830
<v Speaker 1>the value structure that you're laying </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the world is insufficient to keep</v>

313
00:14:38.831 --> 00:14:39.664
<v Speaker 1>itself propagating across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of that's just you and some of </v>

314
00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:47.050
<v Speaker 1>that's other people and some of that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural world constraints Galore.</v>

315
00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:49.390
<v Speaker 1>And so in the phase of all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints,</v>

316
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.660
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely unreasonable to say any </v>
<v Speaker 1>old solution goes.</v>

317
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:55.790
<v Speaker 1>It's try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generate a random solution,</v>

318
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:56.624
<v Speaker 1>run it as a simulation in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>see and see how many slings and arrows </v>

319
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 1>come your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be plenty.</v>

320
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

321
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about slings and arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

322
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

323
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.390
<v Speaker 1>that's a claim you don't get to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

324
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:12.830
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

325
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:13.664
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being informed internally as to </v>

326
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:18.320
<v Speaker 1>the nature of your value structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to specify where you are.</v>

327
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:19.820
<v Speaker 1>You have to specify where you're going.</v>

328
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.653
<v Speaker 1>You have to integrate all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying biological mechanisms into </v>

329
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:25.460
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that Schema.</v>

330
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.000
<v Speaker 1>It's something I think that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of weak about the piaget and ideas.</v>

331
00:15:29.001 --> 00:15:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because piaget,</v>

332
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a great fan of Piaget,</v>

333
00:15:32.121 --> 00:15:32.954
<v Speaker 1>but piaget tended to think that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child came into the world with nothing </v>

334
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:36.764
<v Speaker 1>but a set of reflexes that's as </v>
<v Speaker 1>technical claim and that the bootstrap </v>

335
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.053
<v Speaker 1>off those reflexes and I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it underestimates the degree to which </v>

336
00:15:43.921 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 1>the child comes into the world as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>already prepared unit.</v>

337
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 1>And I mean he just thought of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

338
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:51.920
<v Speaker 1>It's so self evident that you don't need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about them,</v>

339
00:15:51.921 --> 00:15:54.530
<v Speaker 1>but that's actually not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do need to talk about them.</v>

340
00:15:54.531 --> 00:15:55.364
<v Speaker 1>We know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you provide children with food </v>

341
00:15:57.531 --> 00:16:00.290
<v Speaker 1>and shelter and an adequate food and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelter,</v>

342
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.420
<v Speaker 1>but you don't interact with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>socially,</v>

343
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.670
<v Speaker 1>almost all of them die in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

344
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not optional touch.</v>

345
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.280
<v Speaker 1>He's not optional for children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attention is not optional for children.</v>

346
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Play is not optional for children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't just like,</v>

347
00:16:14.031 --> 00:16:14.864
<v Speaker 1>well the child comes into the world with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a set of reflexes and can adapt to any </v>

348
00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:18.734
<v Speaker 1>old environments like know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment has to be structured in a </v>

349
00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:21.854
<v Speaker 1>certain way or the child will die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very interesting when it comes </v>

350
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:25.874
<v Speaker 1>to things like play and touch because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't think of those as </v>

351
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:29.180
<v Speaker 1>fundamental necessities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

352
00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:30.014
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you deprive a child badly enough of </v>

353
00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 1>play and touch in the first three years </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their life,</v>

354
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.033
<v Speaker 1>even if they survive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what comes out at the end of that is </v>

355
00:16:39.201 --> 00:16:43.010
<v Speaker 1>often something that's like barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizable as a functional human being</v>

356
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.023
<v Speaker 1>and cannot be repaired after that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that experiment was done with </v>

357
00:16:47.361 --> 00:16:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Romanian orphans back in back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties so,</v>

358
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:51.603
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an ugly situation to say the </v>

359
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:53.834
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>

360
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.453
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you take these underlying </v>

361
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:59.660
<v Speaker 1>biological systems and maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggregate themselves into something that</v>

362
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:01.510
<v Speaker 1>vaguely looks like your temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

363
00:17:01.511 --> 00:17:04.550
<v Speaker 1>your five temperamental dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe if you're an extrovert,</v>

364
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:05.743
<v Speaker 1>you're dominated by the dopaminergic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system just like you are as if you're </v>

365
00:17:08.601 --> 00:17:10.430
<v Speaker 1>high in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're,</v>

366
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.460
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're high in neuroticism,</v>

367
00:17:13.461 --> 00:17:18.080
<v Speaker 1>it's mostly that you're dominated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety systems and systems that mediate</v>

368
00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.090
<v Speaker 1>emotional pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're agreeable,</v>

369
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.103
<v Speaker 1>you're dominated by the function of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying maternal slash care </v>

370
00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:26.690
<v Speaker 1>affiliation systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so you could say,</v>

371
00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:28.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got these loose,</v>

372
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.740
<v Speaker 1>you've got a multitude of fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological predispositions that manifest</v>

373
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:36.410
<v Speaker 1>themselves as implicit stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

374
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.543
<v Speaker 1>And they organize themselves into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary temperaments and the primary </v>

375
00:17:40.401 --> 00:17:42.200
<v Speaker 1>temperaments are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

376
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.123
<v Speaker 1>are biasing factors that determine in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part the nature of the interpretive </v>

377
00:17:46.161 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 1>structure that you're going to lay out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

378
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not entirely determined by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>

379
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.080
<v Speaker 1>We know that personality is only </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicting,</v>

380
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like let's say 10% of the </v>

381
00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 1>variance in most complex social outcomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

382
00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.690
<v Speaker 1>and the other elements are well </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperamental as you might be.</v>

383
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:02.730
<v Speaker 1>You still have to get along with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the world.</v>

384
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:05.790
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come in with these internal biases,</v>

385
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:06.624
<v Speaker 1>but they have still have to be modified </v>
<v Speaker 1>extensively by your social and your </v>

386
00:18:09.241 --> 00:18:11.190
<v Speaker 1>natural surround.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

387
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.293
<v Speaker 1>And then you develop your routines from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom up as piaget pointed out in </v>

388
00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:17.364
<v Speaker 1>sometimes from the top down because now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can think yourself into a </v>

389
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:23.310
<v Speaker 1>radical transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But mostly what you're doing is building</v>

390
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.144
<v Speaker 1>the micro units of your interpretive </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme is and your behaviors and </v>

391
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:28.134
<v Speaker 1>aggregating them into higher order </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that you can then tag with </v>

392
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:33.930
<v Speaker 1>higher order abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about that.</v>

393
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.230
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell a three year old to clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>up his room.</v>

394
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.333
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are empty boxes as far as the </v>

395
00:18:40.711 --> 00:18:43.800
<v Speaker 1>kid's concerned clean he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might,</v>

396
00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:46.560
<v Speaker 1>he might have room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might have that clean,</v>

397
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:47.394
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might have pickup the teddy bear and </v>

398
00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:52.050
<v Speaker 1>put it in that space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

399
00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:53.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of these little micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>routines.</v>

400
00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:54.684
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you say you put 20 of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro routines together and now you can </v>

401
00:18:57.811 --> 00:18:58.644
<v Speaker 1>say clean up your room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically what you're saying is </v>

402
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.403
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implement the 10 micro routines that </v>

403
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:03.474
<v Speaker 1>you've learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a well functioning personality </v>

404
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.863
<v Speaker 1>has all the micro routines in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually something that you help </v>

405
00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 1>people with if you're a behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist.</v>

406
00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:12.504
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things you assume if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a behavioral therapist is that </v>

407
00:19:15.181 --> 00:19:19.350
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the reason people aren't doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things is because they don't know how.</v>

408
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:20.783
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes maybe the person is depressed </v>

409
00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:25.530
<v Speaker 1>but potentially high functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got all the damn micro routines,</v>

410
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 1>they're well socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just dormant.</v>

411
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.880
<v Speaker 1>You got to get them awake again and </v>
<v Speaker 1>implementing them.</v>

412
00:19:29.881 --> 00:19:30.714
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you get someone in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your practice say who's just been </v>

413
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.820
<v Speaker 1>neglected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you cannot believe,</v>

414
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:36.654
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parents never paid any attention to </v>

415
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 1>them or maybe just punish them every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time they did something good.</v>

416
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.450
<v Speaker 1>That's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

417
00:19:42.451 --> 00:19:43.284
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't make friends and so they're </v>

418
00:19:44.101 --> 00:19:45.000
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really</v>

419
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.960
<v Speaker 1>vague and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

420
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.903
<v Speaker 1>and poorly articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what you do is you work at </v>

421
00:19:51.091 --> 00:19:51.924
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the micro routines and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to practice building up all these </v>

422
00:19:55.201 --> 00:19:57.330
<v Speaker 1>little attributes that they didn't build</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

423
00:19:57.331 --> 00:19:59.370
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you can think about in</v>

424
00:19:59.371 --> 00:20:00.204
<v Speaker 1>terms of character development is so now</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe understand something about your </v>

425
00:20:02.881 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 1>own personality.</v>

426
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.493
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what could you do to improve your </v>

427
00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:06.264
<v Speaker 1>personality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And answer is develop some of the micro </v>

428
00:20:09.091 --> 00:20:11.970
<v Speaker 1>routines on the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality distribution.</v>

429
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.510
<v Speaker 1>So if you're disagreeable as hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could start learning how to do</v>

430
00:20:15.511 --> 00:20:18.660
<v Speaker 1>nice things for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that actually works by the way.</v>

431
00:20:18.661 --> 00:20:19.494
<v Speaker 1>So if you take disagreeable people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are depressed and you get them doing </v>

432
00:20:21.661 --> 00:20:23.940
<v Speaker 1>nice things for other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their depression tends to lift.</v>

433
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.220
<v Speaker 1>But then by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're agreeable,</v>

434
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.720
<v Speaker 1>then you should practice doing some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things for yourself and being more tough</v>

435
00:20:30.721 --> 00:20:34.290
<v Speaker 1>minded in your negotiations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can sort of place yourself on</v>

436
00:20:34.291 --> 00:20:36.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the personality trait distribution,</v>

437
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're extrovert.</v>

438
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:38.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay man,</v>

439
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.790
<v Speaker 1>learn to spend some time with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

440
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:42.863
<v Speaker 1>You're low in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well try reading a book that's outside </v>

441
00:20:44.791 --> 00:20:45.601
<v Speaker 1>of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

442
00:20:45.601 --> 00:20:46.434
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sphere of interest now in that if </v>

443
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:49.534
<v Speaker 1>you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you should probably learn how to </v>

444
00:20:51.191 --> 00:20:52.000
<v Speaker 1>relax.</v>

445
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually and so forth.</v>

446
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:54.574
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think partly what you're doing as </v>

447
00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:58.810
<v Speaker 1>you're developing your personality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not moving the mean much,</v>

448
00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:01.210
<v Speaker 1>the average where you know where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>located,</v>

449
00:21:01.211 --> 00:21:04.840
<v Speaker 1>but you're extending the standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation so that you're a bigger bag of</v>

450
00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:05.674
<v Speaker 1>tricks than you were before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can practice that </v>

451
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 1>consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're hyper orderly.</v>

452
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:13.240
<v Speaker 1>It's well get a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

453
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.530
<v Speaker 1>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're messy,</v>

454
00:21:14.531 --> 00:21:15.580
<v Speaker 1>horrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

455
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:18.220
<v Speaker 1>it's just what you need if you're hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly because they're gonna leave hair</v>

456
00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:19.810
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and force you to live with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

457
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:20.920
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

458
00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:23.140
<v Speaker 1>so and so this is sort of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

459
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:23.974
<v Speaker 1>This is your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this connect collection of routine </v>

460
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.410
<v Speaker 1>sub routines that you've turned into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

461
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.270
<v Speaker 1>And then there's something at the top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

462
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big question.</v>

463
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Like what the hell should be at the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the hierarchy?</v>

464
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the ultimate question of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unity and the,</v>

465
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.650
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clinicians would say,</v>

466
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:40.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the self actualized person,</v>

467
00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:42.520
<v Speaker 1>or it's the self or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

468
00:21:42.521 --> 00:21:43.450
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the eye,</v>

469
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 1>that's the implicit and perhaps explicit</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal that you're aiming for.</v>

470
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:51.080
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well is does such thing existed?</v>

471
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.440
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well do you admire people?</v>

472
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's your answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

473
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Do you despise people while you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>some people and you don't like others?</v>

474
00:21:59.471 --> 00:22:00.304
<v Speaker 1>You respect some people you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect others while you're acting out </v>

475
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.860
<v Speaker 1>the notion that there's at least an </v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit ideal,</v>

476
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.690
<v Speaker 1>you do the same thing when you go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

477
00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:09.310
<v Speaker 1>you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know who the hero is,</v>

478
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:10.144
<v Speaker 1>you know who the bad guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're acting out the proposition that </v>

479
00:22:12.521 --> 00:22:15.970
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of value hierarchy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some sort of manifestation of it</v>

480
00:22:15.971 --> 00:22:17.680
<v Speaker 1>that's coherent across time.</v>

481
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.663
<v Speaker 1>So you appear to believe that and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know you are driven at least to some </v>

482
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:26.320
<v Speaker 1>degree by your own inner ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you tend to answer the question,</v>

483
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.220
<v Speaker 1>is that real with an affirmative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't,</v>

484
00:22:30.221 --> 00:22:31.054
<v Speaker 1>there's catastrophic consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicha and the existentialists were very </v>

485
00:22:33.491 --> 00:22:35.680
<v Speaker 1>good at detailing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like you let your value hierarchy</v>

486
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:37.420
<v Speaker 1>disintegrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then what?</v>

487
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Well part of it is nihilistic chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who that's not so much fun.</v>

488
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:43.413
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the alignment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic chaos with the intrinsic </v>

489
00:22:46.271 --> 00:22:49.000
<v Speaker 1>desire that someone will come along and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you what to do.</v>

490
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.283
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is if you let this </v>

491
00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:52.024
<v Speaker 1>devolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up with nihilistic exit with </v>

492
00:22:54.131 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic chaos or the demand for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the tyrant to come forward.</v>

493
00:22:57.701 --> 00:22:58.534
<v Speaker 1>And we've had that happen lots of times </v>
<v Speaker 1>and doesn't seem to have gotten that </v>

494
00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:02.260
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

495
00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.341
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

496
00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:09.610
<v Speaker 1>so what happens when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lay out these little routines in the</v>

497
00:23:09.611 --> 00:23:11.590
<v Speaker 1>world at different levels of analysis.</v>

498
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.083
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how your emotions function </v>

499
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.450
<v Speaker 1>broadly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

500
00:23:16.451 --> 00:23:20.890
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at something and that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an oversimplification,</v>

501
00:23:20.891 --> 00:23:22.540
<v Speaker 1>which is why I want to show you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

502
00:23:22.541 --> 00:23:27.541
<v Speaker 1>When I show you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that it's made out of that,</v>

503
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a schematic oversimplification</v>

504
00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:31.894
<v Speaker 1>because even if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that I'm trying to do </v>

505
00:23:34.541 --> 00:23:37.060
<v Speaker 1>something as simple as walking towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>the door,</v>

506
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.433
<v Speaker 1>I mean that the action of walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the door is predicated on the </v>

507
00:23:42.371 --> 00:23:43.204
<v Speaker 1>existence of all the sub routines that </v>
<v Speaker 1>enabled to propel my body across time </v>

508
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:49.840
<v Speaker 1>and space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like there's that t.</v>

509
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:50.703
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took a lot of internal organization </v>

510
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 1>to get that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a traumatized now.</v>

511
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.510
<v Speaker 1>And so you can treat it like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>invisible.</v>

512
00:23:56.511 --> 00:24:00.950
<v Speaker 1>But implicit in any one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures is this entire structure.</v>

513
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 1>And you actually see this in therapy </v>
<v Speaker 1>very frequently too.</v>

514
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.990
<v Speaker 1>So I was talking to a client the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

515
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.030
<v Speaker 1>it was so interesting.</v>

516
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.023
<v Speaker 1>This person said something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had been talking to his mother and </v>

517
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:14.300
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just made a casual comment.</v>

518
00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:17.990
<v Speaker 1>He said he was talking to his mother who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in a state of grief for,</v>

519
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:20.340
<v Speaker 1>for good reasons that were independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

520
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.310
<v Speaker 1>of this particular person who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hate her.</v>

521
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

522
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:29.360
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where did that come from?</v>

523
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.570
<v Speaker 1>And so I made a comment on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a Freudian slip,</v>

524
00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:34.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there was,</v>

525
00:24:34.581 --> 00:24:35.414
<v Speaker 1>the conversation was flowing and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>this little emotion tagged utterance </v>

526
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:42.560
<v Speaker 1>came forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whenever an emotion tagged utterance</v>

527
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.050
<v Speaker 1>of that sort comes forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

528
00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:50.010
<v Speaker 1>it's associated with a whole rat's nest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of underlying pain and anxiety and,</v>

529
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

530
00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.383
<v Speaker 1>and what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disappointment and frustration that </v>

531
00:24:54.711 --> 00:24:57.350
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been properly rectified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a marker.</v>

532
00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.600
<v Speaker 1>And yet you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking to people,</v>

533
00:24:59.601 --> 00:25:02.110
<v Speaker 1>they say something and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>

534
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Too much information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about,</v>

535
00:25:04.851 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just what are you up to?</v>

536
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.353
<v Speaker 1>And then if you have any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just forget that that even happened </v>

537
00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:10.970
<v Speaker 1>and you continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

538
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.600
<v Speaker 1>that's like the snout of a dragon peak </v>
<v Speaker 1>peeking out from a cave.</v>

539
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:15.920
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

540
00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:16.754
<v Speaker 1>it's just a snout man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not because dragon snouts tend </v>

541
00:25:19.521 --> 00:25:20.354
<v Speaker 1>to be attached to the whole Damn Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is also something to know </v>

542
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:25.820
<v Speaker 1>about relationships because when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a relationship with someone,</v>

543
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.190
<v Speaker 1>they'll do that now and then they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

544
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.890
<v Speaker 1>outer something and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah Ha.</v>

545
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:31.143
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bump in the road where we're </v>

546
00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:34.850
<v Speaker 1>going to look underneath that at our </v>
<v Speaker 1>peril.</v>

547
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.280
<v Speaker 1>But if you do go down there and you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it,</v>

548
00:25:37.281 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

549
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.240
<v Speaker 1>then the whole thing comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can start to disentangle the,</v>

550
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:46.100
<v Speaker 1>the way above of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of memories and experiences that are all</v>

551
00:25:46.101 --> 00:25:49.100
<v Speaker 1>tangled together as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their emotional identity.</v>

552
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Because I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

553
00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:51.224
<v Speaker 1>everything that makes you anxious or </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that makes you upset is the </v>

554
00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:56.960
<v Speaker 1>same as every other thing that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>made you upset.</v>

555
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.333
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's an even different sub </v>

556
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.150
<v Speaker 1>set of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is all those things that have made</v>

557
00:26:02.151 --> 00:26:02.984
<v Speaker 1>you upset that you've never dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all laying down there at the </v>

558
00:26:05.181 --> 00:26:08.900
<v Speaker 1>bottom of your nasty little soul waiting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pop themselves up in some,</v>

559
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.760
<v Speaker 1>in some random moderates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

560
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.923
<v Speaker 1>And so then you go in there at your </v>
<v Speaker 1>peril because if you're the person who </v>

561
00:26:14.601 --> 00:26:15.434
<v Speaker 1>pokes around in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to get blasted with </v>

562
00:26:16.911 --> 00:26:17.744
<v Speaker 1>all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to come out like almost </v>

563
00:26:19.701 --> 00:26:22.550
<v Speaker 1>uncontrollably then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can sort it out.</v>

564
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.180
<v Speaker 1>And so what you find is if you ask a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person a question like that and then you</v>

565
00:26:26.181 --> 00:26:29.150
<v Speaker 1>let them free associate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just talk about it,</v>

566
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.223
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do a wandering around like that </v>

567
00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:33.290
<v Speaker 1>maze that I told you about.</v>

568
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.560
<v Speaker 1>They'll do a wandering around of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire territory.</v>

569
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.490
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes just having them wander </v>
<v Speaker 1>around in it can help them straighten it</v>

570
00:26:40.491 --> 00:26:41.324
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you might find out that something </v>

571
00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:43.184
<v Speaker 1>happened to them years ago that left </v>
<v Speaker 1>them with a terrible sense of guilt or </v>

572
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:48.850
<v Speaker 1>dismay or frustration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when,</v>

573
00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.150
<v Speaker 1>when they interact with their parents in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain way,</v>

574
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:51.984
<v Speaker 1>the parent knows exactly how to tap that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that all comes up and that's </v>

575
00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:56.310
<v Speaker 1>what produces that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little,</v>

576
00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:57.443
<v Speaker 1>that little utterance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the material of the world </v>

577
00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 1>manifesting itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what matters manifesting itself.</v>

578
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And it almost always manifests itself as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an object.</v>

579
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Something that objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're having a conversation,</v>

580
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.880
<v Speaker 1>it's going quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

581
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a bump in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an emotional disjunct right now.</v>

582
00:27:15.781 --> 00:27:17.880
<v Speaker 1>We're no longer in the same place at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

583
00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:19.560
<v Speaker 1>We're no longer playing the same game.</v>

584
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:20.940
<v Speaker 1>So then I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

585
00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:23.040
<v Speaker 1>well let's open that up and see what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>

586
00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.213
<v Speaker 1>While in the question is what's behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the game you're playing an answer to </v>

587
00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:32.190
<v Speaker 1>that is all the world that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignoring always.</v>

588
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.610
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when imagine that,</v>

589
00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.293
<v Speaker 1>think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to do well in a class and </v>

590
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:43.860
<v Speaker 1>you get a bad grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

591
00:27:43.861 --> 00:27:44.694
<v Speaker 1>so you're in this little frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get a good grade that isn't </v>

592
00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:48.930
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got a bad grade.</v>

593
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.033
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that's manifesting itself as </v>

594
00:27:52.111 --> 00:27:54.240
<v Speaker 1>the bad grade?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you could say,</v>

595
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:56.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a c minus on a piece of paper.</v>

596
00:27:56.401 --> 00:27:56.911
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

597
00:27:56.911 --> 00:27:57.720
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

598
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.500
<v Speaker 1>really know that that's the objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation.</v>

599
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.603
<v Speaker 1>You got a piece of paper with a c minus </v>
<v Speaker 1>the value free proposition is that </v>

600
00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:08.820
<v Speaker 1>you've been delivered a piece of paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a curve on it and a little,</v>

601
00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:09.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative side.</v>

602
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

603
00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:13.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what that is.</v>

604
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

605
00:28:14.191 --> 00:28:15.900
<v Speaker 1>it's as dopey as thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

606
00:28:15.901 --> 00:28:16.734
<v Speaker 1>here you got your failing grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go into the lab and you like weigh </v>

607
00:28:18.841 --> 00:28:19.674
<v Speaker 1>it on a scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you burn it and see what it was </v>

608
00:28:21.571 --> 00:28:22.470
<v Speaker 1>made of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

609
00:28:22.471 --> 00:28:23.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did I get so upset about that?</v>

610
00:28:23.971 --> 00:28:25.470
<v Speaker 1>It's just paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

611
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not just paper.</v>

612
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.950
<v Speaker 1>It's an entity that exists in a web of </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections.</v>

613
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.430
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it signified by paper is </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost completely irrelevant.</v>

614
00:28:35.431 --> 00:28:38.400
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is you don't know.</v>

615
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's why when you pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get this paralyzed,</v>

616
00:28:42.331 --> 00:28:43.164
<v Speaker 1>sinking feeling because your limbic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is a lot smarter than your </v>

617
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.200
<v Speaker 1>perceptual systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your perceptual systems say,</v>

618
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:50.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a piece of paper,</v>

619
00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:52.050
<v Speaker 1>and your limbic system says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

620
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.440
<v Speaker 1>for sure dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

621
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:56.663
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're sweating and then </v>

622
00:28:58.081 --> 00:28:58.914
<v Speaker 1>maybe you put it away and you go play </v>
<v Speaker 1>video games because you know better the </v>

623
00:29:02.701 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the real dragon.</v>

624
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:08.490
<v Speaker 1>And so instead you pull out the piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper maybe and you think,</v>

625
00:29:08.491 --> 00:29:11.940
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did I get this c minus?</v>

626
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a question,</v>

627
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:15.360
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

628
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.090
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

629
00:29:18.091 --> 00:29:18.924
<v Speaker 1>that could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least stupid compared to who you </v>

630
00:29:20.221 --> 00:29:21.330
<v Speaker 1>think you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>

631
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.400
<v Speaker 1>that's the real horror that's lurking </v>
<v Speaker 1>there rights.</v>

632
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.671
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

633
00:29:23.671 --> 00:29:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was kind of smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

634
00:29:25.621 --> 00:29:28.380
<v Speaker 1>that's a proposition of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

635
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was kind of smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

636
00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:32.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what about this c minus?</v>

637
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

638
00:29:33.811 --> 00:29:35.580
<v Speaker 1>that God damn professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

639
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been attacked by a predator.</v>

640
00:29:39.751 --> 00:29:41.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the first response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

641
00:29:41.411 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nonsensical message.</v>

642
00:29:43.121 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 1>It's just delivered by someone evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory.</v>

643
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

644
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.960
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't go there.</v>

645
00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.320
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't go there first necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

646
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.570
<v Speaker 1>but then while then say you don't go </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

647
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:56.051
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

648
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:56.884
<v Speaker 1>so what is this exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you not know what you thought you </v>

649
00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:02.710
<v Speaker 1>knew or are you not who you think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are?</v>

650
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you not work hard enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are Your values not organized properly?</v>

651
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Do you misuse your time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you in the wrong field?</v>

652
00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Is the way you're construing Your Life </v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely Inappropriate?</v>

653
00:30:13.601 --> 00:30:14.434
<v Speaker 1>Are you acting out what your parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted you to do it and you're pissed </v>

654
00:30:16.571 --> 00:30:17.404
<v Speaker 1>off about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're only running at 40% to spite </v>

655
00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:20.134
<v Speaker 1>them despite the fact that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying $25,000 a year for your </v>

656
00:30:22.751 --> 00:30:24.610
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's a fun game.</v>

657
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go do what you want me to do,</v>

658
00:30:26.801 --> 00:30:27.634
<v Speaker 1>but I'll fail at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not completely because then that </v>

659
00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:31.684
<v Speaker 1>would wouldn't cost you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just fail a little bit so that you </v>

660
00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:38.050
<v Speaker 1>have to spend all that money forcing me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do what I don't want to do,</v>

661
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.820
<v Speaker 1>but you'll never get to escape from it.</v>

662
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.833
<v Speaker 1>And then every time we interact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll stab you in various ways that you </v>

663
00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:46.810
<v Speaker 1>don't quite understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to show you how irritated I am that</v>

664
00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I happen to be acting out the destiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've put forward for me.</v>

665
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.070
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's part of the Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

666
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.980
<v Speaker 1>And then that pulls in the whole parent </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and you know it's,</v>

667
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.840
<v Speaker 1>these are bottomless pits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often when you,</v>

668
00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:01.810
<v Speaker 1>when you're in the world and something </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects to you,</v>

669
00:31:01.811 --> 00:31:02.644
<v Speaker 1>something that matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects to you then in the entire </v>

670
00:31:06.101 --> 00:31:08.800
<v Speaker 1>unrealized world is in that thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects,</v>

671
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:09.634
<v Speaker 1>it's all tangled up inside it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's the great dragon of </v>

672
00:31:11.831 --> 00:31:12.664
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everything that's outside of your </v>

673
00:31:14.381 --> 00:31:16.720
<v Speaker 1>conceptual structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is that?</v>

674
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.000
<v Speaker 1>It's everything that lurks outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

675
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.103
<v Speaker 1>of your walled city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's manifested itself like the </v>

676
00:31:22.871 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 1>snake in the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the easiest thing to do is say,</v>

677
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not having anything to do with that.</v>

678
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.250
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

679
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.650
<v Speaker 1>you get your c minus and you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it.</v>

680
00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a little bitter and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful in your study.</v>

681
00:31:35.081 --> 00:31:35.914
<v Speaker 1>Habits get a little worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next time you get like a d plus </v>

682
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.680
<v Speaker 1>and then you collect a bunch of f's and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you stopped going to school,</v>

683
00:31:41.681 --> 00:31:44.140
<v Speaker 1>then you stop showering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

684
00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Then you end up jumping off the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's uh,</v>

685
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:48.063
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how the dragon eats you when you </v>

686
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:52.390
<v Speaker 1>don't pay attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's no bloody wonder that people</v>

687
00:31:52.391 --> 00:31:53.500
<v Speaker 1>avoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

688
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.573
<v Speaker 1>it's really no wonder that they avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>because error messages contain within </v>

689
00:31:58.391 --> 00:31:59.224
<v Speaker 1>them the implicit world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the upside of that is while they </v>

690
00:32:03.461 --> 00:32:07.300
<v Speaker 1>contain within them the implicit world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the world isn't all negative,</v>

691
00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:08.134
<v Speaker 1>and so maybe you get your c minus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually the best gift you ever </v>

692
00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:14.080
<v Speaker 1>got because somebody finally took you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and went whack,</v>

693
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:15.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clue in.</v>

694
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.800
<v Speaker 1>And so you take that apart and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

695
00:32:17.801 --> 00:32:18.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to write.</v>

696
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never read anything in my life.</v>

697
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.190
<v Speaker 1>My study habits are a Bismal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

698
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:26.800
<v Speaker 1>like maybe I'm working at 2% efficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

699
00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.630
<v Speaker 1>which is probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would suspect that,</v>

700
00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you aren't doing that,</v>

701
00:32:30.611 --> 00:32:31.444
<v Speaker 1>but I bet you that I bet there's 30 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 50% of the people in the room are </v>

702
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:37.990
<v Speaker 1>working at 2% efficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you got it.</v>

703
00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.850
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to find that out is so optimistic.</v>

704
00:32:40.851 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're barely hanging in there,</v>

705
00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 1>but you're only working out 2% you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine what you could have as a life if</v>

706
00:32:46.701 --> 00:32:50.450
<v Speaker 1>you work at at like 50% so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

707
00:32:50.451 --> 00:32:53.210
<v Speaker 1>the c minus can be the best gift you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever had.</v>

708
00:32:53.211 --> 00:32:55.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's the gold that the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>hordes,</v>

709
00:32:55.071 --> 00:32:55.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

710
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

711
00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.593
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're moving from point a to point </v>

712
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:03.350
<v Speaker 1>b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In your little circumscribed world,</v>

713
00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:06.320
<v Speaker 1>you've made everything invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as long as that works,</v>

714
00:33:06.321 --> 00:33:08.750
<v Speaker 1>then your theory is good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's accurate enough.</v>

715
00:33:08.751 --> 00:33:11.000
<v Speaker 1>It's true enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in your little paradise.</v>

716
00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.073
<v Speaker 1>But if something comes up and objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's where your character is </v>

717
00:33:15.891 --> 00:33:18.560
<v Speaker 1>tested fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the character test.</v>

718
00:33:18.561 --> 00:33:20.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with messages of error?</v>

719
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's a tricky issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

720
00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:27.500
<v Speaker 1>so here's a solution to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what not to do.</v>

721
00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I am a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to see mice.</v>

722
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.943
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might as well just go jump off the </v>

723
00:33:32.301 --> 00:33:33.140
<v Speaker 1>bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

724
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.280
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

725
00:33:34.281 --> 00:33:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Because what that means is that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

726
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:37.813
<v Speaker 1>every time you try to learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make a mistake because </v>

727
00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:41.360
<v Speaker 1>what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're gonna make mistakes.</v>

728
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.640
<v Speaker 1>And if the rule is every time you make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>

729
00:33:43.641 --> 00:33:48.050
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go jump off the bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's not a useful problem solving</v>

730
00:33:48.051 --> 00:33:50.810
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you make a mistake,</v>

731
00:33:50.811 --> 00:33:53.840
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to beat yourself to death </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a club.</v>

732
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.213
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll have your internal tyrant in </v>

733
00:33:57.111 --> 00:33:59.360
<v Speaker 1>there who's perfectly happy about doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

734
00:33:59.361 --> 00:34:00.490
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

735
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.560
<v Speaker 1>overactive superego that Freud talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

736
00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:04.394
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it came to you via a parent who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was too authoritarian or a grandparent </v>

737
00:34:07.971 --> 00:34:08.804
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's just you cause you're </v>

738
00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:13.940
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable in neurotic and so you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>take yours or had hyper conscientious,</v>

739
00:34:13.941 --> 00:34:17.600
<v Speaker 1>you'll take yourself apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well starting the,</v>

740
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:22.790
<v Speaker 1>so you've got a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something has objected to you,</v>

741
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 1>then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

742
00:34:24.891 --> 00:34:25.910
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

743
00:34:25.911 --> 00:34:27.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not looking at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

744
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your goals are wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not acting properly.</v>

745
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.011
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

746
00:34:31.011 --> 00:34:35.420
<v Speaker 1>so the question that arises when an </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle emerges is,</v>

747
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:40.370
<v Speaker 1>which part of this structure needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention?</v>

748
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.653
<v Speaker 1>And the first answer can't be all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why when you're arguing with </v>

749
00:34:46.011 --> 00:34:46.844
<v Speaker 1>someone in an intimate relationship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're angry at them and you want to </v>

750
00:34:50.391 --> 00:34:52.010
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a big mistake,</v>

751
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.360
<v Speaker 1>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say,</v>

752
00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.780
<v Speaker 1>well you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're like,</v>

753
00:34:56.781 --> 00:34:59.300
<v Speaker 1>here's another 10 examples of how you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>done that in the past.</v>

754
00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.700
<v Speaker 1>And I can new rate more of them if you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

755
00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.890
<v Speaker 1>And so it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually what you like.</v>

756
00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:04.724
<v Speaker 1>And I tried fixing it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it looks like you're going to be </v>

757
00:35:06.861 --> 00:35:09.230
<v Speaker 1>like that up into the future and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically saying to them,</v>

758
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:10.303
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a bad person and the only thing </v>

759
00:35:11.511 --> 00:35:12.344
<v Speaker 1>they can do is either collapse or punch </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and punching you is actually better </v>

760
00:35:16.101 --> 00:35:16.970
<v Speaker 1>than collapsing.</v>

761
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.930
<v Speaker 1>But you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

762
00:35:17.931 --> 00:35:19.880
<v Speaker 1>It's such a counterproductive way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing.</v>

763
00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.013
<v Speaker 1>You don't leave the person any out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe while they're civilized so </v>

764
00:35:24.171 --> 00:35:25.004
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that's good and maybe it </v>

765
00:35:26.961 --> 00:35:27.794
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they end up either really not </v>

766
00:35:29.181 --> 00:35:30.014
<v Speaker 1>happy with you in a way that they will </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest the first possible opportunity </v>

767
00:35:32.871 --> 00:35:34.970
<v Speaker 1>they get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they have to go off in the corner and</v>

768
00:35:34.971 --> 00:35:35.804
<v Speaker 1>cringe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

769
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.861
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won.</v>

770
00:35:36.861 --> 00:35:39.780
<v Speaker 1>It's now your partners either hates you </v>
<v Speaker 1>or is cringing.</v>

771
00:35:39.781 --> 00:35:42.780
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real good victory band cry rack</v>

772
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:43.614
<v Speaker 1>up about a hundred victories like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll be in divorce court and </v>

773
00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:49.770
<v Speaker 1>spending $250,000 while being miserable </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

774
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

775
00:35:51.631 --> 00:35:54.270
<v Speaker 1>so something objects to you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

776
00:35:54.271 --> 00:35:55.104
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I need to,</v>

777
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I need to take myself apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

778
00:35:57.781 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 1>because there's a piece that's broken </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and then you might think,</v>

779
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:01.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

780
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 1>let's assume it's a little pace to begin</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

781
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.610
<v Speaker 1>That's the right mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

782
00:36:05.611 --> 00:36:07.410
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a c minus</v>

783
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:09.773
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't prove that you're stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now it implies that you might be </v>

784
00:36:13.111 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't.</v>

785
00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really it does.</v>

786
00:36:15.121 --> 00:36:16.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you don't want to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

787
00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:17.124
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it applies that you're lazier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implies that you're ignorant or like it </v>

788
00:36:19.651 --> 00:36:20.484
<v Speaker 1>implies all sorts of terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might imply that you're a bad person </v>

789
00:36:22.951 --> 00:36:24.990
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to leap to that.</v>

790
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:28.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of the proclamation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocence before guilt.</v>

791
00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Assume that you're the least amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible and ignorant possible.</v>

792
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.660
<v Speaker 1>And so then you look at the micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>routines,</v>

793
00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:39.300
<v Speaker 1>it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I got a c minus in this course,</v>

794
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:44.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should study for that course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes more a day for the next three</v>

795
00:36:45.211 --> 00:36:47.430
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you ask yourself,</v>

796
00:36:47.431 --> 00:36:48.780
<v Speaker 1>do you think you could do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

797
00:36:48.781 --> 00:36:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm too useless.</v>

798
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about 15 minutes every second day?</v>

799
00:36:52.171 --> 00:36:53.004
<v Speaker 1>You think you could do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put it in your schedule like 15 </v>

800
00:36:55.081 --> 00:36:58.650
<v Speaker 1>minutes every second day in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's while you think,</v>

801
00:36:58.651 --> 00:36:59.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with me?</v>

802
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:00.623
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not very good at managing my study </v>

803
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:03.804
<v Speaker 1>schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not quite down here at the </v>

804
00:37:05.011 --> 00:37:07.650
<v Speaker 1>behavioral level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty close because what you,</v>

805
00:37:07.651 --> 00:37:08.484
<v Speaker 1>you can take an action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can open up your schedule and you </v>

806
00:37:10.141 --> 00:37:11.190
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh mark,</v>

807
00:37:11.191 --> 00:37:14.250
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes away aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can practice doing that.</v>

808
00:37:14.251 --> 00:37:15.084
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty low level in the hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>means while you're still not a horrible </v>

809
00:37:18.121 --> 00:37:18.954
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just got to polish up your work </v>

810
00:37:20.641 --> 00:37:23.130
<v Speaker 1>ethic and so what you want to do is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>

811
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:25.260
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the L.</v>

812
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adage.</v>

813
00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:26.603
<v Speaker 1>You got to stand up for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to make unnecessary </v>

814
00:37:28.411 --> 00:37:30.540
<v Speaker 1>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hots are really good thing to know.</v>

815
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like shut the hell up most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

816
00:37:32.761 --> 00:37:33.594
<v Speaker 1>but now and then you don't shut up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's time to say something you </v>

817
00:37:36.271 --> 00:37:37.104
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to make unnecessary </v>

818
00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:38.934
<v Speaker 1>enemies though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

819
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to take yourself apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>any more than is absolutely necessary.</v>

820
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Start little and you do that with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you to like if you have a child,</v>

821
00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 1>you know and the child does something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't right,</v>

822
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

823
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.163
<v Speaker 1>minimal necessary intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we do to decrease the </v>

824
00:37:54.841 --> 00:37:57.120
<v Speaker 1>probability that that's going to occur </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future?</v>

825
00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>

826
00:37:59.361 --> 00:38:01.140
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good thing to know with </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

827
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's also a good thing to know with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your partners.</v>

828
00:38:03.091 --> 00:38:04.500
<v Speaker 1>You have having an argument with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

829
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.420
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you want?</v>

830
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:11.070
<v Speaker 1>What's the minimum thing you can request</v>
<v Speaker 1>from them that would satisfy you and the</v>

831
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:14.550
<v Speaker 1>evil part of your soul is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them cringing in the corner.</v>

832
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:15.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

833
00:38:15.871 --> 00:38:17.760
<v Speaker 1>get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get that stuff under control,</v>

834
00:38:17.761 --> 00:38:18.594
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can figure out what the </v>

835
00:38:19.871 --> 00:38:23.160
<v Speaker 1>person could offer you that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimal that you would accept.</v>

836
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.960
<v Speaker 1>And then tell them that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

837
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.720
<v Speaker 1>here's the words I would like you to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the apology.</v>

838
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:28.554
<v Speaker 1>I would like you to formulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that you think you did </v>

839
00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:33.030
<v Speaker 1>something wrong when you have to argue </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that because maybe you didn't.</v>

840
00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:36.580
<v Speaker 1>But if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to specify precisely and narrowly</v>

841
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:37.623
<v Speaker 1>and I want to give you an escape route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know you might only be able to </v>

842
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:43.720
<v Speaker 1>do it badly because you're still mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you apologize.</v>

843
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:44.554
<v Speaker 1>Halfheartedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get a pat on the head for </v>

844
00:38:45.731 --> 00:38:46.564
<v Speaker 1>that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next time it'll be 51% not </v>

845
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.490
<v Speaker 1>halfheartedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

846
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.353
<v Speaker 1>So it's careful training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's careful training of yourself and </v>

847
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:57.460
<v Speaker 1>other people with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the goal in mind,</v>

848
00:38:57.461 --> 00:39:01.060
<v Speaker 1>but also with the least amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>harshness possible.</v>

849
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.570
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing to do as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is also true for you,</v>

850
00:39:04.571 --> 00:39:05.404
<v Speaker 1>and this is something I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying the behaviorist is like watch </v>

851
00:39:07.901 --> 00:39:08.734
<v Speaker 1>the people around you like a hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever they do something that you </v>

852
00:39:10.991 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 1>think is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell them,</v>

853
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:14.740
<v Speaker 1>that's wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

854
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:15.723
<v Speaker 1>You'll get so far with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot bloody well believe it </v>

855
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:19.440
<v Speaker 1>because most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

856
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:20.343
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of any number of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things they're really </v>

857
00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:27.730
<v Speaker 1>afraid of is that now and then they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>creep out of their cynical shell and try</v>

858
00:39:27.731 --> 00:39:28.930
<v Speaker 1>to do something good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

859
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:31.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're popping out this thing</v>

860
00:39:31.691 --> 00:39:32.524
<v Speaker 1>that's unbelievably vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then try to do something good and creep </v>

861
00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.750
<v Speaker 1>right back into their persona and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll look around,</v>

862
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.880
<v Speaker 1>see if anyone noticed and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get punished for it.</v>

863
00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:44.410
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then they won't do it again.</v>

864
00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:47.560
<v Speaker 1>So don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then now and then you think,</v>

865
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:48.610
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw you do this.</v>

866
00:39:48.611 --> 00:39:50.230
<v Speaker 1>It was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was actually pretty good.</v>

867
00:39:50.231 --> 00:39:52.450
<v Speaker 1>And they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>

868
00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.510
<v Speaker 1>somebody noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

869
00:39:53.511 --> 00:39:55.480
<v Speaker 1>was like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll think,</v>

870
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:56.523
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

871
00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe I could do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to live with someone for</v>

872
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 1>a long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say every time they do something</v>

873
00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:07.120
<v Speaker 1>that you would like them to do more of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

874
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:11.260
<v Speaker 1>notice number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them right.</v>

875
00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Because I know you don't want to because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really want to dominate them and you</v>

876
00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:18.310
<v Speaker 1>don't want them thriving because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be,</v>

877
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:19.443
<v Speaker 1>they'd be competition to you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be able to go complain to your </v>

878
00:40:21.401 --> 00:40:23.500
<v Speaker 1>mother about what a miserable partner </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

879
00:40:23.501 --> 00:40:24.334
<v Speaker 1>And you know how delightful that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have to forego all that </v>

880
00:40:26.861 --> 00:40:29.270
<v Speaker 1>pleasure if you actually helped your </v>
<v Speaker 1>person developed.</v>

881
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.870
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to get over all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really annoying.</v>

882
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.550
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got this person,</v>

883
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:34.301
<v Speaker 1>peg does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

884
00:40:34.301 --> 00:40:35.700
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

885
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.633
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's the best you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got one eye open and then </v>

886
00:40:38.741 --> 00:40:40.810
<v Speaker 1>every time they do something good you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to notice.</v>

887
00:40:40.811 --> 00:40:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Because if that elevated them a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>

888
00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:43.714
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be able to feel so </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and miserable and keep your </v>

889
00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:49.270
<v Speaker 1>eye open for the next possible affair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is what people are like.</v>

890
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.300
<v Speaker 1>That is what people are like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're like too.</v>

891
00:40:52.301 --> 00:40:53.134
<v Speaker 1>That's what people are like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to decide if that's what </v>

892
00:40:55.301 --> 00:40:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you want or you want to help the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're with grow,</v>

893
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.030
<v Speaker 1>you know that's dangerous because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>might know shine you well good.</v>

894
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll have someone to compare </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to.</v>

895
00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.480
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a good deal.</v>

896
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:08.980
<v Speaker 1>It's really rough with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

897
00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:12.610
<v Speaker 1>because parents will stop their children</v>
<v Speaker 1>from succeeding beyond them.</v>

898
00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.013
<v Speaker 1>They get jealous and then they'll put </v>
<v Speaker 1>them down and then they have kids that </v>

899
00:41:17.891 --> 00:41:18.724
<v Speaker 1>do not like them and they'll pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I've figured </v>

900
00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:26.380
<v Speaker 1>out over the last years is this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good proposition.</v>

901
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:30.430
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty self evident that life is,</v>

902
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:33.100
<v Speaker 1>has got its rat's nest of miseries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

903
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.023
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could even make a categorical </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement that life is mostly a rat's </v>

904
00:41:36.741 --> 00:41:38.120
<v Speaker 1>nest of misery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

905
00:41:38.121 --> 00:41:40.160
<v Speaker 1>And you could make a pretty powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument for that.</v>

906
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.980
<v Speaker 1>But then there's a counter question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

907
00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:43.814
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you tried not to make it any </v>

908
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:47.060
<v Speaker 1>more miserable than it had to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

909
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what would it be like?</v>

910
00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.790
<v Speaker 1>And my suspicions are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a lot of that misery,</v>

911
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.713
<v Speaker 1>I would suspect that most of that misery</v>
<v Speaker 1>would go away because it's the </v>

912
00:41:56.121 --> 00:41:58.430
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary misery that really brings </v>
<v Speaker 1>you down.</v>

913
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:59.263
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

914
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone has cancer.</v>

915
00:42:00.681 --> 00:42:01.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sucks.</v>

916
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:06.080
<v Speaker 1>But it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you can say,</v>

917
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Speaker 1>if only we had done this differently </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that wouldn't have happened.</v>

918
00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:14.060
<v Speaker 1>But when someone's out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like torturing you in a malevolent way,</v>

919
00:42:14.061 --> 00:42:16.250
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're doing the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can always ask yourself,</v>

920
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:18.410
<v Speaker 1>was it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this really necessary?</v>

921
00:42:18.411 --> 00:42:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Is this just like a useless add on to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the miseries of life?</v>

922
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:25.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what disheartens people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even in your own life,</v>

923
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:26.450
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

924
00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:29.590
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you aren't suffering from selfimposed</v>

925
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:33.560
<v Speaker 1>misery and you're only suffering from an</v>
<v Speaker 1>escapable misery,</v>

926
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could handle that and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you could,</v>

927
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.420
<v Speaker 1>you could survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could bear it.</v>

928
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.140
<v Speaker 1>And even maybe without becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>irredeemably corrupt.</v>

929
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.520
<v Speaker 1>And so the goal would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

930
00:42:43.521 --> 00:42:45.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is a rat's nest of miseries.</v>

931
00:42:45.591 --> 00:42:47.510
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it has no ultimate meaning.</v>

932
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.570
<v Speaker 1>We could say that if we're feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly pessimistic,</v>

933
00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.910
<v Speaker 1>but it still leaves one question open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

934
00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:55.310
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't do everything you could to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it worse,</v>

935
00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:59.720
<v Speaker 1>how good could you make it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the least answer is,</v>

936
00:42:59.721 --> 00:43:00.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

937
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:02.780
<v Speaker 1>it could be tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not hell.</v>

938
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.020
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that that's,</v>

939
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.240
<v Speaker 1>that's the most pessimistic proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>

940
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:09.283
<v Speaker 1>The worst case outcome in the worst of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all possible worlds is that your life </v>

941
00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:14.300
<v Speaker 1>could be tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not hell.</v>

942
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's blood better than hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

943
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:17.743
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

944
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.820
<v Speaker 1>and you think I could give you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of the difference.</v>

945
00:43:19.821 --> 00:43:21.990
<v Speaker 1>You're at your mother's death bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

946
00:43:21.991 --> 00:43:24.740
<v Speaker 1>that's tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another scenario.</v>

947
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.020
<v Speaker 1>You're out of your mother's death bed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all you,</v>

948
00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:29.480
<v Speaker 1>you and all your idiot siblings are </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing.</v>

949
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.393
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and hell and you might be able </v>

950
00:43:33.741 --> 00:43:34.574
<v Speaker 1>to tolerate the first circumstance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would even bring you closer </v>

951
00:43:36.651 --> 00:43:38.060
<v Speaker 1>together with your family members.</v>

952
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.133
<v Speaker 1>The second one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one can bear that you walk away from </v>

953
00:43:41.811 --> 00:43:42.644
<v Speaker 1>a situation like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick of yourself and sick of everything </v>

954
00:43:45.111 --> 00:43:46.400
<v Speaker 1>else too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

955
00:43:46.401 --> 00:43:47.234
<v Speaker 1>it's often the case that tragic </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances bring out the dragons </v>

956
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.770
<v Speaker 1>because the stress is high and all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people haven't dealt with,</v>

957
00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:58.060
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the energy to repress </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

958
00:43:58.061 --> 00:44:00.260
<v Speaker 1>and all the bitterness comes pouring </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

959
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like seriously man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

960
00:44:03.161 --> 00:44:05.420
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a rough lesson,</v>

961
00:44:05.421 --> 00:44:07.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good hallmark for figuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>out whether or not you're,</v>

962
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.590
<v Speaker 1>you've got yourself adjusted properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in relationship to your siblings.</v>

963
00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:15.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you are all gathered around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bed,</v>

964
00:44:15.381 --> 00:44:18.680
<v Speaker 1>if someone close who was dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you manage it?</v>

965
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.020
<v Speaker 1>If the answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

966
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.033
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put your life together because it's </v>

967
00:44:22.881 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 1>going to happen and you should be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who's there that can do it and do</v>

968
00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:27.764
<v Speaker 1>it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you'd find that it isn't </v>

969
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.150
<v Speaker 1>the sort of thing that will undermine </v>
<v Speaker 1>your faith in life itself.</v>

970
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.120
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen both of those situations,</v>

971
00:44:36.121 --> 00:44:37.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly,</v>

972
00:44:37.081 --> 00:44:38.790
<v Speaker 1>ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly situations,</v>

973
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.333
<v Speaker 1>murderously ugly situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're opposite where people </v>

974
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:47.880
<v Speaker 1>have had terrible things happen and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to them as a family and you know,</v>

975
00:44:47.881 --> 00:44:48.714
<v Speaker 1>they pulled together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rebuild their damn ship and they </v>

976
00:44:52.051 --> 00:44:52.884
<v Speaker 1>sail away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems to me to be a lot </v>

977
00:44:54.961 --> 00:44:55.794
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

978
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

979
00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.560
<v Speaker 1>That makes you noah when the flood </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes.</v>

980
00:44:59.561 --> 00:45:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

981
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:01.990
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the same thing.</v>

982
00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question emerges,</v>

983
00:45:03.281 --> 00:45:04.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are you?</v>

984
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say</v>

985
00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.600
<v Speaker 1>you're this plan.</v>

986
00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

987
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what people usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how people usually identify.</v>

988
00:45:12.181 --> 00:45:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they have no plan at all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just in chaos.</v>

989
00:45:14.491 --> 00:45:15.324
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like being in the belly of the </v>

990
00:45:16.711 --> 00:45:18.420
<v Speaker 1>beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're nihilistic and chaos.</v>

991
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:20.760
<v Speaker 1>They have no plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just chaos itself.</v>

992
00:45:20.761 --> 00:45:23.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very dreadful situation for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to be in.</v>

993
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they conjured together a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's their identity.</v>

994
00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:29.100
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of fragile and they're holding</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto that with,</v>

995
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:29.963
<v Speaker 1>with everything they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's their little sticker would that </v>

996
00:45:31.411 --> 00:45:33.480
<v Speaker 1>they're floating in the ocean clinging </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

997
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're identifying really hard </v>

998
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:38.370
<v Speaker 1>with that plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when you're an idiot</v>

999
00:45:38.371 --> 00:45:41.190
<v Speaker 1>log is that you're identifying really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard with that plan.</v>

1000
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:44.210
<v Speaker 1>The problem is something comes up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>confront it.</v>

1001
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you act?</v>

1002
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:46.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't let go with a plan cause you </v>

1003
00:45:47.671 --> 00:45:48.504
<v Speaker 1>drown.</v>

1004
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1005
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Then you cling to it rigidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1006
00:45:50.641 --> 00:45:52.590
<v Speaker 1>that's no good because then you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn anything.</v>

1007
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Then if that's you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a totalitarian,</v>

1008
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:56.124
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to learn anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to end up in something </v>

1009
00:45:58.141 --> 00:45:58.974
<v Speaker 1>that's close enough to hell so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't know the difference and you might </v>

1010
00:46:00.721 --> 00:46:03.480
<v Speaker 1>drag everyone along with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's happened plenty of times,</v>

1011
00:46:03.481 --> 00:46:04.314
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole story of the 20th </v>

1012
00:46:05.131 --> 00:46:06.840
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened over and over and over,</v>

1013
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:07.943
<v Speaker 1>and it happens in people's states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to happens in their business </v>

1014
00:46:11.521 --> 00:46:13.530
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens in their cities.</v>

1015
00:46:13.531 --> 00:46:16.320
<v Speaker 1>It happens in their provinces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens in their states,</v>

1016
00:46:16.321 --> 00:46:19.620
<v Speaker 1>and it happens in their psyches all at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

1017
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.173
<v Speaker 1>You can't blame the manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing on any of those one </v>

1018
00:46:24.421 --> 00:46:27.420
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens when a society goes down that</v>

1019
00:46:27.421 --> 00:46:28.254
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes down everywhere at the same </v>

1020
00:46:29.461 --> 00:46:29.700
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1021
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.533
<v Speaker 1>It's not the totalitarians at the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the happy people striving to be </v>

1022
00:46:33.631 --> 00:46:35.760
<v Speaker 1>free at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that at all.</v>

1023
00:46:35.761 --> 00:46:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's totalitarianism at every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of the hierarchy,</v>

1024
00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:41.850
<v Speaker 1>including the psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't want to be the thing.</v>

1025
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

1026
00:46:43.621 --> 00:46:44.454
<v Speaker 1>But you don't want to be the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>clings so desperately to the raft that </v>

1027
00:46:47.431 --> 00:46:50.400
<v Speaker 1>you can't let go when someone comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rescue you.</v>

1028
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be that.</v>

1029
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:53.880
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1030
00:46:53.881 --> 00:46:56.490
<v Speaker 1>exactly what are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not the chaos.</v>

1031
00:46:56.491 --> 00:46:57.324
<v Speaker 1>You're not the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're the thing that confronts </v>

1032
00:47:00.521 --> 00:47:01.354
<v Speaker 1>the obstacle.</v>

1033
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1034
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.500
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's the categorical </v>
<v Speaker 1>lesson of</v>

1035
00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:05.860
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1036
00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Of psychology in so far as it has to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with personal transformation,</v>

1037
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.460
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you always teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in psychotherapy.</v>

1038
00:47:12.461 --> 00:47:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapist you are,</v>

1039
00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:15.550
<v Speaker 1>you're always teaching them the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1040
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:19.570
<v Speaker 1>You're the thing that you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not the plan.</v>

1041
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.180
<v Speaker 1>You're the thing that can confront the </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle to the plant.</v>

1042
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:26.020
<v Speaker 1>And then when you know even further that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the obstacle is not only an obstacle but</v>

1043
00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:29.080
<v Speaker 1>opportunity itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then your whole view,</v>

1044
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 1>the world can change because you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1045
00:47:30.761 --> 00:47:31.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got this plan.</v>

1046
00:47:31.661 --> 00:47:32.494
<v Speaker 1>Something came up to object to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's possible that the thing </v>

1047
00:47:36.131 --> 00:47:36.964
<v Speaker 1>that's objecting has something to teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that will take you to the place </v>

1048
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 1>where you develop an even better plat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a nice framework to use.</v>

1049
00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:45.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you so sure that this is a problem?</v>

1050
00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Is that the only way that you can look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it?</v>

1051
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Or is it an opportunity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1052
00:47:50.141 --> 00:47:51.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1053
00:47:51.221 --> 00:47:54.460
<v Speaker 1>naively optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some things that's pretty hard</v>

1054
00:47:54.461 --> 00:47:55.294
<v Speaker 1>to extract gold from some dragons and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the death of a family member is a </v>

1055
00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:00.870
<v Speaker 1>good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in even in a situation like that,</v>

1056
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that it's an opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1057
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.640
<v Speaker 1>it's an opportunity for maturation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

1058
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.740
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

1059
00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:09.574
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty miserable to go to be </v>

1060
00:48:11.111 --> 00:48:13.660
<v Speaker 1>digging for gold when someone's falling </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the grave.</v>

1061
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they really love you,</v>

1062
00:48:15.101 --> 00:48:16.990
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they'll want you to do.</v>

1063
00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:18.183
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make their death a lot </v>

1064
00:48:19.061 --> 00:48:22.720
<v Speaker 1>more palatable experience for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're someone who can be in the room</v>

1065
00:48:22.721 --> 00:48:24.330
<v Speaker 1>and be helpful instead of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1066
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.173
<v Speaker 1>quivering in the corner and feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire world is collapsing in on </v>

1067
00:48:27.611 --> 00:48:28.361
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1068
00:48:28.361 --> 00:48:29.194
<v Speaker 1>that's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be the useful person at the </v>

1069
00:48:30.971 --> 00:48:31.804
<v Speaker 1>funeral.</v>

1070
00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.570
<v Speaker 1>How's that for a goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good goal,</v>

1071
00:48:34.571 --> 00:48:35.404
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that you've got yourself </v>

1072
00:48:36.671 --> 00:48:37.504
<v Speaker 1>together in a situation like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to be at them and </v>

1073
00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:43.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe you want to be the person on whose</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder people cry.</v>

1074
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.730
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a good goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's Kinda,</v>

1075
00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:48.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like being naively optimistic.</v>

1076
00:48:48.221 --> 00:48:49.810
<v Speaker 1>So when I tell you to get your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

1077
00:48:49.811 --> 00:48:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say roses and sunshine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's,</v>

1078
00:48:53.791 --> 00:48:54.624
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1079
00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:55.493
<v Speaker 1>that's Pablum for fools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it really is something to be the </v>

1080
00:48:59.141 --> 00:49:01.780
<v Speaker 1>reliable person at a funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1081
00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:05.950
<v Speaker 1>And you can aim it that you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be tough to do that because it</v>

1082
00:49:05.951 --> 00:49:06.784
<v Speaker 1>also means that you can sustain a major </v>
<v Speaker 1>loss without collapsing and that you've </v>

1083
00:49:12.101 --> 00:49:13.810
<v Speaker 1>got to be a monster to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1084
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Because you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've had clients like this,</v>

1085
00:49:15.731 --> 00:49:18.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my child.</v>

1086
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I love my mother so much that I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive if anything happened to them.</v>

1087
00:49:23.141 --> 00:49:27.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have some serious thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do about that.</v>

1088
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like you really want to curse </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone with that kind of love.</v>

1089
00:49:30.581 --> 00:49:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't live without you.</v>

1090
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:36.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away from me.</v>

1091
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

1092
00:49:38.621 --> 00:49:39.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the depaul mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1093
00:49:39.941 --> 00:49:43.300
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll forgive you no matter what you do.</v>

1094
00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:48.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like really no matter what I do a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are not my friend.</v>

1095
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.830
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

1096
00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:53.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible thing to do to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1097
00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:57.130
<v Speaker 1>that's the witch in Hansel and Gretel </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

1098
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.660
<v Speaker 1>all gingerbread and outside to the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid inside.</v>

1099
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.960
<v Speaker 1>You feed them candy and make them fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and eat them.</v>

1100
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Hansel and Gretel.</v>

1101
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.863
<v Speaker 1>That's the oedipal mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of Freud's major discoveries </v>

1102
00:50:10.271 --> 00:50:14.500
<v Speaker 1>if gets a major discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the devouring force of love.</v>

1103
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:15.933
<v Speaker 1>You want the person to be able to stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their own and the price you pay for </v>

1104
00:50:18.041 --> 00:50:22.510
<v Speaker 1>that is that you stand on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like good to have you around.</v>

1105
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Glad you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>

1106
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.233
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if tragedies when and if and when </v>

1107
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 1>tragedy strikes either</v>

1108
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:28.993
<v Speaker 3>of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that one of us is standing when </v>

1109
00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:34.440
<v Speaker 3>it blows past and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that there's a harshness about that.</v>

1110
00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.380
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably cruel cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

1111
00:50:36.381 --> 00:50:39.590
<v Speaker 3>well if my mother died I could live </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1112
00:50:39.591 --> 00:50:40.424
<v Speaker 3>what kind of monster are you exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need the death of your mother </v>

1113
00:50:42.621 --> 00:50:44.540
<v Speaker 3>doesn't do you in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1114
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:46.460
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that being a monster is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right thing.</v>

1115
00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.240
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a rough thing to learn,</v>

1116
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.360
<v Speaker 3>but it's necessary to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1117
00:50:53.361 --> 00:50:54.620
<v Speaker 3>cause it also makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1118
00:50:54.621 --> 00:50:55.880
<v Speaker 3>at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1119
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.073
<v Speaker 3>as you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the time you were in your mid </v>

1120
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:00.913
<v Speaker 3>twenties something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should start having a relationship </v>

1121
00:51:03.861 --> 00:51:07.670
<v Speaker 3>with your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's approximately one of peers.</v>

1122
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:11.180
<v Speaker 3>And you can tell if you have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's a little trick you can use.</v>

1123
00:51:11.181 --> 00:51:14.390
<v Speaker 3>So you have parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously they have friends,</v>

1124
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:15.980
<v Speaker 3>you probably care what your parents </v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

1125
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:17.023
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you care what their friends think of </v>

1126
00:51:18.531 --> 00:51:20.360
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And answer to that is,</v>

1127
00:51:20.361 --> 00:51:21.560
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not nearly as much.</v>

1128
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:22.423
<v Speaker 3>And so then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why do you care what your parents </v>

1129
00:51:23.601 --> 00:51:26.180
<v Speaker 3>think of you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there are the same people.</v>

1130
00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:27.493
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just luck of the draw that your </v>

1131
00:51:29.451 --> 00:51:31.670
<v Speaker 3>parents or someone else's kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>

1132
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:34.610
<v Speaker 3>they don't think the same way about them</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you do.</v>

1133
00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:36.620
<v Speaker 3>That's where you see that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>projection,</v>

1134
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:38.203
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If by the time you're 30 if what your </v>

1135
00:51:39.111 --> 00:51:41.180
<v Speaker 3>parents think of you matters more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1136
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:43.730
<v Speaker 3>say a random set of their friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of you,</v>

1137
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000
<v Speaker 3>then you've still got your parents </v>
<v Speaker 3>confused with with God.</v>

1138
00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:47.893
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've still got them confused with an </v>

1139
00:51:50.211 --> 00:51:53.180
<v Speaker 3>archetype and you're still a child and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you might think,</v>

1140
00:51:53.181 --> 00:51:54.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty damn rude not to think about</v>

1141
00:51:54.741 --> 00:51:56.720
<v Speaker 3>what your parents think of you anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to care.</v>

1142
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:57.681
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1143
00:51:57.681 --> 00:52:00.080
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of rude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you'll be useful for them when</v>

1144
00:52:00.081 --> 00:52:03.740
<v Speaker 3>they get old and that's a much better </v>
<v Speaker 3>form of caring.</v>

1145
00:52:03.741 --> 00:52:04.574
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're going to be independent</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough and strong enough and and </v>

1146
00:52:07.221 --> 00:52:10.220
<v Speaker 3>detached enough so that when the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the,</v>

1147
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:13.100
<v Speaker 3>when the power dynamic shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it will,</v>

1148
00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.593
<v Speaker 3>that you'll be the person that can carry</v>
<v Speaker 3>things forward while you can't do a </v>

1149
00:52:18.081 --> 00:52:20.060
<v Speaker 3>better thing for them than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1150
00:52:20.061 --> 00:52:22.670
<v Speaker 3>That's the best of all possible outcomes</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your parents.</v>

1151
00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:34.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think about the world this way.</v>

1152
00:52:34.021 --> 00:52:34.854
<v Speaker 3>You can think about it as you're orderly</v>
<v Speaker 3>little plan that's a place and you can </v>

1153
00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:41.400
<v Speaker 3>think about it as the place that things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that disrupt your plan comes from.</v>

1154
00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:46.080
<v Speaker 3>That's another place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a bigger place than this because</v>

1155
00:52:46.081 --> 00:52:46.914
<v Speaker 3>there's an endless number of things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>can disrupt your plan and only a tiny </v>

1156
00:52:49.831 --> 00:52:51.660
<v Speaker 3>number of them that can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1157
00:52:51.661 --> 00:52:55.140
<v Speaker 3>that will help you work it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So part of the question then too is like</v>

1158
00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.393
<v Speaker 3>are you the friend of your plan or are </v>
<v Speaker 3>you the friend of the thing that </v>

1159
00:52:58.801 --> 00:52:59.634
<v Speaker 3>disrupts your plan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say you should work to </v>

1160
00:53:01.921 --> 00:53:05.310
<v Speaker 3>become the friend of the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>disrupts your plan because there's a lot</v>

1161
00:53:05.311 --> 00:53:08.460
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you become the friend of the</v>

1162
00:53:08.461 --> 00:53:11.270
<v Speaker 3>thing that disrupts your plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you be,</v>

1163
00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:13.710
<v Speaker 3>you start to develop strengths in </v>
<v Speaker 3>proportion to the,</v>

1164
00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.650
<v Speaker 3>to the disruptive force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's really what you want.</v>

1165
00:53:16.651 --> 00:53:18.480
<v Speaker 3>You want to be able to implement your </v>
<v Speaker 3>plan obviously,</v>

1166
00:53:18.481 --> 00:53:19.314
<v Speaker 3>but you want to be able to take on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of error and learn from it </v>

1167
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you win</v>

1168
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.620
<v Speaker 1>constantly because even if something </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes sideways,</v>

1169
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:31.590
<v Speaker 1>you think there's something to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>derived from this.</v>

1170
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:37.190
<v Speaker 1>That's wisdom fundamentally so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the eternal domains,</v>

1171
00:53:37.741 --> 00:53:38.574
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the domain of order that's a </v>

1172
00:53:40.741 --> 00:53:41.574
<v Speaker 1>snake by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a domain of chaos and that's </v>

1173
00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:45.384
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you're in the order and maybe </v>

1174
00:53:48.301 --> 00:53:49.134
<v Speaker 1>you're in the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those can flip on you and maybe you </v>

1175
00:53:51.031 --> 00:53:53.820
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be in either of those places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should be right in the middle</v>

1176
00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:57.710
<v Speaker 1>and that's where you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell,</v>

1177
00:53:57.711 --> 00:53:58.544
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is another escape from postmodern </v>

1178
00:54:01.311 --> 00:54:03.980
<v Speaker 1>nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that's actually a real place.</v>

1179
00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:08.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not metaphysical or maybe it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's metaphysical.</v>

1180
00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.790
<v Speaker 1>If metaphysics is more real than </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>

1181
00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:11.803
<v Speaker 1>and you can tell when you're at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>place because that's a maximally </v>

1182
00:54:13.551 --> 00:54:16.820
<v Speaker 1>meaningful place and you drift in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of it all the time in your life,</v>

1183
00:54:16.821 --> 00:54:19.730
<v Speaker 1>and when things are really bad for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not there hardly at all,</v>

1184
00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everything's overwhelming.</v>

1185
00:54:21.561 --> 00:54:22.394
<v Speaker 1>Your or things have become sterile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you watch your life even over a </v>

1186
00:54:26.271 --> 00:54:27.104
<v Speaker 1>week or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that now and then you're </v>

1187
00:54:28.071 --> 00:54:29.600
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1188
00:54:29.601 --> 00:54:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Stand up straighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1189
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're in the right place at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right time and you think,</v>

1190
00:54:33.831 --> 00:54:34.664
<v Speaker 1>Aha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got the forces of chaos and order </v>

1191
00:54:36.471 --> 00:54:37.460
<v Speaker 1>properly balanced.</v>

1192
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:40.040
<v Speaker 1>It's unstable and it'll fall apart on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1193
00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:40.903
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can practice bringing things </v>

1194
00:54:42.861 --> 00:54:43.694
<v Speaker 1>together continually and then you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>end up so that you're there more often </v>

1195
00:54:46.671 --> 00:54:48.620
<v Speaker 1>than not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's,</v>

1196
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.530
<v Speaker 1>that's a metta place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a place,</v>

1197
00:54:51.531 --> 00:54:56.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a metta place and it's a place that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be in all places and,</v>

1198
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's not an illusion of any sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the deepest reality.</v>

1199
00:54:59.571 --> 00:55:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Your nervous system is always orienting </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1200
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Your is always orienting you to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>place always.</v>

1201
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.970
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because it's a real place.</v>

1202
00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:12.140
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the normal world</v>

1203
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.110
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the garden with the snake in it.</v>

1204
00:55:16.111 --> 00:55:16.944
<v Speaker 1>And that's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the chaos that arises when your </v>

1205
00:55:18.871 --> 00:55:19.980
<v Speaker 1>plans collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1206
00:55:19.981 --> 00:55:20.814
<v Speaker 1>That's the world and the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the underworld is always there </v>

1207
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:23.694
<v Speaker 1>and it's lurking beneath everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the figure of the shark and </v>

1208
00:55:26.101 --> 00:55:26.934
<v Speaker 1>the jaws poster right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are swinging at the top and there's </v>

1209
00:55:29.761 --> 00:55:32.640
<v Speaker 1>that terrible thing underneath that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up and pull you down.</v>

1210
00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:33.683
<v Speaker 1>That's the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to be able to operate here </v>

1211
00:55:36.331 --> 00:55:39.150
<v Speaker 1>and you need to be able to operate here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you operate here,</v>

1212
00:55:39.151 --> 00:55:42.840
<v Speaker 1>well that's when you rescue your father </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the belly of the whale.</v>

1213
00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:44.723
<v Speaker 1>That's when you go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see when you're down in chaos and </v>

1214
00:55:46.291 --> 00:55:47.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what the hell is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1215
00:55:47.581 --> 00:55:49.740
<v Speaker 1>You have to rediscover the values that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orient.</v>

1216
00:55:49.741 --> 00:55:52.860
<v Speaker 1>People have oriented people forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you have to discover.</v>

1217
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.113
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm dealing with people who have </v>

1218
00:55:55.141 --> 00:55:55.974
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've usually encountered someone </v>

1219
00:55:58.111 --> 00:55:58.944
<v Speaker 1>malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to relearn the description of </v>

1220
00:56:01.201 --> 00:56:04.410
<v Speaker 1>good and evil because if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd have no framework.</v>

1221
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:06.180
<v Speaker 1>They're lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>

1222
00:56:06.181 --> 00:56:07.014
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a malevolence afoot in the </v>

1223
00:56:08.101 --> 00:56:10.200
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a naive,</v>

1224
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm a naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a prey animal,</v>

1225
00:56:13.891 --> 00:56:16.320
<v Speaker 1>a naive prey animal for the malevolence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

1226
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:16.861
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1227
00:56:16.861 --> 00:56:19.020
<v Speaker 1>good luck functioning under that set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions,</v>

1228
00:56:19.021 --> 00:56:21.300
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just do not recover from that.</v>

1229
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 1>You stay at home in your borough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>

1230
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:25.661
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

1231
00:56:25.661 --> 00:56:27.010
<v Speaker 1>you go down into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1232
00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:29.530
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well malevolence is afoot.</v>

1233
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I better be the sort of person that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it and deal with it.</v>

1234
00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:36.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's another reason why you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to transform yourself into a monster.</v>

1235
00:56:36.701 --> 00:56:40.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the young Ian Incorporation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shadow.</v>

1236
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.983
<v Speaker 1>It's no bloody joke because the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that a monster won't mess with is </v>

1237
00:56:45.341 --> 00:56:46.660
<v Speaker 1>another monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

1238
00:56:46.661 --> 00:56:47.494
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to transfer myself into a </v>

1239
00:56:48.341 --> 00:56:50.080
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't have a choice.</v>

1240
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:54.970
<v Speaker 1>You can either be a pathetic monster or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be a monster with some power.</v>

1241
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Those are your options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no non monster alternative,</v>

1242
00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.253
<v Speaker 1>weak or strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean strong like dominating </v>

1243
00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:04.390
<v Speaker 1>tyrant strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what I mean at all.</v>

1244
00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.373
<v Speaker 1>I mean strength like functioning at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>funeral strength and that's a kind of </v>

1245
00:57:09.431 --> 00:57:11.710
<v Speaker 1>monstrosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're down in chaos,</v>

1246
00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:16.740
<v Speaker 1>that's what you have to rediscover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's partly what that means.</v>

1247
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:18.763
<v Speaker 1>You're lucky if you come back out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember I told you the story of </v>

1248
00:57:20.801 --> 00:57:21.634
<v Speaker 1>Jonah at the beginning of the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like he had something to do and was </v>

1249
00:57:24.551 --> 00:57:28.360
<v Speaker 1>refusing to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so God pulled him down to the depths</v>

1250
00:57:28.361 --> 00:57:30.940
<v Speaker 1>of being and threatened him with death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but worse,</v>

1251
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 1>not just death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell really?</v>

1252
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he decided it was better to come popping</v>

1253
00:57:36.401 --> 00:57:38.980
<v Speaker 1>up back into the light and go do what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was supposed to do.</v>

1254
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:40.203
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason that that like that's </v>

1255
00:57:45.521 --> 00:57:46.354
<v Speaker 1>the oldest story of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you as far back as you go into the </v>

1256
00:57:48.941 --> 00:57:51.850
<v Speaker 1>archives of history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find this story right?</v>

1257
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:53.343
<v Speaker 1>And it's because,</v>

1258
00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:59.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because not only is it because it's</v>

1259
00:57:59.141 --> 00:57:59.974
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's true and everyone </v>

1260
00:58:01.151 --> 00:58:03.160
<v Speaker 1>knows it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though they don't know that.</v>

1261
00:58:03.161 --> 00:58:06.220
<v Speaker 1>They know that this is the story too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

1262
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:09.580
<v Speaker 1>There's always a city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always enclosed,</v>

1263
00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:13.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always people who inhabit it.</v>

1264
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:17.590
<v Speaker 1>There's always someone who's willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that the dragon hasn't gone away,</v>

1265
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:18.703
<v Speaker 1>is skulls are still around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's someone who's willing to come </v>

1266
00:58:20.621 --> 00:58:23.920
<v Speaker 1>out of the fortress and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take that on.</v>

1267
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:25.083
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to prefer perform the job of </v>

1268
00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:28.960
<v Speaker 1>rescuing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an eternal story.</v>

1269
00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Are you the city?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are You the Dragon?</v>

1270
00:58:31.691 --> 00:58:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Are you the thing that</v>

1271
00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:33.720
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1272
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:38.720
<v Speaker 1>engages voluntarily in combat with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>lies outside your range of safety?</v>

1273
00:58:39.521 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's what that image represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that is the monster amalgam,</v>

1274
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:48.250
<v Speaker 1>symbolic amalgam of all that which lies </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside your realm of safety.</v>

1275
00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.680
<v Speaker 1>You want to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget that,</v>

1276
00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

1277
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not in the cards.</v>

1278
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.690
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be safe while then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be medisafe.</v>

1279
00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's way better because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not safe.</v>

1280
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:03.760
<v Speaker 1>But you know how to cope with danger </v>
<v Speaker 1>while fine,</v>

1281
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:05.583
<v Speaker 1>that solves the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's even a better solution </v>

1282
00:59:07.391 --> 00:59:11.110
<v Speaker 1>because if you're safe then you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to stay in your burrow.</v>

1283
00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:12.213
<v Speaker 1>But if you can confront danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you could go wherever you want and </v>

1284
00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:15.634
<v Speaker 1>you can have an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's what you need to do is </v>

1285
00:59:18.011 --> 00:59:20.590
<v Speaker 1>to go out and have an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't even want safety.</v>

1286
00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Cause how exciting is that?</v>

1287
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Not Dostoyevsky said very clearly would </v>
<v Speaker 3>say we made you perfectly safe.</v>

1288
00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:28.573
<v Speaker 3>All that you had to do was eat cakes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>worry yourself with the continuation of </v>

1289
00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:33.530
<v Speaker 3>the species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would you do?</v>

1290
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:37.010
<v Speaker 3>You'd smash it all down as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly could,</v>

1291
00:59:37.011 --> 00:59:40.010
<v Speaker 3>just so you had something interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and challenging to do.</v>

1292
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:43.460
<v Speaker 3>So you don't want safety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to be able to cope with danger.</v>

1293
00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:46.010
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1294
00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:47.090
<v Speaker 3>this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1295
00:59:47.091 --> 00:59:49.970
<v Speaker 3>metaphysical that did clinical data on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this as clear.</v>

1296
00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.550
<v Speaker 3>When you treat someone for an anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 3>disorder,</v>

1297
00:59:52.551 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 3>like agora phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do not get rid of their anxiety.</v>

1298
00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.790
<v Speaker 3>You make them braver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's way better.</v>

1299
00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:01.130
<v Speaker 3>There's no going back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like once you're agoraphobic,</v>

1300
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.740
<v Speaker 3>you're heart's not doing the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1301
01:00:03.741 --> 01:00:04.161
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1302
01:00:04.161 --> 01:00:06.440
<v Speaker 3>it's missing beats now in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like death.</v>

1303
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:07.483
<v Speaker 3>Like the crocodile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got the clock and it's in his </v>

1304
01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:10.940
<v Speaker 3>stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It death is after you.</v>

1305
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:13.520
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no going back to naive it.</v>

1306
01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.370
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to be safe ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1307
01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:18.650
<v Speaker 3>so what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get to be stronger.</v>

1308
01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:19.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1309
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:21.470
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that's a better bargain </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways.</v>

1310
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:25.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1311
01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:26.283
<v Speaker 3>Lynn Isbell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an evolutionary arms race between early </v>

1312
01:00:29.021 --> 01:00:32.740
<v Speaker 3>snakes and mammals triggered the </v>
<v Speaker 3>development of improved vision and large</v>

1313
01:00:32.741 --> 01:00:33.574
<v Speaker 3>brain in primates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A radical new theory suggests the idea </v>

1314
01:00:36.851 --> 01:00:37.684
<v Speaker 3>proposed by Lynne Isbell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an anthropologist at the University of </v>

1315
01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:40.594
<v Speaker 3>California suggest that snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>primates share along an intimate </v>

1316
01:00:43.121 --> 01:00:43.954
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One that forced both groups to evolve </v>

1317
01:00:45.881 --> 01:00:48.850
<v Speaker 3>new strategies as each attempted to gain</v>
<v Speaker 3>the upper hand.</v>

1318
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:50.770
<v Speaker 3>Now it's Hercules',</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1319
01:00:50.771 --> 01:00:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's infinity.</v>

1320
01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:53.320
<v Speaker 3>That symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the snake.</v>

1321
01:00:53.321 --> 01:00:55.180
<v Speaker 3>You cut off one head and seven more </v>
<v Speaker 3>grow.</v>

1322
01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an infinite snake.</v>

1323
01:00:57.131 --> 01:00:59.920
<v Speaker 3>You're never going to run out of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the things that object to your</v>

1324
01:00:59.921 --> 01:01:01.330
<v Speaker 3>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1325
01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:03.340
<v Speaker 3>you can't get rid of the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what do you do?</v>

1326
01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:04.930
<v Speaker 3>You learn how to handle them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1327
01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:06.090
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1328
01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:09.100
<v Speaker 3>that's the answer is you learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become a handler of snakes,</v>

1329
01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.610
<v Speaker 3>both physical and metaphysical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1330
01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:17.110
<v Speaker 3>you see the little halo around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that Saint George might be Saint</v>

1331
01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's St George.</v>

1332
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:19.210
<v Speaker 3>Why has he got a halo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1333
01:01:19.211 --> 01:01:21.280
<v Speaker 3>that's the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or what does that mean?</v>

1334
01:01:21.281 --> 01:01:24.820
<v Speaker 3>It's gold to gold is pure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the pure gold sun.</v>

1335
01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.713
<v Speaker 3>It's associated with consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the pure gold sun of consciousness </v>

1336
01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:31.600
<v Speaker 3>that can confront the terrible thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that paralyzes.</v>

1337
01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:32.883
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1338
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:35.750
<v Speaker 3>and that's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's death,</v>

1339
01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:36.613
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The clock in the stomach of the </v>

1340
01:01:37.311 --> 01:01:38.144
<v Speaker 3>crocodile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's already got a taste of captain </v>

1341
01:01:39.051 --> 01:01:40.790
<v Speaker 3>hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Captain Hook's no St George.</v>

1342
01:01:40.791 --> 01:01:42.770
<v Speaker 3>That's why Peter Pan doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>grow up.</v>

1343
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:45.770
<v Speaker 3>I'd always sees is Captain Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be Captain Hook.</v>

1344
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.963
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't see this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he stays at home and plays video </v>

1345
01:01:49.761 --> 01:01:51.410
<v Speaker 3>games with the rest of the lost boys.</v>

1346
01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got nothing against video games,</v>

1347
01:01:55.481 --> 01:01:58.660
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean everything in moderation,</v>

1348
01:01:58.661 --> 01:02:00.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean they demand skill.</v>

1349
01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:02.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what's this?</v>

1350
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you are and you go down into chaos</v>

1351
01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.370
<v Speaker 3>and then you come back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you might say,</v>

1352
01:02:06.371 --> 01:02:07.204
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I this or am I the chaos or am I the </v>

1353
01:02:08.741 --> 01:02:09.574
<v Speaker 3>new new solution?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And answer is you're not this or you </v>

1354
01:02:13.601 --> 01:02:15.820
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be because that's your old </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead self,</v>

1355
01:02:15.821 --> 01:02:16.654
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that needs to burn </v>

1356
01:02:17.141 --> 01:02:19.360
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not chaos itself,</v>

1357
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:22.770
<v Speaker 3>but you're also not the new regenerated </v>
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>

1358
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:26.940
<v Speaker 3>You're the thing that can make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>journey and more than that,</v>

1359
01:02:26.941 --> 01:02:27.774
<v Speaker 3>you're the thing that decides to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>the journey voluntarily and then more </v>

1360
01:02:31.321 --> 01:02:32.154
<v Speaker 3>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the thing that decides to make </v>

1361
01:02:33.691 --> 01:02:36.270
<v Speaker 3>the journey voluntarily for as long as </v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes.</v>

1362
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.490
<v Speaker 3>And that's where you derive your </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength.</v>

1363
01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's no getting rid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>

1364
01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.410
<v Speaker 3>It's eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no getting rid of order.</v>

1365
01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:46.260
<v Speaker 3>It's eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are both traps.</v>

1366
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.513
<v Speaker 3>You mediate between them and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>where your strength lies and that's not </v>

1367
01:02:50.161 --> 01:02:51.990
<v Speaker 3>only strength for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's strength for you,</v>

1368
01:02:51.991 --> 01:02:52.824
<v Speaker 3>it's strength for the people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's strength for the community as </v>

1369
01:02:55.231 --> 01:02:56.064
<v Speaker 3>strength for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the thing that makes everything </v>

1370
01:02:58.171 --> 01:03:01.680
<v Speaker 3>order itself properly and thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to ask yourself,</v>

1371
01:03:01.681 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 3>and this is the thing you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the existential question.</v>

1372
01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:09.000
<v Speaker 3>Do you want things to be ordered </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly and thrive?</v>

1373
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:10.163
<v Speaker 3>Because if the answer to that is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to give up your hatred of </v>

1374
01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:14.610
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to give up your resentment,</v>

1375
01:03:14.611 --> 01:03:15.444
<v Speaker 3>you have to give up your margin demond </v>
<v Speaker 3>your victimization and all of that </v>

1376
01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.980
<v Speaker 3>because to the degree that you carry </v>
<v Speaker 3>that forward,</v>

1377
01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:25.290
<v Speaker 3>it will corrupt you and you will not </v>
<v Speaker 3>want the best cause to be.</v>

1378
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.700
<v Speaker 3>If two want the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be without rage,</v>

1379
01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:30.920
<v Speaker 3>hatred and Rand Corp and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and resentment because in,</v>

1380
01:03:30.921 --> 01:03:31.754
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I resent you for your enigma </v>

1381
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:36.450
<v Speaker 3>adequacies or even for your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your accomplishments,</v>

1382
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to have a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you where I'm aiming for the best.</v>

1383
01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:42.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivations.</v>

1384
01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:44.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take you down somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1385
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.160
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the Cain and Abel Story.</v>

1386
01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet I want to be who you are,</v>

1387
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:50.034
<v Speaker 3>but I can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll just cut you off at the knees </v>

1388
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.213
<v Speaker 3>and that'll do just fine and then I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>get my revenge on you and I can get my </v>

1389
01:03:56.161 --> 01:03:58.080
<v Speaker 3>revenge on being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1390
01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.240
<v Speaker 3>the fact that it helps turn everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>into hell.</v>

1391
01:04:00.241 --> 01:04:02.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's just an additional benefit</v>

1392
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:08.360
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Represented all sorts of different ways.</v>

1393
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:14.650
<v Speaker 3>The masculine and the Feminine Moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's horace in gold,</v>

1394
01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:17.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horus is all speech and eyes,</v>

1395
01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:17.631
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1396
01:04:17.631 --> 01:04:19.970
<v Speaker 3>cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that God of tradition and Isis,</v>

1397
01:04:19.971 --> 01:04:23.060
<v Speaker 3>the queen of the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see the same thing here,</v>

1398
01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:28.690
<v Speaker 3>suffering individual that transcends it </v>
<v Speaker 3>by accepting it nested inside of society</v>

1399
01:04:28.971 --> 01:04:29.804
<v Speaker 3>and the patriarchal structure nested </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside the natural world and the </v>

1400
01:04:32.061 --> 01:04:32.894
<v Speaker 3>feminine.</v>

1401
01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.790
<v Speaker 3>It's the same idea there.</v>

1402
01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:46.600
<v Speaker 3>That's Buddha emerging from the lotus </v>
<v Speaker 3>flower.</v>

1403
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:51.100
<v Speaker 3>The lotus flower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>its roots go down into the merch at the,</v>

1404
01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.410
<v Speaker 3>at the bottom of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>

1405
01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:54.363
<v Speaker 3>of the pond.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it emerges out of the darkness and </v>

1406
01:04:57.011 --> 01:04:57.844
<v Speaker 3>manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it climbs upwards towards the </v>

1407
01:05:00.401 --> 01:05:02.410
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the lotus floats on the surface</v>

1408
01:05:02.411 --> 01:05:03.244
<v Speaker 3>of the water in bloom's open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And inside that the Buddha sits golden </v>

1409
01:05:06.791 --> 01:05:08.930
<v Speaker 3>buddha sits in the light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1410
01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:10.980
<v Speaker 3>it's the flowering of being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1411
01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:13.030
<v Speaker 3>that's a Mandela from the union </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

1412
01:05:13.031 --> 01:05:15.910
<v Speaker 3>It's the Mendell opens up and it reveals</v>
<v Speaker 3>this motive.</v>

1413
01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Perfect big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1414
01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:18.523
<v Speaker 3>it's what the Buddha means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he found enlightenment underneath </v>

1415
01:05:20.201 --> 01:05:21.034
<v Speaker 3>the tree because that's the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment there is to find </v>

1416
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:27.490
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment underneath the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got the sun on his head too,</v>

1417
01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:31.390
<v Speaker 3>and he's gold for the same reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gold is pure.</v>

1418
01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:46.520
<v Speaker 3>You see the same thing in Hinduism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's the Yoni Feminine Symbol case.</v>

1419
01:05:47.911 --> 01:05:52.350
<v Speaker 3>You were wondering masculine symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the union of the two,</v>

1420
01:05:52.351 --> 01:05:54.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the union of chaos and order with</v>

1421
01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:55.753
<v Speaker 3>the snake lurking in the background and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's golden because it's the union of </v>

1422
01:06:00.361 --> 01:06:03.240
<v Speaker 3>those two things that produces the power</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the snake.</v>

1423
01:06:03.241 --> 01:06:04.740
<v Speaker 3>That's something that you might think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1424
01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.890
<v Speaker 3>You could think about those as two </v>
<v Speaker 3>halves of the DNA molecule.</v>

1425
01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:09.390
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is what they are.</v>

1426
01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:11.130
<v Speaker 3>Although I can't tell you how I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1427
01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:16.740
<v Speaker 3>but it's the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same idea here.</v>

1428
01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.100
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens here is that you see,</v>

1429
01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:22.440
<v Speaker 3>this is a very remarkable pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is eve.</v>

1430
01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Eve is handing out skulls to mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1431
01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:28.470
<v Speaker 3>It's self consciousness and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovery of death.</v>

1432
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:29.743
<v Speaker 3>This is Mary as the church on this side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's handing out these things that </v>

1433
01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:33.354
<v Speaker 3>are the hosts.</v>

1434
01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:34.423
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are pieces of Christ's body and </v>

1435
01:06:36.481 --> 01:06:38.760
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's put up there on this tree,</v>

1436
01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:39.594
<v Speaker 3>the same as the skull as an antidote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The antidote is something that you </v>

1437
01:06:42.781 --> 01:06:43.614
<v Speaker 3>incorporate and the thing you </v>
<v Speaker 3>incorporate is the voluntary acceptance </v>

1438
01:06:46.051 --> 01:06:49.530
<v Speaker 3>of suffering as the cure for death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what that picture means.</v>

1439
01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.140
<v Speaker 3>People worked on that bloody picture for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a long,</v>

1440
01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:53.970
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

1441
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:57.090
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1442
01:06:57.091 --> 01:06:58.980
<v Speaker 3>we see the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't know what it means.</v>

1443
01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:01.980
<v Speaker 3>But that's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means the same thing that this means.</v>

1444
01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:07.260
<v Speaker 3>It means the same thing that this means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the same thing that this means.</v>

1445
01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:08.820
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1446
01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:11.850
<v Speaker 3>there's pride rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the Scandinavian world tree.</v>

1447
01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:15.840
<v Speaker 3>There's pride rock right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the territory outside.</v>

1448
01:07:15.841 --> 01:07:16.740
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a serpent.</v>

1449
01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:18.660
<v Speaker 3>It's a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the territory outside.</v>

1450
01:07:18.930 --> 01:07:21.960
<v Speaker 3>That's outside of the light and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all in a tree.</v>

1451
01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:23.453
<v Speaker 3>That's how can you not read that as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>history of the evolution of mankind and </v>

1452
01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.490
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's our eternal home.</v>

1453
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:40.743
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we better stop before that girl comes </v>

1458
01:07:50.891 --> 01:07:51.724

<v Speaker 3>And so I'm glad this all worked out so </v>

<v Speaker 3>Otherwise that's not a good thing.</v>

1463
