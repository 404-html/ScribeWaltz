1
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to talk about pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>much ends the section on traits</v>

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to talk today about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical utility of traits.</v>

3
00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:19.070
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always nice if you're doing</v>

4
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.930
<v Speaker 1>psychological research to have a hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>

5
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's it.</v>

6
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.013
<v Speaker 1>It turns out to be relatively uncommon </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst psychological researchers to </v>

7
00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:36.500
<v Speaker 1>actually try to predict something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you use a regression equation,</v>

8
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.423
<v Speaker 1>which is what most of the stats that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd use if you were doing psychology </v>

9
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:40.784
<v Speaker 1>research or based on the purpose of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment or the research </v>

10
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.233
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically is the derivation of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regression equation that might enable </v>

11
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:53.030
<v Speaker 1>you to predict something useful in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

12
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.283
<v Speaker 1>But in in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that is devolved into sort of </v>

13
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:56.894
<v Speaker 1>descriptive work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Showing that two groups differ on some </v>

14
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.993
<v Speaker 1>trait or some feature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the actual utility of knowing that </v>

15
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:11.120
<v Speaker 1>is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not self evident.</v>

16
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.853
<v Speaker 1>It's partly why I got interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>prediction in performance prediction </v>

17
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.703
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can measure performance and it </v>

18
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:23.424
<v Speaker 1>actually matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be performance creatively </v>

19
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:31.311
<v Speaker 1>say or academically or if you're working</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an industrial area,</v>

20
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:32.964
<v Speaker 1>so just say as a factory worker or in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>job that can be reduced to essentially </v>

21
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:37.734
<v Speaker 1>an algorithm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in a job that can be </v>

22
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>reduced to an algorithm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you learn it,</v>

23
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>you know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are simpler jobs.</v>

24
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.073
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then performance in complex jobs as </v>

25
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Performance as an entrepreneur,</v>

26
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:52.014
<v Speaker 1>those are all</v>

27
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.193
<v Speaker 1>in some sense real world phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although of course you still have a </v>

28
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>measurement problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>So if you're trying to measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

30
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>how successful middle managers are in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>

31
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to specify because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.730
<v Speaker 1>if you're measuring the performance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>salesman,</v>

33
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.573
<v Speaker 1>you can see how much they sold and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a performance measure that's </v>

34
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:18.084
<v Speaker 1>basically defacto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're trying to measure their </v>

35
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>performance of managers say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll say in an institution like the</v>

36
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto or even in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>profit making institution,</v>

37
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>their connection with outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketplace is not.</v>

38
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not immediately obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might ask,</v>

39
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:34.794
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how in the world could you assess their </v>

40
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:37.374
<v Speaker 1>performance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way it's generally done is when </v>

41
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>you can have them rate themselves that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has all these problems,</v>

42
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>but you know it's not without validity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely without validity.</v>

43
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>You could have their managers rate them.</v>

44
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.503
<v Speaker 1>I'm that assume that their managers know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing and that they're </v>

45
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.373
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judges have their actual quality of </v>

46
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have their peers rate them,</v>

47
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>and you can have the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>working for them,</v>

48
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.693
<v Speaker 1>rate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out that if you do that on </v>

49
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>a fairly regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say once every quarter or once every six</v>

50
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 1>months or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you use a standardized questionnaire</v>

51
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.613
<v Speaker 1>that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can so that you can do </v>

52
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.273
<v Speaker 1>quantitative analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can get pretty reliable </v>

53
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:21.244
<v Speaker 1>indicators of performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem of course is is just </v>

54
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>because your manager or the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are working for you think you're doing a</v>

55
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean that the job you're doing</v>

56
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>is adding anything to the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity of the company?</v>

57
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

58
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.043
<v Speaker 1>So I think to some degree that's why </v>
<v Speaker 1>large companies tend to be somewhat </v>

59
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>unstable is once they get large enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of inside to them.</v>

60
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not attached to the market in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

61
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>And so people can be working very hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

62
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.023
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore productive from the </v>

63
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>perspective of actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:58.804
<v Speaker 1>labor input,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whether or not that actually is </v>

65
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:01.084
<v Speaker 1>producing a profit or producing the kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of consequence that you'd want it to </v>

66
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>produce so that the company can keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

67
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.383
<v Speaker 1>that's a completely different problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even when you're trying to predict </v>

68
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a fairly,</v>

69
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fairly real world phenomena,</v>

70
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>you still have the problem of how it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you measure performance.</v>

71
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.233
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are being graded all at the </v>

72
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>time and you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the utility of those grades?</v>

74
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.703
<v Speaker 1>What do they accurately represent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you know they're going to be used </v>

75
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.163
<v Speaker 1>in situations where you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enter higher education and the CRA and </v>

76
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:37.630
<v Speaker 1>the selection criteria are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>grades,</v>

77
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you want to go onto graduate </v>

78
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>school or to law school or to medicine </v>
<v Speaker 1>or any of the professional schools,</v>

79
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:46.630
<v Speaker 1>then whether or not you get good grades </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually matters,</v>

80
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.913
<v Speaker 1>but then the relationship between grades</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say achievement outside of those </v>

81
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>specific places where grades are </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

82
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.620
<v Speaker 1>You might argue that that's less clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing we do know about the grades at</v>

83
00:04:58.621 --> 00:04:59.454
<v Speaker 1>the University of Toronto is that their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their correlation with trait creativity </v>

84
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:04.264
<v Speaker 1>is zero and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might hope that one of the things </v>

85
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:11.490
<v Speaker 1>that you'd be assessed for while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in university would,</v>

86
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.373
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have something to do with </v>

87
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:14.171
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

88
00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to think originally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatively and so on.</v>

89
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 1>But our research so far when we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzed what's predicting grades at the</v>

90
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>uft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all ICU and conscientiousness.</v>

91
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>So an introverts do slightly better but </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a tremendous amount.</v>

92
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>That's probably because they're not out </v>
<v Speaker 1>partying all the time.</v>

93
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:31.474
<v Speaker 1>That would be my suspicion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but openness apart from ICU has no </v>

94
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:36.544
<v Speaker 1>relationship whatsoever and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually partly because it's not </v>

95
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 1>that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

96
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:44.340
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get graded for being</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative on a multiple choice task,</v>

97
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

98
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Because the last thing you want to be on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a multiple choice test is creative,</v>

99
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and then with regards to an essay,</v>

100
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:52.564
<v Speaker 1>well the problem with writing a creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>essay is in some sense you force the </v>

101
00:05:56.081 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>greater to come up with a scheme of </v>
<v Speaker 1>grading that's sort of unique to you,</v>

102
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.393
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you've done something </v>

103
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>original and new and so it's not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy for the person who's grading it.</v>

104
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.183
<v Speaker 1>You're forcing them to step outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their comfortable rubric and of course </v>

105
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:12.074
<v Speaker 1>that's a demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when your Ta's or grading for </v>

106
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:14.414
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have 100 papers to grade the </v>

107
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:21.971
<v Speaker 1>probability that on average they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to appreciate a clear easy to read</v>

108
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 1>an essay that does exactly what it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do is quite high rather than</v>

109
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:27.794
<v Speaker 1>something that's original and creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that actually requires thought to </v>

110
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:31.710
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

111
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's actually the </v>

112
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:34.304
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I suspect that it could well </v>

113
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that grades are not a good</v>

114
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:42.840
<v Speaker 1>marker of creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so neither,</v>

115
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative achievement per se.</v>

116
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually creative products </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've produced in your life.</v>

117
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.813
<v Speaker 1>Neither that nor trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness nor measures of creative </v>

118
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:52.964
<v Speaker 1>thinking are associated with grades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that the data sort of </v>

119
00:06:58.161 --> 00:06:58.994
<v Speaker 1>indicates that grades might be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>marker of managerial administrative </v>

120
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're unlikely to be a good marker</v>

121
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:10.031
<v Speaker 1>of creative and entrepreneurial ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

122
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 1>in any institution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:12.314
<v Speaker 1>there's always a tension between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific demands of the institution </v>

124
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:21.581
<v Speaker 1>which are kind of orderly and set and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the requirement for creativity,</v>

125
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.783
<v Speaker 1>which is very difficult thing for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution to deal with because </v>

126
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>institutions try to make thing things </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithmic so they can be predictable.</v>

127
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:29.923
<v Speaker 1>So I think that tension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tension is always there wherever </v>

128
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 1>you go in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also probably by why openness</v>

129
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Speaker 1>and conscientiousness are actually not </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlated,</v>

130
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because their,</v>

131
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.643
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their responses to two really different </v>

132
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:46.070
<v Speaker 1>forms of environments.</v>

133
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.331
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

134
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>So predicting performance is difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's useful because performance</v>

135
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:53.084
<v Speaker 1>exists and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but assessing performance is also </v>

136
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.053
<v Speaker 1>extremely difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why in some ways that's why </v>

137
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:06.230
<v Speaker 1>you could regard market solutions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex problems is almost inevitable.</v>

138
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.663
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you know if a company is run </v>

139
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 1>well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

140
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:15.740
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is people buy its </v>
<v Speaker 1>products and they buy them for enough so</v>

141
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>the company can keep running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you might ask,</v>

142
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:19.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything that you could measure</v>

143
00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:24.671
<v Speaker 1>outside of that and answer that is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly not because it's so difficult,</v>

144
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:26.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I remember I read once that you </v>

145
00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the Communists,</v>

146
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was uh,</v>

147
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 1>there were central committees that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do pricing.</v>

148
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.810
<v Speaker 1>And so this committee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

149
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.980
<v Speaker 1>had to make something on the order of </v>
<v Speaker 1>100,000 pricing decisions a day.</v>

150
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just try to think for a minute about</v>

151
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>how you would calculate what a nail is </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth.</v>

152
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.473
<v Speaker 1>Now remembered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get any price data from the </v>

153
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:53.564
<v Speaker 1>market because the market would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well a nail is worth whatever someone </v>

154
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>will pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While say you don't have a market,</v>

155
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.543
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how in the hell do you figure out what </v>

156
00:09:00.011 --> 00:09:00.844
<v Speaker 1>it nails worth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that is he can't because </v>

157
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>the nail is only worth something in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to every other thing that's</v>

158
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:07.314
<v Speaker 1>worth something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could imagine trying to commute </v>

159
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:10.344
<v Speaker 1>compute the comparative cost of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing against all other things and then </v>

160
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 1>having to do that against all other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

161
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why</v>

162
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.583
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why markets actually work </v>

163
00:09:22.331 --> 00:09:23.164
<v Speaker 1>efficiently is because you could think </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the market as a gigantic </v>

164
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.303
<v Speaker 1>supercomputer made up of the brains of </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single person who's making </v>

165
00:09:30.581 --> 00:09:34.120
<v Speaker 1>purchasing decisions and you just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even bother solving the problem.</v>

166
00:09:34.121 --> 00:09:37.930
<v Speaker 1>You just throw things out there and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them succeed in the sort of Darwinian</v>

167
00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:40.150
<v Speaker 1>way and some of them fail and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

168
00:09:40.151 --> 00:09:40.931
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

169
00:09:40.931 --> 00:09:42.940
<v Speaker 1>the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's.</v>

170
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.163
<v Speaker 1>There's problems with the way that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>market values things and the proper </v>

171
00:09:48.251 --> 00:09:50.890
<v Speaker 1>response to that is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt,</v>

172
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.130
<v Speaker 1>but what are you going to do that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute a better alternative?</v>

173
00:09:54.131 --> 00:09:54.964
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start wrestling with that </v>

174
00:09:56.561 --> 00:09:58.480
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets extraordinarily difficult.</v>

175
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.600
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so technically complex that I don't</v>

176
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:05.110
<v Speaker 1>actually think it's manageable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can't do anything probably,</v>

177
00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:07.240
<v Speaker 1>but make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

178
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.503
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to talk to you a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the difference between pursuing a </v>

179
00:10:15.321 --> 00:10:17.960
<v Speaker 1>career in psychology and pursuing </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific truth.</v>

180
00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:18.794
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you about that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've learned from </v>

181
00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:22.394
<v Speaker 1>trying to predict performance is that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole lot of things that psychologists </v>

182
00:10:25.281 --> 00:10:29.720
<v Speaker 1>talk about research psychologists don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist really at all.</v>

183
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical about psychology because</v>

184
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that any.</v>

185
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

186
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.953
<v Speaker 1>human venture has to produce a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of waste and nonsense </v>

187
00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 1>in order to produce any incremental </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge whatsoever.</v>

188
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.373
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like if you're thinking that every </v>

189
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 1>piece of research is going to produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>new knowledge,</v>

190
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.873
<v Speaker 1>genuine knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're naive because there's lots </v>

191
00:10:56.941 --> 00:11:01.350
<v Speaker 1>of reasons why psychologists do research</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of it is well because they have</v>

192
00:11:01.351 --> 00:11:02.184
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of it is because they have to </v>

193
00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:04.284
<v Speaker 1>train undergraduates and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates basically have to do bad </v>

194
00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:07.494
<v Speaker 1>research because well you only have four</v>
<v Speaker 1>months to do it and you're really going </v>

195
00:11:10.951 --> 00:11:13.080
<v Speaker 1>to discover something new and for months</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

196
00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:13.914
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then master's students are kind of </v>

197
00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:16.284
<v Speaker 1>in the same situation is they're kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting up and running and so they have </v>

198
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:23.610
<v Speaker 1>to do some experiments and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be doable in the time that's allowed and</v>

199
00:11:23.611 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what they're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know the statistics.</v>

200
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>So of course they have to do bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>research and then.</v>

201
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.260
<v Speaker 1>But they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're being trained at least in how to</v>

202
00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:32.500
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

203
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.633
<v Speaker 1>like most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most human enterprises aren't very </v>

204
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:37.290
<v Speaker 1>efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

205
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.423
<v Speaker 1>what do you guys think is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think's the average per </v>

206
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:41.843
<v Speaker 1>percent of profit that a typical say </v>
<v Speaker 1>North American Corporation makes over </v>

207
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:46.860
<v Speaker 1>like a 50 year period?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you averaged it,</v>

208
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.630
<v Speaker 1>what's a good rate of return?</v>

209
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Ten percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody?</v>

210
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody else?</v>

211
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody else?</v>

212
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.053
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So three is the most accurate guests so </v>

213
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:08.230
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a little higher than that.</v>

214
00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:11.440
<v Speaker 1>But not much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can kind of tell that because</v>

215
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.920
<v Speaker 1>if business produced a higher rate of </v>
<v Speaker 1>return than say three to seven percent,</v>

216
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 1>no one would put their money in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bank.</v>

217
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.120
<v Speaker 1>They all put their money in the stock </v>
<v Speaker 1>market,</v>

218
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because how much do you get right now?</v>

219
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:26.050
<v Speaker 1>If you put your money in the bank?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>

220
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:26.884
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One percent maybe if you're really </v>

221
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:28.534
<v Speaker 1>lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously business has to produce </v>

222
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:32.950
<v Speaker 1>more of return than that or everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>would put their money in the bank,</v>

223
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:33.963
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a tremendous amount more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that for your </v>

224
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:40.120
<v Speaker 1>typical corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>97 percent of what it does is,</v>

225
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:44.020
<v Speaker 1>is merely to keep itself running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only three percent.</v>

226
00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Five percent is profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why you,</v>

227
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:49.270
<v Speaker 1>why would you expect anything different </v>
<v Speaker 1>in scientific research?</v>

228
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like 95 percent of it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubbish,</v>

229
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.483
<v Speaker 1>but five percent is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think that there's tens of </v>

230
00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.133
<v Speaker 1>thousands of research papers being </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced,</v>

231
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a monthly basis.</v>

232
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>So how fast do you want things to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward?</v>

233
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:04.203
<v Speaker 1>To me in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're moving forward fast </v>

234
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:06.221
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

235
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already hard to keep up with things</v>

236
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:09.814
<v Speaker 1>like phones or anything electronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they change so frequently that </v>

237
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.163
<v Speaker 1>you know you have to continually force </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to readapt so it's not even </v>

238
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:20.680
<v Speaker 1>obvious how fast you want new knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be generated.</v>

239
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I'm telling you all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because I'm going to tell you a bunch</v>

240
00:13:24.131 --> 00:13:26.110
<v Speaker 1>of things that I think psychologists do </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

241
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.123
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not telling you that because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think psychologists do things </v>

242
00:13:29.231 --> 00:13:30.064
<v Speaker 1>particularly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that almost everything that people </v>

243
00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:33.184
<v Speaker 1>do is mostly just to keep things going </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's this little frog </v>

244
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.233
<v Speaker 1>fraction of the enterprise that might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit or it's equivalent in scientific </v>

245
00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:41.734
<v Speaker 1>endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be the generation of new </v>

246
00:13:42.581 --> 00:13:43.360
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

247
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.090
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be cynical about that.</v>

248
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.310
<v Speaker 1>You need to know something about base </v>
<v Speaker 1>rates,</v>

249
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when these sorts of things help you to.</v>

250
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:52.270
<v Speaker 1>If you do something like apply to </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate school.</v>

251
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:54.280
<v Speaker 1>So I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just talk to you very briefly about</v>

252
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:55.114
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to apply to any place </v>

253
00:13:57.131 --> 00:14:01.540
<v Speaker 1>that had that where you have a low </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of getting in law school,</v>

254
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 1>graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical school,</v>

255
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.720
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

256
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.010
<v Speaker 1>some of what predicts whether or not you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in as you grades,</v>

257
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.170
<v Speaker 1>letters of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your scores on the,</v>

258
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

259
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.870
<v Speaker 1>on the standardized tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are important.</v>

260
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Grades are the most important and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance on the standardized tests.</v>

261
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:18.783
<v Speaker 1>But once you hit threshold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you're like an a minus student </v>

262
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:25.540
<v Speaker 1>and you do 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth percentile or above on the typical</v>

263
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.590
<v Speaker 1>standardized exam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gre,</v>

264
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Ramcat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cat or whatever it is.</v>

265
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:29.763
<v Speaker 1>Then what determines whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get in our random factors so when you </v>

266
00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:34.864
<v Speaker 1>need to know that because all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to progress in your </v>

267
00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:38.284
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of whether or not you progress is </v>

268
00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:43.600
<v Speaker 1>going to be dependent on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your intelligence and your diligence and</v>

269
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.503
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps your creativity and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability and other things </v>

270
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:48.544
<v Speaker 1>that we've talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of it is just the variation in </v>

271
00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:53.510
<v Speaker 1>the marketplace and it's random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question is,</v>

272
00:14:53.511 --> 00:14:54.344
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you beat randomness in the </v>

273
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:55.964
<v Speaker 1>marketplace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An answer to that is by playing many </v>

274
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 1>different lotteries because it's all a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lottery.</v>

275
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to go to clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate school,</v>

276
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.063
<v Speaker 1>then you apply to 30 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not two or three or 4:30 and there's </v>

277
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:09.944
<v Speaker 1>about that many in Canada that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>accredited now and there are schools in </v>

278
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 1>the us that you can apply to and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

279
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Then it costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 50 to $75 a an application.</v>

280
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:21.320
<v Speaker 1>But that's trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's nothing,</v>

281
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:23.060
<v Speaker 1>that's an investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't worry about that.</v>

282
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 1>You borrow for that if you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

283
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 1>well I don't want to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

284
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:30.830
<v Speaker 1>some little ratty town somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 1>northern Ontario say.</v>

285
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Or there's ratty little towns </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

286
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.030
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

287
00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:36.950
<v Speaker 1>you can always say no when they accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

288
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you'll get lucky and you'll get</v>

289
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:43.850
<v Speaker 1>to go to somewhere you want to go or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you want to go and find,</v>

290
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.100
<v Speaker 1>go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you won't get so lucky,</v>

291
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.010
<v Speaker 1>but someone will offer you a place at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller institution.</v>

292
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:50.443
<v Speaker 1>Well then you have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you sure that there's not more </v>

293
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:57.530
<v Speaker 1>opportunity at that smaller institution </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can make use of.</v>

294
00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

295
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.823
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you going to get a research </v>

296
00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:06.350
<v Speaker 1>degree is nowhere near as important as </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you go.</v>

297
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.423
<v Speaker 1>So the difference between no degree and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a degree is way bigger than the </v>

298
00:16:10.431 --> 00:16:12.950
<v Speaker 1>difference between where you got your </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

299
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.100
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the same with applying for jobs.</v>

300
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:16.934
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things you might realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the return on a CV is probably </v>

301
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:22.364
<v Speaker 1>two percent if that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can figure 25 applications for </v>

302
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:26.714
<v Speaker 1>one interview and then maybe one out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>three interviews or one out of four </v>

303
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:32.420
<v Speaker 1>interviews is going to get you a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

304
00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:35.390
<v Speaker 1>And you need to know that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise when you're applying for jobs,</v>

305
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get old disappointed </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to think,</v>

306
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.940
<v Speaker 1>well Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've sent out like 30 job applications.</v>

307
00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I haven't got one response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

308
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:43.843
<v Speaker 1>there must be something wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>job environment or there must be </v>

309
00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:46.700
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with me.</v>

310
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

311
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:49.363
<v Speaker 1>there might be something wrong with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there might be something wrong with </v>

312
00:16:51.591 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 1>the job environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need to keep baselines in mind.</v>

313
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a low probability event and so then</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do when you're applying</v>

314
00:16:59.031 --> 00:16:59.864
<v Speaker 1>for a job is like apply for two hours a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and assume you're going to do that </v>

315
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:08.120
<v Speaker 1>for six months and don't burn yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and don't get depressed or oppressed</v>

316
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:08.954
<v Speaker 1>by the fact that it's extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult because it is extremely </v>

317
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:13.760
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't.</v>

318
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.720
<v Speaker 1>It isn't a commentary on you or it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a commentary on society.</v>

319
00:17:17.721 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 1>It's just that it's a low base rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>

320
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Lots of jobs that are posted aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

321
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:23.234
<v Speaker 1>They don't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The companies are just trying to keep a </v>

322
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:27.620
<v Speaker 1>turnover of hot resumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are.</v>

323
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.180
<v Speaker 1>They've already picked a candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of places,</v>

324
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.080
<v Speaker 1>but they have to advertise by law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

325
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:36.950
<v Speaker 1>so there's a whole bunch of reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get called back.</v>

326
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right day when they pick up</v>
<v Speaker 1>your resume,</v>

327
00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.590
<v Speaker 1>they've been flooded with resumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of reasons.</v>

328
00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:44.930
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baselines matter.</v>

329
00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:47.420
<v Speaker 1>So back to psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is psychologists do?</v>

330
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do two things.</v>

331
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully they have to do both of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be successful.</v>

332
00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 1>They have to pursue scientific truth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to pursue careers.</v>

333
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.113
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is is that pursuing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>career in pursuing scientific truth are </v>

334
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:00.444
<v Speaker 1>not the same thing and so primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>people focus on pursuing their career </v>

335
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.880
<v Speaker 1>and secondarily on scientific truth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it has to be that way,</v>

336
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:11.250
<v Speaker 1>that way it's possible that it has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

337
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.653
<v Speaker 1>but that's not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better to pursue scientific truth </v>

338
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.193
<v Speaker 1>and then do what you can for your career</v>
<v Speaker 1>along the way because otherwise you end </v>

339
00:18:18.751 --> 00:18:19.584
<v Speaker 1>up chasing things that don't exist for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole life and polluting the </v>

340
00:18:22.051 --> 00:18:22.884
<v Speaker 1>scientific literature with nonsense and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can have pretty bad personal and </v>

341
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:27.384
<v Speaker 1>also social consequences because you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>end up discovering things that don't </v>

342
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:31.344
<v Speaker 1>exist and then policy makers will make </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational policy say on the basis of </v>

343
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:38.640
<v Speaker 1>those recommendations and then that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not good and that happens a lot.</v>

344
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.630
<v Speaker 1>So here's how you pursue scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

345
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing,</v>

346
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying this is the only way </v>
<v Speaker 1>of defining reality,</v>

347
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about the phenomenologists </v>

348
00:18:51.271 --> 00:18:52.104
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the phenomenologists talk about </v>

349
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.230
<v Speaker 1>reality as lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

350
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:57.840
<v Speaker 1>So it's reality that encompasses your </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire experience,</v>

351
00:18:57.841 --> 00:18:59.070
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations,</v>

352
00:18:59.071 --> 00:18:59.904
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things that are subjective plus </v>

353
00:19:01.591 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Speaker 1>the objective world that isn't how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>works in science.</v>

354
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.543
<v Speaker 1>There's a rule in science and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them is if you're phenomena can't be </v>

355
00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:12.720
<v Speaker 1>defined well enough to measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it doesn't exist scientifically.</v>

356
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.823
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the first rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to come up with a measurement </v>

357
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:18.690
<v Speaker 1>tool for your concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

358
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.060
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you why that's important a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit later.</v>

359
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.733
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to take your measurement </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to see if it measures what </v>

360
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:27.264
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to measure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very tricky thing because </v>

361
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:32.100
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what is it supposed to measure?</v>

362
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.860
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you come up with a measure </v>
<v Speaker 1>of anxiety,</v>

363
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well a,</v>

364
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:40.380
<v Speaker 1>what's the measure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>

365
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.900
<v Speaker 1>what's it supposed to predict?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

366
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.430
<v Speaker 1>A heart rate increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

367
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.481
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

368
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:46.314
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people's heart rate decrease </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get anxiety and sometimes </v>

369
00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:51.030
<v Speaker 1>people's heart rate increases because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're excited.</v>

370
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.330
<v Speaker 1>So skin conductance increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

371
00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.293
<v Speaker 1>same problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their skin conductance tends to rise </v>

372
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.390
<v Speaker 1>generally whenever you're putting any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of motivated state,</v>

373
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:01.224
<v Speaker 1>well self report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not so bad except maybe </v>

374
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:05.304
<v Speaker 1>people aren't that good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing between guilt and shame </v>

375
00:20:07.231 --> 00:20:08.064
<v Speaker 1>and disgust and anxiety and emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain and frustration and disappointment </v>

376
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.190
<v Speaker 1>assuming that those things are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

377
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.473
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a complicated problem to design a </v>

378
00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:19.984
<v Speaker 1>measure and then to determine whether it</v>
<v Speaker 1>measures anything and also to determine </v>

379
00:20:24.151 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it measures what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to measure.</v>

380
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rules are quite straightforward.</v>

381
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.353
<v Speaker 1>One is that you should be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure the phenomena of variety of </v>

382
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:38.040
<v Speaker 1>using a variety of different methods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you get into the problem of what</v>

383
00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:40.230
<v Speaker 1>constitutes different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can think about it,</v>

384
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.153
<v Speaker 1>the analogy of your senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have five senses and if all five of </v>

385
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:47.220
<v Speaker 1>them telling you that something there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something is there,</v>

386
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:48.603
<v Speaker 1>the probability that it's there is quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>high and that's why we all managed to </v>

387
00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:53.734
<v Speaker 1>live right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you get five different reporting </v>

388
00:20:55.991 --> 00:20:56.824
<v Speaker 1>systems telling you the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that it's not there or </v>

389
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:02.380
<v Speaker 1>that you're wrong starts to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>vanishingly small.</v>

390
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.480
<v Speaker 1>So you sort of have to do that with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure.</v>

391
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.463
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it'd be a physiological measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a conceptual measure in a self </v>

392
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:11.020
<v Speaker 1>report measure and an observational </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure and a behavioral measure.</v>

393
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.750
<v Speaker 1>If you can get all of that and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>converges,</v>

394
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the measures correlate,</v>

395
00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:16.294
<v Speaker 1>then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's something actually there </v>

396
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.903
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might also want to target something </v>

397
00:21:22.961 --> 00:21:26.140
<v Speaker 1>in the real world to predict and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>criterion related validity.</v>

398
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 1>So you have to see if your measurement </v>
<v Speaker 1>is reliable,</v>

399
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.180
<v Speaker 1>measures the same thing more than once </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a role,</v>

400
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.613
<v Speaker 1>whether it can be the phenomena can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>detected in a variety of different ways </v>

401
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.910
<v Speaker 1>and whether that actually predicts </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that might be useful.</v>

402
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:41.523
<v Speaker 1>So I really liked the last one and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's when where psychologists </v>

403
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.160
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of complaints about </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology as a field right now,</v>

404
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:48.994
<v Speaker 1>especially in social psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of scandal in the </v>

405
00:21:52.991 --> 00:21:55.510
<v Speaker 1>general scientific literature including </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical literature.</v>

406
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been,</v>

407
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.820
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy a while back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately I can't remember his name,</v>

408
00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.293
<v Speaker 1>he had a Greek last name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He published a paper showing </v>

409
00:22:05.321 --> 00:22:06.154
<v Speaker 1>mathematically that on average the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reports that were submitted say in </v>

410
00:22:10.361 --> 00:22:13.810
<v Speaker 1>medical journals had to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were too improbable.</v>

411
00:22:13.811 --> 00:22:15.910
<v Speaker 1>He figured it out statistically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

412
00:22:15.911 --> 00:22:16.744
<v Speaker 1>And then there's been a recent attempt </v>
<v Speaker 1>to replicate some of the most </v>

413
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:22.300
<v Speaker 1>fundamental findings in psychology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:25.540
<v Speaker 1>there's been some success at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's been plenty of failure too.</v>

415
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.823
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I think that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful if you're thinking about a </v>

416
00:22:31.331 --> 00:22:33.400
<v Speaker 1>research career is to pick a hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>target,</v>

417
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.263
<v Speaker 1>see if you can make progress on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's one of the things that </v>

418
00:22:36.911 --> 00:22:39.680
<v Speaker 1>puts constraints on your theorizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:22:39.681 --> 00:22:40.514
<v Speaker 1>like what I try to do when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm working out a concept I liked </v>

420
00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:43.594
<v Speaker 1>to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could probably figure that out from </v>

421
00:22:44.891 --> 00:22:45.724
<v Speaker 1>this course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to see if there's like a solid </v>

422
00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:50.740
<v Speaker 1>theoretical basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the philosophy is solid and I like to</v>

423
00:22:50.741 --> 00:22:53.560
<v Speaker 1>see if there's a brain model that'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of helpful.</v>

424
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:57.010
<v Speaker 1>I'd like it if it was derived from </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal experimentation rather than human</v>

425
00:22:57.011 --> 00:22:57.844
<v Speaker 1>because I think that's more valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see if there's a </v>

426
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:03.160
<v Speaker 1>pharmacological level of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that supports it,</v>

427
00:23:03.161 --> 00:23:05.950
<v Speaker 1>that'd be really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some behaviors would be nice.</v>

428
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.990
<v Speaker 1>And then if there's self report data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well all that's all to the good.</v>

429
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 1>And if you get something that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure across all five of those levels,</v>

430
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I think I mentioned five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you kind of think,</v>

431
00:23:16.571 --> 00:23:18.490
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably something there.</v>

432
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.473
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety is a good example of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can measure anxiety with </v>

433
00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:25.510
<v Speaker 1>quest self report questionnaires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get behavioral observations,</v>

434
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:26.344
<v Speaker 1>you can measure psychophysiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's really good animal experimental </v>

435
00:23:29.381 --> 00:23:30.214
<v Speaker 1>models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus there's a pharmacology because we </v>

436
00:23:32.021 --> 00:23:35.260
<v Speaker 1>know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can give people benzodiazepines</v>

437
00:23:35.261 --> 00:23:36.094
<v Speaker 1>or alcohol or barbiturates and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dampens the response and there are the </v>

438
00:23:40.271 --> 00:23:41.104
<v Speaker 1>reverse of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually there are drugs you can take </v>

439
00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 1>that make you more anxious that work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same basic systems.</v>

440
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.933
<v Speaker 1>So you might think a lot of that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Gray's work or the stuff he </v>

441
00:23:49.531 --> 00:23:50.364
<v Speaker 1>summarized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of think there's something </v>

442
00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 1>there and then there's the animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and so forth.</v>

443
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.230
<v Speaker 1>That also is indicative of anxiety.</v>

444
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.333
<v Speaker 1>That's your triangulation is getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty complete by the time you have </v>

445
00:24:01.011 --> 00:24:04.370
<v Speaker 1>five separate sources of information all</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing to the same direction.</v>

446
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

447
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:10.640
<v Speaker 1>you really gotta be skeptical if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>a scientist because the probability that</v>

448
00:24:10.641 --> 00:24:12.710
<v Speaker 1>you're discovering something is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>

449
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.963
<v Speaker 1>And so it's easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with the statistics because </v>

450
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to think of statistics as a </v>

451
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:22.970
<v Speaker 1>sort of little machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd dump in numbers at the top and you</v>

452
00:24:22.971 --> 00:24:25.010
<v Speaker 1>crank it and outcomes knowledge at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom,</v>

453
00:24:25.011 --> 00:24:27.290
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not true at all.</v>

454
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:28.363
<v Speaker 1>Statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it an exploratory technique </v>

455
00:24:29.931 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're making decisions all the time</v>

456
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:37.070
<v Speaker 1>about what constitutes a valid data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know there's an outlier problem,</v>

457
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:37.904
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you graph your data one dimension </v>

458
00:24:40.191 --> 00:24:41.024
<v Speaker 1>across another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see people who are way the hell </v>

459
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:44.540
<v Speaker 1>out on the measurements for one reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>or another,</v>

460
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.823
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you don't know whether you </v>

461
00:24:46.761 --> 00:24:47.594
<v Speaker 1>should include them in the analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is deadly if it's a regression </v>

462
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:51.143
<v Speaker 1>analysis because it's really sensitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>to outliers or whether you should toss </v>

463
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:54.584
<v Speaker 1>them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's the problem if you </v>

464
00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:56.774
<v Speaker 1>tossed them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe that makes it easier for you </v>

465
00:24:58.401 --> 00:24:59.810
<v Speaker 1>to prove your hypothesis.</v>

466
00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to do that because you want</v>

467
00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:04.220
<v Speaker 1>results because then you can publish </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

468
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:08.090
<v Speaker 1>So like it's a really tricky business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an,</v>

469
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 1>it's an ethical business all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to make these decisions</v>

470
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:15.140
<v Speaker 1>that depend on your judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got to ask yourself,</v>

471
00:25:15.141 --> 00:25:17.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when is your judgment valid?</v>

472
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.493
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only answer to that is when you </v>

473
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:23.510
<v Speaker 1>actually know what you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

474
00:25:23.511 --> 00:25:25.220
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go into science as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

475
00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:29.090
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to decide is it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

476
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:30.763
<v Speaker 1>in which case the scientific element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is subordinate or are you trying to </v>

477
00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:34.784
<v Speaker 1>find something out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And building a career as a consequence </v>

478
00:25:36.921 --> 00:25:38.100
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

479
00:25:38.101 --> 00:25:41.590
<v Speaker 1>it's really good to walk through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously because you know,</v>

480
00:25:41.591 --> 00:25:44.630
<v Speaker 1>when you think about the value </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies we've talked about before is</v>

481
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.673
<v Speaker 1>your value hierarchy determines the </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions that you make and if you're </v>

482
00:25:48.711 --> 00:25:51.830
<v Speaker 1>conflicted about whether it's career </v>
<v Speaker 1>promotion or truth.</v>

483
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.320
<v Speaker 1>While career promotion is gonna win out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

484
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's expedient,</v>

485
00:25:55.851 --> 00:25:57.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of pressure pushing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

486
00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:58.883
<v Speaker 1>like get results to get good results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get publishable results and to get </v>

487
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:02.534
<v Speaker 1>lots of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a lot of pressure pushing </v>

488
00:26:05.271 --> 00:26:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you to produce data that's better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

489
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.093
<v Speaker 1>That looks better than it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think these are all micro </v>

490
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:16.310
<v Speaker 1>judgments to say the problem of handling</v>
<v Speaker 1>outliers as well.</v>

491
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.033
<v Speaker 1>Their rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if somebody is three standard </v>

492
00:26:19.371 --> 00:26:21.890
<v Speaker 1>deviations below the mean and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular measure,</v>

493
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:24.050
<v Speaker 1>well then you can throw them out because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're an outlier,</v>

494
00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:27.740
<v Speaker 1>but well what if there two point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five standard deviations from the meat,</v>

495
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.993
<v Speaker 1>it's like and there's only one of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>so they stick way out there or even two </v>

496
00:26:31.341 --> 00:26:32.174
<v Speaker 1>standard deviations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how do you know when to get </v>

497
00:26:34.851 --> 00:26:35.684
<v Speaker 1>rid of them and the answer is you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use your judgment so that you're </v>

498
00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:43.350
<v Speaker 1>modeling the data in the best way </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible and one of the ways that I sort</v>

499
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:44.184
<v Speaker 1>of protect myself against that and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>students is I tell them to use their </v>

500
00:26:46.891 --> 00:26:50.100
<v Speaker 1>statistics destructively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means okay,</v>

501
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:52.050
<v Speaker 1>you got a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he can make it go away,</v>

502
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.750
<v Speaker 1>fiddle with the data till it goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see how hard that was or can you get the</v>

503
00:26:57.751 --> 00:26:59.910
<v Speaker 1>same result using three different </v>
<v Speaker 1>approaches,</v>

504
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.550
<v Speaker 1>three different statistical approaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

505
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:04.020
<v Speaker 1>different cutoffs and so forth.</v>

506
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

507
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.860
<v Speaker 1>if you play with it multiple ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does your result only come out once?</v>

508
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.250
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe it's not there.</v>

509
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.950
<v Speaker 1>If you can make it go away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not there and you know,</v>

510
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:16.770
<v Speaker 1>that's hard on the students because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had one student in particular,</v>

511
00:27:16.771 --> 00:27:20.460
<v Speaker 1>he must've done eight studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of them were replications.</v>

512
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:23.430
<v Speaker 1>He'd get a result and then we tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>replicate it and it wouldn't replicate.</v>

513
00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:24.883
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

514
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:25.763
<v Speaker 1>he did that for like four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never got anything that would </v>

515
00:27:27.391 --> 00:27:28.224
<v Speaker 1>replicate and he could've published </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I couldn't let him publish </v>

516
00:27:30.331 --> 00:27:31.310
<v Speaker 1>before we replicated.</v>

517
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.480
<v Speaker 3>But well,</v>

518
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.940
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is then you set up</v>
<v Speaker 1>these red herrings that people chase,</v>

519
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd chase it and other people would </v>

520
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 1>chase it and that can happen forever.</v>

521
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.613
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

522
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.163
<v Speaker 1>here's how you pursue a career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the sort of the opposite to </v>

523
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.673
<v Speaker 1>pursuing scientific truth and one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>invent a scale or a construct or rename </v>

524
00:27:56.601 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 1>a scale that already exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>refused to validate it,</v>

525
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:00.773
<v Speaker 1>so you don't actually test it against </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything where it's a critical test and </v>

526
00:28:03.661 --> 00:28:06.360
<v Speaker 1>then correlate it with some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena that maybe doesn't exist.</v>

527
00:28:06.361 --> 00:28:08.880
<v Speaker 1>So I can tell you a couple of examples </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

528
00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.113
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

529
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.533
<v Speaker 1>one of the most recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think most scandalously was a </v>

530
00:28:14.181 --> 00:28:15.014
<v Speaker 1>concept called grit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a woman whose name I can't remember </v>

531
00:28:18.261 --> 00:28:19.094
<v Speaker 1>at the moment,</v>

532
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.103
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

533
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Duckworth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's her name,</v>

534
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.490
<v Speaker 1>I hope that's her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

535
00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.890
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did some research at the,</v>

536
00:28:27.891 --> 00:28:30.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>west point,</v>

537
00:28:30.051 --> 00:28:30.884
<v Speaker 1>which is the place where the Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>train their soldiers and she was trying </v>

538
00:28:33.141 --> 00:28:36.740
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what predicted their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their achievement and what she found was</v>

539
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.903
<v Speaker 1>that there were questions in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire that she called Grit that </v>

540
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.500
<v Speaker 1>predicted performance and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was big news man,</v>

541
00:28:45.501 --> 00:28:48.620
<v Speaker 1>like she got a macarthur genius grant </v>
<v Speaker 1>for this work,</v>

542
00:28:48.621 --> 00:28:49.454
<v Speaker 1>which is very rare thing to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like headlines all over the </v>

543
00:28:51.651 --> 00:28:54.320
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grant and now if you look at the federal</v>

544
00:28:54.321 --> 00:28:57.970
<v Speaker 1>government's publications on improving </v>
<v Speaker 1>education in the US,</v>

545
00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.521
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

546
00:28:58.521 --> 00:29:01.580
<v Speaker 1>we have to teach our children grit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at her paper,</v>

547
00:29:01.581 --> 00:29:02.414
<v Speaker 1>you find out that grit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is derived from a questionnaire </v>

548
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.800
<v Speaker 1>and we already know the questionnaire </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>

549
00:29:06.801 --> 00:29:08.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the questionnaire rule?</v>

550
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.433
<v Speaker 1>If it's a questionnaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it measures one or more of the big </v>

551
00:29:12.621 --> 00:29:16.820
<v Speaker 1>five traits either well or badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the rule.</v>

552
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.720
<v Speaker 1>While her grit questionnaire correlated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with conscientiousness,</v>

553
00:29:20.721 --> 00:29:23.390
<v Speaker 1>like at about point seven five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she said,</v>

554
00:29:23.391 --> 00:29:25.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that only accounts for 50 percent of the</v>

555
00:29:25.311 --> 00:29:27.170
<v Speaker 1>variance point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five squared,</v>

556
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.273
<v Speaker 1>but as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully point seven five is an </v>

557
00:29:30.771 --> 00:29:31.604
<v Speaker 1>insanely high correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you give someone a </v>

558
00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:35.624
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire once and then you give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them the questionnaire again and you </v>

559
00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:40.700
<v Speaker 1>correlate their two scores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless it's a deadly good,</v>

560
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.543
<v Speaker 1>the test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retest reliability is only going to be </v>

561
00:29:44.021 --> 00:29:47.860
<v Speaker 1>about point seven five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what that meant was grit measures</v>

562
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:51.160
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicts performance.</v>

563
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Of course we already know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness predicts performance,</v>

564
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:58.580
<v Speaker 1>so that's not at best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be an incremental addition to</v>

565
00:29:58.581 --> 00:30:00.670
<v Speaker 1>a literature that's already well </v>
<v Speaker 1>established,</v>

566
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.670
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares about that name?</v>

567
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:04.504
<v Speaker 1>It Grit</v>

568
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.390
<v Speaker 1>and then you know you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your career progresses rapidly,</v>

569
00:30:08.391 --> 00:30:10.610
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're talking to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are clueless,</v>

570
00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.713
<v Speaker 1>but you wore the whole structure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>say the educational establishment </v>

571
00:30:14.721 --> 00:30:17.990
<v Speaker 1>because now they're all shorting out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you asked about teaching students grit.</v>

572
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:19.161
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

573
00:30:19.161 --> 00:30:21.620
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't exist because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

574
00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Second conscientiousness has a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>vicious biological basis.</v>

575
00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that it's malleable,</v>

576
00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:31.340
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how to teach it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

577
00:30:31.341 --> 00:30:32.174
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a study ever that showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it increased people's </v>

578
00:30:34.401 --> 00:30:37.010
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>

579
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean your parents tried to do that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you for like 18 years.</v>

580
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Did it work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

581
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.360
<v Speaker 1>work harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

582
00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.130
<v Speaker 1>be more diligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay more attention,</v>

583
00:30:46.131 --> 00:30:48.140
<v Speaker 1>don't waste so much time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

584
00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably spent,</v>

585
00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:51.613
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half an hour a day on you trying to </v>

586
00:30:53.781 --> 00:30:57.620
<v Speaker 1>teach you that maybe it's like 150 hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

587
00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:00.080
<v Speaker 1>It's about 2100 hours over the course of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

588
00:31:00.081 --> 00:31:00.914
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that they were that diligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's 2100 hours made you as </v>

589
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:04.904
<v Speaker 1>conscientious as you are now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another 20 hours of training is really </v>

590
00:31:07.671 --> 00:31:10.550
<v Speaker 1>gonna make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like highly improbable.</v>

591
00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:15.560
<v Speaker 1>So then I remember another study this </v>
<v Speaker 1>was done by shelley Taylor and Taylor</v>

592
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:18.163
<v Speaker 1>was the proponent of positive illusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have heard about </v>

593
00:31:20.271 --> 00:31:21.230
<v Speaker 1>positive illusions?</v>

594
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's a positive illusion?</v>

595
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.173
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>

596
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.633
<v Speaker 2>Perception?</v>

597
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would've called it less than </v>

598
00:31:34.281 --> 00:31:35.114
<v Speaker 1>grandiose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theory fundamentally is that people </v>

599
00:31:38.001 --> 00:31:38.834
<v Speaker 1>buttress their self concepts with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of mild deceptions about how </v>

600
00:31:42.261 --> 00:31:45.500
<v Speaker 1>wonderful they are and she thinks that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

601
00:31:45.501 --> 00:31:46.334
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she draws on data showing that if you </v>

602
00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:50.840
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's try this,</v>

603
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.170
<v Speaker 1>how many of you think you are above </v>
<v Speaker 1>average drivers?</v>

604
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:56.583
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do this because I'd like to </v>

605
00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:59.620
<v Speaker 1>replicate the experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you think that,</v>

606
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:01.183
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

607
00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:02.510
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

608
00:32:02.511 --> 00:32:03.344
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

609
00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:04.311
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

610
00:32:04.311 --> 00:32:05.630
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

611
00:32:05.631 --> 00:32:06.464
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you think your average </v>

612
00:32:07.611 --> 00:32:09.740
<v Speaker 1>drivers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

613
00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.300
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

614
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:12.500
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

615
00:32:12.501 --> 00:32:14.000
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

616
00:32:14.001 --> 00:32:14.781
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

617
00:32:14.781 --> 00:32:15.770
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

618
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:18.140
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12.</v>

619
00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:20.630
<v Speaker 1>How many of you think you're below </v>
<v Speaker 1>average drivers?</v>

620
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.760
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

621
00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:23.720
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

622
00:32:23.721 --> 00:32:25.370
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

623
00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.510
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

624
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Is that your voter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hers.</v>

625
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

626
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:32.763
<v Speaker 1>So it looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Taylor's hypothesis was that if you </v>

627
00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:36.754
<v Speaker 1>ask often undergraduates in particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they think they're better than </v>

628
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.793
<v Speaker 1>average drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe this isn't self report </v>

629
00:32:41.391 --> 00:32:42.100
<v Speaker 1>rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

630
00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.440
<v Speaker 1>in an audience like this that most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them say they're above average.</v>

631
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:46.483
<v Speaker 1>Now you guys failed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a non replication as far as </v>

632
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:49.844
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned because the mo about two </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirds of you said you were either </v>

633
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:54.710
<v Speaker 1>average or below average.</v>

634
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.180
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

635
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.450
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that evidence for this pervasive sort of</v>

636
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.553
<v Speaker 1>self aggrandizement in mild ways is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite high and people who are like that </v>

637
00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:10.010
<v Speaker 1>are happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

638
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.650
<v Speaker 1>their wellbeing is better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever wellbeing is.</v>

639
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:16.723
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she published this paper and there was </v>

640
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 1>in the Journal of personality and social</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology and she took all these.</v>

641
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.080
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the positive illusion?</v>

642
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.030
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

643
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:27.830
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try defining it.</v>

644
00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Well how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when does it become a lie?</v>

645
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's too big,</v>

646
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.890
<v Speaker 1>well exactly how big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

647
00:33:33.891 --> 00:33:37.070
<v Speaker 1>When is it an illusion and when is it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive illusion?</v>

648
00:33:37.071 --> 00:33:39.680
<v Speaker 1>When does that turn into like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deception in windows?</v>

649
00:33:39.681 --> 00:33:41.990
<v Speaker 1>That turned into a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's really hard to.</v>

650
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not hard to specify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bloody impossible to specify.</v>

651
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.810
<v Speaker 1>And then exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by wellbeing?</v>

652
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.123
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what she did in this one paper was </v>

653
00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:51.674
<v Speaker 1>she took a bunch of measures that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically aligned in some way with </v>

654
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:57.340
<v Speaker 1>positive illusions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

655
00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.970
<v Speaker 1>and then she factor analyze them.</v>

656
00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:59.803
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she took out the first factor and </v>

657
00:34:00.591 --> 00:34:00.981
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

658
00:34:00.981 --> 00:34:03.410
<v Speaker 1>that's a positive illusion factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got that.</v>

659
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:04.603
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she took a bunch of outcome </v>

660
00:34:05.331 --> 00:34:06.164
<v Speaker 1>measures which were like quantify </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric scales that purported to </v>

661
00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:13.610
<v Speaker 1>measure wellbeing and mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she factor analyze that and took out</v>

662
00:34:13.611 --> 00:34:14.444
<v Speaker 1>the first factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she showed that the first </v>

663
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:16.904
<v Speaker 1>factor from the predictors correlated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the first factor from the outcome </v>

664
00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:21.464
<v Speaker 1>measures of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was an outcome measure </v>

665
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:24.700
<v Speaker 1>predictor was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

666
00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.990
<v Speaker 1>just happened to be which call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put them in.</v>

667
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.093
<v Speaker 1>But even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take questionnaires and you </v>

668
00:34:29.961 --> 00:34:30.794
<v Speaker 1>factor analyze them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first factor is usually </v>

669
00:34:32.721 --> 00:34:33.554
<v Speaker 1>extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what she did was factor </v>

670
00:34:35.871 --> 00:34:38.840
<v Speaker 1>analyze one group of questionnaires and </v>
<v Speaker 1>go on extroversion,</v>

671
00:34:38.841 --> 00:34:42.140
<v Speaker 1>which he called positive illusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she factor analyzed another set</v>

672
00:34:42.141 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 1>of questionnaires and took out the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>factor and she called that psychological</v>

673
00:34:45.591 --> 00:34:46.400
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing.</v>

674
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.670
<v Speaker 1>And then she showed the positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>illusion predicted wellbeing.</v>

675
00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Except what she really showed was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion predicted extroversion,</v>

676
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.490
<v Speaker 1>which is to show nothing at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

677
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.130
<v Speaker 1>but right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got like,</v>

678
00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:57.973
<v Speaker 1>you really got to watch this because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to assume that most of the </v>

679
00:34:59.991 --> 00:35:03.830
<v Speaker 1>psychological studies that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading are wrong in some important way,</v>

680
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:08.330
<v Speaker 1>and unfortunately you can only figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that out if you read the actual results,</v>

681
00:35:08.331 --> 00:35:09.164
<v Speaker 1>which is actually very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't read the results in 10 </v>

682
00:35:11.391 --> 00:35:12.450
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

683
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:13.303
<v Speaker 1>it took somebody a whole year to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to think through it and it's </v>

684
00:35:16.161 --> 00:35:18.740
<v Speaker 1>hard and you know like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that paper,</v>

685
00:35:18.741 --> 00:35:19.574
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing how to critique that is not </v>

686
00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:22.064
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to know that if you take </v>

687
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.823
<v Speaker 1>questionnaires that measure emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking or something akin to </v>

688
00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:32.150
<v Speaker 1>personality and you factor analyze them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the first factor.</v>

689
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.830
<v Speaker 1>You're likely to pull out his </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraversion.</v>

690
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:34.723
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you wouldn't know what sort of </v>

691
00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:40.710
<v Speaker 1>games were being played with the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that happens all the time.</v>

692
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.890
<v Speaker 1>So here's some things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

693
00:35:42.891 --> 00:35:46.080
<v Speaker 1>So then what do you do once you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>your little phenomena,</v>

694
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:50.880
<v Speaker 1>you publish it and then you get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people who are interested in it.</v>

695
00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:51.714
<v Speaker 1>So that's your little primate dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and you don't want too many </v>

696
00:35:54.421 --> 00:35:55.254
<v Speaker 1>people in that because then it's hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>climb to the top but you don't want too </v>

697
00:35:58.111 --> 00:36:00.180
<v Speaker 1>few because if it's just you and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other jerk,</v>

698
00:36:00.181 --> 00:36:03.450
<v Speaker 1>then you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares about you.</v>

699
00:36:03.451 --> 00:36:06.930
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be of moderate size,</v>

700
00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:07.764
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you use a bunch of jargon so </v>

701
00:36:09.061 --> 00:36:09.894
<v Speaker 1>that you can separate yourself from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticisms of other people and then you </v>

702
00:36:13.201 --> 00:36:14.034
<v Speaker 1>compete with each other to climb up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and it's a fairly small </v>

703
00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:16.710
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

704
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.430
<v Speaker 1>So you have a pretty good chance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like at least you know,</v>

705
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:24.170
<v Speaker 1>vice president or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use your statistics selectively and then</v>

706
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.013
<v Speaker 1>enjoy the fruits of your success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a crummy way to go about </v>

707
00:36:28.021 --> 00:36:28.854
<v Speaker 1>it and it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous because public policy </v>

708
00:36:31.951 --> 00:36:35.670
<v Speaker 1>people get jump all over this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and then bad things happen.</v>

709
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:36.923
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they will tell you some stories </v>

710
00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:42.090
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I told you already that psychologists</v>

711
00:36:42.091 --> 00:36:44.160
<v Speaker 1>are having a hard time with replication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

712
00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:44.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

713
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.560
<v Speaker 1>everybody has a hard time with </v>
<v Speaker 1>replication,</v>

714
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.753
<v Speaker 1>but there's other problems to a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the damn journals won't publish </v>

715
00:36:50.011 --> 00:36:53.490
<v Speaker 1>replications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to publish something.</v>

716
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.060
<v Speaker 1>So we've done studies like seven studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a row,</v>

717
00:36:57.061 --> 00:36:57.894
<v Speaker 1>say trying to replicate based on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding that's hypothetically well </v>

718
00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:01.584
<v Speaker 1>established in psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're using it as a measure and be </v>

719
00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 1>damned if we can get it to work.</v>

720
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.320
<v Speaker 1>So we have like seven studies where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work.</v>

721
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.680
<v Speaker 1>So you think you could publish seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>study saying you know what,</v>

722
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.620
<v Speaker 1>this thing that everybody thinks works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>

723
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.160
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't publish non replications.</v>

724
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.530
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

725
00:37:19.531 --> 00:37:22.170
<v Speaker 1>the journals won't take them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so not only that,</v>

726
00:37:22.171 --> 00:37:25.590
<v Speaker 1>the journals will rarely publish </v>
<v Speaker 1>replications themselves,</v>

727
00:37:25.591 --> 00:37:26.424
<v Speaker 1>even if they're successful because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't contribute anything new to </v>

728
00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:30.180
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

729
00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:33.060
<v Speaker 1>And so you can work yourself half to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and do a really good study,</v>

730
00:37:33.061 --> 00:37:34.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you find out,</v>

731
00:37:34.801 --> 00:37:35.910
<v Speaker 1>oh this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't work.</v>

732
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:37.703
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe it took you two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're basically screwed because </v>

733
00:37:40.171 --> 00:37:41.004
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put it in a drawer somewhere and you </v>

734
00:37:44.201 --> 00:37:45.034
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're a bit wiser but it doesn't </v>

735
00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:49.050
<v Speaker 1>advance your career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big problem.</v>

736
00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:49.884
<v Speaker 1>So part of the problem with sciences </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we forced scientists to only </v>

737
00:37:52.411 --> 00:37:54.540
<v Speaker 1>discover things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:37:54.541 --> 00:37:58.080
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get rewarded otherwise.</v>

739
00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:58.943
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a big problem and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not just psychologists that </v>

740
00:38:01.291 --> 00:38:03.610
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

741
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:06.623
<v Speaker 1>here's some things I think don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to predict anything </v>

742
00:38:08.911 --> 00:38:11.520
<v Speaker 1>in the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some things not to use.</v>

743
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't think self esteem exists is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote really one scale.</v>

744
00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.020
<v Speaker 1>The Roman taffer automated self esteem </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>

745
00:38:19.021 --> 00:38:19.854
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the standard one is the Rosenberg </v>

746
00:38:22.741 --> 00:38:24.720
<v Speaker 1>and I can't remember how many items it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>

747
00:38:24.721 --> 00:38:27.080
<v Speaker 1>15 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not enough items to be,</v>

748
00:38:27.081 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 1>to be reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there were,</v>

749
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:29.803
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25,000 published papers on self esteem </v>

750
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.210
<v Speaker 1>figure 10 grand to paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a true,</v>

751
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:37.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparatively conservative estimation.</v>

752
00:38:37.421 --> 00:38:40.120
<v Speaker 1>So you can do the math 25,000 times </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000.</v>

753
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:44.290
<v Speaker 1>So that's the total amount of research </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding that's gone into looking at self</v>

754
00:38:44.291 --> 00:38:45.160
<v Speaker 1>esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

755
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:48.250
<v Speaker 1>well what self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a word actually,</v>

756
00:38:48.251 --> 00:38:49.180
<v Speaker 1>it's two words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

757
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.560
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

758
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:53.200
<v Speaker 1>and it's sort of something you think you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might have or not have,</v>

759
00:38:53.201 --> 00:38:56.620
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a figure of speech that's not</v>

760
00:38:56.621 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 1>an empirical phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so most of your artists,</v>

761
00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:00.363
<v Speaker 1>most of extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of extroversion is just </v>

762
00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

763
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.740
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you have a lot of negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>

764
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.280
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel that good about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well isn't that a surprise?</v>

765
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.770
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot of negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

766
00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:13.480
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to fix it up a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>

767
00:39:13.481 --> 00:39:14.314
<v Speaker 1>then you can also subtract positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion from that because if you have a </v>

768
00:39:16.901 --> 00:39:20.410
<v Speaker 1>lot of negative emotion and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of positive emotion,</v>

769
00:39:20.411 --> 00:39:22.180
<v Speaker 1>so that's neuroticism minus </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

770
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.110
<v Speaker 1>then your self esteem is even lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

771
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:25.953
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe over time </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness starts to make a bit </v>

772
00:39:27.911 --> 00:39:28.721
<v Speaker 1>of a difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

773
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're conscientious and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>work hard,</v>

774
00:39:31.031 --> 00:39:34.780
<v Speaker 1>you can start to see that that's paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>off and calf rod has done some work that</v>

775
00:39:34.781 --> 00:39:36.760
<v Speaker 1>seems to sort of indicate that.</v>

776
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:37.743
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happened is </v>

777
00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:41.014
<v Speaker 1>everybody went on a self esteem bander </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the measures were pretty </v>

778
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:47.350
<v Speaker 1>appalling and even though you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>model it with the big five,</v>

779
00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:48.184
<v Speaker 1>and then one of the things that happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of that was that the </v>

780
00:39:50.201 --> 00:39:53.980
<v Speaker 1>whole California school system started </v>
<v Speaker 1>to teach students self esteem.</v>

781
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.173
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes you think you should have </v>

782
00:39:57.611 --> 00:39:58.444
<v Speaker 1>high self esteem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you're a miserable little </v>

783
00:39:59.771 --> 00:40:01.480
<v Speaker 1>worm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows,</v>

784
00:40:01.481 --> 00:40:03.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the case that you should have a</v>

785
00:40:03.851 --> 00:40:06.280
<v Speaker 1>good opinion of yourself in every bloody</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

786
00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:07.443
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a bully who pounds people out </v>

787
00:40:08.591 --> 00:40:09.424
<v Speaker 1>in the schoolyard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullies by the way do have higher self </v>

788
00:40:11.771 --> 00:40:12.604
<v Speaker 1>esteem than normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there because it's not like they're </v>

789
00:40:15.431 --> 00:40:17.320
<v Speaker 1>feeling bad about themselves when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>pound you,</v>

790
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:20.200
<v Speaker 1>they're feeling bad about you and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best work.</v>

791
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:21.183
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the low self esteem equals bully </v>

792
00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:24.850
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people believe that,</v>

793
00:40:24.851 --> 00:40:25.684
<v Speaker 1>but if you read Dan always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the world's leading authority on </v>

794
00:40:28.181 --> 00:40:30.040
<v Speaker 1>bullying and who's actually done </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it,</v>

795
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.570
<v Speaker 1>what he says is that bullies have </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriately high self esteem,</v>

796
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.450
<v Speaker 1>which is why they think they're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly good position to pound you out</v>

797
00:40:37.451 --> 00:40:38.284
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to be on the playground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like they're suffering from </v>

798
00:40:40.811 --> 00:40:41.590
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

799
00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:45.160
<v Speaker 1>neurotic weakness of self image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite the contrary.</v>

800
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:49.360
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the California school system,</v>

801
00:40:49.361 --> 00:40:52.390
<v Speaker 1>they tried to teach kids self esteem and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

802
00:40:52.391 --> 00:40:53.224
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence that you can do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>first because neuroticism is actually </v>

803
00:40:55.901 --> 00:40:57.970
<v Speaker 1>quite hard to shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

804
00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.210
<v Speaker 1>And if we knew how to treat it well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hooray,</v>

805
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.770
<v Speaker 1>everybody would be thrilled about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not easy.</v>

806
00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.280
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people like,</v>

807
00:41:05.281 --> 00:41:06.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's her name,</v>

808
00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.313
<v Speaker 1>Jean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she used to be a student of Roy </v>

809
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.553
<v Speaker 1>ministers who claims that all that self </v>
<v Speaker 1>esteem training has just made younger </v>

810
00:41:14.801 --> 00:41:17.590
<v Speaker 1>people like you guys more.</v>

811
00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.950
<v Speaker 1>What do you call that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Narcissistic.</v>

812
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:22.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the self esteem becomes </v>

813
00:41:22.871 --> 00:41:25.870
<v Speaker 1>disconnected from the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment because you might hope,</v>

814
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd sort of feel good.</v>

815
00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.600
<v Speaker 1>How good should you feel about yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

816
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:32.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

817
00:41:32.411 --> 00:41:33.244
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should grant yourself the right to </v>

818
00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:36.080
<v Speaker 1>exist like you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else,</v>

819
00:41:36.081 --> 00:41:38.690
<v Speaker 1>you know that sort of like a basic human</v>
<v Speaker 1>right as a human being,</v>

820
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:39.524
<v Speaker 1>you're valuable and then maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should sort of think you're about as </v>

821
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:44.300
<v Speaker 1>valuable as other people roughly think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

822
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:45.860
<v Speaker 1>That seems about right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

823
00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:46.694
<v Speaker 1>So the right amount of self esteem would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be your perception of your value within </v>

824
00:41:51.501 --> 00:41:54.440
<v Speaker 1>the context of a group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be something like that,</v>

825
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there shouldn't be a concordance </v>

826
00:41:56.361 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 1>because like maybe you need to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could well be,</v>

827
00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and are you going to improve if you're </v>

828
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:03.530
<v Speaker 1>feeling really good about yourself?</v>

829
00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Well the answer to that is what we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

830
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.113
<v Speaker 1>How much misery about yourself do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to have before you're motivated to </v>

831
00:42:11.031 --> 00:42:12.260
<v Speaker 1>improve yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

832
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't seem right,</v>

833
00:42:14.751 --> 00:42:19.000
<v Speaker 1>but we also don't know whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>shame or guilt or anxiety or pain or you</v>

834
00:42:19.001 --> 00:42:19.834
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these negative emotions that motivate </v>

835
00:42:20.901 --> 00:42:21.734
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's clear that if you have enough </v>

836
00:42:22.941 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion that can paralyze you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's like depression and and,</v>

837
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.213
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrically high levels of anxiety </v>

838
00:42:30.321 --> 00:42:33.350
<v Speaker 1>that's not like low self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a problem.</v>

839
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.393
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that working memory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>executive function are distinguishable </v>

840
00:42:37.131 --> 00:42:38.720
<v Speaker 1>from ICU,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially.</v>

841
00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our research,</v>

842
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.640
<v Speaker 1>we've done a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've added factor,</v>

843
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:44.483
<v Speaker 1>analyzed a battery of 10 dorsolateral </v>
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal tests done given to 3000 </v>

844
00:42:51.981 --> 00:42:52.790
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big,</v>

845
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:53.623
<v Speaker 1>very big sample.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't published this for a variety </v>

846
00:42:56.631 --> 00:42:59.610
<v Speaker 1>of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one factor comes out and you know,</v>

847
00:42:59.611 --> 00:43:03.470
<v Speaker 1>and Carol's rule for Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you take cognitive tests,</v>

848
00:43:03.471 --> 00:43:06.050
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fact around analyze them,</v>

849
00:43:06.051 --> 00:43:07.130
<v Speaker 1>you pull out the first factor.</v>

850
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:08.570
<v Speaker 1>That's fluid intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

851
00:43:08.571 --> 00:43:09.404
<v Speaker 1>well that's basically what we found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you look at the correlation </v>

852
00:43:12.951 --> 00:43:15.410
<v Speaker 1>between each of the single tests and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first factor,</v>

853
00:43:15.411 --> 00:43:17.120
<v Speaker 1>it's only about point three or point </v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

854
00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.550
<v Speaker 1>but that's also what you find in Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests.</v>

855
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:20.803
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each individual test only correlates </v>

856
00:43:22.161 --> 00:43:26.060
<v Speaker 1>with the aggregate at about point three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you aggregate enough of them,</v>

857
00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.450
<v Speaker 1>you get fluid intelligence and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a solid as a rock.</v>

858
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:30.613
<v Speaker 1>So I'm emotional intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only does that probably not exist </v>

859
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:37.850
<v Speaker 1>because it's agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

860
00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you always hear,</v>

861
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:42.020
<v Speaker 1>you need emotional intelligence to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to thrive in the workplace.</v>

862
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like turns out that's exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards.</v>

863
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Disagreeable people do better as </v>
<v Speaker 1>managers in the workplace.</v>

864
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you lack emotional intelligence,</v>

865
00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:53.450
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to be an effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>manager.</v>

866
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:54.643
<v Speaker 1>So an emotional intelligence is a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicator of sort of pathology and </v>

867
00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:02.090
<v Speaker 1>psychology because it was invented by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist,</v>

868
00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:03.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just have some word invented </v>

869
00:44:04.701 --> 00:44:06.980
<v Speaker 1>by a journalist and then go make a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody,</v>

870
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise out of it.</v>

871
00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:10.183
<v Speaker 1>You got to find out if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's really there and there's not a </v>

872
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:15.140
<v Speaker 1>lot of evidence that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does it mean anyways?</v>

873
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Emotional intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

874
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I can infer what you're feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

875
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:27.140
<v Speaker 1>is that Iq like our smart people better </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that or like,</v>

876
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:30.200
<v Speaker 1>am I mirroring you in some way or do I </v>
<v Speaker 1>care for you?</v>

877
00:44:30.201 --> 00:44:31.034
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe I can figure out exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're feeling and I just don't give a </v>

878
00:44:33.091 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

879
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.290
<v Speaker 1>is that still emotional intelligence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I don't know.</v>

880
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:38.124
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you separate that from </v>

881
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:39.774
<v Speaker 1>sympathy or empathy and what and what if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're over sympathetic to someone is </v>

882
00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 1>that emotional intelligence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you'll feel way too sorry for</v>

883
00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:47.454
<v Speaker 1>your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you're all empathetic and </v>

884
00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:50.454
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not doing them any good or </v>

885
00:44:52.081 --> 00:44:54.030
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you should say,</v>

886
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:54.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quit whining,</v>

887
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:58.530
<v Speaker 1>go the hell outside because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right response sometimes.</v>

888
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:03.210
<v Speaker 1>So these things are not straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

889
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:04.523
<v Speaker 1>And of course emotional intelligence is </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally measured with questionnaires </v>

890
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:11.400
<v Speaker 1>and we know the rule for questionnaires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the rule for questionnaires?</v>

891
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.040
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

892
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:21.270
<v Speaker 1>It's measuring one or more of the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>five either well or badly.</v>

893
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and,</v>

894
00:45:22.571 --> 00:45:23.404
<v Speaker 1>and as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that personality as a </v>

895
00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:29.010
<v Speaker 1>five dimensional structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making that argument because who</v>

896
00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:31.530
<v Speaker 1>the hell knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it does likely,</v>

897
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.053
<v Speaker 1>although it's very difficult to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what the big five theorists have </v>

898
00:45:35.791 --> 00:45:37.920
<v Speaker 1>really demonstrated as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

899
00:45:37.921 --> 00:45:39.990
<v Speaker 1>is that if you factor headlights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaires,</v>

900
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:41.063
<v Speaker 1>what you get looks a lot like a five </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor structure and you can do that </v>

901
00:45:43.861 --> 00:45:44.694
<v Speaker 1>cross culturally and so I think we sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nailed the question of how our </v>

902
00:45:48.481 --> 00:45:53.100
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire is structured so you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>just invent some new thing in term.</v>

903
00:45:53.101 --> 00:45:57.780
<v Speaker 1>It's something and then pretend it </v>
<v Speaker 1>something new without testing it against</v>

904
00:45:57.781 --> 00:46:00.180
<v Speaker 1>and I would test it against Iq because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that bloody thing.</v>

905
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:01.163
<v Speaker 1>We know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq eats up most of the variance in </v>

906
00:46:02.911 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 1>disgust.</v>

907
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Sensitivity scales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think,</v>

908
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:06.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

909
00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Why would I qb related to disgust </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity.</v>

910
00:46:09.121 --> 00:46:10.770
<v Speaker 1>It's inversely related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

911
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.340
<v Speaker 1>the smarter you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less sensitive you are to discuss.</v>

912
00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:15.803
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know if that's because maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cortical inhibition of underlying </v>

913
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:22.740
<v Speaker 1>like limbic limbic motivational systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>is better.</v>

914
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know why,</v>

915
00:46:25.201 --> 00:46:27.060
<v Speaker 1>but we do know that it's a major </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictor.</v>

916
00:46:27.061 --> 00:46:27.894
<v Speaker 1>Orderliness also predicts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about Iq is that it </v>

917
00:46:30.421 --> 00:46:31.254
<v Speaker 1>predicts things that you'd never expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you should validate your scale </v>

918
00:46:34.201 --> 00:46:35.034
<v Speaker 1>against Iq and against the big five and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not some trivial little 10 item measure </v>

919
00:46:38.281 --> 00:46:43.050
<v Speaker 1>of the big five either because then if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you use two questions per trade,</v>

920
00:46:43.051 --> 00:46:43.884
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a lousy measure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the big five and if you're stupid </v>

921
00:46:45.751 --> 00:46:47.940
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire predicts over and above </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

922
00:46:47.941 --> 00:46:50.670
<v Speaker 1>all that means is that you didn't test </v>
<v Speaker 1>it against you.</v>

923
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:51.503
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't set it up for a good </v>

924
00:46:52.051 --> 00:46:54.120
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You set it up for a week challenge.</v>

925
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.480
<v Speaker 1>So grant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very annoying.</v>

926
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:58.703
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very annoying because it's </v>

927
00:46:59.401 --> 00:47:01.140
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was correlated.</v>

928
00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you this was correlated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with conscientiousness of point seven,</v>

929
00:47:04.411 --> 00:47:05.244
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that optimism and </v>

930
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:07.104
<v Speaker 1>pessimism exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that promotion and </v>

931
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:11.820
<v Speaker 1>prevention exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Empathy.</v>

932
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:13.830
<v Speaker 1>We tried measuring empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we use.</v>

933
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:16.740
<v Speaker 1>You can measure empathy like mad if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>use one measure,</v>

934
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.293
<v Speaker 1>but he was three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden your empathy </v>

935
00:47:19.471 --> 00:47:21.840
<v Speaker 1>measures don't correlate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that really sucks.</v>

936
00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.180
<v Speaker 1>So the way out of that is just to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>one measure,</v>

937
00:47:24.181 --> 00:47:25.014
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously not if you're three </v>

938
00:47:27.301 --> 00:47:30.940
<v Speaker 1>empathy measures don't correlate while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a problem.</v>

939
00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.133
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have three rulers and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure something and you get different </v>

940
00:47:34.901 --> 00:47:36.400
<v Speaker 1>numbers from each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like really?</v>

941
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:40.420
<v Speaker 1>That's probably you're either measuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>like bubblegum,</v>

942
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:42.940
<v Speaker 1>well it stretching or there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with your rulers.</v>

943
00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:44.283
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think psychopathy exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's low agreeableness and low </v>

944
00:47:50.171 --> 00:47:51.004
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness because that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you a Predator that's low </v>

945
00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.450
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness and a parasite because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's low conscientiousness.</v>

946
00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.400
<v Speaker 1>So that kind of sums up psychopaths in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of personality disorders.</v>

947
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:02.083
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of them and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last 20 years people have been </v>

948
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.553
<v Speaker 1>the psychometricians in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be trying to cram those things into </v>

949
00:48:08.321 --> 00:48:10.360
<v Speaker 1>the big five structure and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaching,</v>

950
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:11.763
<v Speaker 1>they're experiencing a tremendous amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of resistance from the established </v>

951
00:48:15.431 --> 00:48:20.431
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric community and no wonder but </v>
<v Speaker 1>the but it still lift big five does seem</v>

952
00:48:20.951 --> 00:48:21.784
<v Speaker 1>to be able to provide a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>model of what constitutes personality </v>

953
00:48:24.581 --> 00:48:25.414
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of surprising because </v>

954
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:31.060
<v Speaker 1>you may remember I told you when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the personality measures were first</v>

955
00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:32.043
<v Speaker 1>originated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they threw out all the evaluative words </v>

956
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:38.530
<v Speaker 1>like evil or bad or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or good for that matter,</v>

957
00:48:38.531 --> 00:48:39.364
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine that that would </v>

958
00:48:40.691 --> 00:48:41.524
<v Speaker 1>attenuate the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and psychopathology because </v>

959
00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:45.453
<v Speaker 1>you tend to use more anti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more judgmental words when you're </v>

960
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:52.810
<v Speaker 1>describing psychopathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like antisocial for example,</v>

961
00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:54.580
<v Speaker 1>which isn't in a personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire,</v>

962
00:48:54.581 --> 00:48:55.414
<v Speaker 1>but which if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would likely load primarily on low on </v>

963
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:01.000
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low</v>

964
00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:06.490
<v Speaker 1>positive illusions told you about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>already practical intelligence.</v>

965
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:07.383
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

966
00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.140
<v Speaker 1>that does not exist and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that it exists.</v>

967
00:49:11.141 --> 00:49:11.974
<v Speaker 1>So Sternberg who has said that part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason he was interested in </v>

968
00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:19.000
<v Speaker 1>practical intelligence was because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do very well on his gres.</v>

969
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

970
00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:22.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got this idea that,</v>

971
00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:27.430
<v Speaker 1>well there's a difference between book </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarts and that sort of nerdy people and</v>

972
00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:28.323
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

973
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:29.830
<v Speaker 1>street smarts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

974
00:49:29.831 --> 00:49:30.664
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the punk who makes it out in the real </v>

975
00:49:31.841 --> 00:49:33.040
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

976
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.930
<v Speaker 1>And Street smarts is like practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence with.</v>

977
00:49:36.931 --> 00:49:37.764
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that he never really </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts his practical intelligence </v>

978
00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.253
<v Speaker 1>measures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really don't exist up against Iq </v>

979
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:44.733
<v Speaker 1>in a fair head to head fight and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being just slaughtered for this in the </v>

980
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.810
<v Speaker 1>scientific press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially by Linda.</v>

981
00:49:49.811 --> 00:49:53.260
<v Speaker 1>God Fredson who wrote that paper that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had you guys read on,</v>

982
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:55.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the complexity of everyday life.</v>

983
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:57.640
<v Speaker 1>God's since she's a smart cookie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that woman,</v>

984
00:49:57.641 --> 00:49:59.230
<v Speaker 1>and she's brave too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

985
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:02.290
<v Speaker 1>because she follows the data where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes and she's a very,</v>

986
00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:05.860
<v Speaker 1>very clear thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She really gave Sternberg couple of good</v>

987
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:09.010
<v Speaker 1>wax and he certainly deserved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Multiple intelligences.</v>

988
00:50:09.011 --> 00:50:10.600
<v Speaker 1>You've heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've imagined.</v>

989
00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.300
<v Speaker 1>What are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sensory Motor.</v>

990
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Kinesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional.</v>

991
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

992
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Interpersonal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

993
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those aren't intelligences.</v>

994
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:25.660
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a who knows if they exist and be.</v>

995
00:50:25.661 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 1>We had a perfectly good word for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was talent.</v>

996
00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:30.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't just take a word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

997
00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.260
<v Speaker 1>like that's been studied for 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like intelligence,</v>

998
00:50:33.261 --> 00:50:35.120
<v Speaker 1>which has a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very specific,</v>

999
00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:36.413
<v Speaker 1>a specific definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more specific than anything social </v>

1000
00:50:39.771 --> 00:50:40.820
<v Speaker 1>scientists measure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1001
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:42.800
<v Speaker 1>So if you believe in social science at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1002
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.070
<v Speaker 1>you have to take Iq into account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just swipes the word says,</v>

1003
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.050
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well everybody wins.</v>

1004
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:49.011
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1005
00:50:49.011 --> 00:50:49.844
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1006
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:52.400
<v Speaker 1>people have talents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough,</v>

1007
00:50:52.401 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not trivial.</v>

1008
00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:57.410
<v Speaker 1>But to call them intelligences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he also says,</v>

1009
00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.630
<v Speaker 1>when people harass him about his </v>
<v Speaker 1>concepts,</v>

1010
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:00.051
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1011
00:51:00.051 --> 00:51:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't really believe in measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1012
00:51:02.391 --> 00:51:03.680
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1013
00:51:03.681 --> 00:51:06.150
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except if you're like,</v>

1014
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:08.150
<v Speaker 1>if you're not going to believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>measurement,</v>

1015
00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.480
<v Speaker 1>then what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not science.</v>

1016
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 1>It might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

1017
00:51:13.161 --> 00:51:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's educational philosophy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

1018
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:17.143
<v Speaker 1>but it's not science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's 20 years later with his </v>

1019
00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:21.044
<v Speaker 1>multiple intelligence theories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's be no published measures of </v>

1020
00:51:23.751 --> 00:51:24.584
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whenever people have tried to </v>

1021
00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:26.624
<v Speaker 1>measure them and set them up head to </v>
<v Speaker 1>head against say intelligence plus </v>

1022
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:32.450
<v Speaker 1>personality intelligence and personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>just eats them up.</v>

1023
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:33.530
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1024
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.950
<v Speaker 1>multiple intelligence theory had a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on educational theory.</v>

1025
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:38.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1026
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.983
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every child should have the opportunity </v>

1027
00:51:40.011 --> 00:51:42.230
<v Speaker 1>to develop their own particular form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

1028
00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:42.681
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1029
00:51:42.681 --> 00:51:44.750
<v Speaker 1>well that's great except you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure it.</v>

1030
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:46.970
<v Speaker 1>We don't know if it exists and even if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it does,</v>

1031
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:47.853
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how to develop it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't shown that you can develop it </v>

1032
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.150
<v Speaker 1>and you haven't shown that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing harm by,</v>

1033
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending that these things exist and </v>

1034
00:51:55.491 --> 00:51:58.070
<v Speaker 1>act as if that's actual knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1035
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.370
<v Speaker 1>things that might exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1036
00:52:01.371 --> 00:52:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I told you about these already while </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots,</v>

1037
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:04.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to you a lot about the big </v>

1038
00:52:05.031 --> 00:52:05.864
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1039
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.823
<v Speaker 1>but personality isn't that great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A predictor of individual behavior </v>

1040
00:52:09.891 --> 00:52:10.724
<v Speaker 1>because people are very variable in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their behavior from situation to </v>

1041
00:52:12.741 --> 00:52:13.574
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the best you ever get out of a </v>

1042
00:52:14.541 --> 00:52:18.050
<v Speaker 1>personality measures about point three </v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe about point four,</v>

1043
00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:21.440
<v Speaker 1>that was discovered in 1968.</v>

1044
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:26.710
<v Speaker 1>There was a big hubbub about that made </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Walter Michelle who said,</v>

1045
00:52:27.681 --> 00:52:29.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality scales,</v>

1046
00:52:29.481 --> 00:52:32.360
<v Speaker 1>they give you a point to point three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like nine percent of the variance</v>

1047
00:52:32.361 --> 00:52:33.194
<v Speaker 1>at best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what about the other 90 percent and </v>

1048
00:52:35.451 --> 00:52:39.590
<v Speaker 1>why are we chasing such a trivial amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that killed personality research,</v>

1049
00:52:39.591 --> 00:52:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Stone Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four til 1992.</v>

1050
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:44.143
<v Speaker 1>So for 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 24 years I believe because </v>

1051
00:52:46.131 --> 00:52:47.090
<v Speaker 1>everybody went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1052
00:52:47.091 --> 00:52:47.924
<v Speaker 1>these are trivial effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then no one ever looked to see what </v>

1053
00:52:50.241 --> 00:52:51.074
<v Speaker 1>the effects were in all the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology because it turned out that </v>

1054
00:52:53.391 --> 00:52:56.780
<v Speaker 1>point two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point three is about on the upper end of</v>

1055
00:52:56.781 --> 00:52:57.614
<v Speaker 1>the effects that you get in most forms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of psychology and so that even if it </v>

1056
00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:05.270
<v Speaker 1>isn't that great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as good or better than whatever one</v>

1057
00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:06.203
<v Speaker 1>else is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then there are also economic </v>

1058
00:53:08.091 --> 00:53:08.924
<v Speaker 1>analysis which we'll show you later done</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 nineties that showed that </v>

1059
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:15.800
<v Speaker 1>because human variability in </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity is so great,</v>

1060
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:16.903
<v Speaker 1>especially on the Prieto distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't need very accurate </v>

1061
00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:23.630
<v Speaker 1>predictors for them to be extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful economically.</v>

1062
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Because the question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1063
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:29.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're paying your employee $50,000 a</v>

1064
00:53:29.461 --> 00:53:33.270
<v Speaker 1>year and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could potentially pick an employee,</v>

1065
00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:34.163
<v Speaker 1>an employee that was one standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation above the mean higher than </v>

1066
00:53:38.071 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 1>average on conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with some bad measure,</v>

1067
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:42.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so over 10 employees you get an average </v>

1068
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:46.500
<v Speaker 1>of one standard deviation higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1069
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:48.070
<v Speaker 1>The real question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1070
00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:51.960
<v Speaker 1>what's the economic return on that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is well,</v>

1071
00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:52.794
<v Speaker 1>because people are so variable in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance when some people do like </v>

1072
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:58.260
<v Speaker 1>their crazily productive and others are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1073
00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.333
<v Speaker 1>they actually detract from the function </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the organization that they figure </v>

1074
00:54:02.341 --> 00:54:03.174
<v Speaker 1>about 40 percent of managers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ab negative net value to the companies </v>

1075
00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:07.434
<v Speaker 1>they work for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the productivity line </v>

1076
00:54:10.381 --> 00:54:11.730
<v Speaker 1>doesn't end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's zero.</v>

1077
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're a particularly bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>manager,</v>

1078
00:54:14.401 --> 00:54:16.860
<v Speaker 1>you can be sucking money out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise like Matt.</v>

1079
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Well it turns out that even small </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictors have huge economic value.</v>

1080
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:23.040
<v Speaker 1>So even though they're not that good,</v>

1081
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.150
<v Speaker 1>the amount that they are good is better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than interviews for example,</v>

1082
00:54:28.151 --> 00:54:28.984
<v Speaker 1>by quite a substantial margin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're gonna hire people and </v>

1083
00:54:31.841 --> 00:54:32.674
<v Speaker 1>you want better people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can use personality tests and </v>

1084
00:54:34.901 --> 00:54:37.080
<v Speaker 1>that that actually works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

1085
00:54:37.081 --> 00:54:39.370
<v Speaker 1>what's real well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural factors are real.</v>

1086
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.610
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects of your peer networks,</v>

1087
00:54:42.611 --> 00:54:43.444
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The degree to which like one thing you </v>

1088
00:54:46.691 --> 00:54:50.080
<v Speaker 1>guys should think about as you progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>through life is that,</v>

1089
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:50.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of things that make </v>

1090
00:54:51.491 --> 00:54:54.310
<v Speaker 1>you successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence is one,</v>

1091
00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:57.010
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are pretty rough.</v>

1092
00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:02.290
<v Speaker 1>The breadth of your social network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big deal too.</v>

1093
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.880
<v Speaker 1>That's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1094
00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:07.720
<v Speaker 1>people talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate this word schmoozing,</v>

1095
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:08.803
<v Speaker 1>it's a horrible word and I wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend that anybody ever does that </v>

1096
00:55:11.351 --> 00:55:14.110
<v Speaker 1>because that's sort of making </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections for the sake of having them.</v>

1097
00:55:14.111 --> 00:55:14.944
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you get older you'll find that of </v>

1098
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:18.303
<v Speaker 1>course the people that you know get </v>
<v Speaker 1>older too and they get centralized and </v>

1099
00:55:21.931 --> 00:55:25.750
<v Speaker 1>more and more in positions with more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more influence.</v>

1100
00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:26.883
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that makes you valuable as </v>

1101
00:55:29.411 --> 00:55:34.411
<v Speaker 1>you get older is how well connected you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in a sort of broad social network.</v>

1102
00:55:34.511 --> 00:55:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of what happens if someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to you and says,</v>

1103
00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:39.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here I've got a problem.</v>

1104
00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:43.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean one potential response to that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1105
00:55:43.091 --> 00:55:45.670
<v Speaker 1>all solve it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another potential response is,</v>

1106
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:47.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to solve that,</v>

1107
00:55:47.171 --> 00:55:50.860
<v Speaker 1>but I know this guy or this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they do know how to solve it,</v>

1108
00:55:50.861 --> 00:55:53.290
<v Speaker 1>so you know that that's an extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

1109
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.880
<v Speaker 1>That's an extremely useful additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>attribute and we haven't measured that.</v>

1110
00:55:57.881 --> 00:55:59.140
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have measured that much.</v>

1111
00:55:59.141 --> 00:56:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the things that give</v>
<v Speaker 1>older people in edge on younger people.</v>

1112
00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Younger people are smarter in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid intelligence.</v>

1113
00:56:05.411 --> 00:56:06.244
<v Speaker 1>They're not as conscientious though when</v>
<v Speaker 1>their social networks are nowhere near </v>

1114
00:56:09.011 --> 00:56:09.844
<v Speaker 1>as well developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put that slide together about a year </v>

1115
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:15.100
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of an interesting one.</v>

1116
00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:19.240
<v Speaker 1>I think you can see just from the facial</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressions,</v>

1117
00:56:19.241 --> 00:56:22.330
<v Speaker 1>were these people sort of map pay while </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Carey,</v>

1118
00:56:22.331 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 1>you could hardly get extroverted than </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1119
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's on cocaine all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Rogers,</v>

1120
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:32.170
<v Speaker 1>he's agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't know the next guy.</v>

1121
00:56:32.171 --> 00:56:33.004
<v Speaker 1>His name was able to go to a played.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He played a very introverted policemen </v>

1122
00:56:38.441 --> 00:56:39.274
<v Speaker 1>on an old sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do and while he's neurotic is can </v>

1123
00:56:40.961 --> 00:56:45.430
<v Speaker 1>be a castle high in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Stewart,</v>

1124
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:50.020
<v Speaker 1>very high in emotional stability house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's houses primary characteristic?</v>

1125
00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Disagreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really disagreeable.</v>

1126
00:56:53.661 --> 00:56:55.010
<v Speaker 1>He's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent,</v>

1127
00:56:55.011 --> 00:56:56.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's super disagreeable.</v>

1128
00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.370
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what makes him interesting.</v>

1129
00:56:58.371 --> 00:57:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Robert mentioned was the same then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Clint Eastwood,</v>

1130
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:05.570
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>introverted and emotionally stable.</v>

1131
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:07.580
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1132
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:12.420
<v Speaker 1>it's quite interesting to see how varied</v>
<v Speaker 1>the facial expressions are.</v>

1133
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:19.940
<v Speaker 1>So you guys of course remember this will</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take a look at it briefly,</v>

1134
00:57:19.941 --> 00:57:21.800
<v Speaker 1>so to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to clue you in.</v>

1135
00:57:21.801 --> 00:57:24.650
<v Speaker 1>So the big predictor seemed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness,</v>

1136
00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:26.990
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness.</v>

1137
00:57:26.991 --> 00:57:27.824
<v Speaker 1>If you're working with people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeableness if you're working with </v>

1138
00:57:29.781 --> 00:57:30.614
<v Speaker 1>things and plasticity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness gives you creative achievement </v>

1139
00:57:34.071 --> 00:57:37.100
<v Speaker 1>plus entrepreneurial ability and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion is pretty good.</v>

1140
00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:41.120
<v Speaker 1>We just published a paper using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative achievement questionnaire,</v>

1141
00:57:41.121 --> 00:57:41.954
<v Speaker 1>which I'll show you a bit later and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found was that openness was a very </v>

1142
00:57:46.551 --> 00:57:48.530
<v Speaker 1>good predictor of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of creative achievement,</v>

1143
00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:49.364
<v Speaker 1>but so is extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's probably because if </v>

1144
00:57:54.081 --> 00:57:56.060
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be an artist or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative type,</v>

1145
00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.900
<v Speaker 1>you better be a bit of a marketer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1146
00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:01.760
<v Speaker 1>because it's one thing to sit in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>garret and paint things,</v>

1147
00:58:01.761 --> 00:58:04.170
<v Speaker 1>but what'll happen is you'll starve to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and then you know,</v>

1148
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:07.580
<v Speaker 1>100 years later someone will sell one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your paintings for $25,000,000,</v>

1149
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:10.700
<v Speaker 1>which is not very helpful for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're extroverted,</v>

1150
00:58:10.701 --> 00:58:11.534
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get out there a bit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>be enthusiastic about what you're </v>

1151
00:58:13.371 --> 00:58:15.860
<v Speaker 1>producing and maybe that gives you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to market it.</v>

1152
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.233
<v Speaker 1>We also know that openness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion together make up </v>

1153
00:58:19.101 --> 00:58:20.150
<v Speaker 1>plasticity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1154
00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.780
<v Speaker 1>And plasticity actually seems to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>better predictor of creative achievement</v>

1155
00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:25.460
<v Speaker 1>than openness per se.</v>

1156
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.780
<v Speaker 3>So which is</v>

1157
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.823
<v Speaker 1>there's several,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several hundred people in this </v>

1158
00:58:32.031 --> 00:58:32.990
<v Speaker 1>particular sample.</v>

1159
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:34.543
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1160
00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:36.903
<v Speaker 1>you guys know about this already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extroversion is associated with </v>

1161
00:58:39.161 --> 00:58:40.300
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimism,</v>

1162
00:58:40.301 --> 00:58:41.920
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gregariousness,</v>

1163
00:58:41.921 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 1>and assertiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

1164
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:45.503
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It correlates negatively with longterm </v>

1165
00:58:47.621 --> 00:58:49.330
<v Speaker 1>life outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bet.</v>

1166
00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:50.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not that powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1167
00:58:50.821 --> 00:58:51.820
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>

1168
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:52.893
<v Speaker 1>A height.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People high in neuroticism have a hard </v>

1169
00:58:54.461 --> 00:58:58.080
<v Speaker 1>time with stress so they can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens with neuroticism is</v>

1170
00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.790
<v Speaker 1>you pass a certain point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>

1171
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:02.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're too high in neuroticism and </v>

1172
00:59:03.011 --> 00:59:06.940
<v Speaker 1>then some life event comes along that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just too much and sucker punches you and</v>

1173
00:59:06.941 --> 00:59:10.870
<v Speaker 1>then that further destabilizes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system and you're,</v>

1174
00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:12.580
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of out of the game at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

1175
00:59:12.581 --> 00:59:15.580
<v Speaker 1>So if you're high in negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you want to.</v>

1176
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:19.480
<v Speaker 1>I would say the first thing I would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>is make sure you eat breakfast.</v>

1177
00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:20.613
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like a weird suggestion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know from my clinical practice </v>

1178
00:59:23.511 --> 00:59:24.344
<v Speaker 1>that if I can get my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my clients who are high in negative </v>

1179
00:59:26.691 --> 00:59:27.524
<v Speaker 1>emotion to eat a decent breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps stabilize their nervous </v>

1180
00:59:30.411 --> 00:59:31.490
<v Speaker 1>system throughout the day.</v>

1181
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:32.533
<v Speaker 1>You really got to watch yourself if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're high in negative emotion because </v>

1182
00:59:34.161 --> 00:59:34.994
<v Speaker 1>your stress tolerance isn't that great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might also want to not take like </v>

1183
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:40.400
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really stressful jobs because they grind</v>

1184
00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:42.950
<v Speaker 1>you down over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's something to think about.</v>

1185
00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 1>So agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compliance,</v>

1186
00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:47.630
<v Speaker 1>empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>materiality,</v>

1187
00:59:47.631 --> 00:59:49.370
<v Speaker 1>kinship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now on the negative side,</v>

1188
00:59:49.371 --> 00:59:50.930
<v Speaker 1>if it gets extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's criminality,</v>

1189
00:59:50.931 --> 00:59:53.360
<v Speaker 1>but disagreeable people are tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>minded.</v>

1190
00:59:53.361 --> 00:59:54.600
<v Speaker 1>They're hard to push around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1191
00:59:54.610 --> 00:59:57.860
<v Speaker 1>and they can be a little bit on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>catalyst side and you know,</v>

1192
00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:58.850
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1193
00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>is that a useful attribute?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1194
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:02.683
<v Speaker 1>I know this one guy who is dismissed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable as you can possibly </v>

1195
01:00:06.321 --> 01:00:07.260
<v Speaker 1>imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1196
01:00:07.261 --> 01:00:09.230
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

1197
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:11.870
<v Speaker 1>I was watching him work at a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation.</v>

1198
01:00:11.871 --> 01:00:14.270
<v Speaker 1>He was firing people because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation was shrinking,</v>

1199
01:00:14.271 --> 01:00:15.430
<v Speaker 1>like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like was,</v>

1200
01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.970
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was having a real rough time.</v>

1201
01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.133
<v Speaker 1>So they had to downsize and I asked him </v>
<v Speaker 1>how he handled the emotional stress of </v>

1202
01:00:22.191 --> 01:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>having to fire people and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1203
01:00:23.571 --> 01:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he enjoyed it and I thought,</v>

1204
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:26.743
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not something that I've heard </v>

1205
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:28.520
<v Speaker 1>very often.</v>

1206
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.031
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1207
01:00:29.031 --> 01:00:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean most of the people that are fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>or they've been useless and they've been</v>

1208
01:00:33.441 --> 01:00:36.830
<v Speaker 1>like a existing on other people's Labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>for like 10 years.</v>

1209
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.350
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever called them on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't bother me a bit.</v>

1210
01:00:39.351 --> 01:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I just think of all the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been interfering with and,</v>

1211
01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:43.970
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1212
01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:44.804
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you deserve to be gone and you don't </v>

1213
01:00:45.801 --> 01:00:47.750
<v Speaker 1>have to be a tough son of a bitch to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1214
01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1215
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about that because,</v>

1216
01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:53.210
<v Speaker 1>and I do a fair bit of management </v>
<v Speaker 1>consulting.</v>

1217
01:00:53.211 --> 01:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're a manager and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got 10 employees and one of them is hard</v>

1218
01:00:57.681 --> 01:01:01.280
<v Speaker 1>to get along with and not productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because they're hard to get along</v>

1219
01:01:01.281 --> 01:01:02.114
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make everyone else's life more </v>

1220
01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:06.410
<v Speaker 1>miserable than it has to be and because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not productive,</v>

1221
01:01:06.411 --> 01:01:08.090
<v Speaker 1>then everybody else has to do their </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1222
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1223
01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:10.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do about that </v>

1224
01:01:11.061 --> 01:01:11.871
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know,</v>

1225
01:01:11.871 --> 01:01:12.704
<v Speaker 1>maybe they have a sick parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that too because people are </v>

1226
01:01:15.081 --> 01:01:17.390
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think you think,</v>

1227
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:21.170
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person's in place in their life.</v>

1228
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.080
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do about that?</v>

1229
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think maybe if you're compassionate,</v>

1230
01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:27.651
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1231
01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

1232
01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.720
<v Speaker 1>they've got a difficult situation at </v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

1233
01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:30.554
<v Speaker 1>They've got a sick parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a really good time to fire </v>

1234
01:01:31.851 --> 01:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>La Blah Blah,</v>

1235
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:34.063
<v Speaker 1>but then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about those other nine people you </v>

1236
01:01:36.801 --> 01:01:37.634
<v Speaker 1>know going to work for them that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>near as good as it could be and like </v>

1237
01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.593
<v Speaker 1>they're working hard but they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefiting from it and plus the fact </v>

1238
01:01:44.031 --> 01:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>that this person gets away with it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>demotivating and unfair.</v>

1239
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So then you've got to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1240
01:01:49.311 --> 01:01:51.530
<v Speaker 1>exactly who are you being empathic with?</v>

1241
01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>And this is a hard question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's seriously,</v>

1242
01:01:54.651 --> 01:01:55.484
<v Speaker 1>this is a very difficult question when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in an organization and you're </v>

1243
01:01:57.741 --> 01:02:00.110
<v Speaker 1>trying to build something that goes into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a particular direction.</v>

1244
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's your threshold?</v>

1245
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Like my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wouldn't say I'm very good at this</v>

1246
01:02:05.481 --> 01:02:09.140
<v Speaker 1>because I'm kind of tender hearted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much to my chagrin so,</v>

1247
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:10.423
<v Speaker 1>but my experience doing management </v>
<v Speaker 1>consulting with people is that if they </v>

1248
01:02:13.341 --> 01:02:14.174
<v Speaker 1>have someone who is a problem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been a problem for say a </v>

1249
01:02:16.101 --> 01:02:16.934
<v Speaker 1>substantial amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's happier when that person </v>

1250
01:02:19.471 --> 01:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often the person themself.</v>

1251
01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:22.973
<v Speaker 1>Not always obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes people are miserable and </v>

1252
01:02:25.831 --> 01:02:26.664
<v Speaker 1>hard to get along with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An unproductive because they hate their </v>

1253
01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:28.614
<v Speaker 1>bloody job and someone should just kick </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out of it so they can go on and </v>

1254
01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>find something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1255
01:02:32.131 --> 01:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>that they might be half decent tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1256
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>And people tend to be quite resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if they do end up out of a job,</v>

1257
01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>it isn't exactly clear that six months </v>
<v Speaker 1>later that's worse for them.</v>

1258
01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

1259
01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:50.124
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think disagreeable people are better </v>

1260
01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there's a rule,</v>

1261
01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>a disagreeable person will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you buy,</v>

1262
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>abide by the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about your damn feelings.</v>

1263
01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's Kinda harsh.</v>

1264
01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.353
<v Speaker 1>Maybe</v>

1265
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:04.070
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big predictor.</v>

1266
01:03:04.071 --> 01:03:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Openness that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

1267
01:03:06.021 --> 01:03:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's some combinations.</v>

1268
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:12.650
<v Speaker 1>If you're disagreeable and neurotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to have a personality disorder.</v>

1269
01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:16.100
<v Speaker 1>So those are the two big personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>markers of personality disorders.</v>

1270
01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.730
<v Speaker 1>If you're extroverted and disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that.</v>

1271
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:21.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like this,</v>

1272
01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.540
<v Speaker 1>they're really social in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1273
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:24.523
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1274
01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.140
<v Speaker 1>they're not that empathic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're selfish,</v>

1275
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:29.930
<v Speaker 1>they're narcissists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're extroverted and disagreeable,</v>

1276
01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.470
<v Speaker 1>you have a proclivity towards narcissism</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>

1277
01:03:33.471 --> 01:03:35.930
<v Speaker 1>well that's an awful thing and maybe it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1278
01:03:35.931 --> 01:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>actors,</v>

1279
01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how narcissistic do you have to be to be</v>

1280
01:03:43.591 --> 01:03:45.050
<v Speaker 1>an actor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1281
01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1282
01:03:46.171 --> 01:03:47.004
<v Speaker 1>Because you obviously have to have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>self confidence that goes beyond the </v>

1283
01:03:49.681 --> 01:03:50.850
<v Speaker 1>norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1284
01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.133
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

1285
01:03:56.090 --> 01:03:56.923
<v Speaker 1>this is a summary of what we knew about </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and motivation in relationship </v>

1286
01:04:00.171 --> 01:04:01.004
<v Speaker 1>to the abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we know that extroversion is </v>

1287
01:04:03.051 --> 01:04:05.510
<v Speaker 1>associated with incentive reward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope,</v>

1288
01:04:05.511 --> 01:04:07.520
<v Speaker 1>curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play enthusiasm.</v>

1289
01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:08.623
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dopaminergic function and with the part </v>

1290
01:04:10.791 --> 01:04:13.160
<v Speaker 1>of the hypothalamus that governance </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory behavior.</v>

1291
01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:14.413
<v Speaker 1>So it's an approach circuit and so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems that people who are extroverted </v>

1292
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:22.280
<v Speaker 1>have a lower threshold for having that </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuit activated.</v>

1293
01:04:22.281 --> 01:04:23.114
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's something like that or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe they're there unless they're </v>

1294
01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.540
<v Speaker 1>stimulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have enough positive emotion.</v>

1295
01:04:29.541 --> 01:04:30.374
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extroverts harvest attention from the </v>

1296
01:04:33.891 --> 01:04:34.724
<v Speaker 1>social group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think about these as ways of </v>

1297
01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.633
<v Speaker 1>adapting to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the social group is full of </v>

1298
01:04:39.441 --> 01:04:43.280
<v Speaker 1>resources and if you're assertive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're popular,</v>

1299
01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:46.490
<v Speaker 1>than you can benefit from the accrual of</v>
<v Speaker 1>social resources.</v>

1300
01:04:46.491 --> 01:04:47.810
<v Speaker 1>That puts you up the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

1301
01:04:47.811 --> 01:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's a good strategy for moving.</v>

1302
01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:52.640
<v Speaker 1>It's one good strategy for moving ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1303
01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.040
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

1304
01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:56.300
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>

1305
01:04:56.301 --> 01:04:57.410
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

1306
01:04:57.830 --> 01:04:58.663
<v Speaker 1>Those two seem to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gaba circuits because those are the </v>

1307
01:05:01.101 --> 01:05:04.820
<v Speaker 1>circuits that value and barbiturates and</v>
<v Speaker 1>benzodiazepines effect.</v>

1308
01:05:04.821 --> 01:05:05.654
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the case that as you move </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the dominance hierarchy and your </v>

1309
01:05:08.301 --> 01:05:09.134
<v Speaker 1>serotonin levels rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your negative emotion gets more </v>

1310
01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:12.613
<v Speaker 1>well-regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you fall down on the </v>

1311
01:05:13.851 --> 01:05:14.684
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your negative emotions get less </v>

1312
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:17.973
<v Speaker 1>regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably your positive emotions too </v>

1313
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This empathy,</v>

1314
01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:22.834
<v Speaker 1>sympathy compliance care system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the care system that Jaak </v>

1315
01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Panksepp described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're interested in that,</v>

1316
01:05:28.151 --> 01:05:28.984
<v Speaker 1>you could read a bit more about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's maternal circuitry essentially </v>

1317
01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>now runs on oxytocin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So agreeable people can always tell when</v>

1318
01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:36.874
<v Speaker 1>I have an agreeable person in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice because what happens </v>

1319
01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:40.594
<v Speaker 1>when they come in is that they instantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to talk about relationships and </v>

1320
01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>also their layout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their biography,</v>

1321
01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:47.440
<v Speaker 1>and like a conscientious person.</v>

1322
01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.273
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about the things they have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and the things they've done over </v>

1323
01:05:50.861 --> 01:05:52.540
<v Speaker 1>their life and an open person will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1324
01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>here's the things I'm really interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1325
01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an agreeable personal say,</v>

1326
01:05:56.351 --> 01:05:58.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from 19 seven,</v>

1327
01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.233
<v Speaker 1>1982 to 1987,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went out with this person and then I </v>

1328
01:06:02.891 --> 01:06:03.724
<v Speaker 1>had a relationship with this person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they naturally seem to configure </v>

1329
01:06:06.611 --> 01:06:10.630
<v Speaker 1>their biographies in terms of dyadic </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationships.</v>

1330
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.950
<v Speaker 1>So whereas the disagreeable people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1331
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>well they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1332
01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:18.100
<v Speaker 1>they're not so good at that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1333
01:06:18.101 --> 01:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>And if you talk to engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1334
01:06:20.211 --> 01:06:21.880
<v Speaker 1>and I've talked a lot about silicon </v>
<v Speaker 1>valley,</v>

1335
01:06:21.881 --> 01:06:22.714
<v Speaker 1>it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty oriented towards things </v>

1336
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:28.270
<v Speaker 1>and their interpersonal skills can be</v>

1337
01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:34.070
<v Speaker 1>well interesting to say the least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1338
01:06:34.071 --> 01:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>they invent lots of interesting things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like Hooray,</v>

1339
01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go engineers.</v>

1340
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:39.583
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about conscientiousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be associated with disgust </v>

1341
01:06:42.411 --> 01:06:43.244
<v Speaker 1>and guilt and shame and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it as an adaptive </v>

1342
01:06:47.151 --> 01:06:47.984
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness means stay on contaminated </v>

1343
01:06:51.411 --> 01:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>and sparkly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean.</v>

1344
01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:55.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an efficiency strategy.</v>

1345
01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Everything in its place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that way you don't have to expend</v>

1346
01:06:58.281 --> 01:07:02.240
<v Speaker 1>as much energy to get the results of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your labor.</v>

1347
01:07:02.241 --> 01:07:03.074
<v Speaker 1>You know what it's like if you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work in your office and it's a </v>

1348
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:07.130
<v Speaker 1>complete bloody disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1349
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:08.203
<v Speaker 1>You expand the whole bunch of energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>just coping with the fact that you're </v>

1350
01:07:10.611 --> 01:07:11.444
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by chaos before you even get </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to what it is that you're supposed </v>

1351
01:07:14.541 --> 01:07:17.360
<v Speaker 1>to work at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Industriousness,</v>

1352
01:07:17.361 --> 01:07:18.194
<v Speaker 1>while industrious people seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>implement their goals and maybe they </v>

1353
01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.190
<v Speaker 1>have some social utility to I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspect,</v>

1354
01:07:25.191 --> 01:07:26.024
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're an industrious person </v>

1355
01:07:26.991 --> 01:07:27.824
<v Speaker 1>and you get a reputation for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people are gonna want you around </v>

1356
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:31.543
<v Speaker 1>because like you'll do the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one thing I will tell you that that </v>

1357
01:07:34.041 --> 01:07:34.874
<v Speaker 1>might also be useful as you progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>through life is that if you get into an </v>

1358
01:07:38.151 --> 01:07:38.984
<v Speaker 1>organization and you are diligent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know and you really commit to what </v>

1359
01:07:43.971 --> 01:07:46.130
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think</v>

1360
01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>you might be cynical about whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not that's going to be noticed.</v>

1361
01:07:50.271 --> 01:07:52.850
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not conscientious,</v>

1362
01:07:52.851 --> 01:07:55.250
<v Speaker 1>you'll never figure out why you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>advance.</v>

1363
01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.633
<v Speaker 1>What'll happen is that a bunch of doors </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could open to you just won't </v>

1364
01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:05.840
<v Speaker 1>because if you're a conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like I find this with my students.</v>

1365
01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.713
<v Speaker 1>Some of them I can say because I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>more opportunities than I know what to </v>

1366
01:08:09.171 --> 01:08:11.600
<v Speaker 1>do with usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if I have students I can say,</v>

1367
01:08:11.601 --> 01:08:12.081
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1368
01:08:12.081 --> 01:08:12.914
<v Speaker 1>here you could do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if they come back three weeks </v>

1369
01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:16.401
<v Speaker 1>later and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1370
01:08:16.401 --> 01:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>here's four reasons why I couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1371
01:08:18.171 --> 01:08:19.880
<v Speaker 1>and they're all good reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1372
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.983
<v Speaker 1>but it's not done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then someone else comes back and </v>

1373
01:08:22.851 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>it's four weeks later and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>

1374
01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Then the next time I have an opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to end the person who did it gets it.</v>

1375
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:32.930
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that in almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>all organizations,</v>

1376
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:34.423
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain percentage of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are conscientious and intelligent </v>

1377
01:08:38.361 --> 01:08:39.194
<v Speaker 1>and are doing almost all the work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always looking around for other </v>

1378
01:08:42.801 --> 01:08:43.850
<v Speaker 1>people who are like that.</v>

1379
01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't go out of their way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertise it.</v>

1380
01:08:45.951 --> 01:08:46.784
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're like that and you come to </v>

1381
01:08:48.561 --> 01:08:50.270
<v Speaker 1>their attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll open doors for you.</v>

1382
01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:51.104
<v Speaker 1>And you won't even know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it'll be like your progress </v>

1383
01:08:53.481 --> 01:08:56.780
<v Speaker 1>upwards and there's no reason that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave a necessarily knowing why.</v>

1384
01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:57.643
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're not doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people won't come out and whack you on </v>

1385
01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:00.651
<v Speaker 1>the head and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1386
01:09:00.651 --> 01:09:02.920
<v Speaker 1>you should improve in these six ways and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1387
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:03.763
<v Speaker 1>pay a lot of attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just won't allow you to have any </v>

1388
01:09:06.981 --> 01:09:09.230
<v Speaker 1>opportunities and then you won't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it.</v>

1389
01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:12.670
<v Speaker 1>So that's not good unless you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1390
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:13.543
<v Speaker 1>unless you're not that ambitious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you know is not necessarily a bad </v>

1391
01:09:17.601 --> 01:09:21.770
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Open people will open.</v>

1392
01:09:21.771 --> 01:09:23.560
<v Speaker 1>People are good at manipulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractions.</v>

1393
01:09:23.561 --> 01:09:24.394
<v Speaker 1>And so what they seem to do is to model </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world abstractly and to figure out </v>

1394
01:09:27.531 --> 01:09:28.820
<v Speaker 1>what strategies will work.</v>

1395
01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:30.103
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe they can implement them </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're conscientious and if they </v>

1396
01:09:32.481 --> 01:09:35.720
<v Speaker 1>can't implement them well maybe they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>offer them to other people you know.</v>

1397
01:09:35.721 --> 01:09:38.240
<v Speaker 1>So you have good ideas that has some </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

1398
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.313
<v Speaker 1>And so I was thinking that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't exactly know how to integrate </v>

1399
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:46.580
<v Speaker 1>the trait theory into the narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>

1400
01:09:46.581 --> 01:09:47.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1401
01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:48.613
<v Speaker 1>because almost all of the clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories of psychology are narrative </v>

1402
01:09:51.801 --> 01:09:52.634
<v Speaker 1>theories and they all seem to have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this kind of story that you act </v>

1403
01:09:55.881 --> 01:09:56.714
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've been thinking that maybe this </v>

1404
01:09:57.741 --> 01:10:00.560
<v Speaker 1>is one of the ways that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it anyway,</v>

1405
01:10:00.561 --> 01:10:04.580
<v Speaker 1>so the little frames of reference that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you find yourself in that,</v>

1406
01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.713
<v Speaker 1>that govern your perceptions and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>help you determine your actions are </v>

1407
01:10:10.371 --> 01:10:15.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe motivated by constellations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental motivational systems.</v>

1408
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:16.350
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1409
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:17.203
<v Speaker 1>we talked a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic function and the really </v>

1410
01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:21.680
<v Speaker 1>basic motivational and emotional states.</v>

1411
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:22.933
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like they sort of clumped </v>

1412
01:10:24.251 --> 01:10:25.084
<v Speaker 1>together in the traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know extroversion is where the </v>

1413
01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:28.994
<v Speaker 1>positive emotions clump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A negative neuroticism is where the </v>

1414
01:10:31.071 --> 01:10:34.280
<v Speaker 1>negative emotions clump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play seems to go along with extroversion</v>

1415
01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.353
<v Speaker 1>and then abstract creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration seems to go along with </v>

1416
01:10:38.211 --> 01:10:39.044
<v Speaker 1>openness and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's these like maybe the </v>

1417
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:47.560
<v Speaker 1>traits or something like amalgam stable </v>
<v Speaker 1>amalgams of emotions and motivation,</v>

1418
01:10:47.641 --> 01:10:50.080
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're,</v>

1419
01:10:50.290 --> 01:10:54.470
<v Speaker 1>those stable amalgams produce the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frameworks within which you operate.</v>

1420
01:10:54.471 --> 01:10:55.880
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1421
01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:01.700
<v Speaker 1>if you're extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're goal is going to be,</v>

1422
01:11:01.701 --> 01:11:02.534
<v Speaker 1>well there's a group I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrate myself into it and I'm going </v>

1423
01:11:07.011 --> 01:11:12.011
<v Speaker 1>to make my presence known and enjoyable </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we know for example,</v>

1424
01:11:12.741 --> 01:11:13.574
<v Speaker 1>that like parties and so that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptive strategy because they have the </v>

1425
01:11:17.381 --> 01:11:18.214
<v Speaker 1>social hierarchy out there and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a place where rewards can be </v>

1426
01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:22.644
<v Speaker 1>obtained and so are fundamental tilt is </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards exploitation of the social </v>

1427
01:11:26.011 --> 01:11:26.520
<v Speaker 1>surround.</v>

1428
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.830
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a bit of a trade because </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroverts,</v>

1429
01:11:28.831 --> 01:11:29.664
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it can be very amusing to be with </v>

1430
01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:32.213
<v Speaker 1>and they're always trying to entertain </v>
<v Speaker 1>people so it's not like it's a one way </v>

1431
01:11:34.351 --> 01:11:36.370
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you know,</v>

1432
01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.253
<v Speaker 1>someone who's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more conscientious is going to be well </v>

1433
01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:40.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this place is in bad order and it needs </v>

1434
01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:45.310
<v Speaker 1>to be repaired and we should do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to straighten that up.</v>

1435
01:11:45.311 --> 01:11:49.800
<v Speaker 1>And so that's like a generalized rubric </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're using to apply to the world</v>

1436
01:11:49.801 --> 01:11:51.630
<v Speaker 1>in every different situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's.</v>

1437
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:55.440
<v Speaker 1>So it sort of like base level </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations and emotions.</v>

1438
01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:56.573
<v Speaker 1>The first order aggregation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gives you maybe the five </v>

1439
01:11:58.261 --> 01:12:01.590
<v Speaker 1>dimensions and then those actor as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying,</v>

1440
01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:04.463
<v Speaker 1>what the underlying primarily biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that tilt your perceptions in </v>

1441
01:12:08.641 --> 01:12:11.280
<v Speaker 1>your actions toward certain niches in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment.</v>

1442
01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.250
<v Speaker 1>So the agreeable person is going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>for relationships.</v>

1443
01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:15.443
<v Speaker 1>The disagreeable person is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish somewhat or self oriented </v>

1444
01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:19.650
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and competitive.</v>

1445
01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:21.990
<v Speaker 1>These are all ways that you can go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the world.</v>

1446
01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:22.973
<v Speaker 1>If you're high in negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be quite concerned </v>

1447
01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:28.560
<v Speaker 1>with making sure that things are secure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and safe.</v>

1448
01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:30.810
<v Speaker 1>You can see that those are all valid.</v>

1449
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:33.163
<v Speaker 1>A priory theories about how you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapt to the different niches that the </v>

1450
01:12:36.081 --> 01:12:39.890
<v Speaker 1>world provides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1451
01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:44.500
<v Speaker 1>so then I would say that it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1452
01:12:44.501 --> 01:12:45.334
<v Speaker 1>These hierarchies of values are built up</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the fundamental trait </v>

1453
01:12:50.341 --> 01:12:53.130
<v Speaker 1>orientations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

1454
01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:54.421
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1455
01:12:54.421 --> 01:12:56.640
<v Speaker 1>for an extrovert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something down here might be,</v>

1456
01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.980
<v Speaker 1>tell a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1457
01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.020
<v Speaker 1>plan a party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1458
01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.010
<v Speaker 1>go to a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1459
01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.090
<v Speaker 1>those are all made up of obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>implementable,</v>

1460
01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:08.610
<v Speaker 1>implementable behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're fairly,</v>

1461
01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:11.640
<v Speaker 1>they're fractured and elements of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes extroversion.</v>

1462
01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.550
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1463
01:13:15.551 --> 01:13:20.551
<v Speaker 1>that's probably pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1464
01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:22.403
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll stop there and then I'll see </v>

1465
01:13:24.931 --> 01:13:29.931
<v Speaker 1>you on Thursday and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys know the final is cumulative,</v>

1466
01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I presume so it'll only be covering the </v>
<v Speaker 1>material that was from the last test and</v>

1467
01:13:35.761 --> 01:13:37.650
<v Speaker 1>it'll be the same format as the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests.</v>

1468
01:13:37.651 --> 01:13:39.930
<v Speaker 1>So you're familiar with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's coming.</v>

1469
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you on Thursday.</v>
