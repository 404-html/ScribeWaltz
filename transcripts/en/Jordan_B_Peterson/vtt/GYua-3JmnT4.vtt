1
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.793
<v Speaker 1>I've thought a long time about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivates behavior like that manifested </v>

2
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>at Columbine and at Sandy Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>

3
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>most recently at Parkland and because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Parkland event,</v>

4
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I thought that I would read a chapter </v>
<v Speaker 1>from my book to everyone.</v>

5
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.713
<v Speaker 1>It's chapter six rules six set your </v>
<v Speaker 1>house in perfect order before you </v>

6
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:35.814
<v Speaker 1>criticize the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's an extended meditation on the </v>

7
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>kind of motivations that drive the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who wished to slaughter innocence</v>

8
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:43.524
<v Speaker 1>as a form of revenge against God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to read it to you and you </v>

9
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>can let me know what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rule six,</v>

10
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>set your house in perfect order before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you criticize the world.</v>

11
00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.663
<v Speaker 1>A religious problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does not seem reasonable to describe </v>

12
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:05.834
<v Speaker 1>the young man who shot 20 children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>six staff members at Sandy Hook </v>

13
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.893
<v Speaker 1>Elementary School in Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut in 2012 as a religious </v>

14
00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:16.274
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is equally true for the Colorado </v>

15
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:23.630
<v Speaker 1>theater gunman and the columbine high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school shooters,</v>

16
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.113
<v Speaker 1>but these murderous individuals how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with reality that existed at a </v>

17
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:31.454
<v Speaker 1>religious depth</v>
<v Speaker 1>as one of the members of the columbine </v>

18
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:36.684
<v Speaker 1>dual wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human race isn't worth fighting for </v>

19
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>only worth killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give the earth back to the animals.</v>

20
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>They deserve it infinitely more than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

21
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.583
<v Speaker 1>Nothing means anything anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who think such things view being </v>

22
00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:57.474
<v Speaker 1>itself as inequitable and harsh to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of corruption and human being in </v>

23
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:03.504
<v Speaker 1>particular as contemptible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They appoint themselves supreme </v>

24
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>adjudicators of reality and find it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting.</v>

25
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 1>They are the ultimate critics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The deeply cynical writer continues.</v>

26
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.893
<v Speaker 1>If you recall your history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis came up with a final solution </v>

27
00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 1>to the Jewish problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill the mall.</v>

28
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in case you haven't figured it out,</v>

29
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I say kill mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one should survive.</v>

30
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.900
<v Speaker 1>For such individuals the world have </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced is insufficient and evil,</v>

31
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.540
<v Speaker 1>so to hell with everything,</v>

32
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>what is happening when someone comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think in this manner.</v>

33
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>A great German play Faust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tragedy written by Johann,</v>

34
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>both gang from Gerta addresses that </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

35
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.803
<v Speaker 1>The play's main character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A scholar named Heinrich Faust trades </v>

36
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:13.381
<v Speaker 1>his immortal soul to the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles in return,</v>

37
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.200
<v Speaker 1>he receives whatever he desires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll still alive on earth in girth.</v>

38
00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:24.371
<v Speaker 1>This play Mephistopheles is the eternal </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversary of being.</v>

39
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.990
<v Speaker 1>He has a central defining credo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the spirit who negates,</v>

40
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.903
<v Speaker 1>and rightly so for all that comes to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserves to parish wretchedly it were </v>

41
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing would begin.</v>

42
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Thus everything that your term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sin,</v>

43
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>

44
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>represent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is my proper element.</v>

45
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Girtha considered this hateful </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentiment.</v>

46
00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:56.424
<v Speaker 1>So important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so key to the central element of </v>

47
00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:00.264
<v Speaker 1>vengeful human destructiveness that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had mephistopheles say it a second time </v>

48
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.980
<v Speaker 1>phrased somewhat differently in part two</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the play written many years later.</v>

49
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.970
<v Speaker 1>People often think in the meth festo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>

50
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.223
<v Speaker 1>although they sell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act upon their thoughts as brutally as </v>

51
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:22.380
<v Speaker 1>the mass murderers of school college in </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater,</v>

52
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.410
<v Speaker 1>whenever we experience injustice real or</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined,</v>

53
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.570
<v Speaker 1>whenever we encounter tragedy or fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>prey to the machinations of others,</v>

54
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.560
<v Speaker 1>whenever we experienced the horror and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain of our own,</v>

55
00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:37.394
<v Speaker 1>apparently arbitrary limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temptation to question being and </v>

56
00:04:41.811 --> 00:04:45.350
<v Speaker 1>then to curse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it rises folly from the darkness.</v>

57
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Why must innocent people suffer so </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly?</v>

58
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>What kind of bloody horrible planet is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

59
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is in truth,</v>

60
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.450
<v Speaker 1>very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is destined for pain and slated</v>

61
00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:03.284
<v Speaker 1>for destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes suffering is clearly the </v>

62
00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:10.430
<v Speaker 1>result of personal fault such as willful</v>
<v Speaker 1>blindness,</v>

63
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.130
<v Speaker 1>poor decision making or malevolence.</v>

64
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

65
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.720
<v Speaker 1>In such cases when it appears to be self</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflicted,</v>

66
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.190
<v Speaker 1>it may even seem just people get what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they deserve.</v>

67
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.120
<v Speaker 1>You might contend that's cold comfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

68
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.073
<v Speaker 1>even when true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if those who are suffering </v>

69
00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:31.784
<v Speaker 1>changed their behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then their lives would unfold less </v>

70
00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:35.054
<v Speaker 1>tragically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but human control is limited </v>

71
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.750
<v Speaker 1>susceptibility to despair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>

72
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.550
<v Speaker 1>aging and death is universal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the final analysis,</v>

73
00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:49.610
<v Speaker 1>we do not appear to be the architects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own fragility.</v>

74
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Whose fault is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>

75
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.193
<v Speaker 1>People who are very ill or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have a sick child will inevitably </v>

76
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:00.854
<v Speaker 1>find themselves asking this question </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they are religious believers or </v>

77
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:04.874
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

78
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

79
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.703
<v Speaker 1>The same is true of someone who finds </v>
<v Speaker 1>his shirt sleeve caught in the gears of </v>

80
00:06:10.801 --> 00:06:11.634
<v Speaker 1>a giant bureaucracy who is suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a tax audit or fighting an </v>

81
00:06:15.511 --> 00:06:17.790
<v Speaker 1>interminable lawsuit or divorce.</v>

82
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

83
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.543
<v Speaker 1>and it's not only the obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering who are tormented by the need </v>

84
00:06:23.371 --> 00:06:27.750
<v Speaker 1>to blame someone or something for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerable state of their being</v>

85
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.620
<v Speaker 1>at the height of his fame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence and creative power.</v>

86
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.603
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the towering Leo tolstoy himself began </v>

87
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>to question the value of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

88
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.360
<v Speaker 1>He reasoned in this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My position was terrible.</v>

89
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.753
<v Speaker 1>I knew that I could find nothing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of rational knowledge except the </v>

90
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 1>denial of life and in faith I could find</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing excepted.</v>

91
00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Denial of reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was even more impossible than a</v>

92
00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:05.131
<v Speaker 1>denial of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to rational knowledge,</v>

93
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 1>it followed that life is evil and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it.</v>

94
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.130
<v Speaker 1>They do not have to live yet they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived and they do live.</v>

95
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.323
<v Speaker 1>Just as I myself had lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I had known for a long time </v>

96
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.350
<v Speaker 1>that life is meaningless and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try as he might,</v>

97
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>tall story could only identify for means</v>
<v Speaker 1>of escaping from such thoughts.</v>

98
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.790
<v Speaker 1>One was retreating into childlike </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance of the problem.</v>

99
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

100
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.423
<v Speaker 1>Another was pursuing mindless pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third was continuing to drag out a </v>

101
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 1>life that is evil and meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing beforehand that nothing can come</v>

102
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:49.754
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

103
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

104
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 1>He identified that particular form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>escape with weakness.</v>

105
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Speaker 1>The people in this category know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>death is better than life,</v>

106
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.133
<v Speaker 1>but they do not have the strength to act</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationally and quickly put it into the </v>

107
00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:07.990
<v Speaker 1>delusion by killing themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>only.</v>

108
00:08:07.991 --> 00:08:12.100
<v Speaker 1>The fourth and final motive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>escape involved strength and energy.</v>

109
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.113
<v Speaker 1>It consists of destroying life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once one has realized that life is evil </v>

110
00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:17.734
<v Speaker 1>and meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolstoy relentlessly followed his </v>

111
00:08:21.781 --> 00:08:22.614
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only unusually strong in logically </v>

112
00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:29.271
<v Speaker 1>consistent people act in this manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having realized all the stupidity of the</v>

113
00:08:29.281 --> 00:08:30.114
<v Speaker 1>joke that is being played on us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing that the blessings of the dead </v>

114
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.960
<v Speaker 1>are greater than those of the living and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is better not to exist.</v>

115
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:42.080
<v Speaker 1>They act and put an end to this stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke and they use any means of doing it.</v>

116
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.910
<v Speaker 1>A rope around the neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

117
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.880
<v Speaker 1>a knife in the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a train.</v>

118
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.133
<v Speaker 1>Tolstoy wasn't pessimistic enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stupidity of the joke being played </v>

119
00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.140
<v Speaker 1>on us does not merely motivate suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It motivates murder.</v>

120
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Mass murder often followed by suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a far more effective existential</v>

121
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:13.581
<v Speaker 1>protest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By June of 2016 unbelievable.</v>

122
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:14.904
<v Speaker 1>As it may seem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there had been 1000 mass killings </v>

123
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.760
<v Speaker 1>defined as four or more people shot in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single incident excluding the shooter in</v>

124
00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:24.444
<v Speaker 1>the u s in 1,260 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one such event on five of every </v>

125
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 1>six days for more than three years.</v>

126
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Everyone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand.</v>

127
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.420
<v Speaker 1>How can we still pretend that tolstoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understood more than a century ago,</v>

128
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.373
<v Speaker 1>the ancient authors of the Biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of Cain and Abel understood as </v>

129
00:09:50.771 --> 00:09:53.110
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than 20 centuries ago,</v>

130
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.303
<v Speaker 1>they described murder as the first act </v>
<v Speaker 1>of post edenic history and not just </v>

131
00:09:59.591 --> 00:10:02.590
<v Speaker 1>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fratricidal murder,</v>

132
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.710
<v Speaker 1>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only of someone innocent,</v>

133
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.460
<v Speaker 1>but if someone ideal and good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered,</v>

134
00:10:09.461 --> 00:10:13.660
<v Speaker 1>done consciously to spite the creator of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>

135
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

136
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Today's killers tell us the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their own words.</v>

137
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Who would dare say that this is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worm at the core of the apple.</v>

138
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

139
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.860
<v Speaker 1>but we will not listen because the truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>cuts too close to the bone.</v>

140
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Even for a mind as profound as that of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the celebrated Russian author,</v>

141
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.940
<v Speaker 1>there was no way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can the rest of us manage?</v>

142
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:48.510
<v Speaker 1>When a man of tolstoy's stature admits </v>
<v Speaker 1>defeat for years,</v>

143
00:10:48.551 --> 00:10:49.384
<v Speaker 1>he hit his guns from himself and would </v>
<v Speaker 1>not walk with a rope in hand and Casey </v>

144
00:10:54.131 --> 00:10:54.964
<v Speaker 1>hanged himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can a person who is awake avoid </v>

145
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:05.150
<v Speaker 1>outrage at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vengeance or transformation?</v>

146
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.153
<v Speaker 1>A religious man might shake his fist in </v>
<v Speaker 1>desperation at the apparent injustice </v>

147
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.433
<v Speaker 1>and blindness of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even Christ himself felt abandoned </v>

148
00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:23.971
<v Speaker 1>before the cross or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story goes more agnostic or atheist.</v>

149
00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:25.384
<v Speaker 1>Stick individual might blame fate or </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditate bitterly on the brutality of </v>

150
00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:31.750
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another might tear himself apart,</v>

151
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.823
<v Speaker 1>searching for the character flaws </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying his suffering and </v>

152
00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:40.891
<v Speaker 1>deterioration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all variations on a theme.</v>

153
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.913
<v Speaker 1>The name of the target changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the underlying psychology remains </v>

154
00:11:45.801 --> 00:11:47.960
<v Speaker 1>constant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

155
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Why is there so much suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruelty?</v>

156
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.383
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it really is God's doing or the </v>

157
00:11:58.271 --> 00:11:59.104
<v Speaker 1>fault of blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointless fate if you're inclined to </v>

158
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:06.370
<v Speaker 1>think that way and there appears to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>every reason to think that way.</v>

159
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.553
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

160
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.813
<v Speaker 1>but what happens if you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass murderers believe that the </v>

161
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:15.334
<v Speaker 1>suffering attendant upon existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>justifies judgment and revenge as the </v>

162
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:21.394
<v Speaker 1>columbine boys so clearly indicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will sooner die than betray my own </v>

163
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before I leave this worthless place,</v>

164
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I will kill whoever I deemed unfit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything specially life.</v>

165
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 1>If you pissed me off in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will die.</v>

166
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 1>If I see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to piss off others and</v>

167
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 1>have it eventually all blow over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not me.</v>

168
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.663
<v Speaker 1>I don't forget people who wrong me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most vengeful murderers of </v>

169
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:57.490
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible Carl Pans.</v>

170
00:12:57.491 --> 00:13:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Ram was raped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutalized,</v>

171
00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:00.844
<v Speaker 1>and betrayed in the Minnesota </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution responsible for his </v>

172
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.320
<v Speaker 1>rehabilitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was a delinquent juvenile,</v>

173
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.110
<v Speaker 1>he emerged enraged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond measure as a burglar,</v>

174
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.230
<v Speaker 1>arsonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapists and serial killer.</v>

175
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.130
<v Speaker 1>He aimed consciously and consistently at</v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction,</v>

176
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.360
<v Speaker 1>even keeping track of the dollar value </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the property he burned.</v>

177
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.230
<v Speaker 1>He started by hating the individuals who</v>
<v Speaker 1>had heard him.</v>

178
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.280
<v Speaker 1>His resentment grew until his hatred </v>
<v Speaker 1>encompassed all of mankind and he didn't</v>

179
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:36.694
<v Speaker 1>stop there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His destructiveness was aimed in some </v>

180
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:45.220
<v Speaker 1>fundamental manner at God himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way of phrasing it.</v>

181
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Pans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rem raped,</v>

182
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.793
<v Speaker 1>murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and burned to express his outrage at </v>

183
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:56.131
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He acted as if someone was responsible.</v>

184
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.890
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happens in the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel.</v>

185
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Cain sacrifices are rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He exists in suffering.</v>

186
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.300
<v Speaker 1>He calls out God and challenges the </v>
<v Speaker 1>being he created.</v>

187
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.453
<v Speaker 1>God refuses his plea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tells Kane that is trouble is self </v>

188
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:17.284
<v Speaker 1>induced cane in his rage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills Abel God's favorite and truth be </v>

189
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:29.161
<v Speaker 1>known canes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idle Cain is jealous of course,</v>

190
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.393
<v Speaker 1>of a successful brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he destroys able primarily to spite </v>

191
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.163
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the truest version of what </v>

192
00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:41.980
<v Speaker 1>happens when people take their vengeance</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the ultimate extreme,</v>

193
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:44.720
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

194
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Pans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rams response was,</v>

195
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.140
<v Speaker 1>and this is what is so terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly understandable.</v>

196
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.153
<v Speaker 1>The details of his autobiography reveal </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was one of tolstoy's strong and </v>

197
00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:59.210
<v Speaker 1>logically consistent people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a powerful,</v>

198
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.580
<v Speaker 1>consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fearless actor.</v>

199
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.010
<v Speaker 1>He had the courage of his convictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how good someone like him be expected to</v>

200
00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:09.770
<v Speaker 1>forgive and forget given what had </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to him.</v>

201
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.613
<v Speaker 1>Truly terrible things happen to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no wonder they're out for revenge </v>

202
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.860
<v Speaker 1>under such conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vengeance seems a moral necessity.</v>

203
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.450
<v Speaker 1>How can it be distinguished from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>demand for justice after all,</v>

204
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.260
<v Speaker 1>after the experience of terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>atrocity?</v>

205
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Isn't forgiveness just cowardice or lack</v>
<v Speaker 1>of willpower?</v>

206
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Such questions torment me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people emerge from terrible pasts to</v>

207
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 1>do good and not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although such an accomplishment can seem</v>

208
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.540
<v Speaker 1>superhuman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have met people who managed to do it.</v>

209
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.410
<v Speaker 1>I knew a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great artists who emerged from just such</v>

210
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:57.500
<v Speaker 1>a school as the one described by pans </v>
<v Speaker 1>around only.</v>

211
00:15:57.501 --> 00:16:00.360
<v Speaker 1>This man was thrown into it as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent five-year-old,</v>

212
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.670
<v Speaker 1>fresh from a long stretch in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital where he had suffered measles,</v>

213
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.620
<v Speaker 1>mumps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chicken pox.</v>

214
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Simultaneously in capable of speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>the language of the school,</v>

215
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.500
<v Speaker 1>deliberately isolated from his family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abused,</v>

216
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.080
<v Speaker 1>starved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and otherwise tormented.</v>

217
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.080
<v Speaker 1>He emerged an angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken young man.</v>

218
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.303
<v Speaker 1>He hurt himself badly in the aftermath </v>
<v Speaker 1>with drugs and alcohol and other forms </v>

219
00:16:25.521 --> 00:16:28.760
<v Speaker 1>of self destructive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He detested everyone,</v>

220
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.540
<v Speaker 1>God himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and blind fate included.</v>

221
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

222
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.690
<v Speaker 1>but he put it into all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stopped drinking.</v>

223
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.950
<v Speaker 1>He stopped hating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's still emerges in flashes.</v>

224
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.023
<v Speaker 1>He revitalized the artistic culture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his native tradition and trained young </v>

225
00:16:47.961 --> 00:16:48.794
<v Speaker 1>men to continue in his footsteps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He produced a 50 foot totem pole </v>

226
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:57.190
<v Speaker 1>memorializing the events of his life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the canoe 40 feet long from a single log</v>

227
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.070
<v Speaker 1>of a kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rarely if ever produced.</v>

228
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:01.933
<v Speaker 1>Now he brought his family together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>held a great potlatch with 16 hours of </v>

229
00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:11.561
<v Speaker 1>dancing and hundreds of people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>attendance to express his grief and make</v>

230
00:17:11.601 --> 00:17:12.434
<v Speaker 1>peace with the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He decided to be a good person and then </v>

231
00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:21.050
<v Speaker 1>he did the impossible things required to</v>
<v Speaker 1>live that way.</v>

232
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I had a client who did not have good </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

233
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.923
<v Speaker 1>Her mother died when she was very young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her grandmother who raised her was a </v>

234
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Harridan bitter and over concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearances.</v>

235
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:40.190
<v Speaker 1>She mistreated her granddaughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishing her for her virtues,</v>

236
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.290
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity,</v>

237
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.213
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unable to resist acting out her </v>

238
00:17:45.381 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 1>resentment for an admittedly hard life </v>
<v Speaker 1>on her granddaughter.</v>

239
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.680
<v Speaker 1>She had a better relationship with her </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

240
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:57.460
<v Speaker 1>but he was an addict who died badly </v>
<v Speaker 1>while she cared for him,</v>

241
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.360
<v Speaker 1>my client had his son.</v>

242
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:03.483
<v Speaker 1>She perpetuated none of this with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He grew up truthful and independent and </v>

243
00:18:08.681 --> 00:18:09.514
<v Speaker 1>hardworking and smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of widening the terror and the </v>

244
00:18:12.281 --> 00:18:15.370
<v Speaker 1>cultural fabric she inherited and </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitting it,</v>

245
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.323
<v Speaker 1>she sewed it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She rejected the sins of her </v>

246
00:18:19.301 --> 00:18:20.290
<v Speaker 1>forefathers.</v>

247
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

248
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Such things can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neat.</v>

249
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:31.810
<v Speaker 1>You wrote these words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distress,</v>

250
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:37.110
<v Speaker 1>whether psychic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical or intellectual need not at all</v>

251
00:18:37.271 --> 00:18:41.530
<v Speaker 1>produced nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the radical rejection of value,</v>

252
00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:42.453
<v Speaker 1>meaning and desirability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such distress always permits a variety </v>

253
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:53.361
<v Speaker 1>of interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Nietzsche meant was this,</v>

254
00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.150
<v Speaker 1>people who experienced evil may </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly desire to perpetuate it,</v>

255
00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.480
<v Speaker 1>to pay it forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is also possible to learn good by</v>

256
00:19:04.821 --> 00:19:09.821
<v Speaker 1>experiencing evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bullied boy can mimic his tormentors,</v>

257
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.173
<v Speaker 1>but it can also learn from his own abuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is wrong to push people around </v>

258
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.793
<v Speaker 1>and make their lives miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone tormented by her mother can </v>

259
00:19:20.651 --> 00:19:25.651
<v Speaker 1>learn from her terrible experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how important it is to be a good parent.</v>

260
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:28.763
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even most of the adults who </v>

261
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:34.410
<v Speaker 1>abused children were abused themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>as children.</v>

262
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:36.763
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of people who were abused </v>

263
00:19:38.301 --> 00:19:41.960
<v Speaker 1>as children do not abuse their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

264
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.013
<v Speaker 1>and this is a well established fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can be demonstrated simply </v>

265
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:47.743
<v Speaker 1>arithmetically in this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If one parent abused three children and </v>

266
00:19:52.221 --> 00:19:55.310
<v Speaker 1>each of those children had three </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and so on,</v>

267
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.700
<v Speaker 1>then there would be three abusers in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first generation,</v>

268
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:03.730
<v Speaker 1>nine the second 27 the third 81 the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth and so on,</v>

269
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:09.460
<v Speaker 1>exponentially after 20 generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 10 billion would have suffered</v>

270
00:20:10.911 --> 00:20:12.200
<v Speaker 1>childhood abuse.</v>

271
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

272
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.770
<v Speaker 1>More people than currently inhabit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

273
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.640
<v Speaker 1>but instead abuse disappears across </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>

274
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:20.683
<v Speaker 1>People constrain its spread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a testament to the genuine </v>

275
00:20:26.321 --> 00:20:29.290
<v Speaker 1>dominance of good over evil in the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>

276
00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:32.403
<v Speaker 1>The desire for vengeance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however justified also bars the way to </v>

277
00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:36.934
<v Speaker 1>other productive thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The American English poet ts Elliot </v>

278
00:20:42.161 --> 00:20:46.030
<v Speaker 1>explained why in his play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cocktail party,</v>

279
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 1>one of his is not having a good time of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

280
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Speaker 1>She speaks of her profound unhappiness </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a psychiatrist.</v>

281
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.830
<v Speaker 1>She says she hopes all her suffering is </v>
<v Speaker 1>her own fault.</v>

282
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.960
<v Speaker 1>The psychiatrist is taken aback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He asks why</v>

283
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.970
<v Speaker 1>she has thought long and hard about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

284
00:21:05.971 --> 00:21:06.804
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and has come to the following </v>

285
00:21:07.591 --> 00:21:10.590
<v Speaker 1>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's her fault,</v>

286
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:15.510
<v Speaker 1>she might be able to do something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it if it's God's fault.</v>

287
00:21:15.511 --> 00:21:19.920
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if reality itself is flawed hell bent on</v>

288
00:21:19.921 --> 00:21:20.754
<v Speaker 1>ensuring her misery and she is doomed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't change the structure of </v>

289
00:21:27.091 --> 00:21:32.040
<v Speaker 1>reality itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she could change her own life.</v>

290
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:35.983
<v Speaker 1>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great Russian documenter of the </v>

291
00:21:41.481 --> 00:21:46.481
<v Speaker 1>abuses of Stalinism had every reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>question the structure of existence when</v>

292
00:21:47.451 --> 00:21:48.284
<v Speaker 1>he was imprisoned in a Soviet labor camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the terrible 20th </v>

293
00:21:52.491 --> 00:21:55.160
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had served as a soldier on the ill,</v>

294
00:21:55.161 --> 00:21:59.600
<v Speaker 1>prepared Russian front lines in the face</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a Nazi invasion.</v>

295
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:01.970
<v Speaker 1>He'd been arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beaten,</v>

296
00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.700
<v Speaker 1>and thrown into prison by his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

297
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Then he was struck by cancer.</v>

298
00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.270
<v Speaker 1>He could have become resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter.</v>

299
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:16.280
<v Speaker 1>His life had been rendered miserable by </v>
<v Speaker 1>both Stalin and Hitler,</v>

300
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:21.110
<v Speaker 1>two of the worst tyrants in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived in brutal conditions,</v>

301
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:26.230
<v Speaker 1>vast stretches of his precious time were</v>
<v Speaker 1>stolen from him and squandered.</v>

302
00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.630
<v Speaker 1>He witnessed the pointless and </v>
<v Speaker 1>degrading,</v>

303
00:22:29.631 --> 00:22:32.810
<v Speaker 1>suffering and death of his friends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquaintances.</v>

304
00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Then he contracted and extremely serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

305
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Soldier Knutsen had cause to curse God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Job himself.</v>

306
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Barely had it as hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the great writer,</v>

307
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.153
<v Speaker 1>the profound spirited defender of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not allow his mind to turn towards </v>

308
00:22:54.411 --> 00:22:58.130
<v Speaker 1>vengeance and destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He opened his eyes instead.</v>

309
00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.353
<v Speaker 1>During his many trials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn encountered people who </v>

310
00:23:01.761 --> 00:23:05.900
<v Speaker 1>comported themselves notably under </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific circumstances.</v>

311
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:11.590
<v Speaker 1>He contemplated their behavior deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he asked himself the most difficult</v>

312
00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:13.124
<v Speaker 1>of questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he personally contributed to the </v>

313
00:23:17.461 --> 00:23:20.790
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If so,</v>

314
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:22.863
<v Speaker 2>how?</v>

315
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.613
<v Speaker 1>He remembered his unquestioning support </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the communist party in his early </v>

316
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.680
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He reconsidered his whole life.</v>

317
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.143
<v Speaker 1>He had plenty of time in the camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would he missed the mark in the </v>

318
00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:38.874
<v Speaker 1>past?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times had he acted against his </v>

319
00:23:41.191 --> 00:23:42.024
<v Speaker 1>own conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging in actions that he knew to be </v>

320
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:45.643
<v Speaker 1>wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many times had he betrayed himself </v>

321
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:49.303
<v Speaker 1>and lied?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there any way that the sins of his </v>

322
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:53.264
<v Speaker 1>past could be rectified?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atone for in the muddy hell of a Soviet </v>

323
00:23:57.921 --> 00:23:58.754
<v Speaker 1>ghoulag</v>

324
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.813
<v Speaker 1>soldier knits and poured over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>details of his life with a fine tooth </v>

325
00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:08.460
<v Speaker 1>comb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He asked himself a second question and a</v>

326
00:24:08.461 --> 00:24:12.180
<v Speaker 1>third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I stop making such mistakes now?</v>

327
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Can I repair the damage done by my past </v>
<v Speaker 1>failures?</v>

328
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he learned to watch and to listen.</v>

329
00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:23.730
<v Speaker 1>He found people he admired who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest.</v>

330
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Despite everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took himself apart piece by piece,</v>

331
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:33.290
<v Speaker 1>let what was unnecessary and harmful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>die and resurrected himself.</v>

332
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:34.463
<v Speaker 1>Then he wrote the Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a history of the Soviet prison camp </v>

333
00:24:38.341 --> 00:24:40.710
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a forceful,</v>

334
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.753
<v Speaker 1>terrible book written with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming moral force of unvarnished </v>

335
00:24:45.901 --> 00:24:48.390
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sheer outrage.</v>

336
00:24:48.391 --> 00:24:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Screamed unbearably across hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pages,</v>

337
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:57.470
<v Speaker 1>band and for good reason in the USSR.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was smuggled to the West in the 1970s</v>

338
00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.653
<v Speaker 1>and burst upon the world soldier Nixon's</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing utterly and finally demolished </v>

339
00:25:06.931 --> 00:25:11.931
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual credibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communism as ideology or society.</v>

340
00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.110
<v Speaker 1>He took an ax to the trunk of the tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's bitter.</v>

341
00:25:16.111 --> 00:25:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Fruits had nourished him so poorly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's planting.</v>

342
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:25.070
<v Speaker 1>He had witnessed and supported</v>
<v Speaker 1>one man's decision to change his life.</v>

343
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Instead of cursing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fate shook the whole pathological system</v>

344
00:25:32.191 --> 00:25:37.191
<v Speaker 1>of communist tyranny to its core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It crumbled entirely,</v>

345
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:38.543
<v Speaker 1>not so many years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and soldier Nixon's courage was not the </v>

346
00:25:42.361 --> 00:25:44.130
<v Speaker 1>least of the reasons why</v>

347
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:49.170
<v Speaker 1>he was not the only such person to </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform such a miracle.</v>

348
00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.213
<v Speaker 1>Vaclav Havel the persecuted writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who later impossibly became the </v>

349
00:25:54.601 --> 00:25:55.434
<v Speaker 1>president of Czechoslovakia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then of the new Czech Republic comes to </v>

350
00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:04.491
<v Speaker 1>mind as does Mahatma Gandhi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things fall apart.</v>

351
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:08.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

352
00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.653
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peoples have adamantly refused to judge </v>

353
00:26:12.001 --> 00:26:12.834
<v Speaker 1>reality to criticize being to blame God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to consider the Old </v>

354
00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:20.723
<v Speaker 1>Testament Hebrews in this regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their travails followed a consistent </v>

355
00:26:23.191 --> 00:26:26.160
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and</v>

356
00:26:26.161 --> 00:26:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Abel and Noah and the Tower of Babel are</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly ancient.</v>

357
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Their origins vanish into the mysteries </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

358
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.153
<v Speaker 1>It's not until after the flood story in </v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis that something like history as </v>

359
00:26:38.551 --> 00:26:42.480
<v Speaker 1>we understand it truly starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts with Abraham.</v>

360
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Abraham's descendants become the Hebrew </v>
<v Speaker 1>people of the Old Testament,</v>

361
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:52.290
<v Speaker 1>also known as the Hebrew Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They enter a covenant with Yahweh,</v>

362
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:53.933
<v Speaker 1>with God and begin their recognizably </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical adventures under the </v>

363
00:26:58.291 --> 00:26:59.124
<v Speaker 1>leadership of a great man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Hebrews organize themselves into a </v>

364
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:06.450
<v Speaker 1>society and then an empire as their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunes rise.</v>

365
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Success breeds pride and arrogance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corruption raises its ugly head.</v>

366
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:13.523
<v Speaker 1>The increasingly hubristic state becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with power begins to forget </v>

367
00:27:18.481 --> 00:27:22.560
<v Speaker 1>it's duty to the widows and the orphans </v>
<v Speaker 1>and deviates from its age.</v>

368
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Old Agreement with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A prophet arises,</v>

369
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
<v Speaker 1>he brazenly and publicly reviles the </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian king and faithless country</v>

370
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.630
<v Speaker 1>for their failures before God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an act of blind courage,</v>

371
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.940
<v Speaker 1>telling them of the terrible judgment to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come</v>

372
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.860
<v Speaker 1>when his wise words are not completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignored,</v>

373
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.780
<v Speaker 1>they are heated too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God smites is wayward.</v>

374
00:27:48.781 --> 00:27:53.781
<v Speaker 1>People dooming them to abject defeat in </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle and generations of subjugation.</v>

375
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.493
<v Speaker 1>The Hebrews repent at length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blaming their misfortune on their own </v>

376
00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:00.474
<v Speaker 1>failure to adhere to God's word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They insist to themselves that they </v>

377
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:05.514
<v Speaker 1>could have done better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They rebuild their state and the cycle </v>

378
00:28:08.971 --> 00:28:11.820
<v Speaker 1>begins again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is life</v>

379
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.423
<v Speaker 1>we build structures to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We build families and states and </v>

380
00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:18.114
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We abstract the principles upon which </v>

381
00:28:20.701 --> 00:28:24.570
<v Speaker 1>those structures are founded and </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate systems of belief.</v>

382
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:30.380
<v Speaker 1>At first we inhabit those structures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs like Adam and eve in paradise,</v>

383
00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.160
<v Speaker 1>but success makes us complacent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We forget to pay attention.</v>

384
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.360
<v Speaker 1>We take what we have for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We turn a blind eye.</v>

385
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.313
<v Speaker 1>We fail to notice that things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing or that corruption is taking </v>

386
00:28:43.411 --> 00:28:44.244
<v Speaker 1>root and everything falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the fault of reality or God or </v>

387
00:28:51.721 --> 00:28:52.554
<v Speaker 1>to things fall apart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we have not paid sufficient </v>

388
00:28:55.471 --> 00:28:56.304
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the hurricane hit New Orleans and </v>

389
00:28:59.551 --> 00:29:04.230
<v Speaker 1>the town's sank under the waves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that a natural disaster?</v>

390
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:10.670
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch prepare their dykes for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst storm in 10,000 years.</v>

391
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Have New Orleans followed that example?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No tragedy would have occurred.</v>

392
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.083
<v Speaker 1>It's not that no one knew the flood </v>
<v Speaker 1>control act of 1965 mandated </v>

393
00:29:22.621 --> 00:29:27.600
<v Speaker 1>improvements in the levee system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>held back lake pontchartrain.</v>

394
00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:35.250
<v Speaker 1>The system was to be completed by 1978 </v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years later,</v>

395
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.333
<v Speaker 1>only 60% of the work had been done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Willful blindness and corruption took </v>

396
00:29:43.331 --> 00:29:47.440
<v Speaker 1>the city down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hurricane is an act of God,</v>

397
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.453
<v Speaker 1>but failure to prepare when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity for preparation as well known </v>

398
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.433
<v Speaker 1>that's sin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's failure to hit the mark and the </v>

399
00:29:56.441 --> 00:29:57.274
<v Speaker 1>wages of sin is death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romans six 23 the ancient Jews always </v>

400
00:30:03.281 --> 00:30:05.500
<v Speaker 1>blamed themselves when things fell </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

401
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:06.483
<v Speaker 1>They are as if God's goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goodness of reality was axiomatic </v>

402
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.100
<v Speaker 1>and took responsibility for their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

403
00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.653
<v Speaker 1>That's insanely responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the alternative is to judge reality </v>

404
00:30:20.011 --> 00:30:20.844
<v Speaker 1>as insufficient to criticize being </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and to sink into resentment and </v>

405
00:30:26.041 --> 00:30:30.330
<v Speaker 1>the desire for revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are suffering well,</v>

406
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:35.610
<v Speaker 1>that's the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are limited and life is tragic.</v>

407
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.450
<v Speaker 1>If you're suffering is unbearable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

408
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.730
<v Speaker 1>and you were starting to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupted,</v>

409
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:47.750
<v Speaker 1>here's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clean up your life.</v>

410
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Consider your circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start small.</v>

411
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Have you taken full advantage of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities offered to you?</v>

412
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Are you working harder on your career or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even your job?</v>

413
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Or are you letting bitterness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment hold you back?</v>

414
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Drag you down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you made peace with your brother?</v>

415
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Are you treating your spouse and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>children with dignity and respect?</v>

416
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you have habits that are destroying </v>
<v Speaker 1>your health and wellbeing?</v>

417
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Are you truly shouldering your </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities?</v>

418
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Have you said what you need to say to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends and family members?</v>

419
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:34.203
<v Speaker 1>Are there things that you could do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you could do that would make </v>

420
00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:42.220
<v Speaker 1>things around you better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you cleaned up your life?</v>

421
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.040
<v Speaker 1>If the answer is no,</v>

422
00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:47.470
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

423
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.303
<v Speaker 1>here's something to try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start to stop doing what you know to be </v>

424
00:31:53.591 --> 00:31:56.860
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start stopping today.</v>

425
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Don't waste time questioning how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that what you're doing is wrong.</v>

426
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.073
<v Speaker 1>If you're certain that it is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportune questioning can confuse </v>

427
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:08.530
<v Speaker 1>without enlightening as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>deflecting you from action.</v>

428
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.293
<v Speaker 1>You can know that something is wrong or </v>
<v Speaker 1>right without knowing why you're entire </v>

429
00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:17.710
<v Speaker 1>being can tell you something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can neither explain nor articulate.</v>

430
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Every person is too complex to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves completely and we all contain</v>

431
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:25.120
<v Speaker 1>wisdom that we cannot comprehend.</v>

432
00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:31.540
<v Speaker 1>So simply stop when you apprehend </v>
<v Speaker 1>however dimly that you should stop.</v>

433
00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Stop acting in that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>despicable manner.</v>

434
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Stop saying things that make you weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ashamed.</v>

435
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Say only those things that make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

436
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Do only those things that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak of with honor.</v>

437
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 1>You can use your own standards of </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment.</v>

438
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:53.143
<v Speaker 1>You can rely on yourself for guidance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to adhere to some </v>

439
00:32:56.001 --> 00:32:56.834
<v Speaker 1>external arbitrary code of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you should not overlook the </v>

440
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:05.330
<v Speaker 1>guidance of your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is short and you don't have time to</v>

441
00:33:05.331 --> 00:33:06.164
<v Speaker 1>figure out everything on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wisdom of the past was hard earned </v>

442
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:10.993
<v Speaker 1>and you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ancestors may have something useful to </v>

443
00:33:13.221 --> 00:33:17.960
<v Speaker 1>tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't blame capitalism.</v>

444
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.100
<v Speaker 1>The radical left or the inequity of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies.</v>

445
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Don't reorganize the state until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have ordered your own experience.</v>

446
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.393
<v Speaker 1>Have some humility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you cannot bring peace to your </v>

447
00:33:32.531 --> 00:33:35.980
<v Speaker 1>household,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you try to rule a city.</v>

448
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.153
<v Speaker 1>Let your own soul guide you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch what happens over the days and </v>

449
00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:45.640
<v Speaker 1>weeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were at work,</v>

450
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you will begin to say what you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

451
00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.800
<v Speaker 1>You will start to tell your wife or your</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband or your children or your parents</v>

452
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:54.813
<v Speaker 1>what you really want and need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you know that you have left </v>

453
00:33:58.781 --> 00:34:02.590
<v Speaker 1>something undone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will act to correct the omission.</v>

454
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Your head will start to clear up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you stop filling it with lies,</v>

455
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:07.953
<v Speaker 1>your experience will improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you stopped distorting it within a </v>

456
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:12.820
<v Speaker 1>authentic actions,</v>

457
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:15.523
<v Speaker 1>you will then begin to discover new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more subtle things that you are doing </v>

458
00:34:19.491 --> 00:34:22.490
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop doing those too.</v>

459
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.930
<v Speaker 1>After some months and years of diligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>

460
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.780
<v Speaker 1>your life will become simpler and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

461
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Your judgment will improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will untangle your past.</v>

462
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.220
<v Speaker 1>You will become stronger and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter.</v>

463
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.210
<v Speaker 1>You will move more confidently into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

464
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.440
<v Speaker 1>You will stop making your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessarily difficult.</v>

465
00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:51.340
<v Speaker 1>You will then be left with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitable bear tragedies of life,</v>

466
00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:56.530
<v Speaker 1>but they will no longer be compounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>with bitterness and deceit.</v>

467
00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps you will discover that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>now less corrupted soul,</v>

468
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:06.070
<v Speaker 1>much stronger than it might otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been,</v>

469
00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:07.083
<v Speaker 1>is now able to bear those remaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary minimal in escapable </v>

470
00:35:11.981 --> 00:35:16.030
<v Speaker 1>tragedies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps you will even learn to encounter</v>

471
00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:16.864
<v Speaker 1>them so that they stay tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>merely tragic instead of degenerating </v>

472
00:35:21.881 --> 00:35:22.714
<v Speaker 1>into outright hellishness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your anxiety and hopelessness and </v>

473
00:35:27.611 --> 00:35:32.611
<v Speaker 1>resentment and anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however murderous initially will recede.</v>

474
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps your uncorrupted soul will then </v>
<v Speaker 1>see its existence,</v>

475
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.063
<v Speaker 1>a genuine good as something to celebrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the face of your own </v>

476
00:35:42.751 --> 00:35:43.584
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps you will become an ever more </v>

477
00:35:47.671 --> 00:35:52.050
<v Speaker 1>powerful force for peace and whatever is</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

478
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps you will then see that if all </v>
<v Speaker 1>people did this in their own lives,</v>

479
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 1>the world might stop being an evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

480
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

481
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.450
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with continued effort,</v>

482
00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.020
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it could even stop being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragic place.</v>

483
00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:10.773
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what existence might be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>if we all decided to strive for the </v>

484
00:36:15.251 --> 00:36:18.460
<v Speaker 1>best?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what eternal heaven's might be</v>

485
00:36:18.461 --> 00:36:22.000
<v Speaker 1>established by our spirits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purified by truth,</v>

486
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:26.260
<v Speaker 1>aiming skyward right here on the fallen </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

487
00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Set your house in perfect order before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you criticize the world.</v>

488
00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:37.203
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
