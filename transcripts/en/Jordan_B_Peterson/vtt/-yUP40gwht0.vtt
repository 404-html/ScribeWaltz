1
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank</v>

2
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've been thinking about things that </v>

3
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.331
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy about and what I'm most happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>about so far is that I haven't spilled </v>

4
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:49.771
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my bubbly water into my computer so far </v>

5
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:50.350
<v Speaker 2>while I've been doing these lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's always.</v>

6
00:00:50.351 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably do it tonight now that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>bragging about having avoided it.</v>

7
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

8
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.810
<v Speaker 2>thank you all for coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the last lecture in this 12 part</v>

9
00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:03.811
<v Speaker 2>series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did mention that I have made </v>

10
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:06.841
<v Speaker 2>arrangements with the theater at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do this once a month for the next </v>

11
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:10.021
<v Speaker 2>four months and we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll play it by year past then I want </v>

12
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 2>to continue and I'll find another venue </v>
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps to do it every two weeks,</v>

13
00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:15.160
<v Speaker 2>but certainly once a month and maybe I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can even get deeper into the material if</v>

14
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:20.161
<v Speaker 2>it's only once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be then when then will </v>

15
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:20.161
<v Speaker 2>really slow down to a snail's crawl.</v>

16
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.870
<v Speaker 2>So this is a tough one tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

17
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 2>it's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a story that everyone with any sense </v>

18
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.170
<v Speaker 2>should approach with a substantial </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree of trepidation.</v>

19
00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I've been working on my book this week </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Chapter Seven,</v>

20
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 2>which is called do what is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not what's expedient,</v>

21
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 2>and it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been a very difficult chapter </v>

22
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.081
<v Speaker 2>because I'm coming to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to extend my understanding of</v>

23
00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:52.531
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is of course what we're going to </v>

24
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:52.531
<v Speaker 2>talk about tonight in great detail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

25
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've been wrestling with exactly how</v>

26
00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:57.370
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to read you some of that.</v>

27
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.340
<v Speaker 2>I think today I don't generally read </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I do my lectures,</v>

28
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:05.341
<v Speaker 2>but this is so complicated that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>confident of my ability to just spin it </v>

29
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:05.740
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

30
00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

31
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.310
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A spontaneously,</v>

32
00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:14.311
<v Speaker 2>that's the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so andy last give me a chance to </v>

33
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:18.871
<v Speaker 2>test out whether what I've written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've been struggling with has the </v>

34
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:19.630
<v Speaker 2>kind of poetic flow that I'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

35
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 2>If you're writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really good to read things aloud,</v>

36
00:02:21.671 --> 00:02:26.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can tell if you've got the </v>

37
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:26.671
<v Speaker 2>rhythmic cadence right then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

38
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you all for coming.</v>

39
00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Many of you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

40
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:33.700
<v Speaker 2>attended all 12 lectures and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really remarkable.</v>

41
00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

42
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.340
<v Speaker 2>this place has been full every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>lecture rights completely unbelievable.</v>

43
00:02:39.341 --> 00:02:41.050
<v Speaker 2>That would be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

44
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:46.051
<v Speaker 2>about more than 2 million views of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been watched more than 2 million </v>

45
00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:50.791
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not 2 million people because it </v>

46
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:50.791
<v Speaker 2>would be the same people I would suspect</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times,</v>

47
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:55.111
<v Speaker 2>but that's also crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a crazy world and it seems to </v>

48
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:59.280
<v Speaker 2>be getting crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hopefully this is some addition to </v>

49
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 2>stabilizing it and making slightly more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sane.</v>

50
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 3>That's the hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

51
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 3>so we've got a couple of stories to deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>with tonight.</v>

52
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>complex,</v>

53
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 3>complex stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really easy to comprehend in any</v>

54
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 3>sense of the sense of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean with the story of Isaiah.</v>

55
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 3>God calls on his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

56
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 3>his chosen individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham,</v>

57
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 3>the person who's made this contract with</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sacrifice his son.</v>

58
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:30.181
<v Speaker 3>And it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How in the world are you supposed to </v>

59
00:03:30.181 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 3>make sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any sort of sensible fence out of that.</v>

60
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.310
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly that sort of story that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes modern people who are convinced </v>

61
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 3>that the faster we put the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories behind this,</v>

62
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 3>the better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's grist for the mill.</v>

63
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:44.821
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it seems like such a </v>

64
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 3>incomprehensible and even barbaric act </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the part of God and so you know,</v>

65
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hesitate to even approach it because,</v>

66
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's so many ways that the </v>

67
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.670
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of that sort can go </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

68
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 3>but we'll see how it goes.</v>

69
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 3>And so let's walk through it and see </v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens.</v>

70
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 3>So we're gonna Start with a story of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sarah and Isaac,</v>

71
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 3>and the Lord visited Sarah as he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>

72
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.580
<v Speaker 3>You remember when Abraham was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>midst of his appropriate sacrificial </v>

73
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:16.741
<v Speaker 3>routines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we've characterized as his return </v>

74
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 3>to the contract he made with the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the good,</v>

75
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 3>the contract with God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was informed by God that he would get</v>

76
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 3>what he most wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was an error.</v>

77
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite his advanced old age,</v>

78
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:30.991
<v Speaker 3>and of course Sarah was very skeptical </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that as she had every reason to </v>

79
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:34.681
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this story opens with the </v>

80
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:37.750
<v Speaker 3>fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Lord visited Sarah as he had </v>

81
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.361
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Lord Did unto Sarah as he had </v>

82
00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 3>spoken for Sarah conceived and bore </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham a son in his old age.</v>

83
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 3>At the set time of which God had spoken </v>
<v Speaker 3>to him,</v>

84
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.190
<v Speaker 3>and Abraham called the name of his son </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was born unto him whom Sarah </v>

85
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 3>Barrett to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isaac and Abraham circumcised his son,</v>

86
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 3>Isaac being eight days old as God </v>
<v Speaker 3>commanded him,</v>

87
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.780
<v Speaker 3>had commanded him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Abraham was 100 years old when his </v>

88
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 3>son Isaac was born unto him and Sarah </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

89
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 3>garth had made God.</v>

90
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Had God have made me laugh so that all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that here will laugh with me.</v>

91
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.120
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would've said unto Abraham that </v>

92
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Sarah should have given children's suck </v>
<v Speaker 3>for?</v>

93
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.651
<v Speaker 3>I have born him a son in his old age and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the child grew and was weaned and </v>

94
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 3>Abraham made a great feast the same day </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Isaac was weaned.</v>

95
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 3>I suppose one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the purposes,</v>

96
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:33.661
<v Speaker 3>let's say perhaps the literary purposes </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this story is to exaggerate for </v>

97
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.100
<v Speaker 3>dramatic purposes the importance of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>child.</v>

98
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people are young,</v>

99
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.680
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is particularly true in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the modern world,</v>

100
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.640
<v Speaker 3>they seem to often regard the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the possibility of having a child as an </v>

101
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 3>impediment to their lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

102
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 3>and of course in some ways I suppose </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true,</v>

103
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.160
<v Speaker 2>although you have to have quite a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle before a child actually </v>

104
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.941
<v Speaker 2>constitutes an impediment because having</v>
<v Speaker 2>a child in your life is actually </v>

105
00:06:06.941 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 2>something that's remarkable almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond belief.</v>

106
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have a relationship with a child</v>

107
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:16.001
<v Speaker 2>that is better than any relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've ever had with anyone in your </v>

108
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.821
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're careful and if you're </v>

109
00:06:18.821 --> 00:06:18.821
<v Speaker 2>fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fortunate.</v>

110
00:06:18.821 --> 00:06:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Being fortunate helps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

111
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I've seen many people delay having </v>
<v Speaker 2>children and for understandable reasons.</v>

112
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:30.491
<v Speaker 2>It's no simple decision to have a child </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course now we can make the </v>

113
00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:33.611
<v Speaker 2>decision to have a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course people couldn't in in </v>

114
00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:36.701
<v Speaker 2>past ages really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes you see people delay and </v>

115
00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:39.911
<v Speaker 2>they delay too long and then they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to have a child and then they're </v>

116
00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:42.581
<v Speaker 2>desperate and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they spent a decade doing fertility </v>

117
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:45.701
<v Speaker 2>treatments or that sort of thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>immersing themselves in one </v>

118
00:06:45.701 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 2>disappointment after another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just at that point what you see</v>

119
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 2>exactly how catastrophic it is.</v>

120
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.650
<v Speaker 2>It can be how catastrophic it can be for</v>
<v Speaker 2>people not to have one of the.</v>

121
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Not to be able to undergo one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great adventures of life,</v>

122
00:06:59.381 --> 00:07:03.370
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things this story does by</v>

123
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.880
<v Speaker 2>by delaying the arrival of Isaac and </v>
<v Speaker 2>delaying the arrival of Isaac </v>

124
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.021
<v Speaker 2>continually is to exaggerate the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>important significance of the child </v>

125
00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:15.640
<v Speaker 2>because it isn't until you're deprived </v>
<v Speaker 2>of something,</v>

126
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
<v Speaker 2>it's truly not until you're deprived of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you have any sense of </v>

127
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.490
<v Speaker 2>what its value is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Isaac was waiting,</v>

128
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.130
<v Speaker 2>or Abraham was waiting a very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 years,</v>

129
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.410
<v Speaker 2>a very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the same with Sarah,</v>

130
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:31.470
<v Speaker 2>and so they're unbelievably excited and </v>
<v Speaker 2>of course this also heightens the drama </v>

131
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.670
<v Speaker 2>that's inherent in the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrificial story because it's not only </v>

132
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.350
<v Speaker 2>that eventually that Abraham is called </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon to sacrifice Isaac,</v>

133
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.210
<v Speaker 2>which would be bad enough under any </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

134
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.870
<v Speaker 2>any circumstances whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self-evidently,</v>

135
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that he's been waiting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>century for the arrival of this child </v>

136
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.130
<v Speaker 2>desperately and made all the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifices and lived in the appropriate </v>

137
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.860
<v Speaker 2>manner to allow this to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Der dramatically heightens the,</v>

138
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

139
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.990
<v Speaker 2>the literary tension.</v>

140
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Now you remember Hagar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the next part of the story Hagar</v>

141
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:09.770
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

142
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.830
<v Speaker 2>was Sarah's handmade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when Sarah was unable to bear </v>

143
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Abraham a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she sent him,</v>

144
00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:21.941
<v Speaker 2>Hagar and Hagar immediately got pregnant</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gave birth to Ishmael.</v>

145
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:23.470
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

146
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.690
<v Speaker 2>the story picks up from that point here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is quite interesting.</v>

147
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.380
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned the other week when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to you guys a couple of weeks in</v>

148
00:08:31.381 --> 00:08:36.381
<v Speaker 2>a row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just how interesting it has been to </v>

149
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:38.451
<v Speaker 2>scour the Internet for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the paintings that are associated </v>

150
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:38.451
<v Speaker 2>with these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just,</v>

151
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:42.981
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an amazing wealth of great </v>

152
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:43.440
<v Speaker 2>paintings that illustrate every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of the,</v>

153
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.650
<v Speaker 2>of every single biblical story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

154
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

155
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:52.541
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really been enlightening to me to </v>

156
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:52.541
<v Speaker 2>find out just exactly how poorly </v>
<v Speaker 2>educated I am.</v>

157
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:53.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

158
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a what would say I'm a,</v>

159
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm a great admirer of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of artistic talent and of artistic </v>

160
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.361
<v Speaker 2>endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's so much I don't know about </v>

161
00:09:05.361 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 2>the history of art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's just absolutely beyond belief.</v>

162
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:10.731
<v Speaker 2>And to see this treasure trove of images</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I really had no idea that existed.</v>

163
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're spread all over the world and </v>

164
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:16.650
<v Speaker 2>it's only been in recent years that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have access to them in this way.</v>

165
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.120
<v Speaker 2>It's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

166
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a constant revelation of the depth </v>

167
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.830
<v Speaker 2>to which these stories have absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>permeated our culture and the loss that </v>

168
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.070
<v Speaker 2>it would be if we didn't know them </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly and,</v>

169
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.880
<v Speaker 2>and take them with the degree of </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriousness that they deserve.</v>

170
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:38.510
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of those great images and </v>

171
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Sarah saw the son of Hagar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Egyptian,</v>

172
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 2>which she had born unto Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mocking.</v>

173
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Wherefore she said unto Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cast out this bonds woman and her son </v>

174
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 2>for the son of this bonds woman shall </v>
<v Speaker 2>not be heir with my son,</v>

175
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.640
<v Speaker 2>even with Isaac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing was very grievous in </v>

176
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.521
<v Speaker 2>Abraham's sight because of his son was </v>
<v Speaker 2>being quite a bit of tension between </v>

177
00:09:58.521 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Abraham or between Sarah and Hagar.</v>

178
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 2>As you could imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be.</v>

179
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't there be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

180
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:07.971
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hagar had the first child and that </v>

181
00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:09.040
<v Speaker 2>elevated her status and she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah's made handmade,</v>

182
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 2>and so that's obviously going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite awkward.</v>

183
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:13.270
<v Speaker 2>And then she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

184
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 2>she lorded it over Sarah because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that she got pregnant so easily.</v>

185
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:22.941
<v Speaker 2>And now we see this situation where </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ishmael is doing the same thing with </v>

186
00:10:22.941 --> 00:10:27.681
<v Speaker 2>regards to Isaac and not causes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantial amount of trouble.</v>

187
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 2>The family is a familial division </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurring here.</v>

188
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 2>And God said unto Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let it not be grievous in eyesight </v>

189
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.180
<v Speaker 2>because of the loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of the Bond Woman in all </v>

190
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:41.640
<v Speaker 2>that Sarah Hath said unto the Hearken </v>
<v Speaker 2>unto her voice,</v>

191
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 2>for in Isaac shall thy seed be called </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

192
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.970
<v Speaker 2>but also of the son of the bond woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will I make a nation?</v>

193
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Because he is vi seed.</v>

194
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.130
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

195
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:52.050
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting outcome to,</v>

196
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

197
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.270
<v Speaker 2>we pointed out before we discussed </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the fact that because Abraham has</v>

198
00:10:57.271 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has lived his life properly in his,</v>

199
00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:03.510
<v Speaker 2>kept the contract with God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's every evidence in the story that</v>

200
00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 2>no matter what the vicissitudes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham's life,</v>

201
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 2>you know how the great serpent that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>sits on in some sense weaves back and </v>

202
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.641
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always the promise that things </v>

203
00:11:16.641 --> 00:11:18.750
<v Speaker 2>will work out positively and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could read that as naive optimism,</v>

204
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:23.751
<v Speaker 2>but I think it has a lot more to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual power of keeping the </v>

205
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:29.331
<v Speaker 2>contractual agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I really do believe and I've </v>

206
00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:31.050
<v Speaker 2>spent a tremendous amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about this over the last couple</v>

207
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 2>of weeks in addition to the decades </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

208
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:33.920
<v Speaker 2>That is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

209
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:39.010
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that's happened since I've been </v>

210
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.211
<v Speaker 2>doing these biblical lectures is that my</v>
<v Speaker 2>conviction and this has been </v>

211
00:11:41.211 --> 00:11:41.211
<v Speaker 2>strengthened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite interesting,</v>

212
00:11:41.211 --> 00:11:45.381
<v Speaker 2>is that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do what it is that you're called </v>

213
00:11:45.381 --> 00:11:49.911
<v Speaker 2>upon to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to lift your eyes up above the </v>

214
00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:50.550
<v Speaker 2>mundane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>daily selfish,</v>

215
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.760
<v Speaker 2>impulsive issues that might be set you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and attempt to enter into a contractual </v>

216
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 2>relationship with that which you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold in the highest regard.</v>

217
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To aim high and to,</v>

218
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:04.900
<v Speaker 2>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to make that important.</v>

219
00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:09.901
<v Speaker 2>Above all else in your life that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fortifies you against the </v>

220
00:12:09.901 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 2>vicissitudes of existence like nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>else can.</v>

221
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:15.931
<v Speaker 2>And I truly believe that that's the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>practical advice that you can possibly,</v>

222
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.620
<v Speaker 2>that you could possibly receive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

223
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.840
<v Speaker 2>I received,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was answering questions last night.</v>

224
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 2>I did this q and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I do about once a month for,</v>

225
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:30.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the people who are supporting me on </v>

226
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Patrion which also released on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somebody asked,</v>

227
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:37.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were struggling with their </v>

228
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.230
<v Speaker 2>religious faith and they asked what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>could do about that.</v>

229
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.401
<v Speaker 2>And I'd also been thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between Nietzsche and </v>

230
00:12:41.401 --> 00:12:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we'll discuss in a minute.</v>

231
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.360
<v Speaker 2>And I was trying to answer this question</v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to religious faith because </v>

232
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

233
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.000
<v Speaker 2>this person was shaky and his faith in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

234
00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

235
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Which is a better way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

236
00:12:53.901 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to me that the way that you</v>

237
00:12:56.681 --> 00:13:01.681
<v Speaker 2>fortify your faith in being and in life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your own existence isn't to try to </v>

238
00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:06.061
<v Speaker 2>convince yourself of the existence of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent power that you could </v>

239
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:09.400
<v Speaker 2>believe in the same way that you believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a set of empirical facts.</v>

240
00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:11.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the right approach.</v>

241
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a weak approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

242
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that the cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology that I don't think that's the</v>

243
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 2>right cognitive technology for that set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of problems.</v>

244
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:23.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more a technology that you use if</v>

245
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:25.510
<v Speaker 2>you were trying to solve a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

246
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:30.930
<v Speaker 2>It's more like it's more something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to be embedded in action rather </v>

247
00:13:31.271 --> 00:13:36.271
<v Speaker 2>than in sustainable belief and the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you fortify your faith in life is </v>

248
00:13:36.271 --> 00:13:38.020
<v Speaker 2>to assume the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

249
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.720
<v Speaker 2>And then to act courageously in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to that.</v>

250
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.160
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

251
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 2>that's tantamount to expressing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith in the highest possible good.</v>

252
00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:48.220
<v Speaker 2>It's tantamount to expressing your faith</v>
<v Speaker 2>in God.</v>

253
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.350
<v Speaker 2>And it's not a matter of stating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

254
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:52.990
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the existence of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent that daddy,</v>

255
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:54.820
<v Speaker 2>because in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares,</v>

256
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.060
<v Speaker 2>who cares what you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

257
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.480
<v Speaker 2>you might and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

258
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.180
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the issue.</v>

259
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.460
<v Speaker 2>The issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me is how you act.</v>

260
00:14:03.461 --> 00:14:08.461
<v Speaker 2>And I was thinking about this intensely </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was thinking about Nietzsche and </v>

261
00:14:08.461 --> 00:14:12.481
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that Nietzsche was the </v>

262
00:14:12.481 --> 00:14:12.520
<v Speaker 2>philosopher who announced the death of </v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

263
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:13.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who is a great,</v>

264
00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:18.601
<v Speaker 2>great critic of Christianity at vicious </v>
<v Speaker 2>critic of Institutional Christianity in </v>

265
00:14:18.601 --> 00:14:19.240
<v Speaker 2>the best sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you announced the death of God.</v>

267
00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:25.090
<v Speaker 2>And he said that we'd never find enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>water to wash away the blood.</v>

268
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:30.090
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a triumphant proclamation even</v>
<v Speaker 2>though it's often read that way and </v>

269
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 2>don't need niches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conclusion from that,</v>

270
00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 2>from the death of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that our ethical systems,</v>

271
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:40.381
<v Speaker 2>we're going to collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the foundation was pulled out from </v>

272
00:14:40.381 --> 00:14:40.381
<v Speaker 2>underneath them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believed that human beings would have</v>

273
00:14:40.381 --> 00:14:43.150
<v Speaker 2>to find their own values to create their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own values.</v>

274
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.420
<v Speaker 2>And there's a problem with that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem that this is something </v>

275
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.270
<v Speaker 2>Carl young was very thorough and </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigating.</v>

276
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:54.271
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really look like people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of creating their own values </v>

277
00:14:54.271 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 2>because you're not really capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>molding yourself just any old way.</v>

278
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:59.870
<v Speaker 2>You want to be like you have a nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to contend with,</v>

279
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.320
<v Speaker 2>and so it isn't a matter of creating our</v>
<v Speaker 2>own values because we don't have that </v>

280
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.761
<v Speaker 2>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be a matter of rediscovering </v>

281
00:15:09.761 --> 00:15:12.251
<v Speaker 2>those values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what Jung was attempting to do </v>

282
00:15:12.251 --> 00:15:12.251
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

283
00:15:12.251 --> 00:15:12.251
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

284
00:15:12.251 --> 00:15:17.140
<v Speaker 2>and so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think nature was actually profoundly </v>

285
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.140
<v Speaker 2>wrong in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that recommendation.</v>

286
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.280
<v Speaker 2>I think he was psychologically wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you know,</v>

287
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.820
<v Speaker 2>there was the Esky wrote in many ways in</v>
<v Speaker 2>parallel to.</v>

288
00:15:23.821 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Nisha was a great influence on Ninja </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

289
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:30.731
<v Speaker 2>Their lives parallel each other to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree that's somewhat miraculous in </v>

290
00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:31.040
<v Speaker 2>some senses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite uncanny.</v>

291
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky was obviously a literary </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure,</v>

292
00:15:33.651 --> 00:15:36.440
<v Speaker 2>whether whereas nature was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher,</v>

293
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:41.470
<v Speaker 2>a literary philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still a philosopher and Dostoevsky </v>

294
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.760
<v Speaker 2>wrestled with exactly the same problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

295
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.840
<v Speaker 2>that nature wrestled with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

296
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:49.930
<v Speaker 2>but he did it in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't literary manner and he has </v>

297
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.771
<v Speaker 2>this great book and the Brothers </v>
<v Speaker 2>Karamazov and in that book there's a </v>

298
00:15:53.771 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 2>hero of the book is really Lee Osha </v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's a monastic novitiate,</v>

299
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.590
<v Speaker 2>a very good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a,</v>

300
00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.440
<v Speaker 2>not an intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not an intellect,</v>

301
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:03.020
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person of great character,</v>

302
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he has a brother Ivan who his older </v>

303
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.121
<v Speaker 2>brother who a great intellect and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a very handsome soldier and a brave </v>

304
00:16:10.121 --> 00:16:10.121
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

305
00:16:10.121 --> 00:16:12.830
<v Speaker 2>And like Dostoyevsky's villains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See Ivan isn't exactly a villain,</v>

306
00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:17.831
<v Speaker 2>but that's close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ivan or Dostoevsky makes his villains </v>

307
00:16:17.831 --> 00:16:19.340
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if Dostoevsky's trying to work out an</v>

308
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

309
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.480
<v Speaker 2>he clothes the argument in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the flash of one of his characters </v>

310
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.280
<v Speaker 2>and if it's an argument he doesn't agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with and he makes that character as </v>

311
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.401
<v Speaker 2>strong as he possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as strong and as attractive and </v>

312
00:16:33.401 --> 00:16:34.990
<v Speaker 2>intelligent as he possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he let some just have outer.</v>

313
00:16:34.991 --> 00:16:39.991
<v Speaker 2>And so Ivan is constantly attacking Lee </v>
<v Speaker 2>Osha and from every direction trying to </v>

314
00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:43.140
<v Speaker 2>knock him off his perch of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

315
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.320
<v Speaker 2>And the Osha Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Osha can't address a single one of </v>

316
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Ivan's criticisms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

317
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.360
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't have the intellect for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

318
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:50.930
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

319
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:55.910
<v Speaker 2>and Ivan has a devastating intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's devastating to him himself as well.</v>

320
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.500
<v Speaker 2>What happens in the brothers Karamazov </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially is the lel.</v>

321
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Osha continues to act out his commitment</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the good,</v>

322
00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:05.780
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that manner he's triumphant.</v>

323
00:17:05.781 --> 00:17:10.781
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter that he loses the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments because the arguments aren't </v>

324
00:17:10.781 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 2>exactly the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the arguments in some sense,</v>

325
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:13.340
<v Speaker 2>our aside issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the issue is,</v>

326
00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:18.341
<v Speaker 2>and this is the existential issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issue is not what you believe as if </v>

327
00:17:18.341 --> 00:17:22.661
<v Speaker 2>it's a set of facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how you conduct yourself in the </v>

328
00:17:22.661 --> 00:17:22.661
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Dostoevsky,</v>

329
00:17:22.661 --> 00:17:24.290
<v Speaker 2>he grasped that and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that makes him such a,</v>

330
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:29.650
<v Speaker 2>an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing literary figure and amazing </v>

331
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.641
<v Speaker 2>genius because he was smart enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to formulate the arguments in a manner </v>

332
00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:36.610
<v Speaker 2>that no one else really could with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible exception of nature.</v>

333
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's quite an exception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet he could still using his </v>

334
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.551
<v Speaker 2>dramatic embodiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could still lay out solutions to the </v>

335
00:17:45.551 --> 00:17:49.241
<v Speaker 2>problems that he was describing that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely compelling and both crime and </v>

336
00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:51.750
<v Speaker 2>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an amazing,</v>

337
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 2>thrilling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engrossing book.</v>

338
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.690
<v Speaker 2>And the brothers Karamazov all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoyevsky's great books really </v>

339
00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.230
<v Speaker 2>circulated around around those profound </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral issues.</v>

340
00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:03.420
<v Speaker 2>And so I've learned a tremendous amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

341
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.740
<v Speaker 2>from reading him so and God said unto </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham,</v>

342
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.410
<v Speaker 2>let it not be grievous and eyesight </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the loud.</v>

343
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 2>And because of that bond woman in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Sarah has said unto Thee,</v>

344
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:16.320
<v Speaker 2>hearkened unto her voice for a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for in Isaiah,</v>

345
00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Excel shall thy seed be called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also of the son of the bond woman,</v>

346
00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:22.860
<v Speaker 2>will I make it nation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he is a seed.</v>

347
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I commented that Abraham is being </v>

348
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.830
<v Speaker 2>blessed in multiple directions even when</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are going wrong.</v>

349
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:32.700
<v Speaker 2>And this is pretty bad because his </v>
<v Speaker 2>family in some sense is breaking up the.</v>

350
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.760
<v Speaker 2>There's this emphasis in the text that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's kept this contractual </v>

351
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.080
<v Speaker 2>relationship with God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

352
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.290
<v Speaker 2>that he's in an arc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could say it,</v>

353
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:41.520
<v Speaker 2>that we could put it that way.</v>

354
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.100
<v Speaker 2>And that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

355
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.400
<v Speaker 2>that he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll try.</v>

356
00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:47.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm through the vicissitudes of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the best you can hope for.</v>

357
00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:48.930
<v Speaker 2>And it's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

358
00:18:48.931 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's so powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the abrahamic stories is that it's</v>

359
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:54.210
<v Speaker 2>not like Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though he is chosen by God,</v>

360
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 2>it's not like he has an easy time of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a rough life.</v>

361
00:18:56.581 --> 00:18:58.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a successful life and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

362
00:18:58.201 --> 00:18:59.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

363
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.640
<v Speaker 2>it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not without its troubles,</v>

364
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.710
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got every sort of trouble you could</v>

365
00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:06.240
<v Speaker 2>possibly imagine pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

366
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.400
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the things that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story so realistic as far as I'm </v>

367
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.310
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Abraham rose up early in the morning</v>

368
00:19:13.311 --> 00:19:16.790
<v Speaker 2>and took bread and a bottle of water and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave it unto Hagar,</v>

369
00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.240
<v Speaker 2>putting it on her shoulder and the child</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sent her away.</v>

370
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.240
<v Speaker 2>And she departed and wandered in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wilderness of</v>

371
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.690
<v Speaker 2>yeshiva.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found the.</v>

372
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:33.190
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess this had more of an emotional </v>

373
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.190
<v Speaker 2>impact on me this week than it might </v>
<v Speaker 2>have because my daughter just had a baby</v>

374
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.680
<v Speaker 2>a week ago and so I've been thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this sort of thing,</v>

375
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:41.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're so happy that that's happened and </v>

376
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.860
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to put yourself in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say,</v>

377
00:19:42.861 --> 00:19:47.861
<v Speaker 2>the conceptual space of the people about</v>
<v Speaker 2>who this stories or people who these </v>

378
00:19:47.991 --> 00:19:50.420
<v Speaker 2>stories are about and trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

379
00:19:50.421 --> 00:19:54.680
<v Speaker 2>notice the catastrophe that this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakup would actually constitute.</v>

380
00:19:54.681 --> 00:19:57.440
<v Speaker 2>And No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the visual images really helped with</v>

381
00:19:57.441 --> 00:20:00.200
<v Speaker 2>that because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so carefully crafted and,</v>

382
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.460
<v Speaker 2>and they hit the story from so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different directions that,</v>

383
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:09.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they add that an additional layer of </v>

384
00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:09.790
<v Speaker 2>emotional meaning to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I found very,</v>

385
00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:14.261
<v Speaker 2>very significant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the water was spent in the bottle </v>

386
00:20:14.261 --> 00:20:17.981
<v Speaker 2>and she cast the child under one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shrubs and she sent to wandering the </v>

387
00:20:17.981 --> 00:20:17.990
<v Speaker 2>desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

388
00:20:17.991 --> 00:20:21.260
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just that she has to leave </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham's household,</v>

389
00:20:21.261 --> 00:20:25.250
<v Speaker 2>it's that where she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really amenable to life.</v>

390
00:20:25.251 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's extraordinarily dramatic and and,</v>

391
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:33.970
<v Speaker 2>and terrible tale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she went and sat her down over </v>

392
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.690
<v Speaker 2>against him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good way off as it were,</v>

393
00:20:35.691 --> 00:20:37.910
<v Speaker 2>a bowshot for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

394
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:42.500
<v Speaker 2>let me not see the death of the child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she sat over against him and lift up</v>

395
00:20:42.501 --> 00:20:43.700
<v Speaker 2>her voice and wept,</v>

396
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.810
<v Speaker 2>and God heard the voice of the loud and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the angel of God called to Hagar out of </v>

397
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 2>heaven and said unto her what Aileth </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hagar,</v>

398
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.640
<v Speaker 2>fear not for God hath heard the voice of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lad where he is rise.</v>

399
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Lift up the lad and hold them in nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand for I will make him a great nation.</v>

400
00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:12.020
<v Speaker 2>And God opened her eyes and she saw a </v>
<v Speaker 2>well of water and she went and filled </v>

401
00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.180
<v Speaker 2>the bottle with water and gave the lead </v>
<v Speaker 2>drink.</v>

402
00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:23.260
<v Speaker 2>And God was with the loud and he grew </v>
<v Speaker 2>and dwelt in the wilderness and became </v>

403
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.501
<v Speaker 2>an archer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually irrelevant detail to </v>

404
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:26.660
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he became an archer,</v>

405
00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:31.661
<v Speaker 2>because I think I mentioned to you at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one point that the word sin is derived </v>

406
00:21:31.661 --> 00:21:35.651
<v Speaker 2>from a Greek word Amartya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though it sounds nothing like that </v>

407
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:38.291
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hamartia is actually a an archery term </v>

408
00:21:38.291 --> 00:21:38.630
<v Speaker 2>and it means to,</v>

409
00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.920
<v Speaker 2>it means to miss the Bullseye and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

410
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:47.110
<v Speaker 2>that's a lovely metaphor for sand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because it's associated so </v>

411
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.240
<v Speaker 2>tightly with the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of goal direction and an aim,</v>

412
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's an,</v>

413
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.800
<v Speaker 2>there's a metaphorical idea that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>embedded in that,</v>

414
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.230
<v Speaker 2>in that image and that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

415
00:21:57.231 --> 00:22:00.590
<v Speaker 2>a human being is something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifies a target,</v>

416
00:22:00.591 --> 00:22:02.420
<v Speaker 2>which we do all the time with her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

417
00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean our eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our target specifying mechanisms.</v>

418
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:10.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have very precise central focal </v>

419
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.990
<v Speaker 2>vision and we use our focal vision to </v>
<v Speaker 2>target the aim of our behavior.</v>

420
00:22:11.991 --> 00:22:14.480
<v Speaker 2>And so we are aiming creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's are,</v>

421
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.730
<v Speaker 2>it's built right into our plot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our body,</v>

422
00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.890
<v Speaker 2>or we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're built on a hunting platform.</v>

423
00:22:18.891 --> 00:22:22.550
<v Speaker 2>We're aiming creatures and we do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitively as well as behaviorally.</v>

424
00:22:22.551 --> 00:22:27.551
<v Speaker 2>And so as hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we take aim at things that we take aim </v>

425
00:22:27.551 --> 00:22:30.821
<v Speaker 2>at moving targets and we're very good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing them down and we'd been doing </v>

426
00:22:30.821 --> 00:22:31.820
<v Speaker 2>that for who knows how long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of years really.</v>

427
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Even chimpanzees are carnivorous by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

428
00:22:34.191 --> 00:22:36.290
<v Speaker 2>and we split from them about 6 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

429
00:22:36.291 --> 00:22:39.290
<v Speaker 2>so we've been hunting and aiming for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

430
00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:42.560
<v Speaker 2>very long period of time and we still </v>
<v Speaker 2>have aims in our life.</v>

431
00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how we describe them.</v>

432
00:22:43.791 --> 00:22:45.410
<v Speaker 2>What are you aiming at or what are your </v>
<v Speaker 2>aims,</v>

433
00:22:45.411 --> 00:22:47.780
<v Speaker 2>what are your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your target?</v>

434
00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:53.050
<v Speaker 2>It's all based on that hunting metaphor </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that Ishmael becomes an </v>

435
00:22:53.361 --> 00:22:58.361
<v Speaker 2>archer means that he is someone who can </v>
<v Speaker 2>take aim at the center of the Bullseye </v>

436
00:22:58.361 --> 00:23:02.261
<v Speaker 2>and hit it precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's an indication that he's a </v>

437
00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:02.261
<v Speaker 2>good man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

438
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

439
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:11.220
<v Speaker 2>and I suppose also part of the part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it carries part of the narrative weight </v>

440
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.830
<v Speaker 2>of the story because of course he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham's son and you'd expect Abraham's</v>

441
00:23:13.831 --> 00:23:18.831
<v Speaker 2>son to be someone who's very good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking aim and he dwelt in the </v>

442
00:23:18.831 --> 00:23:19.800
<v Speaker 2>wilderness of Paran and he could live </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and survive,</v>

443
00:23:19.801 --> 00:23:24.801
<v Speaker 2>which is no trivial thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his mother took him a wife out of </v>

444
00:23:24.801 --> 00:23:26.370
<v Speaker 2>the land of Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

445
00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:29.160
<v Speaker 2>So that's the story of Hagar and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly straightforward story.</v>

446
00:23:29.161 --> 00:23:32.450
<v Speaker 2>It's complex emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't and it and it.</v>

447
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:37.510
<v Speaker 2>It brings up the terrible theme of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>familial catastrophe and the </v>

448
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:41.271
<v Speaker 2>complications of of romantic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>familial relationships and all of that,</v>

449
00:23:41.371 --> 00:23:45.030
<v Speaker 2>but it really serves as a prodrome on to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next story,</v>

450
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.800
<v Speaker 2>which is the one that's so complex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so difficult to understand</v>

451
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.650
<v Speaker 2>and it came to pass after these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that God did tempt Abraham,</v>

452
00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.160
<v Speaker 3>which is a funny thing for God to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose,</v>

453
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.850
<v Speaker 3>and said unto him Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

454
00:24:03.851 --> 00:24:05.440
<v Speaker 3>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here I am,</v>

455
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.050
<v Speaker 3>and God said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take now thy son the only son,</v>

456
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:17.051
<v Speaker 3>Isaac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who who they'll love us and get thee </v>

457
00:24:17.051 --> 00:24:19.361
<v Speaker 3>into the land of Moriah and offer him </v>
<v Speaker 3>there for a burnt offering upon one of </v>

458
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:24.521
<v Speaker 3>the mountains which I will tell the of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Abraham rose up early in the morning</v>

459
00:24:30.861 --> 00:24:34.580
<v Speaker 3>and saddled his ass and took two of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>young men with him and Isaac his son and</v>

460
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:40.150
<v Speaker 3>clave the wood for the burnt offering </v>
<v Speaker 3>and rose up and went under the place of </v>

461
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.850
<v Speaker 3>which God had told him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then on the third day of journeying,</v>

462
00:24:42.851 --> 00:24:47.680
<v Speaker 3>Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place afar off and Abraham said unto his</v>

463
00:24:47.681 --> 00:24:48.970
<v Speaker 3>young men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abide he,</v>

464
00:24:48.971 --> 00:24:53.971
<v Speaker 3>he here with the ass and I and the lad </v>
<v Speaker 3>will go yonder and worship and come </v>

465
00:24:54.581 --> 00:24:55.270
<v Speaker 3>again to you.</v>

466
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.710
<v Speaker 3>It's really one of the first times that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've come across the word worship,</v>

467
00:25:02.711 --> 00:25:07.711
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a very difficult word to </v>

468
00:25:07.711 --> 00:25:10.261
<v Speaker 3>contend with to know because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like me or if you're like me when I was </v>

469
00:25:11.111 --> 00:25:12.460
<v Speaker 3>a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I haven't thought about this for</v>

470
00:25:12.461 --> 00:25:17.461
<v Speaker 3>a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was never really obvious to me why </v>

471
00:25:17.461 --> 00:25:17.461
<v Speaker 3>God would want to be worshiped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

472
00:25:17.461 --> 00:25:21.641
<v Speaker 3>if you go to church and you offer up </v>
<v Speaker 3>your praise and thanks to God and you </v>

473
00:25:21.641 --> 00:25:22.150
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well relate.</v>

474
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.920
<v Speaker 3>Does that make a lot of sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

475
00:25:23.921 --> 00:25:26.080
<v Speaker 3>why in the world is that what he wants?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

476
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.880
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

477
00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:28.390
<v Speaker 3>you're</v>

478
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.780
<v Speaker 2>kneeling down in front of an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of an ancient,</v>

479
00:25:31.781 --> 00:25:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Middle Eastern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

480
00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:35.480
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical emperor and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

481
00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:40.420
<v Speaker 2>and vowing your submission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that never sat well with me.</v>

482
00:25:40.421 --> 00:25:45.421
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it doesn't sit well with many </v>

483
00:25:45.421 --> 00:25:47.251
<v Speaker 2>people and I think that's because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not the proper way of conceptualizing </v>

484
00:25:47.251 --> 00:25:50.941
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens when you see what Abraham </v>

485
00:25:50.941 --> 00:25:52.510
<v Speaker 2>does continually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this seems to be implicit in the use</v>

486
00:25:52.511 --> 00:25:55.630
<v Speaker 2>of the word worship in this particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

487
00:25:55.631 --> 00:25:58.090
<v Speaker 2>is that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we discussed,</v>

488
00:25:58.091 --> 00:26:03.091
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has an adventure in his life that </v>

489
00:26:03.091 --> 00:26:03.091
<v Speaker 2>comes to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's an episode in his life,</v>

490
00:26:03.091 --> 00:26:07.141
<v Speaker 2>it comes to an end and then there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of we might consider it re where </v>

491
00:26:07.141 --> 00:26:09.360
<v Speaker 2>you reconstitute himself to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

492
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.400
<v Speaker 2>That's when he makes his sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me that it's that </v>

493
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:14.800
<v Speaker 2>reconstitution that constitutes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worship.</v>

494
00:26:14.801 --> 00:26:16.690
<v Speaker 2>The worship is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

495
00:26:16.691 --> 00:26:19.330
<v Speaker 2>this is alluding back to my original </v>
<v Speaker 2>proposition,</v>

496
00:26:19.331 --> 00:26:20.230
<v Speaker 2>that it's how you act.</v>

497
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:24.460
<v Speaker 2>That's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the worship is the decision to enact</v>

498
00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:29.490
<v Speaker 2>the good in whatever form it is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can conceptualize it as well as trying </v>

499
00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:32.320
<v Speaker 2>to continually reconceptualize the good </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a manner that makes the good,</v>

500
00:26:32.321 --> 00:26:34.480
<v Speaker 2>that you're conceptualizing even that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much better.</v>

501
00:26:34.481 --> 00:26:36.550
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you start aiming,</v>

502
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:41.790
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>aiming in the right direction is very </v>

503
00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.821
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hypothetically as you aim and as </v>

504
00:26:44.821 --> 00:26:47.610
<v Speaker 2>practice and as you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the target is going to shift in front of</v>

505
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:51.060
<v Speaker 2>your eyes and you're going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow whatever more clearly and so that</v>

506
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:56.061
<v Speaker 2>seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially given the context that </v>

507
00:26:56.061 --> 00:26:59.411
<v Speaker 2>this word is used in this particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>story is much more appropriate </v>

508
00:26:59.411 --> 00:27:00.480
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper worship.</v>

509
00:27:00.481 --> 00:27:05.481
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose it's akin to the later </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian idea that it's the imitation </v>

510
00:27:05.481 --> 00:27:09.951
<v Speaker 2>of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the sacred duty of every </v>

511
00:27:09.951 --> 00:27:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every Christian and every human being.</v>

512
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I suppose in so far as that's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypal idea.</v>

513
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.500
<v Speaker 2>An idea is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

514
00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:21.501
<v Speaker 2>it's the embodiment of the good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the issue and it's not your </v>

515
00:27:21.501 --> 00:27:26.301
<v Speaker 2>stated belief in the good and you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>when nature was criticized and </v>

516
00:27:26.301 --> 00:27:30.081
<v Speaker 2>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is actually one of the things that </v>

517
00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:32.211
<v Speaker 2>he brought up as a as a major issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that he believed Christianity </v>

518
00:27:32.211 --> 00:27:35.361
<v Speaker 2>had lost its way because it had </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced a confusion between stated </v>

519
00:27:35.361 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 2>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is say your belief in the divinity</v>

520
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:38.700
<v Speaker 2>of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it means.</v>

521
00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:41.160
<v Speaker 2>If you state that it isn't obvious what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it means,</v>

522
00:27:41.161 --> 00:27:46.161
<v Speaker 2>that when you state that because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't obvious what it would mean that </v>

523
00:27:46.161 --> 00:27:46.920
<v Speaker 2>you believe it or even what it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're believing in.</v>

524
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.290
<v Speaker 2>As far as Nietzsche was concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>

525
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:54.291
<v Speaker 2>not only was that beside the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was dangerously beside the point </v>

526
00:27:54.291 --> 00:27:57.501
<v Speaker 2>because it actually allowed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian believer not to adopt the </v>

527
00:27:58.801 --> 00:28:03.030
<v Speaker 2>moral burden that was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>appropriate to the faith which was to.</v>

528
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:07.050
<v Speaker 2>And this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using a kind of a union concept here</v>

529
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.680
<v Speaker 2>to manifest the archetype within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>confines of your own life.</v>

530
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.280
<v Speaker 2>And that's to make the divine that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the divine,</v>

531
00:28:14.281 --> 00:28:19.281
<v Speaker 2>your relationship with the transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 2>and infinite into something that's </v>

532
00:28:19.281 --> 00:28:20.910
<v Speaker 2>actually realized bubble in the context </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your own life.</v>

533
00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Which is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

534
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to.</v>

535
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.780
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

536
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:27.150
<v Speaker 2>to act out the highest good of which </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're capable.</v>

537
00:28:27.151 --> 00:28:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll transform your life.</v>

538
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:30.540
<v Speaker 2>To some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into an archetypal adventure,</v>

539
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.640
<v Speaker 2>there is no way around that because as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you attempt to climb a higher mountain,</v>

540
00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:40.671
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or to aim at a higher target or </v>

541
00:28:40.671 --> 00:28:42.591
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the things around you will become </v>

542
00:28:42.591 --> 00:28:45.410
<v Speaker 2>increasingly dramatic and of import.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happens by necessity obviously </v>

543
00:28:45.511 --> 00:28:49.650
<v Speaker 2>because if you're aiming at something </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult and profound and you're really</v>

544
00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:54.651
<v Speaker 2>working on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your life is going to become </v>

545
00:28:54.651 --> 00:28:54.651
<v Speaker 2>perhaps increasingly difficult and </v>
<v Speaker 2>profound,</v>

546
00:28:54.651 --> 00:28:55.710
<v Speaker 2>but that might be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might.</v>

547
00:28:55.711 --> 00:29:00.711
<v Speaker 2>That might be exactly what you need as </v>
<v Speaker 2>an antidote to the implicit limitations </v>

548
00:29:00.961 --> 00:29:05.961
<v Speaker 2>that say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see you as a human being so and I and </v>

549
00:29:13.991 --> 00:29:16.360
<v Speaker 2>the lad will go yonder and worship and </v>
<v Speaker 2>come again to you.</v>

550
00:29:16.361 --> 00:29:21.361
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an implication here too that </v>

551
00:29:21.361 --> 00:29:24.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a foreshadowing that Abraham </v>
<v Speaker 2>offering up his son is actually a form </v>

552
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:28.471
<v Speaker 2>of worship and that's that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuous with what he's already done </v>

553
00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:31.210
<v Speaker 2>and well now I'm going to read you some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things that I've written and then</v>

554
00:29:31.211 --> 00:29:33.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll return to this and we'll see how </v>
<v Speaker 2>that goes.</v>

555
00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.330
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

556
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.680
<v Speaker 2>life is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's clear.</v>

557
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.070
<v Speaker 2>There is no more basic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>irrefutable truth.</v>

558
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:50.610
<v Speaker 2>It's basically as we've seen what God </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells Adam and Eve immediately before he</v>

559
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:55.030
<v Speaker 2>kicks them out of Paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote unto the woman,</v>

560
00:29:55.031 --> 00:30:00.031
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and </v>

561
00:30:00.031 --> 00:30:02.191
<v Speaker 2>thy conception in sorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thou shall bring forth children and that</v>

562
00:30:02.471 --> 00:30:07.471
<v Speaker 2>desire shall be to the husband and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>shall rule over thee and unto Adam he </v>

563
00:30:07.471 --> 00:30:11.941
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have hearkened unto the </v>

564
00:30:11.941 --> 00:30:12.670
<v Speaker 2>voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tree which I commanded thee,</v>

565
00:30:12.671 --> 00:30:14.560
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thou shalt not eat of it.</v>

566
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Cursed is the ground for the sake in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorrow shall thou eat of it all the days</v>

567
00:30:20.501 --> 00:30:25.501
<v Speaker 2>of thy life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thorns also and thistles shall it bring </v>

568
00:30:25.501 --> 00:30:26.950
<v Speaker 2>forth to thee and thou shalt eat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>herb of the field.</v>

569
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:32.310
<v Speaker 2>By the sweat of your brow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will eat your food until you return </v>

570
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.310
<v Speaker 2>to the ground.</v>

571
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.490
<v Speaker 2>Since from it you were taken for dust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are and to dust,</v>

572
00:30:33.491 --> 00:30:37.650
<v Speaker 2>you will return rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

573
00:30:37.651 --> 00:30:42.651
<v Speaker 2>and we've associated that with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Adam and Eve's eyes opening and </v>

574
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:47.730
<v Speaker 2>them becoming self conscious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovering the future and becoming </v>

575
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:51.331
<v Speaker 2>fully aware and falling into history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me to be a very </v>

576
00:30:51.331 --> 00:30:54.280
<v Speaker 2>realistic existential portrayal of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicament of humankind.</v>

577
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.340
<v Speaker 2>What in the world should be done about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

578
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.200
<v Speaker 2>The simplest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most obvious and most direct answer,</v>

579
00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:06.520
<v Speaker 2>pursue pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Follow your impulses.</v>

580
00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Live for the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do what's expedient.</v>

581
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheat,</v>

582
00:31:10.961 --> 00:31:12.070
<v Speaker 2>steal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deceive,</v>

583
00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:17.220
<v Speaker 2>manipulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't get caught in an ultimately </v>

584
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.610
<v Speaker 2>meaningless universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What possible difference could it make?</v>

585
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.480
<v Speaker 2>And this is by no means a new idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact of life tragedy and the </v>

586
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.370
<v Speaker 2>suffering that is part of it has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to justify the pursuit of immediate</v>

587
00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:30.190
<v Speaker 2>selfish gratification for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

588
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:32.980
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even reading young,</v>

589
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.880
<v Speaker 2>he often writes as if before the rise of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conflict between religion and </v>

590
00:31:39.131 --> 00:31:44.131
<v Speaker 2>science and which culminated say in </v>
<v Speaker 2>niches pronouncement about the death of </v>

591
00:31:44.131 --> 00:31:46.510
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people lived ensconced quite safely</v>

592
00:31:46.511 --> 00:31:51.511
<v Speaker 2>within a religious conceptualization </v>
<v Speaker 2>that abused their life with meaning and </v>

593
00:31:51.511 --> 00:31:52.360
<v Speaker 2>that that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was just the state of reality,</v>

594
00:31:52.361 --> 00:31:57.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's ancient writings that makes </v>

595
00:31:57.361 --> 00:31:57.361
<v Speaker 2>it quite clear that the crisis of faith </v>
<v Speaker 2>that characterize,</v>

596
00:31:57.361 --> 00:32:00.340
<v Speaker 2>say modern people were certainly far </v>
<v Speaker 2>from unknown in the past.</v>

597
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:05.340
<v Speaker 2>And here's one of those writings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is from wisdom to the revised </v>

598
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:11.310
<v Speaker 2>standard version,</v>
<v Speaker 2>short and sorrowful is our life and </v>

599
00:32:11.861 --> 00:32:16.861
<v Speaker 2>there is no remedy when a man comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>his end and no one has been known to </v>

600
00:32:16.861 --> 00:32:21.511
<v Speaker 2>return from Haiti's because we were born</v>
<v Speaker 2>by mere chance and hereafter.</v>

601
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:27.270
<v Speaker 2>We shall be as though we had never been </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the breath in our nostrils is </v>

602
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:31.591
<v Speaker 2>smoke and reason is just a spark kindled</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the beating of our hearts.</v>

603
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:36.930
<v Speaker 2>When it is extinguished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our body will turn to ashes and their </v>

604
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.990
<v Speaker 2>spirit will dissolve like empty air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our Name</v>

605
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:43.500
<v Speaker 2>will be forgotten in time and no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>will remember our works.</v>

606
00:32:43.501 --> 00:32:48.501
<v Speaker 2>Our life will pass away like the traces </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a cloud and be scattered like mist </v>

607
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:52.911
<v Speaker 2>that is chased by the rays of the sun </v>
<v Speaker 2>and overcome by its heat for our </v>

608
00:32:52.911 --> 00:32:57.560
<v Speaker 2>allotted time is about the passing of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shadow and there is no return from </v>

609
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.710
<v Speaker 2>our death because it is sealed up and no</v>
<v Speaker 2>one turns back.</v>

610
00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>

611
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:08.300
<v Speaker 2>let us enjoy the good things that exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>and make use of the creation to the </v>

612
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.330
<v Speaker 2>full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As in youth.</v>

613
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Let us take our fill of costly wines and</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfumes and let know flower of spring </v>

614
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:20.740
<v Speaker 2>passes by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds </v>

615
00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.381
<v Speaker 2>before they wither.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let none of us fail to share in our </v>

616
00:33:24.381 --> 00:33:28.011
<v Speaker 2>revelry everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let us leave signs of enjoyment because </v>

617
00:33:28.011 --> 00:33:30.130
<v Speaker 2>this is our portion and this is our lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let us oppress.</v>

618
00:33:30.131 --> 00:33:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Press the righteous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor man.</v>

619
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Let us not spare the widow nor regard </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gray hairs of the aged,</v>

620
00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.820
<v Speaker 2>but let her might be are right for what </v>
<v Speaker 2>is weak proves itself to be useless.</v>

621
00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.490
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing</v>

622
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.660
<v Speaker 2>piece of writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know it.</v>

623
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:53.830
<v Speaker 2>It starts with an announcement of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationale for nihilism and ends with a </v>

624
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:55.580
<v Speaker 2>justification for fastest tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

625
00:33:55.581 --> 00:33:57.680
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's thousands of years old.</v>

626
00:33:57.681 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a remarkable thing to see and to be</v>

627
00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:05.920
<v Speaker 2>laid out so concisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pleasure of expediency may be </v>

628
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.060
<v Speaker 2>fleeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's pleasure nonetheless,</v>

629
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:12.200
<v Speaker 2>and that's something to stack up against</v>
<v Speaker 2>the terror and pain of existence.</v>

630
00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Every man for himself and the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take the hindmost as the old proverb has</v>

631
00:34:18.231 --> 00:34:23.231
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not simply take everything you can </v>

632
00:34:23.231 --> 00:34:26.261
<v Speaker 2>get whenever the opportunity arises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not determined to live in that </v>

633
00:34:26.261 --> 00:34:30.401
<v Speaker 2>manner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the alternative and why should we</v>

634
00:34:30.691 --> 00:34:35.691
<v Speaker 2>bother with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our ancestors worked out very </v>

635
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:39.231
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated answers to such questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we still don't understand them very </v>

636
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:40.860
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is because they are in large part,</v>

637
00:34:40.861 --> 00:34:44.250
<v Speaker 2>still implicit manifest primarily in </v>
<v Speaker 2>ritual and myth,</v>

638
00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:49.730
<v Speaker 2>and as of yet incompletely articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we act them out and represent them in </v>

639
00:34:50.771 --> 00:34:55.771
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not wise enough yet to </v>

640
00:34:55.771 --> 00:34:58.321
<v Speaker 2>formulate them explicitly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're still chimps in a troop or wolves </v>

641
00:34:58.321 --> 00:35:00.130
<v Speaker 2>in the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know how to behave.</v>

642
00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:03.580
<v Speaker 2>We know who's who and why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've learned that through experience.</v>

643
00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Our knowledge has been shaped by our </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction with others.</v>

644
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.410
<v Speaker 2>We've established predictable routines </v>
<v Speaker 2>and patterns of behavior,</v>

645
00:35:11.411 --> 00:35:15.160
<v Speaker 2>but we don't really understand them or </v>
<v Speaker 2>know where they originated.</v>

646
00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Maybe evolved over great expanses of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

647
00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:24.810
<v Speaker 2>No one was formulating them explicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least not in the dimmest reaches of </v>

648
00:35:25.181 --> 00:35:30.181
<v Speaker 2>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though we've been telling each </v>

649
00:35:30.181 --> 00:35:31.610
<v Speaker 2>other how to act forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One day,</v>

650
00:35:31.611 --> 00:35:32.840
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so long ago,</v>

651
00:35:32.841 --> 00:35:35.930
<v Speaker 2>we woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were already doing,</v>

652
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>but we noticing what we</v>

653
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:43.040
<v Speaker 3>were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started using our bodies as devices </v>

654
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 3>to represent their own actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started imitating and dramatizing.</v>

655
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:51.230
<v Speaker 3>We invented ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started acting out our own </v>

656
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:52.830
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we started to tell stories.</v>

657
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:58.490
<v Speaker 3>We coded our observations of our own </v>
<v Speaker 3>drama in those stories,</v>

658
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:04.520
<v Speaker 3>in this manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The information that was first only </v>

659
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.100
<v Speaker 3>embedded in our behavior became </v>
<v Speaker 3>represented in our stories,</v>

660
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.790
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't and we still don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what it all meant.</v>

661
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:14.190
<v Speaker 3>The Biblical narrative of Paradise in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fall is one such story fabricated by</v>

662
00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:17.220
<v Speaker 3>our collective imagination working over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the centuries.</v>

663
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:24.320
<v Speaker 3>It provides a profound account of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature of being and points the way to a </v>

664
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:29.211
<v Speaker 3>motive conceptualization and action well</v>
<v Speaker 3>matched to that nature in the garden of </v>

665
00:36:29.211 --> 00:36:31.590
<v Speaker 3>Eden prior to the dawn of self </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>

666
00:36:31.591 --> 00:36:34.710
<v Speaker 3>so goes the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human beings were sinless.</v>

667
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Our primordial parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam and Eve walked with God.</v>

668
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:49.940
<v Speaker 3>They hadn't attempted by the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first couple ate from the tree of </v>

669
00:36:50.281 --> 00:36:55.281
<v Speaker 3>the knowledge of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered death and vulnerability and </v>

670
00:36:55.281 --> 00:36:58.731
<v Speaker 3>turned away from God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mankind was exiled from paradise and </v>

671
00:36:58.951 --> 00:37:01.830
<v Speaker 3>began it's effortful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mortal existence,</v>

672
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.890
<v Speaker 3>the idea of sacrifice enter soon </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards,</v>

673
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:09.891
<v Speaker 3>beginning with the account of Cain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abel and developing as we've seen </v>

674
00:37:09.891 --> 00:37:09.891
<v Speaker 3>through the abrahamic stories,</v>

675
00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:16.530
<v Speaker 3>after much contemplation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>struggling humanity learns that God's </v>

676
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:19.450
<v Speaker 3>favor could be gained and his wrath </v>
<v Speaker 3>averted through proper sacrifice,</v>

677
00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.720
<v Speaker 3>and also that bloody murder might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivated among those unwilling or </v>

678
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.201
<v Speaker 3>unable to succeed in this manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When engaging in sacrifice,</v>

679
00:37:29.501 --> 00:37:34.501
<v Speaker 3>our forefathers began to act out what </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be considered a proposition if it </v>

680
00:37:34.501 --> 00:37:38.431
<v Speaker 3>were stated in words that something </v>
<v Speaker 3>better might be attained in the future </v>

681
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:40.570
<v Speaker 3>by giving up something of value in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>present.</v>

682
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:42.820
<v Speaker 3>Recall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>

683
00:37:42.821 --> 00:37:47.821
<v Speaker 3>that the necessity for work is one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the curses placed by God upon out of </v>

684
00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:52.001
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his descendants in consequence of </v>

685
00:37:52.001 --> 00:37:54.631
<v Speaker 3>original sin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam's waking to the fundamental </v>

686
00:37:55.011 --> 00:37:57.980
<v Speaker 3>constraints of his being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his vulnerability,</v>

687
00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.960
<v Speaker 3>his eventual death that's equivalent to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the discovery of the future.</v>

688
00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:07.440
<v Speaker 3>The future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where you go to die.</v>

689
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:13.490
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully not too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your demise might be staved off through </v>

690
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:17.871
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the sacrifice of the now to </v>

691
00:38:17.871 --> 00:38:20.400
<v Speaker 3>benefit later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is for this reason,</v>

692
00:38:20.401 --> 00:38:25.401
<v Speaker 3>among others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no doubt that the concept of sacrifice </v>

693
00:38:25.401 --> 00:38:27.961
<v Speaker 3>is introduced in the biblical chapter </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately following the drama of the </v>

694
00:38:27.961 --> 00:38:31.281
<v Speaker 3>fall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's little difference between </v>

695
00:38:31.281 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice and work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're also both uniquely human.</v>

696
00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes animals act as if</v>

697
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:41.040
<v Speaker 4>they're working,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're really only following the </v>

698
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:41.920
<v Speaker 4>dictates of their natures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beavers build dams.</v>

699
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:45.160
<v Speaker 4>They do so because they're beavers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>beavers build dams.</v>

700
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.320
<v Speaker 4>They don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

701
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.560
<v Speaker 4>but I'd rather be on a beach in Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 4>with my girlfriend while they're doing </v>

702
00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:52.560
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

703
00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Prosaically such sacrifice work is delay</v>
<v Speaker 3>of gratification,</v>

704
00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:07.460
<v Speaker 3>but that's a very mundane phrase to </v>
<v Speaker 3>describe something of soul shattering </v>

705
00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:11.721
<v Speaker 3>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The discovery that gratification could </v>

706
00:39:11.721 --> 00:39:14.871
<v Speaker 3>be delayed was simultaneously the </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovery of time and with it causality </v>

707
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:20.780
<v Speaker 3>long ago in the dim mists of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we began to realize that reality was </v>

708
00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.620
<v Speaker 3>structured as if it could be bargained </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

709
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.310
<v Speaker 3>We learned that behaving properly now in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the present,</v>

710
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:31.400
<v Speaker 3>regulating our impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>considering the plight of others could </v>

711
00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.660
<v Speaker 3>bring rewards in the future in a time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and place that did not yet exist.</v>

712
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:38.990
<v Speaker 3>We began to inhibit control and organize</v>
<v Speaker 3>our immediate impulses so that we could </v>

713
00:39:39.301 --> 00:39:44.301
<v Speaker 3>stop interfering with other people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>our future selves doing so was </v>

714
00:39:44.471 --> 00:39:47.680
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable from organizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

715
00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:54.420
<v Speaker 3>The discovery of the causal relationship</v>
<v Speaker 3>between our efforts today and the </v>

716
00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.530
<v Speaker 3>quality of tomorrow motivated the social</v>
<v Speaker 3>contract,</v>

717
00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:00.250
<v Speaker 3>the organization that enables today's </v>
<v Speaker 3>work to be stored reliably,</v>

718
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 3>mostly in the form of promises from </v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

719
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:09.630
<v Speaker 3>Understanding is something that's often </v>
<v Speaker 3>acted out before it can be articulated</v>

720
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:16.110
<v Speaker 3>just as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>acts out what it means to be mother or </v>

721
00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:18.040
<v Speaker 3>father before being able to give a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spoken account of what those roles mean.</v>

722
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.400
<v Speaker 3>The idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the act of making a ritual sacrifice to </v>

723
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.671
<v Speaker 3>God was an early and sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 3>enactment of the idea of the usefulness </v>

724
00:40:27.311 --> 00:40:32.311
<v Speaker 3>of delay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a long conceptual journey </v>

725
00:40:32.311 --> 00:40:35.791
<v Speaker 3>between merely feasting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hungrily and learning to set aside some </v>

726
00:40:35.791 --> 00:40:39.361
<v Speaker 3>extra meat smoke by the fire for the end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the day or for someone who isn't </v>

727
00:40:39.361 --> 00:40:43.111
<v Speaker 3>present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a long time to learn to keep </v>

728
00:40:43.111 --> 00:40:45.520
<v Speaker 3>anything later for yourself or to share </v>
<v Speaker 3>it with someone else,</v>

729
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.880
<v Speaker 3>and those are very much the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>as in the former case.</v>

730
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:50.590
<v Speaker 3>You're sharing with your future self.</v>

731
00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:57.060
<v Speaker 3>It's much easier and far more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 3>selfishly and immediately wolf down </v>

732
00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.661
<v Speaker 3>everything in sight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are similar long journeys between </v>

733
00:41:00.661 --> 00:41:03.631
<v Speaker 3>every leap and sophistication with </v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to delay and its </v>

734
00:41:03.631 --> 00:41:05.950
<v Speaker 3>conceptualization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>short term sharing,</v>

735
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:11.310
<v Speaker 3>storing away from the further future </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation of that storage in the </v>

736
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:15.721
<v Speaker 3>form of records and later in the form of</v>
<v Speaker 3>currency and ultimately the saving of </v>

737
00:41:15.721 --> 00:41:19.651
<v Speaker 3>money in a bank or other institution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some conceptualizations had serve as </v>

738
00:41:19.651 --> 00:41:24.391
<v Speaker 3>intermediaries or the full range of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>practices and ideas surrounding </v>

739
00:41:24.391 --> 00:41:26.800
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice and work and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation could have never emerged.</v>

740
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:30.340
<v Speaker 3>Our ancestors acted out a drama,</v>

741
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.850
<v Speaker 3>a literary fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They persona fired the forest,</v>

742
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 3>that governance fate as a spirit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be bargained with,</v>

743
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.420
<v Speaker 3>traded with as if it were another human </v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

744
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:46.510
<v Speaker 3>and the amazing thing is that it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was in part because the future is </v>

745
00:41:46.701 --> 00:41:51.701
<v Speaker 3>largely composed of other human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often precisely those who have watched </v>

746
00:41:51.701 --> 00:41:55.190
<v Speaker 3>an evaluated and appraise the tiniest </v>
<v Speaker 3>details of your past behavior.</v>

747
00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:01.060
<v Speaker 3>It's not very far from that to God </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting above on high tracking your </v>

748
00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.800
<v Speaker 3>every move and writing it down for </v>
<v Speaker 3>further reference.</v>

749
00:42:03.801 --> 00:42:07.610
<v Speaker 3>In a big book here is a productive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolic idea.</v>

750
00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:13.570
<v Speaker 3>The future is a judgmental father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good start,</v>

751
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.760
<v Speaker 3>but two additional archetype or </v>
<v Speaker 3>foundational questions that arose </v>

752
00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:25.661
<v Speaker 3>because of the discovery of sacrifice of</v>
<v Speaker 3>work both have to do with the ultimate </v>

753
00:42:25.661 --> 00:42:30.071
<v Speaker 3>extension of the logic of work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is sacrifice now to gain later.</v>

754
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:38.120
<v Speaker 3>First question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what must be sacrificed?</v>

755
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:45.200
<v Speaker 3>Small sacrifices might be sufficient to </v>
<v Speaker 3>small to solve small singular problems,</v>

756
00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:51.620
<v Speaker 3>but it's possible that larger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more comprehensive sacrifices might </v>

757
00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.450
<v Speaker 3>solve an array of large and complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems all at the same time.</v>

758
00:42:55.260 --> 00:43:00.260
<v Speaker 3>That's harder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might be better adapting to the </v>

759
00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.220
<v Speaker 3>necessary discipline of medical school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

760
00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:07.700
<v Speaker 3>will fatally interfere with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>licentious lifestyle of a hardcore </v>

761
00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.380
<v Speaker 3>undergraduate party animal giving that </v>
<v Speaker 3>up as a sacrifice,</v>

762
00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:13.470
<v Speaker 3>but a physician can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To quote George,</v>

763
00:43:13.471 --> 00:43:18.471
<v Speaker 3>w really put food on his family that's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of trouble dispensed with over a </v>

764
00:43:23.251 --> 00:43:28.251
<v Speaker 3>very long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so sacrifices are necessary to improve </v>

765
00:43:28.861 --> 00:43:33.180
<v Speaker 3>the future and larger sacrifices can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

766
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Second question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>introduction.</v>

767
00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:41.180
<v Speaker 3>We've already established the basic </v>
<v Speaker 3>principle sacrifice will improve the </v>

768
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:45.171
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's implied by that in the most </v>

769
00:43:45.171 --> 00:43:49.341
<v Speaker 3>extreme and final of cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where does that basic principle find its</v>

770
00:43:49.351 --> 00:43:54.351
<v Speaker 3>limits?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We must ask to begin with what would be </v>

771
00:43:54.351 --> 00:43:55.170
<v Speaker 3>the largest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most effective,</v>

772
00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:59.040
<v Speaker 3>most pleasing of all possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices,</v>

773
00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:04.650
<v Speaker 3>and then how good might the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible future be if the most effective</v>

774
00:44:04.651 --> 00:44:09.651
<v Speaker 3>possible sacrifice could be made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Biblical story of Cain and Abel,</v>

775
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Adam and Eve sons immediately follows </v>
<v Speaker 3>the story of the expulsion from </v>

776
00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.730
<v Speaker 3>paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As mentioned previously,</v>

777
00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Cain and Abel are really the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans since their parents were made </v>

778
00:44:26.951 --> 00:44:29.320
<v Speaker 3>directly by God and not born in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>standard manner.</v>

779
00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Cain and Abel live in history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in Eden.</v>

780
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.760
<v Speaker 2>They must work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must make sacrifices to please God </v>

781
00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.010
<v Speaker 2>and they do so with alter and proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>ritual,</v>

782
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.670
<v Speaker 2>but things get complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ables offerings please God,</v>

783
00:44:41.671 --> 00:44:45.420
<v Speaker 2>but do not able is rewarded many times </v>
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>

784
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.930
<v Speaker 2>but Kane is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not precisely clear why,</v>

785
00:44:48.931 --> 00:44:51.750
<v Speaker 2>although the tech strongly hints that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Keynes Heart is just not in it.</v>

786
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.600
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the quality of what came put </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward was low.</v>

787
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Maybe his spirit was begrudging or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>God was just feeding crabby and all of </v>

788
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 2>this is realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the texts,</v>

789
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:07.050
<v Speaker 2>vagueness of explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all sacrifices are of equal quality.</v>

790
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it often appears that sacrifices of </v>

791
00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.471
<v Speaker 2>apparently high quality are sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>not rewarded with a better future and </v>

792
00:45:15.471 --> 00:45:17.040
<v Speaker 2>it's not clear why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't God happy?</v>

793
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.520
<v Speaker 2>What would have to change to make him </v>
<v Speaker 2>so?</v>

794
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.990
<v Speaker 2>These are difficult questions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone asks them all the time,</v>

795
00:45:24.991 --> 00:45:26.550
<v Speaker 2>even if they don't notice.</v>

796
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Asking such questions is </v>
<v Speaker 2>indistinguishable from thinking.</v>

797
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:36.950
<v Speaker 2>The realization that pleasure could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>usefully for stole dormed with a </v>

798
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:40.161
<v Speaker 2>difficulty that's almost impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 2>overstate such a realization runs </v>

799
00:45:41.461 --> 00:45:46.461
<v Speaker 2>absolutely contrary to our ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental animal instincts which </v>

800
00:45:46.461 --> 00:45:50.871
<v Speaker 2>demand immediate satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly under conditions of </v>

801
00:45:50.871 --> 00:45:54.531
<v Speaker 2>deprivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are both inevitable and </v>

802
00:45:54.531 --> 00:45:54.531
<v Speaker 2>commonplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to complicate the matter,</v>

803
00:45:54.531 --> 00:45:59.450
<v Speaker 2>such delay only becomes useful when </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization has stabilized itself </v>

804
00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:01.890
<v Speaker 2>enough to guarantee the existence of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>delayed reward.</v>

805
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:04.730
<v Speaker 2>If everything you save will be destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 2>or worse,</v>

806
00:46:04.731 --> 00:46:06.530
<v Speaker 2>stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no point saving.</v>

807
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:12.650
<v Speaker 2>It's for this reason that a wolf will </v>
<v Speaker 2>down 20 pounds of raw meat in a single </v>

808
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 2>meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He isn't thinking,</v>

809
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:14.970
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate it when I binge.</v>

810
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I should save some of this for next </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

811
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.630
<v Speaker 2>Here's a developmental progression from </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal to human.</v>

812
00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.940
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt in the details,</v>

813
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:27.930
<v Speaker 2>but it's sufficiently correct for our </v>
<v Speaker 2>purposes in theme first,</v>

814
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:31.080
<v Speaker 2>there's excess food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>large carcasses,</v>

815
00:46:31.081 --> 00:46:34.350
<v Speaker 2>mammoths or other massive herbivores </v>
<v Speaker 2>might provide that way.</v>

816
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:38.730
<v Speaker 2>A lot of mamas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe all of them with a large animal,</v>

817
00:46:38.731 --> 00:46:43.731
<v Speaker 2>there's some left for later after a kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's accidental at first,</v>

818
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:49.550
<v Speaker 2>but eventually the utility of for later </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to be appreciated.</v>

819
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Some provisional notion of sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 2>develops at the same time.</v>

820
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:57.540
<v Speaker 2>If I leave some now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if I want it now,</v>

821
00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:02.700
<v Speaker 2>I won't have to be hungry later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That provision will notion then develops</v>

822
00:47:02.701 --> 00:47:05.340
<v Speaker 2>to the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I leave some for later,</v>

823
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I won't have to go hungry and neither </v>
<v Speaker 2>will those I care for and then to the </v>

824
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.500
<v Speaker 2>next level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't possibly eat all this mammoth,</v>

825
00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:16.110
<v Speaker 2>but I can't store the rest for too long </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

826
00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:18.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should feed some to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

827
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they'll remember and feed me some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their mammoth when they have some and</v>

828
00:47:23.191 --> 00:47:28.191
<v Speaker 2>I have none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'll get some mammoth now and some </v>

829
00:47:28.191 --> 00:47:29.710
<v Speaker 2>mammoth later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good deal</v>

830
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.940
<v Speaker 3>and maybe those I'm sharing with will </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to trust me more generally.</v>

831
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Maybe then we could trade forever in </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a manner.</v>

832
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:42.520
<v Speaker 3>Mammoth becomes future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mammoth and future.</v>

833
00:47:42.521 --> 00:47:47.521
<v Speaker 3>Mammoth becomes personal reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the emergence of the social </v>

834
00:47:47.521 --> 00:47:52.471
<v Speaker 3>contract to share does not mean to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>away something you value and get nothing</v>

835
00:47:53.041 --> 00:47:54.420
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only.</v>

836
00:47:54.421 --> 00:47:59.421
<v Speaker 3>Instead what every child who refuses to </v>
<v Speaker 3>share his afraid that it means to share </v>

837
00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:02.220
<v Speaker 3>means properly to initiate the process </v>
<v Speaker 3>of trade.</v>

838
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.950
<v Speaker 3>A child who can't share,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't trade,</v>

839
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:11.210
<v Speaker 3>can't have any friends because having </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends is a form of trade.</v>

840
00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:16.570
<v Speaker 3>Benjamin Franklin once suggested that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>newcomer to a neighborhood ask a new </v>

841
00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:20.660
<v Speaker 3>neighbor to do him or her a favor citing</v>
<v Speaker 3>an old maxim.</v>

842
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:26.050
<v Speaker 3>He that has one stun you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A kindness will be more ready to do </v>

843
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:29.500
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he whom you yourself have obliged </v>

844
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:30.740
<v Speaker 3>in Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so opinion asking something for someone,</v>

845
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:36.100
<v Speaker 3>asking someone for something not too </v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme obviously was the most useful </v>

846
00:48:36.441 --> 00:48:38.750
<v Speaker 3>and immediate invitation to social </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction.</v>

847
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Such asking allowed the neighbor to show</v>
<v Speaker 3>him or herself as a good person at first</v>

848
00:48:42.801 --> 00:48:47.801
<v Speaker 3>encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also meant that the neighbor could </v>

849
00:48:47.801 --> 00:48:50.501
<v Speaker 3>now ask the newcomer for a favor in </v>
<v Speaker 3>return because of the debt incurred in </v>

850
00:48:50.501 --> 00:48:55.271
<v Speaker 3>that manner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both parties could overcome their </v>

851
00:48:55.271 --> 00:48:55.370
<v Speaker 3>natural hesitancy and mutual fear of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stranger.</v>

852
00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:00.090
<v Speaker 3>It's better to have something rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>than nothing.</v>

853
00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:06.600
<v Speaker 3>It's better yet to generously share the </v>
<v Speaker 3>something you have.</v>

854
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:08.490
<v Speaker 3>It's even better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

855
00:49:08.491 --> 00:49:11.310
<v Speaker 3>to become widely known for generous </v>
<v Speaker 3>sharing,</v>

856
00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:15.420
<v Speaker 3>that's something that lasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something that's reliable,</v>

857
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:20.900
<v Speaker 3>and at this point in abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can observe how the groundwork for </v>

858
00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.280
<v Speaker 3>the conceptions of reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honest and generous have been laid.</v>

859
00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.880
<v Speaker 3>The basis for an articulated morality </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been put in place.</v>

860
00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:32.120
<v Speaker 3>The productive truthful sharer is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prototype for the good citizen and the </v>

861
00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:36.921
<v Speaker 3>good man we can see in this manner how </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the simple notion that leftovers </v>

862
00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:43.250
<v Speaker 3>are a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the highest moral principles might </v>

863
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:46.491
<v Speaker 3>emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's as if something like this happened </v>

864
00:49:46.491 --> 00:49:51.211
<v Speaker 3>as humanity developed first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're the endless tens or hundreds of </v>

865
00:49:53.621 --> 00:49:57.040
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years prior to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emergence of written history and drama.</v>

866
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.720
<v Speaker 3>During this time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the twin practices of delay and exchange</v>

867
00:50:01.721 --> 00:50:06.721
<v Speaker 3>began to emerge slowly and painfully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they became represented in </v>

868
00:50:07.181 --> 00:50:12.181
<v Speaker 3>metaphorical abstraction as rituals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tales of sacrifice totaled in a manner </v>

869
00:50:12.791 --> 00:50:17.791
<v Speaker 3>such as this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's as if there is a powerful figure in</v>

870
00:50:18.221 --> 00:50:23.221
<v Speaker 3>the sky who sees all and is judging you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving up something you value seems to </v>

871
00:50:25.331 --> 00:50:30.331
<v Speaker 3>make them happy and you to make them </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy because all hell breaks loose if </v>

872
00:50:30.331 --> 00:50:35.201
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so practice sacrificing and sharing </v>

873
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:39.260
<v Speaker 3>until you become expert at it and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>will go well for you.</v>

874
00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.380
<v Speaker 3>No one said any of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least not so plainly and directly,</v>

875
00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:47.160
<v Speaker 3>but it was implicit in the practice and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then in the stories.</v>

876
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Action came first as it had to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the animals we once were,</v>

877
00:50:53.101 --> 00:50:58.101
<v Speaker 3>could act but could not think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Implicit unrecognized value came first </v>

878
00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.830
<v Speaker 3>as the actions that proceeded thought</v>

879
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:07.230
<v Speaker 3>embodied value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but did not make that value explicit.</v>

880
00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 3>People watched the successful succeed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the unsuccessful fail for thousands </v>

881
00:51:13.471 --> 00:51:18.471
<v Speaker 3>and thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We thought it over and we drew a </v>

882
00:51:18.471 --> 00:51:22.491
<v Speaker 3>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The successful among us delay </v>

883
00:51:22.491 --> 00:51:25.200
<v Speaker 3>gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the successful among us bargain with the</v>

884
00:51:25.201 --> 00:51:28.420
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A great idea began to emerge taking ever</v>

885
00:51:28.421 --> 00:51:33.210
<v Speaker 3>more clearly articulated forum in </v>
<v Speaker 3>evermore clearly articulated stories.</v>

886
00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:37.500
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful and the unsuccessful,</v>

887
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:43.670
<v Speaker 3>the successful sacrifice things get </v>
<v Speaker 3>better as the successful practice,</v>

888
00:51:44.191 --> 00:51:49.191
<v Speaker 3>their sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the questions become increasingly </v>

889
00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:52.881
<v Speaker 3>precise and simultaneously broader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the greatest possible sacrifice </v>

890
00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:57.920
<v Speaker 3>for the greatest possible good and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer become increasingly deeper and </v>

891
00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.781
<v Speaker 3>profound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The God of western tradition like so </v>

892
00:52:02.781 --> 00:52:05.100
<v Speaker 3>many gods requires sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've already examined why,</v>

893
00:52:05.101 --> 00:52:09.720
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes he goes even further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He demands not only sacrifice,</v>

894
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.140
<v Speaker 3>but the sacrifice of precisely what is </v>
<v Speaker 3>love best.</v>

895
00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:18.320
<v Speaker 3>This is most starkly portrayed and most </v>
<v Speaker 3>confusingly evident in the story of </v>

896
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:23.040
<v Speaker 3>Abraham and Isaac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham beloved of God long wanted a son</v>

897
00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:28.220
<v Speaker 3>and God promised them exactly that after</v>
<v Speaker 3>many delays and under the apparently </v>

898
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.960
<v Speaker 3>impossible conditions of old age and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>long barren wife,</v>

899
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:37.070
<v Speaker 3>but not so long afterward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the miraculously born,</v>

900
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:42.071
<v Speaker 3>Isaac is still a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God turns around and in apparently </v>

901
00:52:42.071 --> 00:52:44.030
<v Speaker 3>barbaric fashion demands that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>faithful servant,</v>

902
00:52:44.031 --> 00:52:47.990
<v Speaker 3>offer his son as a sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The story ends happily.</v>

903
00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:53.830
<v Speaker 3>God sends an angel to stay Abraham's </v>
<v Speaker 3>obedient hand and accepts a ram and </v>

904
00:52:53.881 --> 00:52:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Isaac stead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a good thing,</v>

905
00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:59.180
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't really address the issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>at hand.</v>

906
00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:03.350
<v Speaker 3>Why was God's going further necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does he?</v>

907
00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Why does life impose such demands?</v>

908
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:16.730
<v Speaker 3>Let's start our analysis with a truism </v>
<v Speaker 3>stark self evident and understated.</v>

909
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes things do not go well that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have much to do with the terrible nature</v>

910
00:53:27.391 --> 00:53:32.391
<v Speaker 3>of the world with its plagues and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>famines and it's tyrannies and it's </v>

911
00:53:32.391 --> 00:53:32.910
<v Speaker 3>betrayals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the rub.</v>

912
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.400
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes when things are not going </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

913
00:53:35.401 --> 00:53:40.401
<v Speaker 3>it's not the world that it's the cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cause is instead that which is most </v>

914
00:53:40.401 --> 00:53:41.790
<v Speaker 3>valued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

915
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.800
<v Speaker 3>Because the world is revealed to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>intermittent degree through the template</v>

916
00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:51.801
<v Speaker 3>of your values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the world you are seeing is not the </v>

917
00:53:51.801 --> 00:53:56.331
<v Speaker 3>world you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore it's time to examine your </v>

918
00:53:56.331 --> 00:53:59.961
<v Speaker 3>values.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's time to rid yourself of your </v>

919
00:53:59.961 --> 00:54:01.890
<v Speaker 3>current presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's time to let go.</v>

920
00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:07.760
<v Speaker 3>It might even be time to sacrifice what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you love best so that you can become who</v>

921
00:54:08.791 --> 00:54:12.720
<v Speaker 3>you might become instead of staying who </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>

922
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:19.910
<v Speaker 3>something valuable given up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Insurers fused future prosperity,</v>

923
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:21.940
<v Speaker 3>something valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrificed,</v>

924
00:54:21.941 --> 00:54:26.941
<v Speaker 3>pleases the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is most valuable and best </v>

925
00:54:26.941 --> 00:54:29.480
<v Speaker 3>sacrificed or what does at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>emblematic of that,</v>

926
00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:33.110
<v Speaker 3>a choice cut of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best animal in a flock,</v>

927
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:38.330
<v Speaker 3>a most valued possession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's above even that something </v>

928
00:54:39.461 --> 00:54:44.461
<v Speaker 3>intensely personal and painful to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>up that symbolized perhaps in God's </v>

929
00:54:44.461 --> 00:54:47.950
<v Speaker 3>insistence on circumcision as part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham sacrificial routine.</v>

930
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:53.160
<v Speaker 3>What's beyond that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What pertains more closely to the whole </v>

931
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:57.301
<v Speaker 3>person rather than the part?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What constitutes the ultimate sacrifice </v>

932
00:54:57.301 --> 00:54:58.720
<v Speaker 3>for the gain of the ultimate prize?</v>

933
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.430
<v Speaker 3>It's a close race between child and </v>
<v Speaker 3>self.</v>

934
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:10.580
<v Speaker 3>The sacrifice of the mother offering her</v>
<v Speaker 3>child to the world is exemplified.</v>

935
00:55:10.891 --> 00:55:12.590
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by Michelangelo,</v>

936
00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 3>great sculpture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Pieta,</v>

937
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:18.030
<v Speaker 3>Michelangelo Crafted Mary Contemplating </v>
<v Speaker 3>Her Son,</v>

938
00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:20.430
<v Speaker 3>crucified in ruins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she's sitting.</v>

939
00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:25.020
<v Speaker 3>Most of you know this sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's sitting and the body of her son is</v>

940
00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:26.280
<v Speaker 3>in her arms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her adult son,</v>

941
00:55:26.281 --> 00:55:31.281
<v Speaker 3>and it's broken and he's been destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a very beautiful but very </v>

942
00:55:31.321 --> 00:55:32.070
<v Speaker 3>tragic</v>

943
00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:37.150
<v Speaker 3>work of genius work of genius level </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation.</v>

944
00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Michelangelo crafted Mary Contemplating </v>
<v Speaker 3>Her Son,</v>

945
00:55:41.621 --> 00:55:44.470
<v Speaker 3>crucified and rude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's her fault.</v>

946
00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:48.970
<v Speaker 3>It was through her that he entered the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and it's great drama of Ba.</v>

947
00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:53.170
<v Speaker 3>Is it right to bring a baby into this </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible world?</v>

948
00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Every woman asks herself that question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some say no,</v>

949
00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.560
<v Speaker 3>and they have their reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mary answers,</v>

950
00:55:59.561 --> 00:56:04.561
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily knowing full well what's to </v>

951
00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:06.841
<v Speaker 3>come as do all mothers if they allow </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves to see it's an act of supreme</v>

952
00:56:06.851 --> 00:56:09.520
<v Speaker 3>courage when it's undertaken </v>
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily.</v>

953
00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:15.330
<v Speaker 3>In turn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mary Sung Christ offers himself to God </v>

954
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:18.271
<v Speaker 3>and the world to be trailed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>torture and death to the very point of </v>

955
00:56:18.271 --> 00:56:21.010
<v Speaker 3>despair on the cross where he cries out </v>
<v Speaker 3>those terrible words,</v>

956
00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:25.690
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my why hast thou forsaken me?</v>

957
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:32.100
<v Speaker 3>That is the archetipal story of the man </v>
<v Speaker 3>who gives his all for the sake of the </v>

958
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:36.001
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who offers up his life for the </v>

959
00:56:36.001 --> 00:56:38.131
<v Speaker 3>advancement of being who allows God's </v>
<v Speaker 3>will to become manifest fully within the</v>

960
00:56:38.231 --> 00:56:40.420
<v Speaker 3>confines of a single mortal life.</v>

961
00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:44.710
<v Speaker 3>That is the model for the honorable man </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Christ case.</v>

962
00:56:44.711 --> 00:56:47.320
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as he sacrifices himself,</v>

963
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:50.860
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his father is simultaneously sacrificing</v>

964
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:55.980
<v Speaker 3>his son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's for this reason that the Christian </v>

965
00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.540
<v Speaker 3>sacrificial drama of Sun and self is </v>
<v Speaker 3>archetipal.</v>

966
00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:02.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a story at the limit where nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>more extreme,</v>

967
00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:07.410
<v Speaker 3>nothing greater can be imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the very definition of </v>

968
00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:10.681
<v Speaker 3>archetypical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the core of what constitutes </v>

969
00:57:10.681 --> 00:57:13.381
<v Speaker 3>religious pain and suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Define the world of that.</v>

970
00:57:14.171 --> 00:57:19.171
<v Speaker 3>There can be no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sacrifice can hold pain and suffering in</v>

971
00:57:20.201 --> 00:57:25.201
<v Speaker 3>a balance to a greater or lesser degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and greater sacrifices can do that more </v>

972
00:57:26.321 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 3>effectively than lesser of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There can be no doubt.</v>

973
00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Everyone holds this knowledge in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>soul,</v>

974
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:38.380
<v Speaker 3>thus the person who wishes to alleviate </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering,</v>

975
00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:43.930
<v Speaker 3>who wishes to rectify the flaws and </v>
<v Speaker 3>being who wishes to bring about the best</v>

976
00:57:43.931 --> 00:57:48.310
<v Speaker 3>of all possible futures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who wants to create heaven on earth will</v>

977
00:57:48.311 --> 00:57:53.311
<v Speaker 3>make the greatest of sacrifices of self </v>
<v Speaker 3>and child of everything that is loved to</v>

978
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:59.020
<v Speaker 3>live a life aimed at the good he will </v>
<v Speaker 3>forego expediency.</v>

979
00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:04.830
<v Speaker 3>He will pursue the path of ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning and he will in that manner bring</v>

980
00:58:06.291 --> 00:58:09.280
<v Speaker 3>salvation to the ever desperate world.</v>

981
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

982
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:33.960
<v Speaker 3>On the third day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the </v>

983
00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:33.960
<v Speaker 3>place far off.</v>

984
00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:38.770
<v Speaker 3>It's not an accident also did in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain,</v>

985
00:58:38.771 --> 00:58:41.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because a mountain is something you have</v>

986
00:58:41.081 --> 00:58:46.081
<v Speaker 3>to climb and you have to climb to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pinnacle of a mountain and the mountain </v>

987
00:58:46.081 --> 00:58:46.081
<v Speaker 3>is operate in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mountain,</v>

988
00:58:46.081 --> 00:58:50.971
<v Speaker 3>stretches up to heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a long journey to specify the </v>

989
00:58:50.971 --> 00:58:54.451
<v Speaker 3>right place on the highest pinnacle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's symbolic because of course </v>

990
00:58:54.761 --> 00:58:57.250
<v Speaker 3>it's a pinnacle that you're always </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to reach.</v>

991
00:58:57.251 --> 00:59:00.280
<v Speaker 3>Just like you're always trying to aim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always trying to climb upward.</v>

992
00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:03.730
<v Speaker 3>At least that's the theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depends to some degree of course on your</v>

993
00:59:03.731 --> 00:59:08.110
<v Speaker 3>definition of upward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Abraham said to his young men,</v>

994
00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:13.140
<v Speaker 3>abide he here with us and I and the lad </v>
<v Speaker 3>will go yonder and worship and come to </v>

995
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:17.491
<v Speaker 3>you again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Abraham took the wood of the burnt </v>

996
00:59:17.491 --> 00:59:19.540
<v Speaker 3>offering and laid it upon Isaac,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his son,</v>

997
00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:25.050
<v Speaker 3>and he took the fire in hand and a knife</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they went both of them together and </v>

998
00:59:29.551 --> 00:59:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

999
00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.070
<v Speaker 3>my father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1000
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:39.310
<v Speaker 3>here are my my son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1001
00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:44.970
<v Speaker 3>behold the fire in the wood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but where is the lamb for a burnt </v>

1002
00:59:45.791 --> 00:59:49.550
<v Speaker 3>offering?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Abraham said,</v>

1003
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:54.640
<v Speaker 3>my son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God will provide himself a lamb for a </v>

1004
00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.970
<v Speaker 3>burnt offering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they went both of them together</v>

1005
00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.770
<v Speaker 3>and they came to the place which God had</v>
<v Speaker 3>told him of,</v>

1006
00:59:59.771 --> 01:00:04.771
<v Speaker 3>and Abraham built an altar there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>laid the wood in order and bound Isaac </v>

1007
01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:07.690
<v Speaker 3>his son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and laid him on the alter upon the wood.</v>

1008
01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:14.850
<v Speaker 3>And Abraham stretched forth his hand and</v>
<v Speaker 3>took the knife to slay his son.</v>

1009
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:24.640
<v Speaker 3>And the angel of the Lord called unto </v>
<v Speaker 3>him out of Heaven and said Abraham.</v>

1010
01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:27.310
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here am I.</v>

1011
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:31.090
<v Speaker 3>and the Angel said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lay not dine.</v>

1012
01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Hand upon the lad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neither do thou anything unto him.</v>

1013
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:35.960
<v Speaker 3>For now I know that Thou [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

1014
01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:40.160
<v Speaker 3>Seeing thou has not withheld thy son an </v>
<v Speaker 3>only son from me.</v>

1015
01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.800
<v Speaker 3>When I was answering the questions last </v>
<v Speaker 3>night at this q and a,</v>

1016
01:00:52.801 --> 01:00:57.801
<v Speaker 3>this guy asked me this question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that he had parents who were </v>

1017
01:00:57.801 --> 01:01:01.730
<v Speaker 3>desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti social alcoholic addicted </v>

1018
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:06.140
<v Speaker 3>friendless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that they didn't want him to leave </v>

1019
01:01:06.821 --> 01:01:11.821
<v Speaker 3>their home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the only relationship they had </v>

1020
01:01:11.821 --> 01:01:15.240
<v Speaker 3>that that was up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the only relationship they had </v>

1021
01:01:16.751 --> 01:01:21.751
<v Speaker 3>and he asked what he should do and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>told him that he should leave,</v>

1022
01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.320
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that is that you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a moral obligation as a parent too.</v>

1023
01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.390
<v Speaker 3>Encourage your child to go out into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

1024
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:41.630
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to be whoever they can be to be the </v>

1025
01:01:41.821 --> 01:01:46.570
<v Speaker 3>best they can possibly be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in doing that you're offering,</v>

1026
01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:50.830
<v Speaker 3>you're encouraging them to pursue the </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1027
01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:56.040
<v Speaker 3>You're sacrificing them to the good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not keeping them for yourself </v>

1028
01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:59.740
<v Speaker 3>selfishly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're telling them that they can go out</v>

1029
01:01:59.741 --> 01:02:01.780
<v Speaker 3>and live their life and live it </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

1030
01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.960
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the parallel to the idea of </v>

1031
01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:13.890
<v Speaker 3>the sacrifice of Isaac as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you don't want for your son what it</v>

1032
01:02:18.041 --> 01:02:19.440
<v Speaker 3>is that you want him,</v>

1033
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:25.610
<v Speaker 5>you want for your son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would be best for him and for the </v>

1034
01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:30.651
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you let go in precise proportion to </v>

1035
01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:34.920
<v Speaker 5>your desire to have that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know the psychoanalysts,</v>

1036
01:02:34.921 --> 01:02:37.040
<v Speaker 5>the great psychoanalyst,</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychoanalyst,</v>

1037
01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.900
<v Speaker 5>I think this is actually Freud's dictum,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not certain of that.</v>

1038
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:45.230
<v Speaker 5>He said the good mother fails,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a bit of brilliant observation </v>

1039
01:02:45.331 --> 01:02:50.331
<v Speaker 5>because when you have an infant do you </v>
<v Speaker 5>do everything for the infant because the</v>

1040
01:02:51.151 --> 01:02:53.430
<v Speaker 5>infant can do nothing for him or </v>
<v Speaker 5>herself,</v>

1041
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:58.490
<v Speaker 5>but as the infant matures and this </v>
<v Speaker 5>increasingly capable of doing things for</v>

1042
01:02:59.461 --> 01:03:01.110
<v Speaker 5>him or herself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you pull back,</v>

1043
01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:06.111
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You pull back and every time the child </v>

1044
01:03:06.111 --> 01:03:09.290
<v Speaker 5>develops the ability to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you allow them or encourage them to do </v>

1045
01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:10.290
<v Speaker 5>it and you don't interfere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1046
01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.240
<v Speaker 5>So if your child is struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting dressed,</v>

1047
01:03:12.241 --> 01:03:14.580
<v Speaker 5>well obviously there's some times that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you helped them,</v>

1048
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:19.581
<v Speaker 5>but mostly you let them learn so that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they can know how to do it in the </v>

1049
01:03:19.581 --> 01:03:19.680
<v Speaker 5>future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's better for you.</v>

1050
01:03:19.681 --> 01:03:24.681
<v Speaker 5>And it's certainly better for them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a rule if you're working with </v>

1051
01:03:24.681 --> 01:03:25.470
<v Speaker 5>the elderly and an old age home and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rule is something like,</v>

1052
01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:27.810
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't do anything for any of the.</v>

1053
01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:34.300
<v Speaker 5>For any of the guests,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say that they can do for </v>

1054
01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.930
<v Speaker 5>themselves because you compromise their </v>
<v Speaker 5>independence.</v>

1055
01:03:35.931 --> 01:03:40.931
<v Speaker 5>And so as a mother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you pull back and you pull back and you </v>

1056
01:03:40.931 --> 01:03:43.811
<v Speaker 5>let your child hit him or herself </v>
<v Speaker 5>against the world and you fail to </v>

1057
01:03:43.811 --> 01:03:46.130
<v Speaker 5>protect them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but by failing to protect them,</v>

1058
01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:51.160
<v Speaker 5>you encourage and enable them to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>point where you're no longer necessary.</v>

1059
01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:57.850
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they may still want to see you and it </v>

1060
01:03:57.850 --> 01:03:57.920
<v Speaker 5>would be wonderful if that was the case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the point is is that you're supposed</v>

1061
01:03:57.921 --> 01:04:02.921
<v Speaker 5>to remove yourself from the equation by </v>
<v Speaker 5>encouraging your child to be the best </v>

1062
01:04:03.471 --> 01:04:08.471
<v Speaker 5>possible person that person can be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you sacrifice your desires,</v>

1063
01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.370
<v Speaker 5>all of your desires to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your personal desires,</v>

1064
01:04:13.371 --> 01:04:18.371
<v Speaker 5>even your desires for your child in </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship to you because you want </v>

1065
01:04:18.371 --> 01:04:19.940
<v Speaker 5>them to move forward into the world as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>light,</v>

1066
01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:21.650
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>As a light on a hill.</v>

1067
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:23.930
<v Speaker 5>That's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have any sense,</v>

1068
01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:28.310
<v Speaker 5>and so you don't get to keep your </v>
<v Speaker 5>children at home because you need them.</v>

1069
01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:33.610
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm talking generally obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there are circumstances under which </v>

1070
01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:35.510
<v Speaker 5>families make their own idiosyncratic </v>
<v Speaker 5>decisions.</v>

1071
01:04:35.511 --> 01:04:40.340
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not trying to damn everyone with</v>
<v Speaker 5>a with a casual gesture,</v>

1072
01:04:40.341 --> 01:04:42.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the point is still strong that</v>

1073
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:50.630
<v Speaker 5>the good father is precisely someone who</v>
<v Speaker 5>is willing to sacrifice this child to </v>

1074
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:54.050
<v Speaker 5>the ultimate good that's dramatized in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this store,</v>

1075
01:04:54.051 --> 01:04:55.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's brutal,</v>

1076
01:04:56.630 --> 01:05:01.630
<v Speaker 5>but the world is a brutal place and much</v>
<v Speaker 5>wisdom comes out of catastrophe and this</v>

1077
01:05:04.891 --> 01:05:09.870
<v Speaker 5>is an indication of how much catastrophe</v>
<v Speaker 5>our ancestors had to plow through,</v>

1078
01:05:09.871 --> 01:05:14.871
<v Speaker 5>had to work through in order to generate</v>
<v Speaker 5>the substructure for the conceptions of </v>

1079
01:05:14.871 --> 01:05:16.770
<v Speaker 5>freedom even that we have today for </v>
<v Speaker 5>freedom and the.</v>

1080
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:20.320
<v Speaker 5>And that's how the story appears to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

1081
01:05:20.321 --> 01:05:23.290
<v Speaker 5>I think there's more to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if there has to be more to it,</v>

1082
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:28.210
<v Speaker 5>it lays the groundwork,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least in the Christian context,</v>

1083
01:05:28.211 --> 01:05:32.710
<v Speaker 5>for the eventual emergence of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As I alluded to in my reading.</v>

1084
01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:38.730
<v Speaker 5>That story obviously has to be unpacked </v>
<v Speaker 5>and unpacked and unpacked just like it </v>

1085
01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:41.260
<v Speaker 5>has been for the last 2000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also an indication here of,</v>

1086
01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:50.820
<v Speaker 5>well I would say the transmutation of </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice into an increasingly </v>

1087
01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:54.091
<v Speaker 5>psychological forum,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a development that we've </v>

1088
01:05:54.091 --> 01:05:54.091
<v Speaker 5>tracked all the way through the Old </v>
<v Speaker 5>Testament,</v>

1089
01:05:54.091 --> 01:05:57.500
<v Speaker 5>up to this particular point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First act it out,</v>

1090
01:05:58.190 --> 01:06:01.370
<v Speaker 5>then represented in ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those would be the rituals of sacrifice.</v>

1091
01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:06.790
<v Speaker 5>Then laid out in story then turned into </v>
<v Speaker 5>a psychological phenomena so that now </v>

1092
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:10.850
<v Speaker 5>we're capable of making sacrifices in </v>
<v Speaker 5>abstraction,</v>

1093
01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:15.880
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to conceptualize a future that we want </v>

1094
01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.170
<v Speaker 5>to let go of the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>stopping us from moving forward and to </v>

1095
01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:24.101
<v Speaker 5>free ourselves from the chains of our </v>
<v Speaker 5>original preconceptions and that's laid </v>

1096
01:06:24.101 --> 01:06:28.280
<v Speaker 5>out in these old stories as the optimal </v>
<v Speaker 5>pathway of being</v>

1097
01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:32.150
<v Speaker 5>and there's a philosopher of science </v>
<v Speaker 5>named Karl Popper,</v>

1098
01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:37.660
<v Speaker 5>very sensible and down to earth person </v>
<v Speaker 5>who was talking about thinking and it's </v>

1099
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:41.891
<v Speaker 5>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was thought about thinking in a </v>

1100
01:06:41.891 --> 01:06:41.891
<v Speaker 5>Darwinian fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

1101
01:06:41.891 --> 01:06:45.701
<v Speaker 5>the purpose of thinking is too late.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your thoughts die instead of you so </v>

1102
01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:48.380
<v Speaker 5>brilliant notion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so the idea is something like that.</v>

1103
01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:53.180
<v Speaker 5>You can conjure up a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>

1104
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:58.210
<v Speaker 5>You can conjure up a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 5>potential representations of yourself </v>

1105
01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:01.721
<v Speaker 5>into the in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can lay out how those future </v>

1106
01:07:01.721 --> 01:07:04.310
<v Speaker 5>representations of yourself are likely </v>
<v Speaker 5>to prevail or fail.</v>

1107
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:09.430
<v Speaker 5>You can call the potential use in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>future that will fail and then you can </v>

1108
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:14.171
<v Speaker 5>embody the ones that will succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do that well simultaneously </v>

1109
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:20.470
<v Speaker 5>conjuring up a representation of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>current state and determining for </v>

1110
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:24.371
<v Speaker 5>yourself because of your undo suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which elements of your pathetic being </v>

1111
01:07:24.861 --> 01:07:29.861
<v Speaker 5>needed to be given up so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>move forward into that future and the </v>

1112
01:07:29.861 --> 01:07:34.091
<v Speaker 5>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it that you're aiming at with </v>

1113
01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:34.700
<v Speaker 5>that work and that sacrifice?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the ultimate question.</v>

1114
01:07:34.701 --> 01:07:36.800
<v Speaker 5>It's the question I was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>address in that writing.</v>

1115
01:07:36.801 --> 01:07:41.801
<v Speaker 5>What is it that you're trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you're trying to improve the </v>

1116
01:07:41.801 --> 01:07:41.801
<v Speaker 5>future?</v>

1117
01:07:41.801 --> 01:07:42.800
<v Speaker 5>We believe that the future can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>improved.</v>

1118
01:07:42.801 --> 01:07:46.640
<v Speaker 5>We believed that it can be improved as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>consequence of our sacrificial work,</v>

1119
01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.220
<v Speaker 5>and so once again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the limitations?</v>

1120
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:51.710
<v Speaker 5>What are the limits to that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are the necessary limits to that?</v>

1121
01:07:51.711 --> 01:07:54.680
<v Speaker 5>I would say we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say as well that that's actually</v>

1122
01:07:54.681 --> 01:07:59.681
<v Speaker 5>something that the entire Corpus of </v>
<v Speaker 5>biblical stories is trying desperately </v>

1123
01:07:59.681 --> 01:08:01.430
<v Speaker 5>to articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to figure out and articulate,</v>

1124
01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:02.450
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

1125
01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:03.200
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1126
01:08:03.350 --> 01:08:06.980
<v Speaker 5>we conjured up this remarkable idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The future exists.</v>

1127
01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.350
<v Speaker 5>We can see it even though it's only </v>
<v Speaker 5>potential.</v>

1128
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:14.470
<v Speaker 5>We can adjust our behavior in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>present in order to maximize our </v>

1129
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:17.060
<v Speaker 5>probability of success in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How best to do that?</v>

1130
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:19.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea is something like,</v>

1131
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:25.950
<v Speaker 5>don't hesitate to offer the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice if you want the future to turn</v>

1132
01:08:28.731 --> 01:08:33.731
<v Speaker 5>out ultimately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well now obviously that idea is clothed </v>

1133
01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:38.030
<v Speaker 5>in metaphysical speculation and </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious imagery,</v>

1134
01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:41.150
<v Speaker 5>but it still remains an intensely </v>
<v Speaker 5>practical issue,</v>

1135
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:46.570
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it that you could contract for?</v>

1136
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:55.070
<v Speaker 5>Let's say if you were willing to give up</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything about you that's weak and </v>

1137
01:08:55.321 --> 01:09:00.321
<v Speaker 5>unworthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

1138
01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:11.460
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a continual hints of that in the</v>

1139
01:09:11.461 --> 01:09:12.420
<v Speaker 5>Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1140
01:09:12.421 --> 01:09:14.760
<v Speaker 5>Because what happens with no of course </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that</v>

1141
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:20.110
<v Speaker 5>he establishes the proper covenant with </v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1142
01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.170
<v Speaker 5>the proper contract with being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

1143
01:09:23.171 --> 01:09:26.710
<v Speaker 5>and thrives as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then Abraham does the same thing.</v>

1144
01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:31.030
<v Speaker 5>There's a strong intimation that that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>how the world is set right now.</v>

1145
01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:36.120
<v Speaker 5>That idea develops and magnifies as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories progress into something like </v>

1146
01:09:39.310 --> 01:09:41.890
<v Speaker 5>into something like the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 5>heaven on earth.</v>

1147
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:48.990
<v Speaker 5>The notion being that the proper </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrificial additude produces a </v>

1148
01:09:51.281 --> 01:09:55.390
<v Speaker 5>psychological state and then the social </v>
<v Speaker 5>state.</v>

1149
01:09:55.420 --> 01:10:00.420
<v Speaker 5>That's a manifestation of that attitude </v>
<v Speaker 5>that decreases the probability that the </v>

1150
01:10:01.481 --> 01:10:06.481
<v Speaker 5>world will careen into hell and </v>
<v Speaker 5>increases the probability that people </v>

1151
01:10:06.641 --> 01:10:11.641
<v Speaker 5>will live high quality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaningful private lives in a society </v>

1152
01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:17.341
<v Speaker 5>that's balanced and capable of </v>
<v Speaker 5>supporting that and none of that seems </v>

1153
01:10:17.341 --> 01:10:17.590
<v Speaker 5>to me to be</v>

1154
01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:21.810
<v Speaker 5>questionable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

1155
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:26.070
<v Speaker 5>I also don't think it's anything that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't actually know.</v>

1156
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:30.540
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people have told me many times that when</v>

1157
01:10:30.541 --> 01:10:34.140
<v Speaker 5>they listened to me talk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're hearing things that they already</v>

1158
01:10:34.141 --> 01:10:36.240
<v Speaker 5>know knew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but didn't know how to say.</v>

1159
01:10:36.241 --> 01:10:41.241
<v Speaker 5>It's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is one of those things that I </v>

1160
01:10:41.241 --> 01:10:41.241
<v Speaker 5>think is exactly like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1161
01:10:41.241 --> 01:10:45.890
<v Speaker 5>I think it's at the very core of our </v>
<v Speaker 5>moral knowledge and which is our </v>

1162
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900
<v Speaker 5>behavioral knowledge and our perceptual </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowledge.</v>

1163
01:10:45.901 --> 01:10:47.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's get this straight.</v>

1164
01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:52.250
<v Speaker 5>Moral knowledge is no trivial matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's knowledge about how it is that you </v>

1165
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:55.371
<v Speaker 5>orient yourself in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no more profoundly necessary </v>

1166
01:10:55.371 --> 01:10:55.371
<v Speaker 5>form of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1167
01:10:55.371 --> 01:10:57.900
<v Speaker 5>it's predicated on on something that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly like this.</v>

1168
01:10:58.110 --> 01:11:03.110
<v Speaker 5>We know that we have to make sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know that we have to aim at what's </v>

1169
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:06.351
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so then why isn't that we don't aim at </v>

1170
01:11:06.351 --> 01:11:08.841
<v Speaker 5>what's best and make the sacrifices that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are necessary in order to bring that </v>

1171
01:11:08.841 --> 01:11:12.321
<v Speaker 5>into play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it seems to me that in some </v>

1172
01:11:12.321 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 5>sense that's self.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question</v>

1173
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:19.040
<v Speaker 3>is why we don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's answers to that to already </v>

1174
01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.310
<v Speaker 3>in the material that we've covered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life is hard and it hurts people.</v>

1175
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:25.870
<v Speaker 3>It's rife with limitation and some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's arbitrary and it's no wonder and </v>

1176
01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.350
<v Speaker 3>some of it's unjust and some of its </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst.</v>

1177
01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:33.351
<v Speaker 3>Some of it's malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is even worse than something I </v>

1178
01:11:33.351 --> 01:11:33.351
<v Speaker 3>haven't talked about at all in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>lecture.</v>

1179
01:11:33.351 --> 01:11:38.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not surprising that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>combination of vicissitude can turn </v>

1180
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:41.271
<v Speaker 3>people against being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think even when that happens and </v>

1181
01:11:41.271 --> 01:11:44.481
<v Speaker 3>even when people have the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>history that if they revealed to you,</v>

1182
01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:47.070
<v Speaker 3>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1183
01:11:47.071 --> 01:11:52.071
<v Speaker 3>it's no wonder you turned out that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people who turn out that way still </v>

1184
01:11:52.171 --> 01:11:57.171
<v Speaker 3>know that it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still know that however deep their </v>

1185
01:11:57.171 --> 01:11:57.930
<v Speaker 3>own suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however arbitrary their own suffering,</v>

1186
01:11:58.170 --> 01:12:01.200
<v Speaker 3>however much that's caused by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence of others,</v>

1187
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:06.320
<v Speaker 3>as well as the tragedy of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that does not in any way justify </v>

1188
01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.241
<v Speaker 3>they're turning away from the good and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe everyone knows that I believe </v>

1189
01:12:12.811 --> 01:12:17.811
<v Speaker 3>that they know it implicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they don't allow themselves to </v>

1190
01:12:17.811 --> 01:12:20.790
<v Speaker 3>know what explicitly and I believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>if they violate that idea,</v>

1191
01:12:20.791 --> 01:12:24.480
<v Speaker 3>then they violate themselves and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they end up in cains position,</v>

1192
01:12:24.481 --> 01:12:29.481
<v Speaker 3>which is the position of the man who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been given a punishment that is too </v>

1193
01:12:29.481 --> 01:12:29.481
<v Speaker 3>great to bear,</v>

1194
01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.680
<v Speaker 3>and the angel said,</v>

1195
01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:39.400
<v Speaker 4>thank you</v>

1196
01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:41.750
<v Speaker 3>les,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not dying.</v>

1197
01:12:41.751 --> 01:12:44.810
<v Speaker 3>Hand upon the loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neither do without anything unto him.</v>

1198
01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:50.650
<v Speaker 3>For now I know that Thou [inaudible] God</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing thou has not withheld thy son.</v>

1199
01:12:53.341 --> 01:12:58.341
<v Speaker 3>They only son from me and Abraham lifted</v>
<v Speaker 3>up his eyes and looked and behold behind</v>

1200
01:13:01.111 --> 01:13:06.111
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ram caught in the thicket body has </v>

1201
01:13:06.111 --> 01:13:08.661
<v Speaker 3>thorns by his horns and Abraham went and</v>
<v Speaker 3>took the ram and offered him up for a </v>

1202
01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:14.601
<v Speaker 3>burnt offering instead of his son and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham called the name of that place.</v>

1203
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Jehovah Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As it is said to this day in the mount </v>

1204
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:27.751
<v Speaker 3>of the Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shall be seat and the angel of the </v>

1205
01:13:28.401 --> 01:13:33.401
<v Speaker 3>Lord called Unto Abraham Out of heaven </v>
<v Speaker 3>the second time and said by myself,</v>

1206
01:13:34.551 --> 01:13:38.510
<v Speaker 3>have I sworn Sayeth the Lord for because</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thou hast done this thing and it has not</v>

1207
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:43.810
<v Speaker 3>withheld thy son die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And only son that in blessing I will </v>

1208
01:13:43.941 --> 01:13:48.941
<v Speaker 3>bless thee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in multiplying I will multiply thy </v>

1209
01:13:48.941 --> 01:13:53.081
<v Speaker 3>seed as the stars of the heaven and as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sand which is upon the seashore and </v>

1210
01:13:53.081 --> 01:13:55.730
<v Speaker 3>thy seed shall possess the gates of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>gate of his enemies.</v>

1211
01:13:56.750 --> 01:14:01.750
<v Speaker 3>And in thy seed shall all the nations of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Earth be blessed because thou hast </v>

1212
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:03.140
<v Speaker 3>obeyed my voice.</v>

1213
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:12.110
<v Speaker 4>So Abraham</v>

1214
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:15.560
<v Speaker 3>returned unto his young men and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>rose up and went together to Beersheba.</v>

1215
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:20.830
<v Speaker 3>And Abraham dwelled had Beersheba and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>came to pass after these things that it </v>

1216
01:14:22.051 --> 01:14:25.530
<v Speaker 3>was told Abraham saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>behold,</v>

1217
01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.920
<v Speaker 3>milka she has also born children unto </v>
<v Speaker 3>thy brother [inaudible] whore.</v>

1218
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:35.750
<v Speaker 3>And Sarah was 107 and 20 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those were the years of the life of </v>

1219
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Sarah and Sarah died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>encourage,</v>

1220
01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:42.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same as Hebrew in the land of </v>

1221
01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:45.381
<v Speaker 3>Canaan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and </v>

1222
01:14:45.381 --> 01:14:49.591
<v Speaker 3>to weep for her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1223
01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:25.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't exactly know what to do now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that.</v>

1224
01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.710
<v Speaker 3>I'll review what we've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we've covered,</v>

1225
01:15:47.090 --> 01:15:52.090
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll bring this to a close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can have some more questions than </v>

1226
01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:55.601
<v Speaker 3>would be usual tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what have we established by this </v>

1227
01:15:58.701 --> 01:16:03.701
<v Speaker 3>point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stories that have been revealed so </v>

1228
01:16:04.771 --> 01:16:09.771
<v Speaker 3>far or something like that contain the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that there's something divine </v>

1229
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:21.470
<v Speaker 3>that's a now I guess to the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>capacity for communication and </v>

1230
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:23.600
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's APP the,</v>

1231
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:26.810
<v Speaker 3>that operates at the genesis of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

1232
01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:31.730
<v Speaker 3>That's the initial account in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 3>Testament.</v>

1233
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:38.890
<v Speaker 3>It's an account that places the role of </v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit centrally in the,</v>

1234
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:45.550
<v Speaker 3>in the nature of being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not exactly sure what to make of </v>

1235
01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:50.171
<v Speaker 3>that because in some ways I miss </v>
<v Speaker 3>materialistically oriented as modern </v>

1236
01:16:50.691 --> 01:16:55.691
<v Speaker 3>people typically are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the stories make sense to me in many</v>

1237
01:16:55.851 --> 01:17:00.851
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that there's something world </v>

1238
01:17:01.401 --> 01:17:06.401
<v Speaker 3>creating about human consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's a canned in some sense to </v>

1239
01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 3>the divine force that called order out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of</v>

1240
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.040
<v Speaker 5>chaos at the beginning of time seems to </v>
<v Speaker 5>me to be a very powerful metaphysical </v>

1241
01:17:15.111 --> 01:17:20.111
<v Speaker 5>idea and it also seems to me to be an </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea that is immovable.</v>

1242
01:17:20.171 --> 01:17:25.171
<v Speaker 5>He out the foundation of Western culture</v>
<v Speaker 5>because our entire legal system,</v>

1243
01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:28.820
<v Speaker 5>our society,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our expect,</v>

1244
01:17:28.821 --> 01:17:33.530
<v Speaker 5>mutual expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of that are conditioned to the final</v>

1245
01:17:33.531 --> 01:17:38.531
<v Speaker 5>degree by our presupposition that each </v>
<v Speaker 5>of us has an intrinsic value that </v>

1246
01:17:40.881 --> 01:17:45.881
<v Speaker 5>transcends the local conditions of our </v>
<v Speaker 5>being and it's with that presupposition </v>

1247
01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:52.871
<v Speaker 5>that we've been able to establish the </v>
<v Speaker 5>society that functions as a society that</v>

1248
01:17:53.271 --> 01:17:58.271
<v Speaker 5>functions and functions well and it has </v>
<v Speaker 5>its current characterization and that's </v>

1249
01:17:58.581 --> 01:18:03.581
<v Speaker 5>a non.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an unlikely occurrence and it's a </v>

1250
01:18:03.581 --> 01:18:06.470
<v Speaker 5>nontrivial reality and I don't see any </v>
<v Speaker 5>way out of that.</v>

1251
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:13.560
<v Speaker 5>We out of that conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't see anything that that can </v>

1252
01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:16.831
<v Speaker 5>easily be replaced with and so god calls</v>
<v Speaker 5>being into order,</v>

1253
01:18:19.411 --> 01:18:24.411
<v Speaker 5>into being out of chaos at the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 5>of time and attributes to human beings </v>

1254
01:18:24.411 --> 01:18:28.571
<v Speaker 5>the same essential capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we turn to Adam and eve in the </v>

1255
01:18:28.571 --> 01:18:29.510
<v Speaker 5>garden and they're unconscious by all </v>
<v Speaker 5>appearances,</v>

1256
01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:34.640
<v Speaker 5>allied tightly with God but unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't seem aware of the future.</v>

1257
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:39.700
<v Speaker 5>They don't seem aware of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't seem aware of their own </v>

1258
01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:39.700
<v Speaker 5>vulnerability.</v>

1259
01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.920
<v Speaker 5>They make the fatal error of having </v>
<v Speaker 5>their eyes open.</v>

1260
01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:49.250
<v Speaker 5>They discover their own vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They also discovered their capacity for </v>

1261
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:51.000
<v Speaker 5>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We reviewed that to some degree.</v>

1262
01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.080
<v Speaker 5>What's the association?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's the tree of the knowledge </v>

1263
01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.040
<v Speaker 5>of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fruit of which they eat.</v>

1264
01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.760
<v Speaker 5>What's the association between the </v>
<v Speaker 5>discovery of vulnerability and the </v>

1265
01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:08.181
<v Speaker 5>emergence of moral knowledge?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something like as far as I can </v>

1266
01:19:08.181 --> 01:19:11.991
<v Speaker 5>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you actually don't know how to be </v>

1267
01:19:11.991 --> 01:19:14.721
<v Speaker 5>evil or to be good until you're actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>aware of consciously have your own </v>

1268
01:19:14.721 --> 01:19:18.741
<v Speaker 5>vulnerability because the essence of </v>
<v Speaker 5>evil is the exploitation of </v>

1269
01:19:18.741 --> 01:19:22.671
<v Speaker 5>vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps for the sake of that </v>

1270
01:19:22.671 --> 01:19:25.671
<v Speaker 5>exploitation and I can't understand how </v>
<v Speaker 5>to hurt someone until I know exactly how</v>

1271
01:19:27.181 --> 01:19:32.181
<v Speaker 5>I can be hurt myself and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand how I can be hurt myself </v>

1272
01:19:32.190 --> 01:19:35.220
<v Speaker 5>until I become cognizant of my mortal </v>
<v Speaker 5>limitations too,</v>

1273
01:19:35.221 --> 01:19:40.221
<v Speaker 5>until I understand what brings me pain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>until I understand the suffering that </v>

1274
01:19:40.221 --> 01:19:41.910
<v Speaker 5>goes along with my mortal limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

1275
01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:46.710
<v Speaker 5>my inevitable death and the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 5>that goes along with that and with the,</v>

1276
01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:52.140
<v Speaker 5>with the accrual of the knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 5>mortality and good and evil.</v>

1277
01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:57.260
<v Speaker 5>Adam and Eve were cast out of paradise </v>
<v Speaker 5>and history begins and that seems right </v>

1278
01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.460
<v Speaker 5>to me because I don't think that history</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't begin before.</v>

1279
01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:03.090
<v Speaker 5>Human beings became self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's something about that.</v>

1280
01:20:03.091 --> 01:20:08.091
<v Speaker 5>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because history doesn't really begin </v>

1281
01:20:08.091 --> 01:20:10.191
<v Speaker 5>until people become aware of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pe history doesn't really begin until </v>

1282
01:20:10.191 --> 01:20:11.130
<v Speaker 5>people work and start to build,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1283
01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:16.131
<v Speaker 5>We still live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We would still be ensconced in </v>

1284
01:20:16.131 --> 01:20:19.101
<v Speaker 5>essentially an animal existence until </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're aware of the future and start to </v>

1285
01:20:19.101 --> 01:20:21.300
<v Speaker 5>buttress herself against it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Start to wear clothing,</v>

1286
01:20:21.301 --> 01:20:26.301
<v Speaker 5>start to build buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>start to make cities all in all in </v>

1287
01:20:26.301 --> 01:20:29.460
<v Speaker 5>consequence of having become aware of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact that we're fragile and that the</v>

1288
01:20:29.461 --> 01:20:34.461
<v Speaker 5>future is a dangerous place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that seems to me to be existentially </v>

1289
01:20:34.461 --> 01:20:38.001
<v Speaker 5>correct and then we have the story of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cain and Abel Brilliantly placed </v>

1290
01:20:38.001 --> 01:20:41.901
<v Speaker 5>immediately afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so those are the two first two </v>

1291
01:20:41.901 --> 01:20:43.920
<v Speaker 5>people in history essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they make sacrifices,</v>

1292
01:20:43.921 --> 01:20:46.410
<v Speaker 5>so that goes along with the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>discovery work,</v>

1293
01:20:46.411 --> 01:20:48.600
<v Speaker 5>the necessity of work and the discovery </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the future,</v>

1294
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:51.870
<v Speaker 5>and then exactly what you'd expect would</v>
<v Speaker 5>happen.</v>

1295
01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:53.740
<v Speaker 4>One</v>

1296
01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:59.480
<v Speaker 5>segment of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say makes the sacrifices properly </v>

1297
01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:03.321
<v Speaker 5>and prevails in the other segment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>makes the sacrifice is improperly and </v>

1298
01:21:03.321 --> 01:21:07.491
<v Speaker 5>fails,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's perfectly reasonable given </v>

1299
01:21:07.491 --> 01:21:08.550
<v Speaker 5>what you see around you because that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>what seems to happen all the time.</v>

1300
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:13.910
<v Speaker 5>And then more interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say the sacrificial failure </v>

1301
01:21:14.461 --> 01:21:19.461
<v Speaker 5>produces embitterment right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that embitterment produces a hatred </v>

1302
01:21:21.941 --> 01:21:26.941
<v Speaker 5>for being and the desire for revenge and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that seems perfectly appropriate.</v>

1303
01:21:27.370 --> 01:21:30.580
<v Speaker 5>When I look at people who are bitter and</v>
<v Speaker 5>who want revenge,</v>

1304
01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:34.030
<v Speaker 5>it's generally because they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrificial efforts have failed.</v>

1305
01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:37.780
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm loath to say that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>matter of their own doing,</v>

1306
01:21:37.781 --> 01:21:42.781
<v Speaker 5>although sometimes it clearly is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>embittered and vengeful complained to </v>

1307
01:21:47.311 --> 01:21:52.311
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Blame him for the structure of </v>

1308
01:21:52.311 --> 01:21:54.320
<v Speaker 5>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1309
01:21:54.321 --> 01:21:57.470
<v Speaker 5>I read about the columbine massacre and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the kids who</v>

1310
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:59.360
<v Speaker 4>undertook it.</v>

1311
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:05.910
<v Speaker 5>That'll make your hair stand on end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to read something that will </v>

1312
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:07.990
<v Speaker 5>really disturb you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a reading Eric Harris,</v>

1313
01:22:07.991 --> 01:22:12.991
<v Speaker 5>his writings will really disturb you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No matter how much you know about human </v>

1314
01:22:12.991 --> 01:22:15.060
<v Speaker 5>beings reading Eric Harris's writings </v>
<v Speaker 5>will disturb you,</v>

1315
01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:19.980
<v Speaker 5>and Harris has cane you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says it straightforwardly.</v>

1316
01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.580
<v Speaker 5>Hates human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hates being itself.</v>

1317
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.640
<v Speaker 5>He would destroy everything if it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>within his power to do that,</v>

1318
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:32.390
<v Speaker 5>and of course him and his colleague were</v>
<v Speaker 5>motivated to produce far more carnage </v>

1319
01:22:32.911 --> 01:22:37.911
<v Speaker 5>than they manage that day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was successful was only a fraction </v>

1320
01:22:37.911 --> 01:22:41.760
<v Speaker 5>of what they had planned and and Harris </v>
<v Speaker 5>said very straightforwardly that he was,</v>

1321
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:46.910
<v Speaker 5>that he had set himself up as the judge </v>
<v Speaker 5>of being in that it lacked all utility </v>

1322
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:49.530
<v Speaker 5>in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Human beings certainly should all be,</v>

1323
01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:54.950
<v Speaker 5>should all be removed from the face of </v>
<v Speaker 5>existence because of their pathology.</v>

1324
01:22:55.290 --> 01:22:59.070
<v Speaker 5>And the fundamental horrors of being </v>
<v Speaker 5>itself.</v>

1325
01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:02.610
<v Speaker 5>So there's nothing in the Cain and Abel </v>
<v Speaker 5>story that isn't real.</v>

1326
01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:07.670
<v Speaker 5>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And cain complaints to God as people </v>

1327
01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:10.351
<v Speaker 5>will when they're dreams are dashed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that goes for people who don't </v>

1328
01:23:10.351 --> 01:23:11.470
<v Speaker 5>believe in God too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't really matter.</v>

1329
01:23:11.471 --> 01:23:13.450
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's harder,</v>

1330
01:23:13.451 --> 01:23:15.940
<v Speaker 5>I suppose if you're atheistic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to figure out who to blame,</v>

1331
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.860
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't mean that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sentiment,</v>

1332
01:23:20.410 --> 01:23:22.660
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't mean that the sentiment is </v>
<v Speaker 5>any different,</v>

1333
01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.540
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The same drama is being enacted.</v>

1334
01:23:25.810 --> 01:23:29.590
<v Speaker 5>You shake your fist at the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 5>being rather than that God himself,</v>

1335
01:23:29.591 --> 01:23:32.830
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't make any difference </v>
<v Speaker 5>except in the details.</v>

1336
01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:41.880
<v Speaker 5>So God responds to Kate and tells him </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he's got no right to judge being </v>

1337
01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:44.380
<v Speaker 5>before he gets his sacrificial house in </v>
<v Speaker 5>order.</v>

1338
01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:49.980
<v Speaker 5>And even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says that Kane is the architect of </v>

1339
01:23:51.241 --> 01:23:56.241
<v Speaker 5>his own downfall and the invited </v>
<v Speaker 5>catastrophe in his own into his own </v>

1340
01:23:56.701 --> 01:24:01.701
<v Speaker 5>house willingly and entered into a </v>
<v Speaker 5>creative union with it and therefore </v>

1341
01:24:01.861 --> 01:24:06.861
<v Speaker 5>brought about his own demise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's that additional self knowledge </v>

1342
01:24:06.861 --> 01:24:07.080
<v Speaker 5>and you can imagine to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1343
01:24:07.081 --> 01:24:09.840
<v Speaker 5>imagine that you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're facing your life,</v>

1344
01:24:09.841 --> 01:24:14.841
<v Speaker 5>you're facing the failures of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and let's say that you've had a failed </v>

1345
01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:18.231
<v Speaker 5>life and you're bitter about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you meditate upon it and you </v>

1346
01:24:18.231 --> 01:24:20.130
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why has this come about?</v>

1347
01:24:20.131 --> 01:24:20.940
<v Speaker 5>And then you think,</v>

1348
01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.260
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps I did something wrong.</v>

1349
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:29.890
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote the </v>

1350
01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:31.811
<v Speaker 5>Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the book that detailed the </v>

1351
01:24:31.811 --> 01:24:34.160
<v Speaker 5>catastrophes of the Soviet Union and </v>
<v Speaker 5>help bring it down here,</v>

1352
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:37.190
<v Speaker 5>this one part of that book that just </v>
<v Speaker 5>struck me so,</v>

1353
01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.530
<v Speaker 5>so viciously when I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1354
01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:43.070
<v Speaker 5>he was in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the Gulag and he was there for a very</v>

1355
01:24:43.071 --> 01:24:48.071
<v Speaker 5>long time and he said that he observed a</v>
<v Speaker 5>variety of people in the camps who he </v>

1356
01:24:48.951 --> 01:24:50.720
<v Speaker 5>really admired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were rare.</v>

1357
01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:52.850
<v Speaker 5>They were usually religious believers in</v>
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>

1358
01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:58.240
<v Speaker 5>in his experience who were not </v>
<v Speaker 5>participating in the pathology of the </v>

1359
01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.290
<v Speaker 5>camps at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Period.</v>

1360
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:05.470
<v Speaker 5>No matter what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he learned a lot from watching those </v>

1361
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:08.501
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a hard time believing that they </v>

1362
01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:08.501
<v Speaker 5>even existed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they could even exist.</v>

1363
01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:12.340
<v Speaker 5>But he said that one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>he was brought to as a consequence of </v>

1364
01:25:12.351 --> 01:25:17.210
<v Speaker 5>watching those people live their </v>
<v Speaker 5>contract with goodness out,</v>

1365
01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.400
<v Speaker 5>even under the most horrifying of </v>
<v Speaker 5>conditions,</v>

1366
01:25:19.401 --> 01:25:24.401
<v Speaker 5>was that it was possible that he himself</v>
<v Speaker 5>was responsible for his position in the </v>

1367
01:25:26.811 --> 01:25:31.811
<v Speaker 5>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's a very dangerous line of </v>

1368
01:25:31.811 --> 01:25:34.631
<v Speaker 5>argumentation because who wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>the one who blames the victim for the </v>

1369
01:25:34.641 --> 01:25:35.780
<v Speaker 5>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1370
01:25:35.970 --> 01:25:38.600
<v Speaker 5>you have to be very careful when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>walk down that road.</v>

1371
01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:42.170
<v Speaker 5>But Solzhenitsyn was speaking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>himself and he said,</v>

1372
01:25:42.171 --> 01:25:43.430
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was a communist,</v>

1373
01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:48.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he arrogantly and forthrightly move </v>

1374
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:54.910
<v Speaker 5>the movement out into the world and had </v>
<v Speaker 5>not fully gone over his life with a fine</v>

1375
01:25:56.421 --> 01:26:01.310
<v Speaker 5>tooth comb to find out what mistakes he </v>
<v Speaker 5>had made that brought him so low.</v>

1376
01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 5>But his contention eventually that part</v>

1377
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:09.160
<v Speaker 2>of the reason that he ended up where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up was because he and many others </v>

1378
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:14.500
<v Speaker 2>had completely forfeited their </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the truth and it </v>

1379
01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:17.201
<v Speaker 2>allowed their society do degenerate into</v>
<v Speaker 2>deceit and tyrannical catastrophe </v>

1380
01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:22.780
<v Speaker 2>without mounting sufficient opposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he decided when he was in the </v>

1381
01:26:24.201 --> 01:26:28.460
<v Speaker 2>camps to straightened himself out bit by</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>

1382
01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:33.730
<v Speaker 2>and that culminated in the production of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Gulag archipelago and that book </v>

1383
01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:38.170
<v Speaker 2>really demolished once and for all any </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral credibility that the communist </v>

1384
01:26:38.661 --> 01:26:43.661
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian systems had left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one man in the depths of </v>

1385
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:47.030
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe who determined through good </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1386
01:26:47.031 --> 01:26:52.031
<v Speaker 2>at least in part to stop lying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>produced a book eventually the </v>

1387
01:26:52.031 --> 01:26:56.120
<v Speaker 2>demolished the foundation of the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that had imprisoned him.</v>

1388
01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.550
<v Speaker 2>And that is really worth thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1389
01:26:58.570 --> 01:27:03.570
<v Speaker 2>That's one example of the absolute </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandeur of the human soul and the </v>

1390
01:27:04.311 --> 01:27:09.290
<v Speaker 2>capacity for transformation that it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>when let loose properly on the world.</v>

1391
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:13.730
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you're conceptualizing your</v>
<v Speaker 2>own failure,</v>

1392
01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:18.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you meditated on it and you come to </v>

1393
01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:18.980
<v Speaker 2>the conclusion that God forced came to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1394
01:27:18.981 --> 01:27:21.950
<v Speaker 2>not only have things not been going very</v>
<v Speaker 2>well for you,</v>

1395
01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:25.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

1396
01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:27.860
<v Speaker 2>you brought it on yourself and not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1397
01:27:27.861 --> 01:27:31.580
<v Speaker 2>you knew it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then you might think you'll wake up</v>

1398
01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:32.450
<v Speaker 2>and fly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1399
01:27:32.451 --> 01:27:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll get your wings in order and fly,</v>

1400
01:27:34.041 --> 01:27:39.041
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no reason to assume that at </v>

1401
01:27:39.041 --> 01:27:40.040
<v Speaker 2>all and that's not what happens to Cain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just makes him more bitter.</v>

1402
01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can understand that if you think</v>

1403
01:27:42.141 --> 01:27:47.141
<v Speaker 2>about it just for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like bad enough when something </v>

1404
01:27:47.141 --> 01:27:49.631
<v Speaker 2>horrible happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then to have to swallow the </v>

1405
01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:52.181
<v Speaker 2>additional pill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right path to take in the information </v>

1406
01:27:52.181 --> 01:27:52.700
<v Speaker 2>that you could have done something </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1407
01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.170
<v Speaker 2>It was avoidable and you knew it at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and you decided to do it anyways.</v>

1408
01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.490
<v Speaker 2>And I think people are in that situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot more often than every.</v>

1409
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Anyone is willing to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1410
01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:07.400
<v Speaker 2>you have that little voice in the back </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your head that says don't do it.</v>

1411
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:13.870
<v Speaker 2>And you override it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's arrogance that makes you override </v>

1412
01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:14.000
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always arrogance.</v>

1413
01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:15.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it always warns you.</v>

1414
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:16.520
<v Speaker 2>It's always arrogance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1415
01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.170
<v Speaker 2>I can get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1416
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:19.370
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

1417
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:21.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you ever get away with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1418
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:24.590
<v Speaker 2>So in maybe your experience has taught </v>
<v Speaker 2>you different,</v>

1419
01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:26.240
<v Speaker 2>but my suspicions are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't.</v>

1420
01:28:26.241 --> 01:28:28.010
<v Speaker 2>And if you think it has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1421
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:33.250
<v Speaker 2>the other shoe hasn't yet dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So cane doesn't take the opportunity to </v>

1422
01:28:34.731 --> 01:28:39.731
<v Speaker 2>let God's wisdom reorient his character </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that could have been outcome.</v>

1423
01:28:41.630 --> 01:28:44.270
<v Speaker 2>He could have gone down on his knees so </v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak,</v>

1424
01:28:44.271 --> 01:28:44.900
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my,</v>

1425
01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been wrong all along.</v>

1426
01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I'd been living in properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd been making the wrong sacrifices,</v>

1427
01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:55.010
<v Speaker 2>able deserves everything he has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got exactly what was coming to me,</v>

1428
01:28:55.270 --> 01:29:00.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could I possibly now straighten myself </v>

1429
01:29:00.270 --> 01:29:00.270
<v Speaker 2>out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1430
01:29:00.270 --> 01:29:00.270
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1431
01:29:00.270 --> 01:29:04.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and live repentance and improve my </v>

1432
01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:04.540
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not what he did at all.</v>

1433
01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:05.280
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1434
01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:08.010
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1435
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:13.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm going to go after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing I most admire and I'm going to </v>

1436
01:29:13.810 --> 01:29:18.681
<v Speaker 2>destroy it and I'm going to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>despite its cost to me and I'm going to </v>

1437
01:29:18.681 --> 01:29:21.000
<v Speaker 2>do that just to spite the creator of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

1438
01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:25.770
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what Harris did at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbine.</v>

1439
01:29:25.771 --> 01:29:27.690
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1440
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:32.870
<v Speaker 2>in his uncanny writings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's why the mass murders always shoot </v>

1441
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:34.950
<v Speaker 2>themselves afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not before,</v>

1442
01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:40.250
<v Speaker 2>because you might wonder if you're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset with the structure of being why </v>

1443
01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:41.010
<v Speaker 2>you don't just commit suicide in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>

1444
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Why do you have to go out and mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>murder before you top it off with a gun </v>

1445
01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:47.220
<v Speaker 2>to your forehead?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1446
01:29:47.221 --> 01:29:52.221
<v Speaker 2>you don't make the point is effectively </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just commit suicide in your </v>

1447
01:29:52.221 --> 01:29:55.161
<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like live my life means nothing to </v>

1448
01:29:55.161 --> 01:29:59.031
<v Speaker 2>me but neither does anyone else's and </v>
<v Speaker 2>neither does the structure of being </v>

1449
01:29:59.031 --> 01:30:01.530
<v Speaker 2>itself and I'll take all my revenge as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much as I possibly can.</v>

1450
01:30:01.710 --> 01:30:04.200
<v Speaker 2>And then just to show you how little I </v>
<v Speaker 2>care,</v>

1451
01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:08.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll cap myself off at the end and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say also people say all the time,</v>

1452
01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:14.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand how that could happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like I don't believe that.</v>

1453
01:30:15.450 --> 01:30:20.450
<v Speaker 2>I think an hour of thought of real </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

1454
01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:25.850
<v Speaker 2>real thought about your darkest feelings</v>
<v Speaker 2>about existence itself illuminates the </v>

1455
01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:28.920
<v Speaker 2>pathway to that sort of behavior quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly.</v>

1456
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:32.220
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I might be wrong.</v>

1457
01:30:32.221 --> 01:30:37.221
<v Speaker 2>I might be a darker person than most and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly okay.</v>

1458
01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1459
01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least I think there are plenty of </v>

1460
01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:50.790
<v Speaker 2>people out there who are sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 2>dark to knew exactly what I mean,</v>

1461
01:30:50.791 --> 01:30:51.900
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

1462
01:30:51.901 --> 01:30:54.720
<v Speaker 2>and I would also say that if it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>leap,</v>

1463
01:30:54.721 --> 01:30:57.840
<v Speaker 2>do your understanding how that pathway </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be illuminated.</v>

1464
01:30:57.841 --> 01:31:02.841
<v Speaker 2>Then you need to know a lot more about </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself than you actually know now </v>

1465
01:31:02.841 --> 01:31:05.250
<v Speaker 2>because it's whatever you might say </v>
<v Speaker 2>about someone like Eric Harris.</v>

1466
01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:10.251
<v Speaker 2>He was a human being too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there's this idea in the New </v>

1467
01:31:10.251 --> 01:31:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Testament that Christ was he who took </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sins of the world onto himself.</v>

1468
01:31:12.811 --> 01:31:14.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a very complicated idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but part of it,</v>

1469
01:31:16.110 --> 01:31:21.110
<v Speaker 2>part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it is associated with the idea </v>

1470
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.450
<v Speaker 2>that he met the devil in the desert as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1471
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:27.350
<v Speaker 2>To take the sins of mankind onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself is to understand that within </v>

1472
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:30.981
<v Speaker 2>you dwells exactly the same spirit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>commit the atrocities at columbine or </v>

1473
01:31:30.981 --> 01:31:35.100
<v Speaker 2>that ran the camps at Auschwitz and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually understand that that's part and</v>

1474
01:31:35.101 --> 01:31:38.250
<v Speaker 2>parcel of your makeup and then to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for it.</v>

1475
01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:42.120
<v Speaker 2>And I think that in the aftermath of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible 20th century,</v>

1476
01:31:42.121 --> 01:31:47.121
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're left with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're left with the necessity to take </v>

1477
01:31:47.121 --> 01:31:50.241
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for the most terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of ourselves and that way </v>

1478
01:31:50.241 --> 01:31:52.650
<v Speaker 2>perhaps we can stop those terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>things from happening again.</v>

1479
01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:53.580
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

1480
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Thank</v>

1481
01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:06.580
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Also means you know that you don't look </v>

1482
01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:06.580
<v Speaker 5>for the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't look for the,</v>

1483
01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:11.270
<v Speaker 5>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the purveyor of malevolence outside </v>

1484
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.270
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1485
01:32:11.370 --> 01:32:14.430
<v Speaker 5>It isn't someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though sometimes it's someone else,</v>

1486
01:32:14.431 --> 01:32:15.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1487
01:32:15.481 --> 01:32:17.940
<v Speaker 5>It's like there are identifiable </v>
<v Speaker 5>perpetrators,</v>

1488
01:32:17.941 --> 01:32:21.780
<v Speaker 5>but that's not precisely the point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The point is something more like that.</v>

1489
01:32:21.781 --> 01:32:24.900
<v Speaker 5>The proper place for the encapsulation </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that malevolence,</v>

1490
01:32:24.901 --> 01:32:29.901
<v Speaker 5>at least the proper place to start is </v>
<v Speaker 5>within the confines of your own </v>

1491
01:32:29.901 --> 01:32:34.101
<v Speaker 5>existence and then perhaps within the </v>
<v Speaker 5>confines of your family and that way </v>

1492
01:32:34.101 --> 01:32:38.991
<v Speaker 5>you're not a danger to those that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>misapprehend as malevolent and evil </v>

1493
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:41.460
<v Speaker 5>because you won't get your aim right to </v>
<v Speaker 5>begin with.</v>

1494
01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:46.940
<v Speaker 5>You'll identify them improperly and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll take your revenge in a manner </v>

1495
01:32:47.221 --> 01:32:51.390
<v Speaker 5>that allows you to admit your own </v>
<v Speaker 5>responsibility,</v>

1496
01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:57.080
<v Speaker 5>to act out your unconscious desire for </v>
<v Speaker 5>revenge and to move the world just that </v>

1497
01:32:57.331 --> 01:32:58.520
<v Speaker 5>much closer to hail.</v>

1498
01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:08.970
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so cain killed Abel and then cain gives </v>

1499
01:33:08.970 --> 01:33:12.391
<v Speaker 5>rise to his descendants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of whom is the person who's the </v>

1500
01:33:12.391 --> 01:33:13.600
<v Speaker 5>first artificer in weapons of war and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then comes the flood.</v>

1501
01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:18.870
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which seems perfectly miraculously </v>

1502
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:20.140
<v Speaker 5>reasonable to me because what those </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories do,</v>

1503
01:33:20.141 --> 01:33:25.141
<v Speaker 5>it's so amazing that the story of Cain </v>
<v Speaker 5>and Abel segues into the story of the </v>

1504
01:33:25.141 --> 01:33:29.671
<v Speaker 5>flood because it is the case that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>catastrophes that be set society can </v>

1505
01:33:30.761 --> 01:33:35.761
<v Speaker 5>best be conceptualized as the spread of </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual pathology into the social </v>

1506
01:33:35.761 --> 01:33:38.580
<v Speaker 5>world and the and the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would you call the,</v>

1507
01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:44.080
<v Speaker 5>the magnification of that pathology to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the point where everything comes apart </v>

1508
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:48.720
<v Speaker 5>and I truly believe that if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>familiarize yourself with the last </v>

1509
01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:52.380
<v Speaker 5>hundred years of history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's the conclusion that you </v>

1510
01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:54.091
<v Speaker 5>would derive and the people who are most</v>
<v Speaker 5>wise that I've read who commented on </v>

1511
01:33:54.091 --> 01:33:57.730
<v Speaker 5>that say the same thing over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the.</v>

1512
01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.960
<v Speaker 5>The key to the prevention of the horrors</v>
<v Speaker 5>of Auschwitz and the Gulag in the future</v>

1513
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:12.750
<v Speaker 5>is the reconstruction of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 5>soul at the level of each individual.</v>

1514
01:34:14.830 --> 01:34:19.090
<v Speaker 5>And that's a terrible message because it</v>
<v Speaker 5>puts the burden on you.</v>

1515
01:34:19.930 --> 01:34:24.930
<v Speaker 5>But it's an amazing message because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>also means that you could be the source </v>

1516
01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:29.670
<v Speaker 5>of the process that stops that </v>
<v Speaker 5>catastrophe and malevolence from ever </v>

1517
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:32.800
<v Speaker 5>emerging again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1518
01:34:32.801 --> 01:34:37.801
<v Speaker 5>it's hard for me to imagine that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have anything that could possibly be </v>

1519
01:34:37.801 --> 01:34:40.450
<v Speaker 5>better to do with the time that you have</v>
<v Speaker 5>left.</v>

1520
01:34:42.450 --> 01:34:47.130
<v Speaker 5>Well then we see noah who walks with God</v>
<v Speaker 5>and whose generations are in order,</v>

1521
01:34:47.190 --> 01:34:52.190
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which means that he's entered this </v>

1522
01:34:52.190 --> 01:34:52.260
<v Speaker 5>contract with the good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

1523
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:56.070
<v Speaker 5>that has the protective function of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>arc.</v>

1524
01:34:56.370 --> 01:34:59.930
<v Speaker 5>He's put his together and he can ride </v>
<v Speaker 5>out the worst catastrophe.</v>

1525
01:34:59.931 --> 01:35:01.610
<v Speaker 5>And he's actually our ancestor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1526
01:35:01.611 --> 01:35:04.940
<v Speaker 5>So interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that these people who get their act</v>

1527
01:35:04.941 --> 01:35:09.941
<v Speaker 5>together properly and make a contract </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the good are constantly presented </v>

1528
01:35:10.011 --> 01:35:15.011
<v Speaker 5>as the genuine ancestors of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's a really positive element of </v>

1529
01:35:15.011 --> 01:35:16.910
<v Speaker 5>the story as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's one I believe because,</v>

1530
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:19.460
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it hasn't been easy for us to get here.</v>

1531
01:35:19.461 --> 01:35:24.461
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we are the descendants of the great </v>

1532
01:35:24.461 --> 01:35:24.500
<v Speaker 5>heroes of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you took all those heroes and you</v>

1533
01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:29.800
<v Speaker 5>and you and you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you told their stories and you </v>

1534
01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 5>distilled their stories into a single </v>
<v Speaker 5>story,</v>

1535
01:35:30.801 --> 01:35:32.790
<v Speaker 5>maybe you'd have a story like the story </v>
<v Speaker 5>of knower,</v>

1536
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:33.980
<v Speaker 5>the story of Abraham.</v>

1537
01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.600
<v Speaker 5>You know the story of the successful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the story of our forefathers.</v>

1538
01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:43.920
<v Speaker 5>You know not the cancer on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 5>that certain people tend to think that </v>

1539
01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.711
<v Speaker 5>we are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the goal is to be one of the </v>

1540
01:35:47.711 --> 01:35:51.461
<v Speaker 5>people like that and there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything better than can possibly be </v>

1541
01:35:51.461 --> 01:35:54.791
<v Speaker 5>done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the alternative is something like </v>

1542
01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:55.550
<v Speaker 5>hell and so nola rides out the storm and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what everyone wants.</v>

1543
01:35:55.551 --> 01:36:00.551
<v Speaker 5>Because you want to ride out the storm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to be happy because </v>

1544
01:36:00.551 --> 01:36:01.520
<v Speaker 5>that'll just happen if it does or if it </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't,</v>

1545
01:36:01.730 --> 01:36:06.730
<v Speaker 5>but you definitely want to constitute </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself so that you can ride out the </v>

1546
01:36:06.730 --> 01:36:07.190
<v Speaker 5>storm because the storm is always </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming.</v>

1547
01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:09.710
<v Speaker 5>And so then you're fortified against the</v>
<v Speaker 5>worst.</v>

1548
01:36:09.711 --> 01:36:14.711
<v Speaker 5>And that's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because we'll have the best you can </v>

1549
01:36:14.711 --> 01:36:18.221
<v Speaker 5>handle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the worst you have to prepare yourself </v>

1550
01:36:18.221 --> 01:36:21.731
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then we see the same thing repeated </v>

1551
01:36:21.731 --> 01:36:21.731
<v Speaker 5>in the story of Abraham essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1552
01:36:21.731 --> 01:36:25.130
<v Speaker 5>Abraham makes this contract with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>good and constantly renews it.</v>

1553
01:36:25.131 --> 01:36:30.131
<v Speaker 5>That's his sacrifice and his worship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He constantly renews it and he has the </v>

1554
01:36:30.131 --> 01:36:34.170
<v Speaker 5>adventures that are sufficiently typical</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the adventures of a human being who's</v>

1555
01:36:34.190 --> 01:36:36.830
<v Speaker 5>alive and engaging in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1556
01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:37.370
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1557
01:36:37.670 --> 01:36:40.910
<v Speaker 5>he bumps himself up against all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>horrors of existence,</v>

1558
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:46.270
<v Speaker 5>and yet the story is told in such a </v>
<v Speaker 5>manner that reveals that his primary </v>

1559
01:36:47.421 --> 01:36:52.421
<v Speaker 5>ethical commitment to the overarching </v>
<v Speaker 5>good is sufficient to protect him </v>

1560
01:36:53.301 --> 01:36:56.840
<v Speaker 5>against the vicissitudes of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1561
01:36:56.870 --> 01:37:00.410
<v Speaker 5>that's an optimistic story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as a pessimistic person,</v>

1562
01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:05.920
<v Speaker 5>I appreciate an optimistic story that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>believable and there's great demands </v>

1563
01:37:06.741 --> 01:37:09.950
<v Speaker 5>placed on Abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not as if this just comes to him as</v>

1564
01:37:09.951 --> 01:37:14.951
<v Speaker 5>a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has to be willing to sacrifice </v>

1565
01:37:14.951 --> 01:37:15.080
<v Speaker 5>whatever is necessary in order to </v>
<v Speaker 5>maintain that contract.</v>

1566
01:37:15.081 --> 01:37:20.081
<v Speaker 5>And so that seems to me to be realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no reason to assume that life </v>

1567
01:37:20.081 --> 01:37:22.400
<v Speaker 5>isn't so difficult that it actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>demands the best from you,</v>

1568
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.980
<v Speaker 5>that it's actually structured in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>manner,</v>

1569
01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:30.400
<v Speaker 5>and that if you were willing to reveal </v>
<v Speaker 5>the best in you in response to the </v>

1570
01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:35.261
<v Speaker 5>vicissitudes of life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you might actually prevail and you </v>

1571
01:37:35.261 --> 01:37:37.310
<v Speaker 5>might actually set things straight </v>
<v Speaker 5>around you and</v>

1572
01:37:39.670 --> 01:37:41.080
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if that was true?</v>

1573
01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:48.140
<v Speaker 5>That would be a remarkable thing and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't see how it cannot be true,</v>

1574
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:51.470
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't see that it's not stamped on the</v>

1575
01:37:51.471 --> 01:37:55.710
<v Speaker 5>soul of everyone who's conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we all know this perfectly well,</v>

1576
01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:59.130
<v Speaker 5>although the stories remind us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1577
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:01.560
<v Speaker 5>Plato,</v>
<v Speaker 5>socrates believed.</v>

1578
01:38:01.561 --> 01:38:06.561
<v Speaker 5>Then all knowledge was remembering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1579
01:38:07.331 --> 01:38:12.331
<v Speaker 5>he believed that the soul before birth </v>
<v Speaker 5>had all knowledge and lost it at birth </v>

1580
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:17.410
<v Speaker 5>and then experience reminded the soul of</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it already knew.</v>

1581
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:22.950
<v Speaker 5>And there's something about that that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>really true because you're not just </v>

1582
01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:28.130
<v Speaker 5>creature that emerged 30 years ago or 40</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

1583
01:38:28.131 --> 01:38:31.040
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're the inheritor of three and a half</v>

1584
01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:34.250
<v Speaker 5>billion years worth of biological </v>
<v Speaker 5>engineering,</v>

1585
01:38:34.251 --> 01:38:37.850
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have your nature stamp deeply inside</v>

1586
01:38:37.851 --> 01:38:42.851
<v Speaker 5>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>far more deeply than we had any of us </v>

1587
01:38:42.851 --> 01:38:45.341
<v Speaker 5>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when you come across these great </v>

1588
01:38:45.341 --> 01:38:45.341
<v Speaker 5>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these reminders,</v>

1589
01:38:45.341 --> 01:38:49.151
<v Speaker 5>there are a reminder of how to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>properly and they echo in your soul </v>

1590
01:38:49.151 --> 01:38:53.441
<v Speaker 5>because the structure's already there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The external stories are manifestations </v>

1591
01:38:56.101 --> 01:39:01.101
<v Speaker 5>of the internal reality and then there </v>
<v Speaker 5>are call to that until her internal </v>

1592
01:39:01.101 --> 01:39:04.521
<v Speaker 5>reality to reveal itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>

1593
01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:09.470
<v Speaker 5>Then we come to the end of the abrahamic</v>
<v Speaker 5>stories,</v>

1594
01:39:09.471 --> 01:39:14.330
<v Speaker 5>least this section of them with Sarah's </v>
<v Speaker 5>death and Abraham is called upon to make</v>

1595
01:39:14.331 --> 01:39:17.420
<v Speaker 5>the supreme sacrifice and interestingly </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough,</v>

1596
01:39:17.421 --> 01:39:19.760
<v Speaker 5>because he's willing to make the supreme</v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice,</v>

1597
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:25.030
<v Speaker 5>he actually doesn't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's an interesting thing as well </v>

1598
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:29.590
<v Speaker 5>because I believe that it's reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 5>from a psychological perspective to </v>

1599
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:33.140
<v Speaker 5>point out that the more willing you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1600
01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:39.920
<v Speaker 5>to face eth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps the less likely it is that </v>

1601
01:39:40.321 --> 01:39:44.160
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to face it at least</v>
<v Speaker 5>in an ignoble manner.</v>

1602
01:39:47.310 --> 01:39:52.310
<v Speaker 5>And so with that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then we'll bring this 12 part series to </v>

1603
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.310
<v Speaker 5>a close.</v>

1604
01:39:59.530 --> 01:39:59.650
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

1605
01:39:59.650 --> 01:40:01.810
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that applause is for everyone,</v>

1606
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:04.840
<v Speaker 5>and I hate to say that because it sounds</v>
<v Speaker 5>so new age,</v>

1607
01:40:07.690 --> 01:40:08.360
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1608
01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:12.310
<v Speaker 5>it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really does seem to me that this is a</v>

1609
01:40:12.311 --> 01:40:14.080
<v Speaker 5>participatory exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1610
01:40:14.081 --> 01:40:19.081
<v Speaker 5>and that and that it would not be </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible for me to go through these </v>

1611
01:40:19.081 --> 01:40:19.750
<v Speaker 5>stories without having you here to </v>
<v Speaker 5>listen.</v>

1612
01:40:19.810 --> 01:40:23.490
<v Speaker 5>And so and I always think when talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>to a crowd that it's a dialogue.</v>

1613
01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:28.810
<v Speaker 5>It's a dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You sit and you listen and you've all </v>

1614
01:40:28.810 --> 01:40:28.810
<v Speaker 5>listened and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1615
01:40:28.810 --> 01:40:30.100
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and thank God for that,</v>

1616
01:40:30.101 --> 01:40:35.101
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that gives me a chance to think and </v>

1617
01:40:35.101 --> 01:40:37.351
<v Speaker 5>it gives me a chance to watch and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>gives me a chance to interact because </v>

1618
01:40:37.351 --> 01:40:37.351
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're emblematic of,</v>

1619
01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:42.360
<v Speaker 5>of humanity at large.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suppose that's one way of thinking </v>

1620
01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.800
<v Speaker 5>about it and for me to be able to craft </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I'm saying so that it has an impact</v>

1621
01:40:44.801 --> 01:40:49.060
<v Speaker 5>on all of you here also means that I can</v>
<v Speaker 5>simultaneously crafted so that it hasn't</v>

1622
01:40:49.061 --> 01:40:52.150
<v Speaker 5>impacted in principle can reach far </v>
<v Speaker 5>beyond this place.</v>

1623
01:40:52.150 --> 01:40:53.560
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1624
01:40:53.650 --> 01:40:58.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm hoping that I'm really hoping that </v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that can start to </v>

1625
01:40:58.650 --> 01:41:01.060
<v Speaker 5>happen with this at least is that we can</v>
<v Speaker 5>put our culture back on.</v>

1626
01:41:01.061 --> 01:41:06.061
<v Speaker 5>It's from foundation because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's desperately needed and </v>

1627
01:41:06.061 --> 01:41:09.750
<v Speaker 5>in order to do that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand both the evil and the </v>

1628
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:11.320
<v Speaker 5>nobility of the human soul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's like,</v>

1629
01:41:11.321 --> 01:41:13.210
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a fundamental truth,</v>

1630
01:41:13.211 --> 01:41:18.211
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't think you can get to the </v>

1631
01:41:18.211 --> 01:41:18.211
<v Speaker 5>nobility without a soldier and through </v>
<v Speaker 5>the eval.</v>

1632
01:41:18.211 --> 01:41:21.070
<v Speaker 5>I really don't believe that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's no place for the naive to go,</v>

1633
01:41:21.071 --> 01:41:23.800
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anyways,</v>

1634
01:41:23.801 --> 01:41:28.801
<v Speaker 5>I would like to thank you as you thank </v>
<v Speaker 5>me for your close and careful attention </v>

1635
01:41:28.871 --> 01:41:33.871
<v Speaker 5>and your support during all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been a really a remarkable </v>

1636
01:41:33.871 --> 01:41:37.411
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly sort of developed beyond </v>

1637
01:41:37.411 --> 01:41:40.060
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my dreams.</v>

1638
01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:40.540
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1639
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:45.910
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1640
01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.640
<v Speaker 5>Onto the questions.</v>

1641
01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:08.220
<v Speaker 6>Hi Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It appears to me from this series a and </v>

1642
01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:12.290
<v Speaker 6>from the biblical stories themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that the emphasis of the stories is the </v>

1643
01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:15.571
<v Speaker 6>utmost importance of the fool for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>maintenance and adaptation of being or </v>

1644
01:42:15.571 --> 01:42:17.170
<v Speaker 6>society.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The figure who will lunge headfirst into</v>

1645
01:42:17.171 --> 01:42:22.171
<v Speaker 6>uncharted territory,</v>
<v Speaker 6>explicitly aware of the danger and risk </v>

1646
01:42:22.171 --> 01:42:22.480
<v Speaker 6>of loss and confronting what cannot be </v>
<v Speaker 6>understood,</v>

1647
01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:27.660
<v Speaker 6>but unafraid and with zeal and that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>dangers of ideological possession just </v>

1648
01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:32.131
<v Speaker 6>as much or just as much of a concern as </v>
<v Speaker 6>the individuals are unwilling and </v>

1649
01:42:32.171 --> 01:42:37.171
<v Speaker 6>perhaps unable to form an opinion and </v>
<v Speaker 6>take a stance one way or another when </v>

1650
01:42:37.171 --> 01:42:38.890
<v Speaker 6>confronted with a fork in the road or a </v>
<v Speaker 6>decision that must be made.</v>

1651
01:42:39.490 --> 01:42:44.490
<v Speaker 6>You've seen this apathy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>apathy throughout the universities as I </v>

1652
01:42:44.490 --> 01:42:45.970
<v Speaker 6>have to in the public schooling system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My question is,</v>

1653
01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:51.240
<v Speaker 6>how can one model being the fool to </v>
<v Speaker 6>plunge into the unknown and publicly </v>

1654
01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:55.441
<v Speaker 6>fall on your face in pursuit of learning</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a way that clearly demonstrates the </v>

1655
01:42:55.441 --> 01:42:55.630
<v Speaker 6>urgency and utility of the fool?</v>

1656
01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:05.530
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there isn't any difference between the </v>

1657
01:43:05.530 --> 01:43:05.530
<v Speaker 5>fool when someone who's courageous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1658
01:43:05.530 --> 01:43:08.981
<v Speaker 5>From an architectural perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I mean Abraham is a fool obviously </v>

1659
01:43:08.981 --> 01:43:08.981
<v Speaker 5>when he starts his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>

1660
01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:14.020
<v Speaker 5>his adventures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the story lays it out in that </v>

1661
01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:14.690
<v Speaker 5>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's far too old to be leaving home,</v>

1662
01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:16.930
<v Speaker 5>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a late bloomer,</v>

1663
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:18.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1664
01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:23.100
<v Speaker 5>and then he has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has a lot of catastrophic adventures </v>

1665
01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:26.111
<v Speaker 5>along the way and certainly you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine that had you encountered him </v>

1666
01:43:26.111 --> 01:43:28.460
<v Speaker 5>when he first encountered the famine in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the land of strangers when he first went</v>

1667
01:43:28.461 --> 01:43:30.830
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the idea that he had a,</v>

1668
01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:35.630
<v Speaker 5>he had followed his misguided intuitions</v>
<v Speaker 5>would have been self evident,</v>

1669
01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:42.260
<v Speaker 5>but in the abrahamic stories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is this call to get out and do </v>

1670
01:43:42.570 --> 01:43:43.650
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's it.</v>

1671
01:43:43.651 --> 01:43:44.610
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>

1672
01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:49.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things I've learned to put </v>

1673
01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:49.760
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make it concretely is that like,</v>

1674
01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:53.391
<v Speaker 5>I've done a lot of different things in </v>
<v Speaker 5>my life and every time I did a new </v>

1675
01:43:53.391 --> 01:43:53.391
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a fool.</v>

1676
01:43:53.391 --> 01:43:54.350
<v Speaker 5>I did it badly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was an imposter.</v>

1677
01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:55.190
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1678
01:43:55.330 --> 01:44:00.330
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and because when you first start to do </v>

1679
01:44:00.330 --> 01:44:00.330
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know what you're doing,</v>

1680
01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:05.860
<v Speaker 5>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an acceptance of your </v>

1681
01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:05.860
<v Speaker 5>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1682
01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:06.800
<v Speaker 5>And your ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's humility in some sense.</v>

1683
01:44:06.801 --> 01:44:08.540
<v Speaker 5>The willingness to be a fool in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>nude,</v>

1684
01:44:08.541 --> 01:44:10.550
<v Speaker 5>in the land of strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

1685
01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:15.760
<v Speaker 5>The willingness to be a fool in the land</v>
<v Speaker 5>of strangers and that's an act of </v>

1686
01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:19.631
<v Speaker 5>courage because he will also reveal your</v>
<v Speaker 5>vulnerability to the world by stumbling </v>

1687
01:44:19.631 --> 01:44:20.990
<v Speaker 5>around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as long as you're stumbling forward,</v>

1688
01:44:20.991 --> 01:44:22.370
<v Speaker 5>then you're going to move forward.</v>

1689
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:24.110
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you do that?</v>

1690
01:44:24.111 --> 01:44:25.230
<v Speaker 5>More concretely?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1691
01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:26.900
<v Speaker 5>aim at an ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1692
01:44:26.901 --> 01:44:29.330
<v Speaker 5>and you aim in an ideal that's beyond </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1693
01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:34.900
<v Speaker 5>Now maybe you don't aim to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had an idea that ideal that so beyond </v>

1694
01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:37.250
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're crushed by it magnificence.</v>

1695
01:44:37.251 --> 01:44:38.900
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's,</v>

1696
01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:42.350
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's too demotivating to move you,</v>

1697
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:46.130
<v Speaker 5>but you could at least conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself as the you.</v>

1698
01:44:46.131 --> 01:44:51.131
<v Speaker 5>That you are with fewer of the faults </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you know of and that's a good </v>

1699
01:44:51.131 --> 01:44:56.081
<v Speaker 5>start.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I also think that's associated with </v>

1700
01:44:56.081 --> 01:44:56.081
<v Speaker 5>the idea of humility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Take stock,</v>

1701
01:44:56.450 --> 01:45:00.080
<v Speaker 5>figure out how it is that you're not who</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could be,</v>

1702
01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:05.420
<v Speaker 5>and then move in that direction and </v>
<v Speaker 5>accept the consequences.</v>

1703
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:08.990
<v Speaker 5>You know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get slapped a lot,</v>

1704
01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:11.990
<v Speaker 5>but maybe with each slap you'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>straighten up a little bit.</v>

1705
01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:17.380
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you listen even to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are slapping you because </v>

1706
01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:21.131
<v Speaker 5>sometimes they're the ones who can </v>
<v Speaker 5>reveal for you very quickly where it is </v>

1707
01:45:21.131 --> 01:45:25.961
<v Speaker 5>that you're weak and insufficient so </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you won't have to be that way in </v>

1708
01:45:25.961 --> 01:45:27.520
<v Speaker 5>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah.</v>

1709
01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:37.190
<v Speaker 5>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hello.</v>

1710
01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:41.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no questions for you.</v>

1711
01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:46.240
<v Speaker 5>All I ever wanted to do is just stand in</v>
<v Speaker 5>front of you and be able to thank you </v>

1712
01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.610
<v Speaker 5>for everything you have done.</v>

1713
01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:50.640
<v Speaker 7>My pleasure.</v>

1714
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1715
01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:04.590
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>good morning citizen pietism.</v>

1716
01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:07.510
<v Speaker 7>You got a short one?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1717
01:46:07.511 --> 01:46:08.780
<v Speaker 7>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean a question.</v>

1718
01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:12.370
<v Speaker 7>The best question for last for us for </v>
<v Speaker 7>this one's good,</v>

1719
01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:17.440
<v Speaker 7>but first I'll break the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People have said so stayed.</v>

1720
01:46:17.441 --> 01:46:18.570
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no icebreaker.</v>

1721
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:20.440
<v Speaker 7>Do you want me to get right into the </v>
<v Speaker 7>real question?</v>

1722
01:46:20.441 --> 01:46:22.100
<v Speaker 7>I want you to get right into the </v>
<v Speaker 7>questions.</v>

1723
01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:27.060
<v Speaker 7>So this question is about a hyper </v>
<v Speaker 7>critical thinking.</v>

1724
01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:32.120
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now everyone knows that critical </v>

1725
01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:33.060
<v Speaker 7>thinking is a great thing to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to be able to cut,</v>

1726
01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:35.370
<v Speaker 7>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 7>think about your ideas.</v>

1727
01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:40.700
<v Speaker 7>If information is presented to you have </v>
<v Speaker 7>to decide if it's legitimate or if </v>

1728
01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:44.571
<v Speaker 7>there's some sort of deceit behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when it's taken to its extreme,</v>

1729
01:46:45.330 --> 01:46:47.910
<v Speaker 7>no matter how great or noble somebody </v>
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>

1730
01:46:47.911 --> 01:46:52.911
<v Speaker 7>you can always find a in the armor and </v>
<v Speaker 7>try to figure out how they're covering </v>

1731
01:46:52.911 --> 01:46:54.930
<v Speaker 7>up something that's not great about </v>
<v Speaker 7>them,</v>

1732
01:46:54.931 --> 01:46:59.931
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you might then discredit everything </v>

1733
01:46:59.931 --> 01:46:59.931
<v Speaker 7>they do is just a facade.</v>

1734
01:46:59.931 --> 01:47:00.340
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let.</v>

1735
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:05.350
<v Speaker 5>So let me stop you there for a sec </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I want to address two of the </v>

1736
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:06.110
<v Speaker 5>issues that you already brought up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's,</v>

1737
01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:10.310
<v Speaker 5>there's the issue of hyper crit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>critical thinking partly in relationship</v>

1738
01:47:10.311 --> 01:47:12.560
<v Speaker 5>to yourself and partly in relationship </v>
<v Speaker 5>to others.</v>

1739
01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:16.820
<v Speaker 5>So I'd like to address the issue with </v>
<v Speaker 5>regards to yourself to begin with.</v>

1740
01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:19.700
<v Speaker 5>So there's this idea that Carl Jung </v>
<v Speaker 5>developed,</v>

1741
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:23.270
<v Speaker 5>he extracted it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know from where,</v>

1742
01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:25.430
<v Speaker 5>from some ancient writings that he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>familiar with.</v>

1743
01:47:25.431 --> 01:47:29.690
<v Speaker 5>I believe they were Jewish writings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said that classically speaking,</v>

1744
01:47:29.691 --> 01:47:34.691
<v Speaker 5>traditionally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God was viewed to rule being with two </v>

1745
01:47:34.691 --> 01:47:36.050
<v Speaker 5>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right hand and left hand.</v>

1746
01:47:36.051 --> 01:47:39.380
<v Speaker 5>And the right hand was justice and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

1747
01:47:39.381 --> 01:47:41.120
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get what's coming to </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1748
01:47:41.690 --> 01:47:46.690
<v Speaker 5>but the left hand was mercy and the idea</v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially was that the cosmos could </v>

1749
01:47:46.690 --> 01:47:49.490
<v Speaker 5>not exist without the proper combination</v>
<v Speaker 5>of justice and mercy.</v>

1750
01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:54.820
<v Speaker 5>You should get what's coming to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people are fallible and they make </v>

1751
01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:58.451
<v Speaker 5>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's reasonable to apply that to </v>

1752
01:47:58.451 --> 01:47:58.451
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1753
01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:03.760
<v Speaker 5>there's an idea that's been developed by</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychologists over the last few decades </v>

1754
01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:07.931
<v Speaker 5>that people are basically narcissistic </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that they generally feel that </v>

1755
01:48:07.931 --> 01:48:10.910
<v Speaker 5>they're better at most things than other</v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't buy that.</v>

1756
01:48:10.970 --> 01:48:13.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the experimental evidence </v>
<v Speaker 5>for that is very strong.</v>

1757
01:48:13.611 --> 01:48:15.650
<v Speaker 5>And I certainly haven't seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

1758
01:48:15.651 --> 01:48:20.651
<v Speaker 5>in my clinical practice where I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people are generally far harder on </v>

1759
01:48:20.651 --> 01:48:21.110
<v Speaker 5>themselves than they are on other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1760
01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:23.870
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one example of that,</v>

1761
01:48:23.871 --> 01:48:25.580
<v Speaker 5>I've written about this in my new book </v>
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>

1762
01:48:25.581 --> 01:48:26.120
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1763
01:48:26.121 --> 01:48:31.121
<v Speaker 5>if you have a pet that's sick and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>take it to the vet and you get </v>

1764
01:48:31.121 --> 01:48:34.421
<v Speaker 5>medication,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're very likely to give the pet the </v>

1765
01:48:34.421 --> 01:48:36.050
<v Speaker 5>entire course of medication to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>pharmacy to get the prescription filled,</v>

1766
01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:39.140
<v Speaker 5>to give the pet the medication to follow</v>
<v Speaker 5>it through.</v>

1767
01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:41.990
<v Speaker 5>But if you are the person who has the </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem,</v>

1768
01:48:42.230 --> 01:48:47.230
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you all laugh because you know the </v>

1769
01:48:47.230 --> 01:48:47.230
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a 30,</v>

1770
01:48:47.230 --> 01:48:49.460
<v Speaker 5>you won't even go fill the prescription </v>
<v Speaker 5>and of the remaining two thirds of you,</v>

1771
01:48:49.461 --> 01:48:52.010
<v Speaker 5>half of won't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>won't take it to completion.</v>

1772
01:48:52.011 --> 01:48:54.050
<v Speaker 5>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well why are people like that?</v>

1773
01:48:54.051 --> 01:48:57.170
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's because they know </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

1774
01:48:57.350 --> 01:49:02.350
<v Speaker 5>They have contempt for themselves </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of their flaws and then they </v>

1775
01:49:02.350 --> 01:49:06.220
<v Speaker 5>come to despise themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's a big mistake that's </v>

1776
01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:09.821
<v Speaker 5>locked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's too much justice and not enough </v>

1777
01:49:09.821 --> 01:49:09.821
<v Speaker 5>mercy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1778
01:49:09.821 --> 01:49:13.481
<v Speaker 5>young wrote about the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 5>injunction that you should treat your </v>

1779
01:49:13.481 --> 01:49:15.620
<v Speaker 5>neighbor as if he were yourself </v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially.</v>

1780
01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:19.310
<v Speaker 5>But he talked about that isn't equation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was quite interesting.</v>

1781
01:49:19.311 --> 01:49:23.390
<v Speaker 5>So because it's often read as something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like you should be nice to people,</v>

1782
01:49:23.391 --> 01:49:28.391
<v Speaker 5>which is not what it means at all </v>
<v Speaker 5>because first nice is a very low end </v>

1783
01:49:28.391 --> 01:49:29.960
<v Speaker 5>virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it isn't what it means.</v>

1784
01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:34.960
<v Speaker 5>What it means is that you should,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should treat your neighbor as if he </v>

1785
01:49:35.031 --> 01:49:38.450
<v Speaker 5>or she is someone that you wish to </v>
<v Speaker 5>encourage and develop,</v>

1786
01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:42.380
<v Speaker 5>but then you should also have exactly </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same attitude towards yourself,</v>

1787
01:49:42.381 --> 01:49:47.381
<v Speaker 5>which is sort of in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>regardless of what your opinion is of </v>

1788
01:49:47.381 --> 01:49:47.470
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Critical,</v>

1789
01:49:47.471 --> 01:49:52.471
<v Speaker 5>let's say hypercritical even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is often the case with people who </v>

1790
01:49:52.471 --> 01:49:54.130
<v Speaker 5>are anxious or perhaps we were hyper </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientious.</v>

1791
01:49:54.610 --> 01:49:59.610
<v Speaker 5>You have to put forward to yourself the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same sympathy we could say that you </v>

1792
01:50:00.971 --> 01:50:03.430
<v Speaker 5>would extend to someone else that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>cared for.</v>

1793
01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:08.760
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing is that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>come to treat yourself as if you're </v>

1794
01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:11.090
<v Speaker 5>someone that you care for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I mean that technically you know,</v>

1795
01:50:11.170 --> 01:50:13.630
<v Speaker 5>you detach yourself from yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you think,</v>

1796
01:50:13.631 --> 01:50:18.631
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well if I was going to construct a </v>

1797
01:50:18.631 --> 01:50:21.760
<v Speaker 5>motive being that was optimal for this </v>
<v Speaker 5>person that I happened to be,</v>

1798
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:27.000
<v Speaker 5>what would that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that sort of independent of whether </v>

1799
01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.360
<v Speaker 5>or not you think you deserve it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like maybe you deserve it.</v>

1800
01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:30.670
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you don't innocent until proven </v>
<v Speaker 5>guilty.</v>

1801
01:50:30.671 --> 01:50:35.671
<v Speaker 5>That's a pretty good policy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you should come to lay out a mode of</v>

1802
01:50:35.741 --> 01:50:38.800
<v Speaker 5>being for yourself that gives you some </v>
<v Speaker 5>credit,</v>

1803
01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:44.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when that will also help you in your </v>

1804
01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:44.350
<v Speaker 5>dealings with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's often very difficult for people</v>

1805
01:50:44.351 --> 01:50:46.540
<v Speaker 5>to do that to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

1806
01:50:46.541 --> 01:50:49.180
<v Speaker 5>So that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the first part of that.</v>

1807
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:55.030
<v Speaker 7>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it starts out with this hyper </v>

1808
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:57.010
<v Speaker 7>critical thinking and you talk a lot </v>
<v Speaker 7>about niches,</v>

1809
01:50:57.020 --> 01:51:02.020
<v Speaker 7>assertion about the death of God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I see it sort of more like a willful</v>

1810
01:51:02.511 --> 01:51:04.340
<v Speaker 7>destruction of the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1811
01:51:04.341 --> 01:51:09.341
<v Speaker 7>the heroic ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I guess several months ago I had </v>

1812
01:51:09.341 --> 01:51:13.541
<v Speaker 7>occasion to look up a definition or </v>
<v Speaker 7>explanation for the Zeitgeists of modern</v>

1813
01:51:15.561 --> 01:51:20.120
<v Speaker 7>victimhood or outrage culture.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I sought in this particular case and</v>

1814
01:51:20.121 --> 01:51:22.340
<v Speaker 7>I found.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And this paragraph,</v>

1815
01:51:22.341 --> 01:51:27.341
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this has what you call the rhythmic </v>

1816
01:51:27.341 --> 01:51:28.640
<v Speaker 7>cadence that just made my hair stand up </v>
<v Speaker 7>on a sense.</v>

1817
01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:31.640
<v Speaker 7>And if you could look at it and read </v>
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

1818
01:51:31.641 --> 01:51:32.360
<v Speaker 7>this is better than</v>

1819
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:37.390
<v Speaker 5>the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The image of man that dominates in </v>

1820
01:51:39.631 --> 01:51:44.631
<v Speaker 5>modern literature and visual art,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cinema and theater is primarily a group </v>

1821
01:51:44.631 --> 01:51:46.380
<v Speaker 5>gloomy image.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The great and the noble are suspect from</v>

1822
01:51:46.381 --> 01:51:49.290
<v Speaker 5>the outset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They must be torn from their pedestal so</v>

1823
01:51:49.291 --> 01:51:54.291
<v Speaker 5>that one can see through them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Morality counts as hypocrisy and joy is </v>

1824
01:51:54.291 --> 01:51:58.461
<v Speaker 5>self deception.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyone who simply puts trust in the </v>

1825
01:51:58.461 --> 01:52:00.360
<v Speaker 5>beautiful and the good is either </v>
<v Speaker 5>inexcusably and ingenuous or acting with</v>

1826
01:52:00.361 --> 01:52:05.361
<v Speaker 5>evil intent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The truly moral attitude is suspicion </v>

1827
01:52:05.361 --> 01:52:09.051
<v Speaker 5>and it's greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Success is in exposing criticism of </v>

1828
01:52:09.051 --> 01:52:11.220
<v Speaker 5>society is obligatory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is impossible to find words,</v>

1829
01:52:11.221 --> 01:52:14.790
<v Speaker 5>lord and brutal enough to describe the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangers that threaten us.</v>

1830
01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:20.180
<v Speaker 5>This delight in the negative is not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However unlimited there exists at the </v>

1831
01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:25.071
<v Speaker 5>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an obligation to be optimistic and the </v>

1832
01:52:25.071 --> 01:52:26.100
<v Speaker 5>failure to observe this obligation does </v>
<v Speaker 5>not go unpunished.</v>

1833
01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:31.640
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anyone who expresses the view that not </v>

1834
01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:33.891
<v Speaker 5>everything in the intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 5>development of the modern period has </v>

1835
01:52:33.891 --> 01:52:33.891
<v Speaker 5>been correct.</v>

1836
01:52:33.891 --> 01:52:37.730
<v Speaker 5>That is necessary in some essential </v>
<v Speaker 5>areas to reflect on this shared wisdom </v>

1837
01:52:37.730 --> 01:52:40.020
<v Speaker 5>of the great cultures has chosen to make</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wrong kind of criticism.</v>

1838
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:45.350
<v Speaker 5>He finds himself suddenly construct </v>
<v Speaker 5>confronted with a resolute apologia for </v>

1839
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:49.641
<v Speaker 5>the fundamental of the modern age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No matter how much delight one may take </v>

1840
01:52:49.641 --> 01:52:53.891
<v Speaker 5>indignation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he is not permitted to call into </v>

1841
01:52:53.891 --> 01:52:56.201
<v Speaker 5>question the view that the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 5>trajectory of historical development is </v>

1842
01:52:56.201 --> 01:52:57.830
<v Speaker 5>progress and that the good lies in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>future and nowhere else.</v>

1843
01:52:59.630 --> 01:53:01.940
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought a lot about nihilism,</v>

1844
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:06.970
<v Speaker 5>let's say and and its justification.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that a very powerful </v>

1845
01:53:08.751 --> 01:53:13.751
<v Speaker 5>justification for nihilism can be found </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the mere observation that life is </v>

1846
01:53:13.751 --> 01:53:18.050
<v Speaker 5>rife with tragedy and malevolence of </v>
<v Speaker 5>which there is no doubt,</v>

1847
01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:24.340
<v Speaker 5>but then I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got suspicious of that rationale for </v>

1848
01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:28.430
<v Speaker 5>nihilism over the years because a </v>
<v Speaker 5>counter position to it emerged.</v>

1849
01:53:28.431 --> 01:53:29.870
<v Speaker 5>And this is something Nietzsche of </v>
<v Speaker 5>course,</v>

1850
01:53:29.871 --> 01:53:32.810
<v Speaker 5>concentrated on as well that had more to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do with resentment.</v>

1851
01:53:33.070 --> 01:53:38.070
<v Speaker 5>It's like you can imagine negation of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the heroic ideal from despair,</v>

1852
01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:40.250
<v Speaker 5>from the despair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

1853
01:53:40.251 --> 01:53:43.040
<v Speaker 5>produced by tragedy and by exposure to </v>
<v Speaker 5>malevolence,</v>

1854
01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:48.340
<v Speaker 5>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's completely an delightfully </v>

1855
01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:51.590
<v Speaker 5>irresponsible to negate the heroic ideal</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it means that you don't have any</v>

1856
01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:56.591
<v Speaker 5>responsibility and it seems to me that </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're nihilistic and prone to </v>

1857
01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:02.690
<v Speaker 5>criticize the heroic foundation of let's</v>
<v Speaker 5>say Western culture,</v>

1858
01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:08.140
<v Speaker 5>that one of the first questions that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>could ask yourself is what makes you so </v>

1859
01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:10.430
<v Speaker 5>sure that you're appropriately cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>suspicious,</v>

1860
01:54:10.431 --> 01:54:15.431
<v Speaker 5>and critical and not just running away </v>
<v Speaker 5>as fast as you possibly can from every </v>

1861
01:54:15.431 --> 01:54:17.360
<v Speaker 5>bit of responsibility that you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibly adopt.</v>

1862
01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:23.140
<v Speaker 5>And I think that that's a perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 5>reasonable perspective and I think that </v>

1863
01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:26.561
<v Speaker 5>that is reflected to some degree in what</v>
<v Speaker 5>the person who wrote this paragraph was </v>

1864
01:54:26.561 --> 01:54:27.420
<v Speaker 5>attempting to new guests who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wrote that.</v>

1865
01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:30.230
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't really know.</v>

1866
01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:36.100
<v Speaker 5>I left you a hint on who has it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cardinal Ratzinger.</v>

1867
01:54:36.130 --> 01:54:38.560
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

1868
01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:41.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to take another question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well done.</v>

1869
01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

1870
01:54:47.230 --> 01:54:49.030
<v Speaker 3>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hello.</v>

1871
01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:50.890
<v Speaker 3>How are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doing good.</v>

1872
01:54:50.891 --> 01:54:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Dr Hughes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1873
01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:54.010
<v Speaker 3>it's been a pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twelve weeks,</v>

1874
01:54:54.250 --> 01:54:56.530
<v Speaker 3>12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 moments.</v>

1875
01:54:56.531 --> 01:54:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1876
01:54:58.210 --> 01:55:03.210
<v Speaker 3>so two weeks ago we talked about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mischievous suggestion,</v>

1877
01:55:03.250 --> 01:55:08.250
<v Speaker 3>I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a to cut the university's funding by 25 </v>

1878
01:55:08.250 --> 01:55:11.770
<v Speaker 3>percent and how that might've influenced</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of language and,</v>

1879
01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:14.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andrew Scheer's platform,</v>

1880
01:55:14.561 --> 01:55:15.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1881
01:55:15.791 --> 01:55:20.140
<v Speaker 3>and then you discussed how you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly sure what your role is in all of</v>

1882
01:55:20.141 --> 01:55:22.510
<v Speaker 3>this and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

1883
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:28.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be in a war and you </v>

1884
01:55:28.090 --> 01:55:28.270
<v Speaker 3>don't want to be using more like </v>
<v Speaker 3>language and,</v>

1885
01:55:29.410 --> 01:55:31.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>

1886
01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:33.260
<v Speaker 3>I think what you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1887
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:34.990
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you want to be doing is,</v>

1888
01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:37.680
<v Speaker 3>is you're trying to restore order but</v>

1889
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:41.230
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not but not but not have conflict.</v>

1890
01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:43.070
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1891
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.690
<v Speaker 3>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

1892
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:48.750
<v Speaker 3>so after the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the lecture two weeks ago,</v>

1893
01:55:48.751 --> 01:55:51.090
<v Speaker 3>I asked you like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I,</v>

1894
01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:53.940
<v Speaker 3>maybe I should do some sales work for </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1895
01:55:53.970 --> 01:55:57.810
<v Speaker 3>a postmodern lexicon website and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1896
01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:01.260
<v Speaker 3>but I think I've found a better niche </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1897
01:56:01.330 --> 01:56:06.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone of my temperament to help this </v>

1898
01:56:06.330 --> 01:56:06.330
<v Speaker 3>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1899
01:56:06.330 --> 01:56:07.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I,</v>

1900
01:56:07.050 --> 01:56:12.050
<v Speaker 3>so I go to dalhousie university and </v>
<v Speaker 3>because so many students are dropping </v>

1901
01:56:13.321 --> 01:56:15.330
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially men and especially,</v>

1902
01:56:15.670 --> 01:56:16.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

1903
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:18.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethnic minorities.</v>

1904
01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've created this team called the </v>

1905
01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:27.170
<v Speaker 3>student success team or something or </v>
<v Speaker 3>student success advisors and you've been</v>

1906
01:56:27.590 --> 01:56:31.200
<v Speaker 3>extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a incredibly successful crowdfunding,</v>

1907
01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:34.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your research and a,</v>

1908
01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:36.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your patriot.</v>

1909
01:56:36.361 --> 01:56:41.361
<v Speaker 3>And I think like how much does it cost </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a single person to do the self </v>

1910
01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:44.170
<v Speaker 3>authoring program?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1911
01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:46.890
<v Speaker 3>it's a two for one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's about $15.</v>

1912
01:56:47.190 --> 01:56:48.090
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1913
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:50.340
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So nothing then basically,</v>

1914
01:56:51.330 --> 01:56:56.330
<v Speaker 3>but I was thinking that we could somehow</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could incorporate the self authoring </v>

1915
01:56:56.461 --> 01:57:01.461
<v Speaker 3>program into this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into this new advisor committee at Dal's</v>

1916
01:57:03.070 --> 01:57:05.370
<v Speaker 3>that students can freak yourself out.</v>

1917
01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:07.510
<v Speaker 3>Man do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

1918
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:12.750
<v Speaker 3>that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The data for the future authoring </v>

1919
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:15.411
<v Speaker 3>program is quite clear if students even </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it for an hour before they go to </v>

1920
01:57:15.411 --> 01:57:17.700
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a 30 or 30 percent less chance</v>

1921
01:57:17.701 --> 01:57:20.950
<v Speaker 3>of dropping out in the first semester.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1922
01:57:20.951 --> 01:57:25.951
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it would really be nice to see some </v>

1923
01:57:25.951 --> 01:57:27.831
<v Speaker 3>student organizations that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously devoted to facilitating </v>

1924
01:57:27.831 --> 01:57:32.001
<v Speaker 3>student success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might think that's what student </v>

1925
01:57:32.001 --> 01:57:32.001
<v Speaker 3>organizations should do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1926
01:57:32.001 --> 01:57:36.920
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems rather self evident when you </v>

1927
01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:36.920
<v Speaker 3>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1928
01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:38.040
<v Speaker 3>so I would say like if you're oriented </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that direction,</v>

1929
01:57:38.590 --> 01:57:43.590
<v Speaker 3>get out or so it's a fine plan and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the emphasis of it because you're</v>

1930
01:57:44.371 --> 01:57:49.371
<v Speaker 3>directing yourself towards the </v>
<v Speaker 3>facilitation of individual </v>

1931
01:57:49.371 --> 01:57:52.941
<v Speaker 3>accomplishment and you're at least going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do very little harm that way and </v>

1932
01:57:52.941 --> 01:57:54.060
<v Speaker 3>that's a really good start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1933
01:57:54.061 --> 01:57:59.061
<v Speaker 3>You know that's because that's what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should think about when you're setting </v>

1934
01:57:59.061 --> 01:57:59.850
<v Speaker 3>out to make things better.</v>

1935
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.660
<v Speaker 3>The first thing you should think is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so sure I know what I'm doing,</v>

1936
01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:08.960
<v Speaker 3>so why don't I first attempt to do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>least amount of harm possible and by </v>

1937
01:58:09.301 --> 01:58:12.320
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on helping someone develop</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own plan and,</v>

1938
01:58:12.650 --> 01:58:17.650
<v Speaker 3>and implement that into the future and </v>
<v Speaker 3>encouraging them with regards to </v>

1939
01:58:17.650 --> 01:58:19.890
<v Speaker 3>whatever success they would like to find</v>
<v Speaker 3>their way,</v>

1940
01:58:20.190 --> 01:58:25.190
<v Speaker 3>there's a pretty low probability that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to act the tearer tyrant </v>

1941
01:58:25.190 --> 01:58:25.190
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1942
01:58:25.190 --> 01:58:28.560
<v Speaker 3>and play a detrimental role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So good luck.</v>

1943
01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we can communicate about it.</v>

1944
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1945
01:58:31.281 --> 01:58:32.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to send you an email.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>

1946
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Hi Dr Peterson</v>

1947
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:41.310
<v Speaker 3>first of these lectures that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>here to to,</v>

1948
01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 3>but I've listened to all of</v>

1949
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:45.250
<v Speaker 8>them on youtube so far.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to get you close enough.</v>

1950
01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:46.390
<v Speaker 8>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's good.</v>

1951
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:48.090
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

1952
01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:53.700
<v Speaker 8>and I've been trying to think up a this </v>
<v Speaker 8>question since basically the first </v>

1953
01:58:53.700 --> 01:58:58.351
<v Speaker 8>lecture because I'm a seminary student </v>
<v Speaker 8>at an evangelical seminary and uh,</v>

1954
01:58:59.250 --> 01:59:02.190
<v Speaker 8>a lot of what you've been saying has </v>
<v Speaker 8>really been resonating in it and it's.</v>

1955
01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:05.830
<v Speaker 8>And it's really been fascinating to </v>
<v Speaker 8>listen to a.</v>

1956
01:59:06.250 --> 01:59:11.250
<v Speaker 8>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's been many people who have been </v>

1957
01:59:11.250 --> 01:59:12.841
<v Speaker 8>asking you questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what do you believe about the </v>

1958
01:59:12.841 --> 01:59:12.841
<v Speaker 8>resurrection?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do you believe in God?</v>

1959
01:59:12.841 --> 01:59:13.690
<v Speaker 8>Are you a Christian?</v>
<v Speaker 8>And all these sorts of things.</v>

1960
01:59:13.691 --> 01:59:18.691
<v Speaker 8>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've been listening very closely to all </v>

1961
01:59:18.691 --> 01:59:20.581
<v Speaker 8>your answers and have groups of friends </v>
<v Speaker 8>on facebook who are volume following </v>

1962
01:59:20.581 --> 01:59:20.581
<v Speaker 8>very closely saying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

1963
01:59:20.581 --> 01:59:23.020
<v Speaker 8>here what Peterson said this time,</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe he's one of us finally,</v>

1964
01:59:23.021 --> 01:59:23.920
<v Speaker 8>or something like that.</v>

1965
01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:30.960
<v Speaker 8>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 8>other ways that you explained some of </v>

1966
01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:33.730
<v Speaker 8>the stories sound very close to a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what we call theological liberalism.</v>

1967
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:35.110
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in the 19th century,</v>

1968
01:59:35.111 --> 01:59:40.111
<v Speaker 8>the idea that using historical critical </v>
<v Speaker 8>methods of a reading and interpreting </v>

1969
01:59:40.111 --> 01:59:44.101
<v Speaker 8>the Bible and understanding Jesus more </v>
<v Speaker 8>as a moral figure than as a literal </v>

1970
01:59:44.101 --> 01:59:46.840
<v Speaker 8>historical figure who was a tournament </v>
<v Speaker 8>provide satisfaction for man.</v>

1971
01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:52.200
<v Speaker 8>So I tried to figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 8>question was because I could interpret </v>

1972
01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:56.671
<v Speaker 8>what some of your answers were.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I'm gonna put it into more of a </v>

1973
01:59:56.671 --> 01:59:59.161
<v Speaker 8>general way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Where exactly do you see yourself </v>

1974
01:59:59.161 --> 02:00:02.950
<v Speaker 8>differing from traditional Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 8>Evangelical Christianity and,</v>

1975
02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:05.530
<v Speaker 8>and why would you defer their,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a,</v>

1976
02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:07.170
<v Speaker 8>given how much you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>

1977
02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:12.180
<v Speaker 8>you seem to understand the importance of</v>
<v Speaker 8>the biblical stories in the Western </v>

1978
02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:12.180
<v Speaker 8>history and western history.</v>

1979
02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:13.030
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1980
02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:14.800
<v Speaker 5>Well that's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>

1981
02:00:15.190 --> 02:00:20.190
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I off obviously I have to answer in a </v>

1982
02:00:20.190 --> 02:00:20.730
<v Speaker 5>general way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1983
02:00:20.770 --> 02:00:25.770
<v Speaker 5>I think that one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes me different is that I take the </v>

1984
02:00:25.770 --> 02:00:26.980
<v Speaker 5>idea that things are a 14 billion years </v>
<v Speaker 5>old,</v>

1985
02:00:26.981 --> 02:00:28.600
<v Speaker 5>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1986
02:00:28.601 --> 02:00:31.450
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the idea of evolution seriously.</v>

1987
02:00:31.590 --> 02:00:32.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>

1988
02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:35.350
<v Speaker 5>as does the Catholic church by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1989
02:00:35.410 --> 02:00:40.120
<v Speaker 5>but I don't see that as an impediment to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pursuit that I'm undertaking now.</v>

1990
02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:42.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to bridge that gap </v>
<v Speaker 5>precisely,</v>

1991
02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:45.250
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not that worried about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1992
02:00:45.490 --> 02:00:47.830
<v Speaker 5>you can't bridge every gap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not possible.</v>

1993
02:00:47.831 --> 02:00:50.320
<v Speaker 5>It would require infinite knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1994
02:00:50.321 --> 02:00:55.321
<v Speaker 5>And how.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's one major because I'm coming </v>

1995
02:00:55.321 --> 02:00:57.991
<v Speaker 5>at this from a scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really am coming at this from a </v>

1996
02:00:57.991 --> 02:00:57.991
<v Speaker 5>scientific perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1997
02:00:57.991 --> 02:01:02.221
<v Speaker 5>like I try to make sure that everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I talk about is commensurate with </v>

1998
02:01:02.221 --> 02:01:02.770
<v Speaker 5>current scientific knowledge.</v>

1999
02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:08.220
<v Speaker 5>Now current scientific knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no doubt is airing and all sorts of </v>

2000
02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:10.921
<v Speaker 5>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I think our notion about exactly </v>

2001
02:01:10.921 --> 02:01:10.930
<v Speaker 5>how evolution progresses is flawed in </v>
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>

2002
02:01:10.931 --> 02:01:15.931
<v Speaker 5>many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the recent discoveries in the field </v>

2003
02:01:15.931 --> 02:01:18.721
<v Speaker 5>of epigenetics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which show that you can actually </v>

2004
02:01:18.721 --> 02:01:18.721
<v Speaker 5>transmit acquired characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2005
02:01:18.721 --> 02:01:23.251
<v Speaker 5>has really put a whole real serious a </v>
<v Speaker 5>stick in the spokes of the evolutionary </v>

2006
02:01:24.011 --> 02:01:25.150
<v Speaker 5>bicycle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say.</v>

2007
02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:29.410
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then I also think the question is,</v>

2008
02:01:29.411 --> 02:01:34.411
<v Speaker 5>miss asked in some sense because I gave </v>
<v Speaker 5>this lecture series a specific title for</v>

2009
02:01:34.721 --> 02:01:39.721
<v Speaker 5>a specific reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the lecture series is the </v>

2010
02:01:39.721 --> 02:01:40.550
<v Speaker 5>psychological significance of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>biblical stories.</v>

2011
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:45.850
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm not claiming that my </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological analysis exhausts the </v>

2012
02:01:45.850 --> 02:01:48.390
<v Speaker 5>significance of the biblical stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2013
02:01:48.391 --> 02:01:50.750
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have multitudes,</v>

2014
02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:55.160
<v Speaker 5>let's say layers of meaning and some of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those layers of metaphysical and some of</v>

2015
02:01:55.161 --> 02:02:00.161
<v Speaker 5>them are more specifically religious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm trying the best I can not to </v>

2016
02:02:00.161 --> 02:02:02.900
<v Speaker 5>wander into those domains like I do </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's impossible to keep yourself</v>

2017
02:02:02.930 --> 02:02:03.410
<v Speaker 5>grounded.</v>

2018
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:06.080
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're a discursive speaker,</v>

2019
02:02:06.081 --> 02:02:07.850
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or I'm trying to.</v>

2020
02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:13.180
<v Speaker 5>What I'm trying to do is the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that young did essentially is to </v>

2021
02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:13.180
<v Speaker 5>take a look at these old stories and </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

2022
02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:17.951
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well let's look at this from the </v>

2023
02:02:17.951 --> 02:02:19.451
<v Speaker 5>perspective of the human psyche and </v>
<v Speaker 5>let's see what the significance can be.</v>

2024
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:23.750
<v Speaker 5>And not to say that's all of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>significance there is.</v>

2025
02:02:23.810 --> 02:02:28.810
<v Speaker 5>Who knows what significance there is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One thing I have learned about the </v>

2026
02:02:28.810 --> 02:02:30.530
<v Speaker 5>biblical stories is that no matter how </v>
<v Speaker 5>deep you go into them,</v>

2027
02:02:30.531 --> 02:02:33.680
<v Speaker 5>you are not at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's been very,</v>

2028
02:02:33.681 --> 02:02:38.681
<v Speaker 5>very interesting to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and God only knows about the </v>

2029
02:02:38.681 --> 02:02:41.390
<v Speaker 5>metaphysical substructure of reality </v>
<v Speaker 5>because human beings certainly don't.</v>

2030
02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:46.810
<v Speaker 5>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to claim that what I'm </v>

2031
02:02:46.810 --> 02:02:47.690
<v Speaker 5>doing is a religious interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although you know,</v>

2032
02:02:47.691 --> 02:02:52.691
<v Speaker 5>it drifts into that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to stay within the purview of my </v>

2033
02:02:52.691 --> 02:02:54.560
<v Speaker 5>expertise such as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to say,</v>

2034
02:02:54.561 --> 02:02:57.110
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look at this psychologically,</v>

2035
02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:02.200
<v Speaker 5>here's what you can extract as as </v>
<v Speaker 5>pragmatically existentially and </v>

2036
02:03:02.391 --> 02:03:03.620
<v Speaker 5>clinically meaningful.</v>

2037
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:09.070
<v Speaker 5>And the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well the rest of it has to be left in a </v>

2038
02:03:09.070 --> 02:03:12.281
<v Speaker 5>bance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And because I don't have the pasty to </v>

2039
02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:18.400
<v Speaker 5>investigate claims that go beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that does not mean that I'm saying that </v>

2040
02:03:18.590 --> 02:03:23.120
<v Speaker 5>what I'm doing is reducing these stories</v>
<v Speaker 5>to their psychological significance.</v>

2041
02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:26.510
<v Speaker 5>Even though the psyche is a grand thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to do that.</v>

2042
02:03:26.690 --> 02:03:31.690
<v Speaker 5>It's not reductionistic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a take on it so people can make up </v>

2043
02:03:31.941 --> 02:03:36.941
<v Speaker 5>their own minds metaphysically and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>also have to make up their own minds </v>

2044
02:03:36.941 --> 02:03:38.450
<v Speaker 5>about how they're going to act.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is really the crucial issue as far</v>

2045
02:03:38.451 --> 02:03:40.340
<v Speaker 5>as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2046
02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>you bet.</v>

2047
02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:51.940
<v Speaker 8>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I had a question with respect to,</v>

2048
02:03:51.941 --> 02:03:54.010
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>data being presented I believe two weeks</v>

2049
02:03:54.011 --> 02:03:54.940
<v Speaker 8>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sorry,</v>

2050
02:03:54.941 --> 02:03:57.100
<v Speaker 8>a question with respect to data that you</v>
<v Speaker 8>presented,</v>

2051
02:03:57.101 --> 02:04:02.101
<v Speaker 8>I believe two lectures ago regarding the</v>
<v Speaker 8>use of Psilocybin in treatment of mental</v>

2052
02:04:02.921 --> 02:04:03.940
<v Speaker 8>illness.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

2053
02:04:03.941 --> 02:04:08.941
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So subsequently I looked up some of the </v>

2054
02:04:08.941 --> 02:04:11.640
<v Speaker 8>recently published literature and one of</v>
<v Speaker 8>the studies that have found extremely </v>

2055
02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:14.530
<v Speaker 8>striking was one that was published less</v>
<v Speaker 8>than a year ago in the Lancet,</v>

2056
02:04:14.531 --> 02:04:17.680
<v Speaker 8>which is a very high impact,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well respected journal.</v>

2057
02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:23.340
<v Speaker 8>And what they looked at was a efficacy </v>
<v Speaker 8>in patients with severe treatment </v>

2058
02:04:24.401 --> 02:04:28.390
<v Speaker 8>resistant depression.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And what they found is that in 11 out of</v>

2059
02:04:28.391 --> 02:04:30.100
<v Speaker 8>12 of the patients,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2060
02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:35.460
<v Speaker 8>they showed significant remittance </v>
<v Speaker 8>following just a single dose of the </v>

2061
02:04:35.561 --> 02:04:40.561
<v Speaker 8>substance ops three months following the</v>
<v Speaker 8>single dose without additional </v>

2062
02:04:40.561 --> 02:04:41.630
<v Speaker 8>devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

2063
02:04:41.670 --> 02:04:45.630
<v Speaker 8>so this not only substantiates,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I suppose my own experiences,</v>

2064
02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:50.660
<v Speaker 8>but when you read some of the commentary</v>
<v Speaker 8>or review articles surrounding these </v>

2065
02:04:51.841 --> 02:04:54.900
<v Speaker 8>types of topics now with respect to </v>
<v Speaker 8>depression,</v>

2066
02:04:54.901 --> 02:04:58.230
<v Speaker 8>but things like posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 8>disorder,</v>

2067
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:59.640
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>addiction,</v>

2068
02:05:00.150 --> 02:05:05.150
<v Speaker 8>they'll unequivocally state that these </v>
<v Speaker 8>types of results are completely </v>

2069
02:05:05.150 --> 02:05:08.610
<v Speaker 8>unprecedented in the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 8>psychiatric medicine.</v>

2070
02:05:09.150 --> 02:05:11.460
<v Speaker 8>So I was wondering if you could comment </v>
<v Speaker 8>as to whether or not,</v>

2071
02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:12.450
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that type of,</v>

2072
02:05:12.830 --> 02:05:15.960
<v Speaker 8>I guess rhetoric is overblown and if </v>
<v Speaker 8>not,</v>

2073
02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:21.040
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>do you see these being more mainstream </v>

2074
02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:23.331
<v Speaker 8>than your future or suspect that they'll</v>
<v Speaker 8>fall victim to something on wines of </v>

2075
02:05:23.331 --> 02:05:24.120
<v Speaker 8>regulatory capture?</v>

2076
02:05:24.230 --> 02:05:24.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2077
02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:27.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're overstatements and</v>

2078
02:05:27.991 --> 02:05:30.790
<v Speaker 3>I think I know some of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are engaged in this research and they're</v>

2079
02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:33.770
<v Speaker 3>actually very conservative people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're brave people,</v>

2080
02:05:34.220 --> 02:05:36.080
<v Speaker 3>but I mean conservative in the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>

2081
02:05:36.081 --> 02:05:36.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>

2082
02:05:36.770 --> 02:05:40.130
<v Speaker 3>they're not timothy leary and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to put down Timothy leary.</v>

2083
02:05:40.131 --> 02:05:42.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm really not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2084
02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:45.150
<v Speaker 3>some caution would have been a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2085
02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:47.240
<v Speaker 3>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2086
02:05:48.020 --> 02:05:51.650
<v Speaker 3>when something like when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics burst onto the scene,</v>

2087
02:05:51.651 --> 02:05:53.330
<v Speaker 3>no one had any idea what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2088
02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2089
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:55.400
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we still really don't,</v>

2090
02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:57.560
<v Speaker 3>but the new research is being conducted </v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2091
02:05:57.561 --> 02:06:02.561
<v Speaker 3>very carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is really remarkable that those </v>

2092
02:06:02.561 --> 02:06:02.561
<v Speaker 3>epithets are used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are those,</v>

2093
02:06:02.561 --> 02:06:06.170
<v Speaker 3>those terms are used to describe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>results because those are the Lancet for</v>

2094
02:06:06.171 --> 02:06:08.030
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is one of the top end medical journals.</v>

2095
02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:11.870
<v Speaker 3>If you don't see grand claims in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lancet,</v>

2096
02:06:11.871 --> 02:06:12.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2097
02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:13.960
<v Speaker 3>Scientists don't write that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

2098
02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:18.110
<v Speaker 3>they're trained from the very beginning </v>
<v Speaker 3>to downplay their results,</v>

2099
02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:23.440
<v Speaker 3>but they're quite struck by the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that these effects occur with single </v>

2100
02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:23.660
<v Speaker 3>doses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I,</v>

2101
02:06:23.780 --> 02:06:27.350
<v Speaker 3>I think that what we don't know about </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics could fill many,</v>

2102
02:06:27.351 --> 02:06:30.120
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many thick volumes and they're in.</v>

2103
02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:33.130
<v Speaker 3>They're absolutely mysterious in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>function,</v>

2104
02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:35.150
<v Speaker 3>purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>effect,</v>

2105
02:06:35.330 --> 02:06:36.950
<v Speaker 3>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>

2106
02:06:37.220 --> 02:06:42.220
<v Speaker 3>And I've always thought that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really appalling that we stopped </v>

2107
02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:42.620
<v Speaker 3>investigating them back in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>

2108
02:06:42.621 --> 02:06:44.090
<v Speaker 3>Although it's not been that long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2109
02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:48.410
<v Speaker 3>20 years historically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really nothing but,</v>

2110
02:06:48.411 --> 02:06:50.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no,</v>

2111
02:06:50.421 --> 02:06:55.421
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that there'll be that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>research will be stopped by regulatory </v>

2112
02:06:55.421 --> 02:06:58.640
<v Speaker 3>capture because the people who are doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it now I think learned their lesson from</v>

2113
02:06:58.641 --> 02:07:02.240
<v Speaker 3>what happened in the sixties and are </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it pretty damn carefully.</v>

2114
02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:07.660
<v Speaker 3>So we can hope that more results like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this are produced and that their rec </v>

2115
02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:12.130
<v Speaker 3>replicable and that perhaps build,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prove helpful with any luck.</v>

2116
02:07:13.310 --> 02:07:18.310
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi Dr Peterson.</v>

2117
02:07:21.601 --> 02:07:26.601
<v Speaker 3>I've found this lecture series really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really enthralling and no one explained </v>

2118
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:32.160
<v Speaker 3>that one time for the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's okay,</v>

2119
02:07:32.170 --> 02:07:32.840
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get late.</v>

2120
02:07:32.850 --> 02:07:35.670
<v Speaker 3>You get to the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm curious like what,</v>

2121
02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:41.480
<v Speaker 5>why do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's a strange thing to have </v>

2122
02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:44.521
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like where it's a lecturer on the Bible </v>

2123
02:07:44.521 --> 02:07:44.521
<v Speaker 5>for God Sake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2124
02:07:44.521 --> 02:07:47.050
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not something you'd go to a venture</v>

2125
02:07:47.051 --> 02:07:50.230
<v Speaker 5>capitalist with a business plan for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like what,</v>

2126
02:07:50.231 --> 02:07:55.231
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it about it you think that's </v>

2127
02:07:55.231 --> 02:07:57.090
<v Speaker 5>been that it's had that effect on you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pop asked you a question.</v>

2128
02:07:57.571 --> 02:07:57.660
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2129
02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2130
02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:04.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to put you on the spot.</v>

2131
02:08:04.291 --> 02:08:05.760
<v Speaker 5>If you want to just move to your </v>
<v Speaker 5>question,</v>

2132
02:08:05.761 --> 02:08:07.500
<v Speaker 5>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you have an answer to that,</v>

2133
02:08:07.501 --> 02:08:09.570
<v Speaker 5>I would be very interested in knowing </v>
<v Speaker 5>what it is.</v>

2134
02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:14.540
<v Speaker 7>Well hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's re,</v>

2135
02:08:14.590 --> 02:08:19.590
<v Speaker 7>it's a thrill to encounter a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>means to a metaphysical system that's so</v>

2136
02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:29.220
<v Speaker 7>persuasive and potent and I hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>really experienced that a whole lot in </v>

2137
02:08:29.231 --> 02:08:29.710
<v Speaker 7>my life.</v>

2138
02:08:30.050 --> 02:08:32.380
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what universities are supposed to</v>

2139
02:08:32.381 --> 02:08:35.680
<v Speaker 5>do for people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what universities are supposed to</v>

2140
02:08:35.681 --> 02:08:40.681
<v Speaker 5>do for people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not supposed to take people who </v>

2141
02:08:40.681 --> 02:08:41.500
<v Speaker 5>are barely hanging together and break </v>
<v Speaker 5>them and make them weak.</v>

2142
02:08:41.950 --> 02:08:44.920
<v Speaker 5>They're supposed to equate them with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>heroic,</v>

2143
02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:50.830
<v Speaker 5>heroic substructure of the human psyche </v>
<v Speaker 5>so that they can move out into the world</v>

2144
02:08:50.831 --> 02:08:54.180
<v Speaker 5>and thrive and it's an absolute crime </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2145
02:08:54.181 --> 02:08:56.920
<v Speaker 5>that isn't what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Hooray for that.</v>

2146
02:08:57.490 --> 02:09:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2147
02:09:04.850 --> 02:09:09.170
<v Speaker 7>It occurred to me that they kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>tradition and genre that you are working</v>

2148
02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:13.730
<v Speaker 7>in here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that of the sermon now?</v>

2149
02:09:13.731 --> 02:09:15.920
<v Speaker 7>Are you comfortable with that </v>
<v Speaker 7>categorization and</v>

2150
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:18.860
<v Speaker 5>we'll see where you go with it.</v>

2151
02:09:20.230 --> 02:09:20.610
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>

2152
02:09:20.730 --> 02:09:22.230
<v Speaker 7>that's the essence of my question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2153
02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:25.560
<v Speaker 7>are these sermons and might know.</v>

2154
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:28.480
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

2155
02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:30.890
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The last night one call you a preacher.</v>

2156
02:09:31.410 --> 02:09:32.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can certainly call me.</v>

2157
02:09:32.691 --> 02:09:33.860
<v Speaker 5>Why didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2158
02:09:34.100 --> 02:09:37.540
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that there,</v>

2159
02:09:37.590 --> 02:09:42.590
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a certain overlap and the </v>

2160
02:09:42.590 --> 02:09:44.531
<v Speaker 5>overlap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this has been characteristic of my </v>

2161
02:09:44.531 --> 02:09:44.531
<v Speaker 5>approach to education.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So right from the beginning,</v>

2162
02:09:44.531 --> 02:09:46.010
<v Speaker 5>because I have some rules about what I </v>
<v Speaker 5>lecture,</v>

2163
02:09:46.850 --> 02:09:50.420
<v Speaker 5>what about the topics that I lecture </v>
<v Speaker 5>about and the way that I deal with it.</v>

2164
02:09:50.421 --> 02:09:54.140
<v Speaker 5>So the first rule is I don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>tell you anything that isn't useful.</v>

2165
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:56.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm a pragmatist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2166
02:09:56.451 --> 02:10:01.451
<v Speaker 5>like I'm an American pragmatists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's part of my philosophical </v>

2167
02:10:01.451 --> 02:10:04.361
<v Speaker 5>grounding and I believe that knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 5>is tool like and that the proper thing </v>

2168
02:10:04.641 --> 02:10:09.641
<v Speaker 5>to do is to to equip people with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>tools to move effectively in the world </v>

2169
02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 5>and so I want to make sure that if I </v>
<v Speaker 5>offer a story or a fact for that matter,</v>

2170
02:10:15.771 --> 02:10:16.580
<v Speaker 5>I also say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2171
02:10:16.581 --> 02:10:18.830
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's why you need to know this fact.</v>

2172
02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:23.180
<v Speaker 5>It will actually improve your life or </v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll stop you from wandering into a pit</v>

2173
02:10:23.181 --> 02:10:28.181
<v Speaker 5>which is approximately the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it will also knowing this will </v>

2174
02:10:28.181 --> 02:10:32.531
<v Speaker 5>also make you more effective actor in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the social world and that will improve </v>

2175
02:10:32.531 --> 02:10:32.540
<v Speaker 5>the social world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2176
02:10:32.541 --> 02:10:34.910
<v Speaker 5>and hopefully will improve the </v>
<v Speaker 5>environmental world,</v>

2177
02:10:34.911 --> 02:10:35.810
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

2178
02:10:36.170 --> 02:10:41.170
<v Speaker 5>And so I would say to the degree that </v>
<v Speaker 5>those who produce sermons are concerned </v>

2179
02:10:41.170 --> 02:10:45.020
<v Speaker 5>with producing alterations in behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is our moral alterations.</v>

2180
02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:48.080
<v Speaker 5>Say then I share the same territory with</v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

2181
02:10:48.081 --> 02:10:53.081
<v Speaker 5>but I wouldn't say that that's something</v>
<v Speaker 5>that should be only relegated to the </v>

2182
02:10:53.081 --> 02:10:55.580
<v Speaker 5>domain of the sermon because I believe </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it is the job of the universities.</v>

2183
02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:58.910
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in the damned humanities,</v>

2184
02:10:59.390 --> 02:11:04.390
<v Speaker 5>to ennoble people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And to enable them to adopt the mantle </v>

2185
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:08.771
<v Speaker 5>of proper citizenship and that we've </v>
<v Speaker 5>forgotten that we've forgotten that or </v>

2186
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:12.230
<v Speaker 5>we're avoiding it or refusing it or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that,</v>

2187
02:11:12.630 --> 02:11:15.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think we're using the death of God</v>

2188
02:11:15.231 --> 02:11:16.340
<v Speaker 5>as an excuse.</v>

2189
02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:20.090
<v Speaker 5>So I think that to the degree that I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 5>preacher,</v>

2190
02:11:20.091 --> 02:11:21.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm making an error,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2191
02:11:21.801 --> 02:11:24.620
<v Speaker 5>and also to the degree that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>politicized,</v>

2192
02:11:24.621 --> 02:11:25.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm making an error.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2193
02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:29.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm wondering out of my proper territory</v>
<v Speaker 5>when that's the domain that I meant,</v>

2194
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:34.990
<v Speaker 5>but when I'm attempting to assemble </v>
<v Speaker 5>multiple layers of facts towards a </v>

2195
02:11:35.151 --> 02:11:40.151
<v Speaker 5>practical end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what I'm trying to do in the </v>

2196
02:11:40.151 --> 02:11:40.550
<v Speaker 5>end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the enablement of the individual.</v>

2197
02:11:40.551 --> 02:11:41.810
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's my goal.</v>

2198
02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:45.710
<v Speaker 5>Then then I'm in my proper domain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to make mistakes,</v>

2199
02:11:45.711 --> 02:11:50.711
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to wander out of my territory </v>

2200
02:11:50.711 --> 02:11:50.711
<v Speaker 5>and I try not to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

2201
02:11:50.711 --> 02:11:51.290
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2202
02:11:51.291 --> 02:11:53.690
<v Speaker 5>it's part of being a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to make mistakes.</v>

2203
02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:55.850
<v Speaker 5>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thanks very much.</v>

2204
02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

2205
02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:07.010
<v Speaker 9>Thanks for continuing to do all the cool</v>
<v Speaker 9>stuff that makes everyone love you.</v>

2206
02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:09.420
<v Speaker 9>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Not everyone will.</v>

2207
02:12:09.421 --> 02:12:09.990
<v Speaker 9>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

2208
02:12:09.991 --> 02:12:11.490
<v Speaker 9>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's a generalization.</v>

2209
02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:16.710
<v Speaker 9>There's lots of people that seem not to </v>
<v Speaker 9>love me and I can't blame really.</v>

2210
02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:18.420
<v Speaker 9>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2211
02:12:18.421 --> 02:12:23.421
<v Speaker 9>I'm going to lead into a question here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So in your book maps book maps of </v>

2212
02:12:23.911 --> 02:12:25.580
<v Speaker 9>meaning a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2213
02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:30.180
<v Speaker 9>you got that quote from,</v>
<v Speaker 9>does he ask you about how humankind,</v>

2214
02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:35.240
<v Speaker 9>mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you give them all the cakes and the </v>

2215
02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:35.240
<v Speaker 9>world.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh my God.</v>

2216
02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:36.250
<v Speaker 9>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you get all my</v>

2217
02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:37.200
<v Speaker 5>God is right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2218
02:12:37.201 --> 02:12:40.400
<v Speaker 5>That's one killer quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's from notes from the underground.</v>

2219
02:12:40.401 --> 02:12:45.401
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone should read that because </v>

2220
02:12:45.401 --> 02:12:47.241
<v Speaker 5>everyone's underground and it's a great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a great little journey through </v>

2221
02:12:47.241 --> 02:12:47.241
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2222
02:12:47.241 --> 02:12:48.600
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So it's basically,</v>

2223
02:12:48.610 --> 02:12:49.430
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you give.</v>

2224
02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:53.000
<v Speaker 9>If you have the perfect utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I often use this.</v>

2225
02:12:53.060 --> 02:12:58.060
<v Speaker 9>If you have the most perfect utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 9>humans will find a way to screw it up.</v>

2226
02:12:59.540 --> 02:13:00.980
<v Speaker 9>They'll go out of the.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2227
02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:03.390
<v Speaker 9>because we thought we liked,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we liked chaos and the unknown.</v>

2228
02:13:03.391 --> 02:13:05.200
<v Speaker 9>You've talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's the</v>

2229
02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:07.410
<v Speaker 5>thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that were heroic adventurers,</v>

2230
02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:08.440
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not,</v>

2231
02:13:08.770 --> 02:13:12.460
<v Speaker 5>we're not sybarites laying on a beach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although when you get the opportunity to</v>

2232
02:13:12.461 --> 02:13:14.080
<v Speaker 5>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like make sure you take it,</v>

2233
02:13:14.110 --> 02:13:15.910
<v Speaker 5>but that's not what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not,</v>

2234
02:13:16.090 --> 02:13:18.460
<v Speaker 5>that's not the proper calling of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>human soul,</v>

2235
02:13:18.461 --> 02:13:18.970
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're,</v>

2236
02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:23.380
<v Speaker 5>we're out there to conquer chaos and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>unknown and it's in that we find meaning</v>

2237
02:13:23.381 --> 02:13:26.170
<v Speaker 5>and that's better than the utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what Dostoevsky,</v>

2238
02:13:26.650 --> 02:13:31.650
<v Speaker 5>God bless his soul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dostoevsky had that he was such a </v>

2239
02:13:31.650 --> 02:13:35.221
<v Speaker 5>genius.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had everything that was wrong with </v>

2240
02:13:35.221 --> 02:13:35.610
<v Speaker 5>communism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>figured out even before it started.</v>

2241
02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:37.350
<v Speaker 5>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>

2242
02:13:37.351 --> 02:13:40.170
<v Speaker 5>like if you read the possessed or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>devil's,</v>

2243
02:13:40.171 --> 02:13:42.840
<v Speaker 5>which I would highly recommend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although it's a hard book to get into,</v>

2244
02:13:42.841 --> 02:13:44.610
<v Speaker 5>it takes about 100 pages to read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get,</v>

2245
02:13:44.730 --> 02:13:45.570
<v Speaker 5>get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get,</v>

2246
02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:47.040
<v Speaker 5>get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>moving.</v>

2247
02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:52.460
<v Speaker 5>But Dostoyevsky he talks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His main character in that novel is a </v>

2248
02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:53.220
<v Speaker 5>person who's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

2249
02:13:53.221 --> 02:13:58.221
<v Speaker 5>a very powerful person who's completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>possessed by what's essentially the </v>

2250
02:13:58.221 --> 02:14:01.701
<v Speaker 5>communist ideology and he's very </v>
<v Speaker 5>effective at moving it forward and </v>

2251
02:14:01.701 --> 02:14:05.391
<v Speaker 5>Dostoevsky lays out brilliantly exactly </v>
<v Speaker 5>the catastrophic consequences of that </v>

2252
02:14:05.391 --> 02:14:08.670
<v Speaker 5>both personally and socially.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he did this like 30 years before the</v>

2253
02:14:08.670 --> 02:14:09.210
<v Speaker 5>Russian revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

2254
02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:12.570
<v Speaker 5>it's uncanny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where the hell that guy was</v>

2255
02:14:12.571 --> 02:14:14.610
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Must've been his epilepsy,</v>

2256
02:14:14.611 --> 02:14:15.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2257
02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:17.600
<v Speaker 9>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm glad I got you all excited.</v>

2258
02:14:17.601 --> 02:14:20.480
<v Speaker 9>I'm just gonna keep going here.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Basically,</v>

2259
02:14:20.481 --> 02:14:22.200
<v Speaker 9>I used to use that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2260
02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:23.450
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's kind of fleet to,</v>

2261
02:14:23.451 --> 02:14:28.451
<v Speaker 9>a lot of that comes from the left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this utopia we're going towards with </v>

2262
02:14:28.451 --> 02:14:29.190
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>with the universal income and it's gonna</v>

2263
02:14:29.210 --> 02:14:34.210
<v Speaker 9>be ai and suddenly the whole population </v>
<v Speaker 9>is going to becoming insanely creative </v>

2264
02:14:34.210 --> 02:14:34.760
<v Speaker 9>and with no incentive,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's not.</v>

2265
02:14:35.210 --> 02:14:40.210
<v Speaker 9>Utopia is not there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's not like this thing that hasn't </v>

2266
02:14:40.210 --> 02:14:40.210
<v Speaker 9>happened yet.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We're in it,</v>

2267
02:14:40.210 --> 02:14:41.330
<v Speaker 9>we're in it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This is the best thing ever.</v>

2268
02:14:41.331 --> 02:14:44.510
<v Speaker 9>And like all of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the Western civilization like,</v>

2269
02:14:44.511 --> 02:14:49.511
<v Speaker 9>oh my printing the material sense.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean it just toilet paper,</v>

2270
02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:51.800
<v Speaker 9>toilet paper just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Anyway,</v>

2271
02:14:52.010 --> 02:14:55.960
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that's so serious.</v>

2272
02:15:01.110 --> 02:15:03.240
<v Speaker 9>So we have this beautiful thing and </v>
<v Speaker 9>people are,</v>

2273
02:15:03.250 --> 02:15:08.250
<v Speaker 9>are,</v>
<v Speaker 9>are trying to take it down at all costs </v>

2274
02:15:08.250 --> 02:15:08.390
<v Speaker 9>and now we go into the dark phase of my </v>
<v Speaker 9>life,</v>

2275
02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:13.640
<v Speaker 9>into my question here,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is actually goes into </v>

2276
02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:15.420
<v Speaker 9>Charlottesville.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Had you know,</v>

2277
02:15:15.730 --> 02:15:16.470
<v Speaker 9>with,</v>
<v Speaker 9>with that,</v>

2278
02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:21.520
<v Speaker 9>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>with the initial purpose of protecting </v>

2279
02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:21.520
<v Speaker 9>the statue.</v>

2280
02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:23.180
<v Speaker 9>Was it good thing?</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't,</v>

2281
02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:23.930
<v Speaker 9>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm not,</v>

2282
02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:26.780
<v Speaker 9>I don't know about confederacy except </v>
<v Speaker 9>for the big thing,</v>

2283
02:15:27.110 --> 02:15:30.260
<v Speaker 9>but honestly it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's a slippery,</v>

2284
02:15:30.261 --> 02:15:34.160
<v Speaker 9>slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And the confused souls who and the bad,</v>

2285
02:15:34.250 --> 02:15:38.150
<v Speaker 9>they just darkened soles for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Not Good.</v>

2286
02:15:38.450 --> 02:15:43.450
<v Speaker 9>They screwed up big time because the </v>
<v Speaker 9>purpose behind it is so important </v>

2287
02:15:43.450 --> 02:15:45.890
<v Speaker 9>because it's going to be fought founding</v>
<v Speaker 9>fathers next.</v>

2288
02:15:45.891 --> 02:15:50.891
<v Speaker 9>Anyone who ever contributed anything to </v>
<v Speaker 9>Western civilization as we know it is </v>

2289
02:15:50.891 --> 02:15:50.990
<v Speaker 9>already being.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's already being done.</v>

2290
02:15:50.991 --> 02:15:55.991
<v Speaker 9>James Madison High School in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's getting renamed because some girls </v>

2291
02:15:56.031 --> 02:15:58.250
<v Speaker 9>from random,</v>
<v Speaker 9>one student felt unsafe.</v>

2292
02:15:58.460 --> 02:16:00.830
<v Speaker 9>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this is a serious issue.</v>

2293
02:16:00.831 --> 02:16:05.831
<v Speaker 9>And I wanted like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I feel like we're really up against the </v>

2294
02:16:05.831 --> 02:16:06.710
<v Speaker 9>wall now because now they found they're </v>
<v Speaker 9>Nazis,</v>

2295
02:16:06.711 --> 02:16:08.960
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The Nazis are flooding the streets now.</v>

2296
02:16:08.961 --> 02:16:11.690
<v Speaker 9>So how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how do we possibly,</v>

2297
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:13.910
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>kind of save our cakes.</v>

2298
02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:25.590
<v Speaker 5>You had to bring it up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't ya?</v>

2299
02:16:33.890 --> 02:16:38.890
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having the right degenerate into </v>

2300
02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:38.890
<v Speaker 5>identity politics does not seem to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>part,</v>

2301
02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:43.860
<v Speaker 5>a positive solution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So one of the things I would say is </v>

2302
02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:46.331
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I understand why the identity </v>

2303
02:16:46.331 --> 02:16:49.060
<v Speaker 5>politics that is being practiced so </v>
<v Speaker 5>assiduously and so devastating,</v>

2304
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:52.730
<v Speaker 5>Lee by the left has been cooptive by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2305
02:16:52.940 --> 02:16:57.940
<v Speaker 5>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then here's what I would say to the </v>

2306
02:16:57.940 --> 02:16:58.490
<v Speaker 5>people on the right who are playing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>

2307
02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:03.230
<v Speaker 5>If you play the game of your enemies and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you win,</v>

2308
02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:06.710
<v Speaker 5>you win their game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't win.</v>

2309
02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:12.040
<v Speaker 5>That's not victory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just become the most successful </v>

2310
02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:14.450
<v Speaker 5>exponent of their pathology was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How was that a good thing?</v>

2311
02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:19.610
<v Speaker 5>It's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what does that leave people as old as</v>

2312
02:17:19.611 --> 02:17:21.740
<v Speaker 5>an alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2313
02:17:22.970 --> 02:17:26.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that the Caucasians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

2314
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:30.860
<v Speaker 5>should revert to being white.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a bad idea.</v>

2315
02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:36.160
<v Speaker 5>It's a dangerous idea and it's coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>fast and I don't like to see that.</v>

2316
02:17:37.370 --> 02:17:42.370
<v Speaker 5>I think the whole group identity thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>is seriously pathological.</v>

2317
02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:45.140
<v Speaker 5>I think we've made big mistakes in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Canada.</v>

2318
02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:50.590
<v Speaker 5>I understand why at least to some degree</v>
<v Speaker 5>in that respect and that large mistakes </v>

2319
02:17:50.590 --> 02:17:55.391
<v Speaker 5>are being made all over the western </v>
<v Speaker 5>world where we're making your group </v>

2320
02:17:55.391 --> 02:17:57.470
<v Speaker 5>identity the most important thing about </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2321
02:17:58.010 --> 02:18:02.690
<v Speaker 5>I think that's reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's devastating.</v>

2322
02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:05.690
<v Speaker 5>I think it's genocidal in its ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>expression.</v>

2323
02:18:05.930 --> 02:18:09.320
<v Speaker 5>I think it will bring down our </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization if we pursue it.</v>

2324
02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:14.830
<v Speaker 5>We shouldn't be playing that game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what's the alternative?</v>

2325
02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:19.950
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've thought for a long time about a </v>

2326
02:18:19.950 --> 02:18:20.770
<v Speaker 5>political career really forever since I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like 12,</v>

2327
02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:25.830
<v Speaker 5>really for a long time and I've always </v>
<v Speaker 5>decided against it because it seemed to </v>

2328
02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:30.721
<v Speaker 5>me that the proper level of analysis </v>
<v Speaker 5>with regards to the solution of the </v>

2329
02:18:30.791 --> 02:18:32.980
<v Speaker 5>problem that we're facing isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>political.</v>

2330
02:18:33.130 --> 02:18:38.130
<v Speaker 5>And that's why I think it's a mistake </v>
<v Speaker 5>when what I'm doing gets politicized </v>

2331
02:18:38.130 --> 02:18:41.881
<v Speaker 5>either by me or others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that the way that you deal with </v>

2332
02:18:41.881 --> 02:18:45.931
<v Speaker 5>this is to put yourself together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really believe that is that because I </v>

2333
02:18:45.931 --> 02:18:47.890
<v Speaker 5>think that individual people are far </v>
<v Speaker 5>more powerful.</v>

2334
02:18:47.891 --> 02:18:50.590
<v Speaker 5>There's certainly far more evil than </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're willing to consider,</v>

2335
02:18:50.770 --> 02:18:53.500
<v Speaker 5>but that's also a sign of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>unbelievable power.</v>

2336
02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:59.400
<v Speaker 5>So I think that what you do is you aim </v>
<v Speaker 5>high and put yourself together and stay </v>

2337
02:19:01.211 --> 02:19:05.050
<v Speaker 5>the hell away from the idiot logs </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're hiding.</v>

2338
02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:10.260
<v Speaker 5>They're hiding behind a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not able to come out and fight </v>

2339
02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:13.381
<v Speaker 5>on their own behalf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the way forward through the of </v>

2340
02:19:13.381 --> 02:19:17.490
<v Speaker 5>the logical mass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's the lesson of Western </v>

2341
02:19:17.490 --> 02:19:19.831
<v Speaker 5>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is to place the individual at the place </v>

2342
02:19:19.831 --> 02:19:23.281
<v Speaker 5>of paramount importance and to make the </v>
<v Speaker 5>group identity emerge only when </v>

2343
02:19:23.351 --> 02:19:26.530
<v Speaker 5>necessary and secondarily,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if ever.</v>

2344
02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:29.630
<v Speaker 5>And so you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can do that now.</v>

2345
02:19:29.631 --> 02:19:32.090
<v Speaker 5>You can do that tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you can put your life together.</v>

2346
02:19:32.091 --> 02:19:32.730
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>

2347
02:19:32.810 --> 02:19:35.750
<v Speaker 5>as I mentioned to the other young man </v>
<v Speaker 5>who asked the question is,</v>

2348
02:19:36.140 --> 02:19:38.660
<v Speaker 5>you won't hurt anyone doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2349
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:42.380
<v Speaker 5>You pick up your goddamn responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>certain yourself out,</v>

2350
02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.300
<v Speaker 5>fix up your family,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2351
02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:46.670
<v Speaker 5>And then you can be a force for good in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the culture.</v>

2352
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:51.790
<v Speaker 5>And if enough people do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ideological mass will just </v>

2353
02:19:51.790 --> 02:19:51.790
<v Speaker 5>evaporate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll just disappear.</v>

2354
02:19:51.890 --> 02:19:56.890
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the way you show people </v>
<v Speaker 5>the right path forward to is that you </v>

2355
02:19:56.890 --> 02:19:56.890
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2356
02:19:56.890 --> 02:19:56.890
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2357
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:59.150
<v Speaker 5>we would like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would like it so much.</v>

2358
02:19:59.151 --> 02:20:03.740
<v Speaker 5>If you could thrive as an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drop your cult like affiliation,</v>

2359
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:05.780
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Step out of the shadows,</v>

2360
02:20:05.781 --> 02:20:10.781
<v Speaker 5>the demonic shadows your ideological </v>
<v Speaker 5>possession and step forward as a fully </v>

2361
02:20:11.331 --> 02:20:15.200
<v Speaker 5>developed person into the light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do it by example.</v>

2362
02:20:15.410 --> 02:20:17.990
<v Speaker 5>That's your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's your best Batman.</v>

2363
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:20.390
<v Speaker 5>So that's what it looks like to me.</v>

2364
02:20:23.820 --> 02:20:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2365
02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:34.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to take one more question and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then I'm going to.</v>

2366
02:20:34.210 --> 02:20:38.400

<v Speaker 5>and then I'm going to let you take the </v>

2374
02:20:57.351 --> 02:21:01.130

02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:09.761
<v Speaker 10>increasing your views on youtube because</v>
<v Speaker 10>I flew in from Belgium last night to be </v>

2377
02:21:09.761 --> 02:21:09.770
<v Speaker 10>here</v>

2378
02:21:15.630 --> 02:21:18.140
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2379
02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Right</v>

2380
02:21:18.410 --> 02:21:20.580
<v Speaker 10>now.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And English is not my first language.</v>

2381
02:21:20.581 --> 02:21:24.100
<v Speaker 10>So bear with me.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

2382
02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:29.700
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I would have many burning questions to </v>

2383
02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:32.871
<v Speaker 10>ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but I thought it was fair and necessary </v>

2384
02:21:32.871 --> 02:21:35.601
<v Speaker 10>to pick one and it would be this one.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There are concepts that recur in your </v>

2385
02:21:35.851 --> 02:21:40.851
<v Speaker 10>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but this one you only mentioned once in </v>

2386
02:21:40.851 --> 02:21:43.971
<v Speaker 10>your early videos on bill 16.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm about self esteem.</v>

2387
02:21:44.100 --> 02:21:47.310
<v Speaker 10>You said you don't believe in the </v>
<v Speaker 10>existence of self esteem,</v>

2388
02:21:47.340 --> 02:21:49.470
<v Speaker 10>the wind to teach children.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They're all special.</v>

2389
02:21:49.471 --> 02:21:54.471
<v Speaker 10>You think you boost their confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but the only result is that some get </v>

2390
02:21:54.471 --> 02:21:57.930
<v Speaker 10>narcissistic.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The reason why I'm interested in that is</v>

2391
02:21:57.931 --> 02:22:02.931
<v Speaker 10>about standing up for yourself and it </v>
<v Speaker 10>is,</v>

2392
02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:06.810
<v Speaker 10>and when I tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2393
02:22:07.410 --> 02:22:08.860
<v Speaker 10>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yep.</v>

2394
02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:14.000
<v Speaker 10>I see that I'm rational arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Faith in rationality doesn't get the </v>

2395
02:22:16.171 --> 02:22:21.171
<v Speaker 10>best results in negotiations.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's why you learn how to be </v>

2396
02:22:21.171 --> 02:22:24.030
<v Speaker 10>socialized by playing rough and tumble.</v>

2397
02:22:24.510 --> 02:22:28.500
<v Speaker 10>It's not an intellectual conversation </v>
<v Speaker 10>that gets you socialized.</v>

2398
02:22:29.010 --> 02:22:34.010
<v Speaker 10>So I'm also reading that book is </v>
<v Speaker 10>suggested about a by Steven Hicks </v>

2399
02:22:34.010 --> 02:22:38.450
<v Speaker 10>explaining postmodernism because I </v>
<v Speaker 10>wasn't really familiar and I've been </v>

2400
02:22:38.450 --> 02:22:39.330
<v Speaker 10>listening to a lot for talking to him </v>
<v Speaker 10>later this week.</v>

2401
02:22:39.331 --> 02:22:44.331
<v Speaker 10>So that might be fun and I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 10>read with fresh eyes because I've been </v>

2402
02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:49.550
<v Speaker 10>indoctrinated by you of course are very </v>
<v Speaker 10>critical and there's one more point that</v>

2403
02:22:50.161 --> 02:22:55.161
<v Speaker 10>I have to agree with the postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 10>and that is the world seems to me as I </v>

2404
02:22:56.671 --> 02:23:00.450
<v Speaker 10>observe it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a place where powers are play.</v>

2405
02:23:01.140 --> 02:23:03.210
<v Speaker 10>It's not rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Delete that.</v>

2406
02:23:03.570 --> 02:23:08.280
<v Speaker 10>So when I'm in a weak position and I </v>
<v Speaker 10>want to fight back not to get resentful,</v>

2407
02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:13.110
<v Speaker 10>I find that it's not a rational argument</v>
<v Speaker 10>that will get me there.</v>

2408
02:23:13.140 --> 02:23:16.200
<v Speaker 10>There's something else that I don't do </v>
<v Speaker 10>and that I should be doing it.</v>

2409
02:23:16.201 --> 02:23:17.540
<v Speaker 10>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Right?</v>

2410
02:23:18.150 --> 02:23:22.080
<v Speaker 10>So you see the relationship with self </v>
<v Speaker 10>esteem seems to me that people who think</v>

2411
02:23:22.081 --> 02:23:25.850
<v Speaker 10>of themselves start in a better position</v>
<v Speaker 10>in,</v>

2412
02:23:26.090 --> 02:23:26.970
<v Speaker 10>in this game.</v>

2413
02:23:27.010 --> 02:23:27.720
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

2414
02:23:27.721 --> 02:23:28.620
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2415
02:23:28.680 --> 02:23:29.390
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

2416
02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:31.350
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a lot in that question.</v>

2417
02:23:31.351 --> 02:23:36.351
<v Speaker 5>So the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there's a problem with the </v>

2418
02:23:36.351 --> 02:23:39.651
<v Speaker 5>measurement of self esteem and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually matters because self esteem is </v>

2419
02:23:39.651 --> 02:23:42.030
<v Speaker 5>a psychological concept,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a scientific concept if you like,</v>

2420
02:23:42.300 --> 02:23:47.300
<v Speaker 5>and you have to get the measurement </v>
<v Speaker 5>right and you can predict self esteem </v>

2421
02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:50.631
<v Speaker 5>almost perfectly by measuring someone's </v>
<v Speaker 5>extroversion and subtracting from that.</v>

2422
02:23:51.031 --> 02:23:53.160
<v Speaker 5>They're negative emotionality or </v>
<v Speaker 5>neuroticism.</v>

2423
02:23:53.161 --> 02:23:55.650
<v Speaker 5>So it's actually just a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 5>big five traits.</v>

2424
02:23:55.651 --> 02:24:00.651
<v Speaker 5>And so people who are extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who feel a lot of positive emotion and </v>

2425
02:24:00.651 --> 02:24:04.770
<v Speaker 5>who are and who don't feel a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>negative emotion score high on scales of</v>

2426
02:24:04.771 --> 02:24:06.630
<v Speaker 5>self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2427
02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:11.660
<v Speaker 5>So conceptually it's a nonstarter </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're not going to move </v>

2428
02:24:13.441 --> 02:24:15.900
<v Speaker 5>people's levels of neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

2429
02:24:16.050 --> 02:24:18.600
<v Speaker 5>by trying to get them to feel good about</v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>

2430
02:24:19.050 --> 02:24:21.180
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now having said that,</v>

2431
02:24:21.210 --> 02:24:24.660
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't mean that you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>encourage people.</v>

2432
02:24:25.050 --> 02:24:30.050
<v Speaker 5>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this psychologist named Jerome </v>

2433
02:24:30.050 --> 02:24:32.220
<v Speaker 5>Kagan who's quite a great psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>developmental psychologist.</v>

2434
02:24:32.650 --> 02:24:34.740
<v Speaker 5>I think he's an emeritus at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the,</v>

2435
02:24:34.980 --> 02:24:38.510
<v Speaker 5>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the moment he studied temperamentally</v>

2436
02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:40.230
<v Speaker 5>inhibited children.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2437
02:24:40.390 --> 02:24:45.390
<v Speaker 5>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they are basically kids who are high </v>

2438
02:24:45.390 --> 02:24:45.390
<v Speaker 5>in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably low in extroversion.</v>

2439
02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:50.600
<v Speaker 5>And he found that if those children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can identify them as early as six </v>

2440
02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:50.600
<v Speaker 5>months,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2441
02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:52.170
<v Speaker 5>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very inculcated in their temperament.</v>

2442
02:24:52.620 --> 02:24:57.620
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he found that if you encouraged them in </v>

2443
02:24:57.620 --> 02:25:01.101
<v Speaker 5>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could shift them into a more stable </v>

2444
02:25:01.101 --> 02:25:02.760
<v Speaker 5>personality configuration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what you basically did was when they</v>

2445
02:25:02.761 --> 02:25:07.761
<v Speaker 5>were manifesting signs of distress,</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of encouraging them to withdraw </v>

2446
02:25:07.761 --> 02:25:12.621
<v Speaker 5>and retreat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what they might be attempting </v>

2447
02:25:12.621 --> 02:25:15.441
<v Speaker 5>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you encourage them to go out and </v>

2448
02:25:15.441 --> 02:25:15.441
<v Speaker 5>explore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>

2449
02:25:15.441 --> 02:25:19.431
<v Speaker 5>if you have a temperamentally inhibited </v>
<v Speaker 5>Charles and you go to a playground and </v>

2450
02:25:19.431 --> 02:25:19.830
<v Speaker 5>there's kids out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you have an extroverted,</v>

2451
02:25:19.831 --> 02:25:22.740
<v Speaker 5>emotionally stable kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three years old,</v>

2452
02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:26.440
<v Speaker 5>as you put them on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their feet are already moving,</v>

2453
02:25:26.470 --> 02:25:26.770
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2454
02:25:26.770 --> 02:25:30.160
<v Speaker 5>Like a puppy over water and you let them</v>
<v Speaker 5>go and they just run to the,</v>

2455
02:25:30.450 --> 02:25:33.250
<v Speaker 5>to the kits and they're there and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to drag them away.</v>

2456
02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:35.290
<v Speaker 5>But if you ever temperamentally </v>
<v Speaker 5>inhibited child,</v>

2457
02:25:35.291 --> 02:25:40.291
<v Speaker 5>the child will sort of stand around your</v>
<v Speaker 5>legs and sort of peek out and then what </v>

2458
02:25:40.291 --> 02:25:43.540
<v Speaker 5>you do is wait it out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let them watch,</v>

2459
02:25:43.810 --> 02:25:47.170
<v Speaker 5>encourage them to move a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>forward and encourage them to take their</v>

2460
02:25:47.171 --> 02:25:49.810
<v Speaker 5>steps out into the unknown and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>strange land.</v>

2461
02:25:50.170 --> 02:25:53.140
<v Speaker 5>And don't let them withdraw like you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>do it.</v>

2462
02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:54.700
<v Speaker 5>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're slower to warm up,</v>

2463
02:25:54.701 --> 02:25:56.200
<v Speaker 5>they'll warm up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll habituate,</v>

2464
02:25:56.470 --> 02:26:01.470
<v Speaker 5>and if you continually expose you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>inhibited child to the things that make </v>

2465
02:26:01.751 --> 02:26:06.751
<v Speaker 5>them anxious in measured doses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you can transform their </v>

2466
02:26:06.751 --> 02:26:09.991
<v Speaker 5>psychophysiological temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you're probably not going to shift </v>

2467
02:26:09.991 --> 02:26:10.510
<v Speaker 5>them way the hell out onto the </v>
<v Speaker 5>extroverted,</v>

2468
02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:14.110
<v Speaker 5>emotionally stable land,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can make a big difference that's</v>

2469
02:26:14.111 --> 02:26:17.020
<v Speaker 5>very different than making them feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>good about themselves,</v>

2470
02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:20.320
<v Speaker 5>which is such a need to curse.</v>

2471
02:26:20.470 --> 02:26:23.230
<v Speaker 5>You need to curse when you discuss that </v>
<v Speaker 5>concept.</v>

2472
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:28.710
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it isn't the improved their self </v>

2473
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:29.650
<v Speaker 5>esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it isn't how you feel about yourself,</v>

2474
02:26:29.651 --> 02:26:34.651
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's how you act effectively in the </v>

2475
02:26:34.651 --> 02:26:34.780
<v Speaker 5>world and how you're trained to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

2476
02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:39.840
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now then you were talking about </v>

2477
02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:39.840
<v Speaker 5>negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2478
02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:39.840
<v Speaker 5>And you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well don't.</v>

2479
02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:44.310
<v Speaker 5>You said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't people who feel good about </v>

2480
02:26:44.310 --> 02:26:44.890
<v Speaker 5>themselves aren't they able to negotiate</v>
<v Speaker 5>better and it's.</v>

2481
02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:47.170
<v Speaker 5>I know that's a poor paraphrase,</v>
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

2482
02:26:47.171 --> 02:26:52.030
<v Speaker 5>but I'm in negotiations actually a </v>
<v Speaker 5>practical issue to some degree,</v>

2483
02:26:52.090 --> 02:26:57.090
<v Speaker 5>like the first thing is that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out what you want because you </v>

2484
02:26:57.090 --> 02:26:57.090
<v Speaker 5>were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2485
02:26:57.090 --> 02:26:57.610
<v Speaker 5>it's not merely rational.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2486
02:26:57.611 --> 02:26:58.030
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2487
02:26:58.031 --> 02:27:03.031
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to bargain from a position of </v>

2488
02:27:03.031 --> 02:27:03.031
<v Speaker 5>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say not power.</v>

2489
02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:08.120
<v Speaker 5>Authority is a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't have authority unless you </v>

2490
02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:09.400
<v Speaker 5>know what you're talking about and </v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you can bring some.</v>

2491
02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:12.660
<v Speaker 5>Unless you can bring some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say force.</v>

2492
02:27:12.670 --> 02:27:14.140
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not the right word.</v>

2493
02:27:16.270 --> 02:27:21.270
<v Speaker 5>You can negotiate without anyone unless </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can say no and you can't say no </v>

2494
02:27:21.371 --> 02:27:23.410
<v Speaker 5>unless you've set yourself up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>alternatives.</v>

2495
02:27:23.950 --> 02:27:26.860
<v Speaker 5>So when you go to your boss and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>negotiate for a raise,</v>

2496
02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:32.160
<v Speaker 5>you need to have the sort of CV that </v>
<v Speaker 5>enables you to go find another job and </v>

2497
02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:35.701
<v Speaker 5>you have to have your cv prepared and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to have looked for another job </v>

2498
02:27:35.701 --> 02:27:39.270
<v Speaker 5>and you have to be able to get one </v>
<v Speaker 5>because then you can go in there and </v>

2499
02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:39.270
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm.</v>

2500
02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:43.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm not as productive as I could be at </v>
<v Speaker 5>my current level of remuneration.</v>

2501
02:27:43.420 --> 02:27:46.440
<v Speaker 5>It's not reflective of what I'm able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do and a,</v>

2502
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:49.090
<v Speaker 5>I want this and this is what will happen</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you give me this.</v>

2503
02:27:49.091 --> 02:27:52.090
<v Speaker 5>This will be the good things that will </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen and what do you think of that?</v>

2504
02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:57.120
<v Speaker 5>And the person is going to know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even by the way that you hold yourself </v>

2505
02:27:57.120 --> 02:28:01.891
<v Speaker 5>while you're having the discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether or not you're someone with </v>

2506
02:28:01.891 --> 02:28:03.190
<v Speaker 5>options and you can't fake that while </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>

2507
02:28:03.220 --> 02:28:06.610
<v Speaker 5>but it's not helpful like it just </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't work for very many iterations.</v>

2508
02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:08.410
<v Speaker 5>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's it's.</v>

2509
02:28:08.470 --> 02:28:11.380
<v Speaker 5>It's not rational.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're preparing yourself for battle.</v>

2510
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:14.630
<v Speaker 5>That's what you're doing and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>be weak when you prefer it.</v>

2511
02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:17.320
<v Speaker 5>Prepare yourself for battle because if </v>
<v Speaker 5>the person says,</v>

2512
02:28:17.321 --> 02:28:19.990
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not giving you a raise,</v>

2513
02:28:19.991 --> 02:28:22.000
<v Speaker 5>which is exactly what they should say </v>
<v Speaker 5>because what are they going</v>

2514
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.810
<v Speaker 2>to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like sprinkled the money around.</v>

2515
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:26.030
<v Speaker 2>You need to be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2516
02:28:26.031 --> 02:28:31.031
<v Speaker 2>then there will be consequences that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like and that's what it means to </v>

2517
02:28:31.521 --> 02:28:35.330
<v Speaker 2>say no to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No means if you continue to push this,</v>

2518
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:38.150
<v Speaker 2>things will happen that you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in that case,</v>

2519
02:28:38.151 --> 02:28:43.151
<v Speaker 2>it will be all depart and take my </v>
<v Speaker 2>talents with me and if they don't care </v>

2520
02:28:43.151 --> 02:28:46.961
<v Speaker 2>well then you're in the wrong business </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you don't have any talents to begin </v>

2521
02:28:46.961 --> 02:28:46.961
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2522
02:28:46.961 --> 02:28:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Which is so in order to negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

2523
02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:51.710
<v Speaker 2>and this is more difficult for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are agreeable,</v>

2524
02:28:51.711 --> 02:28:56.711
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there tend to be more conflict </v>

2525
02:28:56.711 --> 02:28:58.841
<v Speaker 2>averse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to put yourself in a position </v>

2526
02:28:58.841 --> 02:29:02.230
<v Speaker 2>where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can push back as hard as you're </v>

2527
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:03.910
<v Speaker 2>going to be pushed on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means you have to open your.</v>

2528
02:29:03.970 --> 02:29:08.970
<v Speaker 2>You have to open up your space of </v>
<v Speaker 2>available options because otherwise the </v>

2529
02:29:08.970 --> 02:29:10.610
<v Speaker 2>person says no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's it.</v>

2530
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:12.740
<v Speaker 2>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you'll lose them.</v>

2531
02:29:13.450 --> 02:29:15.110
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as straightforward as that.</v>

2532
02:29:15.620 --> 02:29:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Now with regards to the self esteem part</v>
<v Speaker 2>is practice on small things because you </v>

2533
02:29:21.471 --> 02:29:23.390
<v Speaker 2>build the skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget about the self esteem.</v>

2534
02:29:23.391 --> 02:29:26.210
<v Speaker 2>It isn't about being confident or </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling confident or any of that.</v>

2535
02:29:26.450 --> 02:29:28.460
<v Speaker 2>It's about knowing bloody well how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiate.</v>

2536
02:29:28.730 --> 02:29:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Start with small things you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you'll notice that there are things </v>

2537
02:29:33.730 --> 02:29:37.721
<v Speaker 2>in your relationships in particular that</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't the way you want them to be and </v>

2538
02:29:37.721 --> 02:29:38.300
<v Speaker 2>that you could see how could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>improved.</v>

2539
02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:40.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like figuring out how they can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>improved.</v>

2540
02:29:40.670 --> 02:29:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Negotiate with your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the incremental improvement.</v>

2541
02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll get better and better at it and </v>

2542
02:29:48.700 --> 02:29:49.220
<v Speaker 2>then you'll be able to go out and have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>harder negotiation in the world.</v>

2543
02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:53.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's a set of skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an attitude behind it,</v>

2544
02:29:53.421 --> 02:29:58.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's easier for some people than </v>

2545
02:29:58.421 --> 02:29:58.421
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But fundamentally it's a set of skills.</v>

2546
02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:00.750
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

2547
02:30:06.310 --> 02:30:09.370
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now we have something interesting and</v>

2548
02:30:09.371 --> 02:30:14.080
<v Speaker 2>unexpected to close this off with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The floor is yours.</v>

2549
02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:15.570
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>Dr Peterson,</v>

2550
02:30:15.571 --> 02:30:20.571
<v Speaker 11>I'd like to say thank you for making </v>
<v Speaker 11>your videos available online.</v>

2551
02:30:22.170 --> 02:30:24.840
<v Speaker 11>They've had a great effect on me over </v>
<v Speaker 11>the last year.</v>

2552
02:30:25.090 --> 02:30:30.090
<v Speaker 11>Actually found them a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but sometime around July or August of </v>

2553
02:30:30.090 --> 02:30:31.350
<v Speaker 11>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I got hooked.</v>

2554
02:30:34.140 --> 02:30:39.140
<v Speaker 11>I would wake up at like 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 11>AM in the morning to watch your maps of </v>

2555
02:30:39.140 --> 02:30:40.290
<v Speaker 11>meaning releases the new ones,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the old ones,</v>

2556
02:30:40.350 --> 02:30:41.130
<v Speaker 11>et,</v>
<v Speaker 11>etc.</v>

2557
02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:46.740
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I found myself inspired by both the </v>

2558
02:30:46.740 --> 02:30:51.171
<v Speaker 11>academic and technicals a material as </v>
<v Speaker 11>well as what I might term the more </v>

2559
02:30:51.300 --> 02:30:56.300
<v Speaker 11>fatherly directives or wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I shared this with my family and my </v>

2560
02:30:56.311 --> 02:30:59.250
<v Speaker 11>friends as well as my girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 11>She's here tonight as well.</v>

2561
02:30:59.280 --> 02:31:01.170
<v Speaker 11>She's been following the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 11>series.</v>

2562
02:31:03.180 --> 02:31:08.180
<v Speaker 11>BUt what I'd like to say is,</v>
<v Speaker 11>thank you for inspiring me to stand up </v>

2563
02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:12.720
<v Speaker 11>and face something that I've been afraid</v>
<v Speaker 11>of all my adult life.</v>

2564
02:31:13.740 --> 02:31:17.160
<v Speaker 11>And thank you for granting me the </v>
<v Speaker 11>permission to ask this question here.</v>

2565
02:31:17.670 --> 02:31:21.690
<v Speaker 11>It's actually for my girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Will you please stand up?</v>

2566
02:31:28.440 --> 02:31:33.440
<v Speaker 11>So some might say,</v>
<v Speaker 11>gIven that we are a couple of primates </v>

2567
02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:37.651
<v Speaker 11>full of snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's pretty miraculous that we haven't </v>

2568
02:31:37.651 --> 02:31:39.661
<v Speaker 11>killed each other,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I think you're pretty great and </v>

2569
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:46.540
<v Speaker 11>we've been talking about commitment and </v>
<v Speaker 11>I think I'm ready.</v>

2570
02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:51.490
<v Speaker 11>I know I'm ready to commit to a life </v>
<v Speaker 11>with you.</v>

2571
02:31:52.390 --> 02:31:56.980
<v Speaker 11>Have sorting ourselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'd like to clean some rooms with you.</v>

2572
02:31:59.550 --> 02:32:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2573
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:12.910
<v Speaker 11>And even as scary as the shackles of </v>
<v Speaker 11>marriage have been made to seem to us,</v>

2574
02:32:15.530 --> 02:32:19.880
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm thinking about forever and simply in</v>

2575
02:32:19.881 --> 02:32:20.900
<v Speaker 11>my,</v>
<v Speaker 11>in my words,</v>

2576
02:32:22.490 --> 02:32:25.100
<v Speaker 11>I love you dearly.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You feel like home.</v>

2577
02:32:25.640 --> 02:32:27.920
<v Speaker 11>I never want to lose that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Will you marry me?</v>

2578
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:29.270
<v Speaker 11>And if you want to come here,</v>

2579
02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:42.520
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2580
02:32:50.590 --> 02:32:53.010
<v Speaker 10>So you're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're going to shackle yourself to me.</v>

2581
02:32:53.011 --> 02:32:58.011
<v Speaker 10>I'd never run away then I shall suffer </v>
<v Speaker 10>the rest of my life with you.</v>

2582
02:33:01.150 --> 02:33:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
