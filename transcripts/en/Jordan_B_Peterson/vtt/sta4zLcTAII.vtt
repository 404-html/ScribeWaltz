1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.040
<v Speaker 1>So while you guys were gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went on Wikipedia and looked up,</v>

2
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyrus,</v>

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I did the research for this</v>

4
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>book certainly wasn't possible to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to that kind of information,</v>

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.290
<v Speaker 1>instantaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>and the stories that are laid out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.873
<v Speaker 1>there's a thread that runs through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that's laid out there that's </v>

8
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>quite similar to the one that I told </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

9
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>but there's all sorts of details that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very radically different.</v>

10
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't really know what to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.573
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that people like </v>

12
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Campbell and Carl young and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.000
<v Speaker 1>the ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an original anthropologist and</v>

14
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>armchair anthropologist who wrote a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Golden Bough,</v>

15
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.263
<v Speaker 1>whose name escapes me momentarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was one of the first attempts to </v>

16
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:49.044
<v Speaker 1>do across cultural categorization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology and to look for underlying </v>

17
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>commonalities.</v>

18
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>

19
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you about Naomi Klein going down </v>

20
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>to Argentina and looking at the factory </v>
<v Speaker 1>through her particular Lens.</v>

21
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.173
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that when you develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lens and then you look at things </v>

22
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.264
<v Speaker 1>through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may just see what that lends </v>

23
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>heightens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.923
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that's a criticism that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be leveled against the sorts of </v>

25
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:14.394
<v Speaker 1>things that I'm telling you about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've cherry picked certain stories and </v>

26
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>interpreted them in certain ways so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fall coherently into a,</v>

27
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.913
<v Speaker 1>a scheme of thought and so I'll tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that I do </v>

28
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:27.684
<v Speaker 1>methodologically to protect myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>against that in so far as that's </v>

29
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

30
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea in psychology called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the multi-method multi multitrack method</v>

31
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>of construct validation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is God awful agglomeration of,</v>

32
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.893
<v Speaker 1>of a jargon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it actually means something and it </v>

33
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:49.314
<v Speaker 1>was the construction of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists back in the late 19 </v>

34
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:53.304
<v Speaker 1>fifties crime back in meal who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in what psychologists meant </v>

35
00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 1>when they said something exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say anger.</v>

36
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean thing?</v>

38
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>What is it that you're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

39
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>His anger exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean as anger,</v>

40
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:10.194
<v Speaker 1>but as an idea what sort of idea is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of anger or the idea of anxiety or </v>

41
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:15.414
<v Speaker 1>the idea of sadness or the idea of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>esteem or self competence or any of </v>

42
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 1>these things that psychologists talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about as if their realities.</v>

43
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:24.234
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

44
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.040
<v Speaker 1>some realities are very tangible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

45
00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:27.874
<v Speaker 1>And and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhat easy to come to agreement </v>

46
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>about the contours of their existence in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the borders,</v>

47
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>but other things are way more difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

48
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.403
<v Speaker 1>And so their idea was that if something </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually exists that you should be able </v>

49
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:43.014
<v Speaker 1>to measure it multiple ways using </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple techniques and still get the </v>

50
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>same answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your senses do that.</v>

51
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.900
<v Speaker 1>You have five of them.</v>

52
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.710
<v Speaker 1>The reason you have five apparently is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because evolution has determined that if</v>

53
00:02:55.711 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>you only had four or you die more often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:58.681 --> 00:02:59.514
<v Speaker 1>so it seems as if you have five separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>sources of information that all lead to </v>

55
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:04.924
<v Speaker 1>the same conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be relatively certain that the </v>

56
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that's reached is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

57
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the multimap multitrack method is,</v>

58
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>is an application of that idea to </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct validation,</v>

59
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>which is like you can think of anger as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea,</v>

60
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>as a construct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terminological issue.</v>

61
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Just define it as a construct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychological Constructs.</v>

62
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>How do you know if they're real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:30.964
<v Speaker 1>the idea is it's very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to measure them in multiple </v>

64
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:34.864
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the ways you measure them have to </v>

65
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:37.264
<v Speaker 1>give the same reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to show that that idea is </v>

66
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:42.874
<v Speaker 1>the same in certain ways as other ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's related to and different from </v>

67
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>other ideas that it's not related to.</v>

68
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.370
<v Speaker 1>So let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a construct neuroticism,</v>

69
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.361
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

70
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>there's another construct depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might say,</v>

71
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are those separate?</v>

72
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Are they the same?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

73
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough one because in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways they're the same.</v>

74
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.443
<v Speaker 1>Are they the same in any important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they different in any important </v>

75
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>ways?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>the way you do that technically is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would measure neuroticism,</v>

77
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:16.264
<v Speaker 1>however you were going to measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'd have you tell me how neurotic </v>

78
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:20.524
<v Speaker 1>you were using a questionnaire and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have your friend tell me and maybe </v>

79
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:24.034
<v Speaker 1>you're a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we got it pretty good triangulation </v>

80
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:26.794
<v Speaker 1>on your neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'd have them do the same </v>

81
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:30.784
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those people do the same thing </v>

82
00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 1>with regards to your levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and anxiety.</v>

83
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.363
<v Speaker 1>Then I'd use both those measures to </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict something else like how well </v>

84
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.493
<v Speaker 1>your life goes in terms of career over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next 10 years and if neuroticism </v>

85
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:50.570
<v Speaker 1>predicted and depression predicted so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were correlated,</v>

86
00:04:50.571 --> 00:04:51.404
<v Speaker 1>then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's some relationship and then </v>

87
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I'd look at them at the same time.</v>

88
00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.330
<v Speaker 1>If I predict with neuroticism and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>add new depression to the mixed,</v>

89
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.643
<v Speaker 1>does that give me more predictive power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like is does a equals C or </v>

90
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 1>does a plus b?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

91
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:11.950
<v Speaker 1>That's all you're asking your regression</v>
<v Speaker 1>equation,</v>

92
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.660
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 1>if a equals c is just as good as a plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>b equals c,</v>

94
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:17.914
<v Speaker 1>then one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if the two things are also </v>

95
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:20.344
<v Speaker 1>correlated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and anxiety and neuroticism </v>

96
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 1>are going to be very highly correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like point seven,</v>

97
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

98
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:30.700
<v Speaker 1>well those are the same thing just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have different names.</v>

99
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

100
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.260
<v Speaker 1>And part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a pragmatic conceptualize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Asian of reality is like,</v>

102
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.343
<v Speaker 1>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this categorization structure good </v>

103
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:42.410
<v Speaker 1>for something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

104
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

105
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.094
<v Speaker 1>all unpack all that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well part of my rules for determining </v>

106
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:52.390
<v Speaker 1>whether these things were useful or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>was to see if the idea is applied across</v>

107
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>multiple levels of analysis.</v>

108
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I told you about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual.</v>

109
00:05:56.921 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 1>So sort of the cognitive psychology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the neuropsychological.</v>

110
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>So there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.853
<v Speaker 1>input of brain research and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative or mythological and then the </v>

112
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>cross cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

113
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.044
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those all stack up in a certain way so </v>

114
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>that if you look between all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see a pattern and it seems to me</v>

115
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.283
<v Speaker 1>increasingly unlikely that that pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be there across all of those </v>

116
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>levels at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say,</v>

117
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

118
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>that depends on how good you are at </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaving a story,</v>

119
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.700
<v Speaker 1>but at some point</v>

120
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.030
<v Speaker 1>encapsulating that many phenomena and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaving a coherent story out of them.</v>

121
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:40.144
<v Speaker 1>If such a thing doesn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be to become cognitively </v>

122
00:06:44.021 --> 00:06:44.854
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't do it unless there's </v>

123
00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:50.260
<v Speaker 1>actually something there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and every,</v>

124
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

125
00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:53.680
<v Speaker 1>everything I tell you also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a simplification?</v>

126
00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:57.490
<v Speaker 1>It has to be because you could spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole life investigating any of the</v>

127
00:06:57.491 --> 00:06:58.324
<v Speaker 1>things that we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm hoping is that I've </v>

128
00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:01.114
<v Speaker 1>abstracted out the central issues of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these multiple levels of analysis and </v>

129
00:07:05.021 --> 00:07:06.070
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.810
<v Speaker 1>put together each of them support all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the others anyways.</v>

131
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

133
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.550
<v Speaker 1>so far so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

134
00:07:18.551 --> 00:07:21.100
<v Speaker 1>So this is a cool representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked this one.</v>

135
00:07:21.101 --> 00:07:26.101
<v Speaker 1>This is called the open virgin and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a 14th or 13th century sculpture,</v>

136
00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:27.634
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of wood and these things </v>

137
00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:30.790
<v Speaker 1>were actually.</v>

138
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:31.623
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the only one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were a form of religious </v>

139
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:38.800
<v Speaker 1>representation that that had different </v>
<v Speaker 1>exemplars.</v>

140
00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:40.930
<v Speaker 1>You could find different ones of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

141
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.333
<v Speaker 1>This is brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this bloody thing as far as I'm </v>

142
00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:46.450
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me show you.</v>

143
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Let me show you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this figure again,</v>

144
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.850
<v Speaker 1>so basically what you have here in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure,</v>

145
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.690
<v Speaker 1>this is at world conception and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world conception is roughly.</v>

146
00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:58.990
<v Speaker 1>There's an individual positive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>

147
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.090
<v Speaker 1>He's he or she is in a cultural sphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's positive or negative,</v>

148
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.950
<v Speaker 1>that's embedded in the world outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that's positive and negative and</v>

149
00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:11.740
<v Speaker 1>all of it comes from potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>

150
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.143
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

151
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.013
<v Speaker 1>this map shows all of the positives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>negatives in relationship to one </v>

152
00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:20.574
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it's not perfectly symmetrical </v>

153
00:08:22.141 --> 00:08:24.960
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell,</v>

154
00:08:24.961 --> 00:08:25.794
<v Speaker 1>the adversarial element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual is the thing that generates </v>

155
00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:29.574
<v Speaker 1>the tyrannical element of culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that like gets in your </v>

156
00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:36.444
<v Speaker 1>way of establishing a creation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative relationship with what you </v>

157
00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:41.400
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well anyways,</v>

158
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.170
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is a manifestation of that.</v>

159
00:08:46.171 --> 00:08:47.004
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I liked this manifestation because </v>

160
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.033
<v Speaker 1>like it's obviously Christian but not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more mythological than Christian </v>

161
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's quite obvious.</v>

162
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the super ordinate figure is married.</v>

163
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.643
<v Speaker 1>The feminine now you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's amazing the person who carved </v>

164
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 1>this just didn't get burnt up at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inquisition because it's a radical idea,</v>

165
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.523
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just an indication of how the </v>

166
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:19.104
<v Speaker 1>mythology can change the causal </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between these different </v>

167
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:22.824
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>

168
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.570
<v Speaker 1>So you have Mary there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's sort of,</v>

169
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.750
<v Speaker 1>she's the ultimate in femininity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ultimate feminine Deity,</v>

170
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 1>but only the positive side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

171
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.203
<v Speaker 1>And then within her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like nature opens itself up and </v>

172
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 1>benevolent nature opens itself up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see inside is culture.</v>

173
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.170
<v Speaker 1>That's God the father holding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

174
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.620
<v Speaker 1>And the individual in this case is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucified Christ,</v>

175
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.190
<v Speaker 1>which is a wonderful conceptualization </v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

176
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 1>because of course that is what life does</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>

177
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 1>That's why that's such a powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol.</v>

178
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.833
<v Speaker 1>Christ is the person who has to face the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of his own death voluntarily or </v>

180
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 1>involuntarily who's betrayed by his </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and betrayed by his friends.</v>

181
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:10.611
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

182
00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:14.430
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's exposed to the most,</v>

183
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.480
<v Speaker 1>the most torturous elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual Ba and simultaneously,</v>

184
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:21.984
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcends them while you bloody well </v>

185
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:25.220
<v Speaker 1>better do that because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

186
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.083
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen?</v>

187
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.960
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

188
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 1>If you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's even worse.</v>

189
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:34.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not only that you fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the beginnings of it.</v>

190
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.070
<v Speaker 1>If you can't transcend the tragedy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your being,</v>

191
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:39.730
<v Speaker 1>then you get corrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

192
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.630
<v Speaker 1>because I see this happening to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

193
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.870
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 1>if you're suffering and you can't cope </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

195
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.190
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that it embitters you.</v>

196
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.800
<v Speaker 1>And once you get bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get resentful.</v>

197
00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:01.530
<v Speaker 1>And once you get resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look for revenge.</v>

198
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.290
<v Speaker 1>And that can just get completely out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

199
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a quick trip to the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>suburb of the underworld,</v>

200
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.140
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

201
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not only that if you don't manage </v>

202
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Speaker 1>this transcendent act that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>swamped by the tragedy of your life,</v>

203
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:19.494
<v Speaker 1>it's worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're swamped by the tragedy of your </v>

204
00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:23.340
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that corrupts you.</v>

205
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.323
<v Speaker 1>And then you start working to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything even more tragic than it has </v>

206
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's why,</v>

207
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in medieval Christian conceptualizations</v>

208
00:11:32.881 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 1>in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the idea of hell,</v>

209
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.013
<v Speaker 1>the desk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the idea that you were destined to </v>

210
00:11:39.091 --> 00:11:42.930
<v Speaker 1>hell was worse than the idea of dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a strange idea,</v>

211
00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:43.764
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think this is what the </v>

212
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:46.510
<v Speaker 1>terror management theorists thing too is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

213
00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.373
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing worse than the fear of </v>

214
00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:49.050
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

215
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.050
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the right imagination.</v>

216
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of things that are worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the fear of death.</v>

217
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.940
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to trivialize the fear of</v>

218
00:11:59.941 --> 00:12:00.900
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

219
00:12:00.901 --> 00:12:01.734
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

220
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

221
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 1>to understand that there are some things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would rather die than do.</v>

222
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.143
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that I could get you guys to </v>

223
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 1>sit for 15 minutes and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

224
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 1>you list 10 things that you would rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>die than do.</v>

225
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>

226
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.410
<v Speaker 1>That's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're a parent,</v>

227
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 1>you can think of those things in no time</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat.</v>

228
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was pretty interesting.</v>

229
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:30.610
<v Speaker 1>So you've got the superordinate feminine</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure here,</v>

230
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.730
<v Speaker 1>which is not what you'd expect from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian representation,</v>

231
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.593
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You expect God to be on the outside and </v>

232
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:38.270
<v Speaker 1>then Mary and then Christ in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>likelihood.</v>

233
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Although that would also be a valid </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

234
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:42.873
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because you can think of the mother </v>

235
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:45.034
<v Speaker 1>as something that's protected by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and supporting the individual </v>

236
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.700
<v Speaker 1>because that's basically what this </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation shows.</v>

237
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 1>But then you see on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the open side,</v>

238
00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 1>so I really liked this.</v>

239
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.003
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so cool is that you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people who aren't archetipal </v>

240
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:05.530
<v Speaker 1>figures there in the little crowd and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gazing at the central figure and</v>

241
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 1>of course that's exactly what's happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Christianity for 2000 years.</v>

242
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so far spread is that for 2000 years</v>

243
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:13.024
<v Speaker 1>people have been looking at that image </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the crucifixion transfixed by </v>

244
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

245
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:19.330
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

246
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that we don't understand,</v>

247
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:27.310
<v Speaker 1>when everybody woke up and like the late</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 hundreds and said,</v>

248
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>why were we looking at that for the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 years?</v>

249
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:33.430
<v Speaker 1>The first answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

250
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:35.830
<v Speaker 1>we really don't have the foggiest idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

251
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.230
<v Speaker 1>it was just one of the things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

252
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.830
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it encapsulated people within the belief</v>

253
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:45.320
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another good example anyway,</v>

254
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.010
<v Speaker 1>of how this archetypal imagery can </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself,</v>

255
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.340
<v Speaker 1>say spontaneously in the imagination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an artist.</v>

256
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.000
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a sacred image and it,</v>

257
00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.320
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In actuality that's what it is.</v>

258
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.450
<v Speaker 1>What it shows is while there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>superordinate transcendent natural order</v>

259
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.403
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a beneficial element that we </v>

260
00:14:06.521 --> 00:14:11.290
<v Speaker 1>associate with femininity and inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is a supportive culture,</v>

261
00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:12.124
<v Speaker 1>is properly nested if things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized properly and it's both of </v>

262
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:18.070
<v Speaker 1>those things that provide support for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the suffering.</v>

263
00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Individuals like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

264
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.393
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty much gone it so now that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exhaust the meaning of this </v>

265
00:14:25.481 --> 00:14:28.540
<v Speaker 1>particular representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot more to it than that,</v>

266
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:30.940
<v Speaker 1>but just that's not so bad.</v>

267
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.200
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can show you a,</v>

268
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.090
<v Speaker 1>a more negative representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've showed you this before,</v>

269
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.320
<v Speaker 1>like this would be a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative element of the feminine.</v>

270
00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.773
<v Speaker 1>And so you have Kelly here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelly is the goddess to whom you make </v>

271
00:14:50.421 --> 00:14:51.254
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully if you make the right </v>

272
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:53.594
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Kelly turns into her positive </v>

273
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 1>counterpart and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

274
00:14:58.221 --> 00:14:59.990
<v Speaker 1>well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

275
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.483
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does sacrifice effect your </v>

276
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:04.820
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the gods?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

277
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.800
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no gods and second of all,</v>

278
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:07.634
<v Speaker 1>well then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you doing with the </v>

279
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:11.540
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's pretty straightforward.</v>

280
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.820
<v Speaker 1>We've already talked about this at </v>
<v Speaker 1>length,</v>

281
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.923
<v Speaker 1>you do make sacrifices all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that you act as if </v>

282
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:23.030
<v Speaker 1>you can have a relationship with your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with being,</v>

283
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.553
<v Speaker 1>you assume that if you withhold certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things from yourself now that you will </v>

284
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:31.430
<v Speaker 1>improve your relationship both with </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature and culture.</v>

285
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.653
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I already told you guys that as far </v>

286
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:35.324
<v Speaker 1>as I was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like the most stunning </v>

287
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.083
<v Speaker 1>cognitive discovery of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the discovery of the future and </v>

288
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:45.380
<v Speaker 1>it's the discovery of the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the present and the future.</v>

289
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.351
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

290
00:15:46.351 --> 00:15:47.184
<v Speaker 1>it's such an amazing idea that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>alter your behavior now and it'll pay </v>

291
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:53.240
<v Speaker 1>off any year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

292
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.330
<v Speaker 1>that's not obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not animals.</v>

293
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Don't think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

294
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of them act that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these and so on,</v>

295
00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:04.130
<v Speaker 1>but that's just built right into their </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior as far as we could tell.</v>

296
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.010
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's Kelly,</v>

297
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a spider.</v>

298
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.933
<v Speaker 1>She's in a web of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fire is outside at web that's made </v>

299
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:18.140
<v Speaker 1>out of skulls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got weapons in her hand.</v>

300
00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Your hair is on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got a headdress of skulls.</v>

301
00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you ever saw something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

302
00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:24.830
<v Speaker 1>it would traumatize you so badly.</v>

303
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:25.663
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be able to get out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>house for like five years and that's </v>

304
00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:30.620
<v Speaker 1>exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

305
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:31.454
<v Speaker 1>It's a representation of all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would traumatize you if you </v>

306
00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:36.074
<v Speaker 1>encountered it and they know it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to encapsulate that as an image </v>

307
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:40.304
<v Speaker 1>and what you could say in some sense is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the people who developed this </v>

308
00:16:43.431 --> 00:16:44.264
<v Speaker 1>image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're attempting to conceptualize the </v>

309
00:16:46.521 --> 00:16:47.354
<v Speaker 1>class of all terrifying things and once </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the classical terrifying things </v>

310
00:16:51.981 --> 00:16:52.814
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can come up with the class of all </v>

311
00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:56.234
<v Speaker 1>useful responses and that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the proper way to behave </v>

312
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.420
<v Speaker 1>and sacrifices and integral element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

313
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:03.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

314
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.190
<v Speaker 1>absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely dead on.</v>

315
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.190
<v Speaker 1>So unless you don't believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice works,</v>

316
00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:12.260
<v Speaker 1>in which case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you doing here?</v>

317
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you act out your belief.</v>

318
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.153
<v Speaker 1>So when it's a firm belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you would also say if things fell </v>

319
00:17:18.861 --> 00:17:20.800
<v Speaker 1>apart so badly that sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

320
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:21.653
<v Speaker 1>no longer paid off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your lights would basically become </v>

321
00:17:23.271 --> 00:17:26.330
<v Speaker 1>intolerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so because it would mean you have,</v>

322
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:27.403
<v Speaker 1>you would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have abandoned all sense of </v>

323
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:32.620
<v Speaker 1>control over the outcomes of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions while you.</v>

324
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:37.190
<v Speaker 1>You can't live like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd just die of stress so well.</v>

325
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.720
<v Speaker 1>And as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

326
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:40.190
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was pregnant.</v>

327
00:17:40.191 --> 00:17:41.024
<v Speaker 1>She's given birth to this unfortunate </v>
<v Speaker 1>character who she's devouring intense </v>

328
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.670
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a rough image.</v>

329
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.230
<v Speaker 1>It's the image of the destructive </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of nature.</v>

330
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the negative side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine,</v>

331
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.780
<v Speaker 1>we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

332
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:04.653
<v Speaker 1>mirrors that positive representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a Greek representation that's </v>

333
00:18:09.091 --> 00:18:14.091
<v Speaker 1>Diana or Artemis hoping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm remembering this properly.</v>

334
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.593
<v Speaker 1>She's multi breasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know this circle around her head is </v>

335
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.440
<v Speaker 1>undoubtedly a representation of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmic nature,</v>

336
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a halo.</v>

337
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.620
<v Speaker 1>The Halo is basically a planetary body </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the sudden,</v>

338
00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 1>do you call it cosmic body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the sun or the moon behind the head</v>

339
00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:38.850
<v Speaker 1>of the divine individual with all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that power,</v>

340
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shining forward.</v>

341
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's an attempt to use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

342
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 1>if you look up at the moon or you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>up at the sun,</v>

343
00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:47.940
<v Speaker 1>there's an element of that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by all.</v>

344
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't help but feel that at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beauty and power and sometimes it's</v>

345
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:54.260
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you,</v>

346
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.313
<v Speaker 1>you take the representation of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the personality and you throw the </v>

347
00:18:58.981 --> 00:18:59.814
<v Speaker 1>representation of these cosmic powers </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it and it's an attempt to </v>

348
00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:07.680
<v Speaker 1>represent transcendent value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very intelligent,</v>

349
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.240
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

350
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:10.913
<v Speaker 1>and so partly what you're trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you conduct your life is you're </v>

351
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:14.334
<v Speaker 1>trying to get all of these archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces in proper balance and I suppose </v>

352
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 1>in some sense to get them tilted towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good.</v>

353
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.420
<v Speaker 1>If that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what this.</v>

354
00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:30.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what this representation in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense you might say,</v>

355
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:30.863
<v Speaker 1>where is it here?</v>

356
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:39.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

357
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.091
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

358
00:19:41.091 --> 00:19:41.720
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

359
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.100
<v Speaker 1>if you got everything ordered properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what being would be like</v>

360
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.380
<v Speaker 1>still pretty rough given that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucifix is at its center.</v>

361
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

362
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.183
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it from a purely </v>

363
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.170
<v Speaker 1>technical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

364
00:20:01.171 --> 00:20:04.200
<v Speaker 1>each of these archetypes is split into </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative.</v>

365
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.700
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

366
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.400
<v Speaker 1>that's just how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no appropriate.</v>

367
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:11.303
<v Speaker 1>There is no way that you can interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of them so that the whole </v>

368
00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:16.400
<v Speaker 1>system tilts towards the positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

369
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:17.303
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

370
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.520
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

371
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.573
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can get them lined up so </v>

372
00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:25.014
<v Speaker 1>that things tilt towards the positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that you can detect when </v>

373
00:20:28.081 --> 00:20:31.710
<v Speaker 1>that happens because that those are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>periods in your life where you feel that</v>

374
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.293
<v Speaker 1>your richly enough engaged in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing in life is meaningful </v>

375
00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:40.860
<v Speaker 1>enough so that the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the substructure that makes it necessary</v>

376
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.870
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is worth it.</v>

377
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.590
<v Speaker 1>It's worthwhile in all that the negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists is okay,</v>

378
00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 1>given the way that things are structured</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

379
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I think that whether or not that's true </v>
<v Speaker 1>is in some sense the eternal question of</v>

380
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:58.720
<v Speaker 1>mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

381
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 1>can you organize your life so that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good?</v>

382
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.693
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

383
00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.653
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you can certainly allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life to degenerate so that it's </v>

384
00:21:09.211 --> 00:21:11.310
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems indisputable.</v>

385
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.173
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there does seem to be an element of </v>

386
00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:14.004
<v Speaker 1>choice in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you know something terrible </v>

387
00:21:15.661 --> 00:21:17.520
<v Speaker 1>could happen to you that you have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>

388
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:23.210
<v Speaker 1>you have no choice of or control over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly seems that you could do</v>

389
00:21:24.091 --> 00:21:27.420
<v Speaker 1>any number of stupid and blind things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that make everything worse.</v>

390
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a common experience and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>also think you'd be hard pressed to find</v>

391
00:21:32.221 --> 00:21:33.054
<v Speaker 1>anyone who wouldn't say that there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>things they did consciously and </v>

392
00:21:36.931 --> 00:21:37.764
<v Speaker 1>willingly that were up their own choice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they didn't have to do that made </v>

393
00:21:42.181 --> 00:21:43.014
<v Speaker 1>things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we seem to have some sense of our </v>

394
00:21:45.751 --> 00:21:46.584
<v Speaker 1>moral agency and we seem automatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept some responsibility for the </v>

395
00:21:51.691 --> 00:21:54.660
<v Speaker 1>outcomes of our actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what that means is that we</v>

396
00:21:54.661 --> 00:21:57.210
<v Speaker 1>do believe that we can make things </v>
<v Speaker 1>better or worse.</v>

397
00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.313
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose in some way that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we believe we can tap the whole </v>

398
00:22:01.861 --> 00:22:04.800
<v Speaker 1>architectural structure of being into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive,</v>

399
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.010
<v Speaker 1>into the positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

400
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:10.613
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>

401
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.200
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you</v>

402
00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:16.700
<v Speaker 1>drilled down to the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialism,</v>

403
00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:21.130
<v Speaker 1>in some sense that's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists pose know,</v>

404
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.920
<v Speaker 1>is there a manner of conducting your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life such that it becomes,</v>

405
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.160
<v Speaker 1>it's not merely acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more than that.</v>

406
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:29.601
<v Speaker 1>You'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

407
00:22:29.601 --> 00:22:30.800
<v Speaker 1>this is how it should be.</v>

408
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.433
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

409
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.670
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to do now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we're not going to do it today,</v>

410
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.013
<v Speaker 1>is we're going to start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>other representations of this </v>

411
00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.043
<v Speaker 1>substructure from other religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditions and we're going to also talk </v>

412
00:22:47.881 --> 00:22:51.240
<v Speaker 1>about ways that you might relate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these figures.</v>

413
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.443
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one question might be while </v>

414
00:22:54.331 --> 00:22:55.164
<v Speaker 1>you're part of your culture and it's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>an orderly element and a protective </v>

415
00:22:58.501 --> 00:23:01.050
<v Speaker 1>element and a tear radical element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

416
00:23:01.051 --> 00:23:03.570
<v Speaker 1>so what should you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

417
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.460
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.253
<v Speaker 1>the tyrannical element is a real and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's corrupt and blind and so to the </v>

419
00:23:10.141 --> 00:23:10.974
<v Speaker 1>degree that you identify with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're tyrannical and corrupt </v>

420
00:23:13.261 --> 00:23:14.910
<v Speaker 1>and blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

421
00:23:14.911 --> 00:23:15.744
<v Speaker 1>you're the fortunate beneficiary of tens</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of years of cultural and </v>

422
00:23:19.711 --> 00:23:23.940
<v Speaker 1>technological evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that an effort,</v>

423
00:23:23.941 --> 00:23:25.620
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

424
00:23:25.621 --> 00:23:29.520
<v Speaker 1>you should be at least appropriately </v>
<v Speaker 1>grateful for that.</v>

425
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:30.683
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're in a real position </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to be grateful and </v>

426
00:23:32.851 --> 00:23:36.360
<v Speaker 1>happy for the thing that tyrannizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls you.</v>

427
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

428
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.940
<v Speaker 1>that's not an easy thing to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because those things seem to conflict.</v>

429
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly should your relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>to culture be?</v>

430
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.293
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are myths that describe </v>

431
00:23:49.741 --> 00:23:54.650
<v Speaker 1>that quite directly and they take into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account the corruption,</v>

432
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a whitewash.</v>

433
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:57.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

434
00:23:57.831 --> 00:24:02.831
<v Speaker 1>of course this thing is dead and blind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and corrupt obviously,</v>

435
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.820
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

436
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.310
<v Speaker 1>it's foolishness and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and willful</v>

437
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:09.703
<v Speaker 1>ignorance and willful blindness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it that way as well as things </v>

438
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.180
<v Speaker 1>merely getting old and falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that there's some level,</v>

439
00:24:17.181 --> 00:24:20.810
<v Speaker 1>it's at the bottom of it is also true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should you flee from Matt?</v>

440
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.063
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

441
00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what the myths say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

442
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.650
<v Speaker 1>they say what you're supposed to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like Pinocchio.</v>

443
00:24:28.651 --> 00:24:32.660
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to go to the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean to the most monstrous possible</v>

444
00:24:32.661 --> 00:24:33.494
<v Speaker 1>part and rescue your father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you have to do before </v>

445
00:24:36.601 --> 00:24:37.680
<v Speaker 1>you become an individual.</v>

446
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

447
00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I can't see how that can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

448
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.800
<v Speaker 1>So in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's what you're doing in</v>

449
00:24:46.801 --> 00:24:48.390
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're here for,</v>

450
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.540
<v Speaker 1>if you're actually getting a university </v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

451
00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:56.810
<v Speaker 1>what you're here to do is to sift </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the dad remnants of the past and</v>

452
00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.073
<v Speaker 1>pull up what's vital that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and complex that there's </v>

453
00:25:01.741 --> 00:25:04.110
<v Speaker 1>no way you'd be able to think it up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

454
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.900
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires us,</v>

455
00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.370
<v Speaker 1>the discriminating agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

456
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.180
<v Speaker 1>if you read someone like nature or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>read someone like Freud,</v>

457
00:25:12.181 --> 00:25:15.870
<v Speaker 1>there's lots to throw away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't what you throw away though.</v>

458
00:25:15.871 --> 00:25:16.704
<v Speaker 1>It's what you keep that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to be a discriminating reader means </v>

459
00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:24.501
<v Speaker 1>that you get rid of the dead matter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep the goal and you build yourself</v>

460
00:25:25.561 --> 00:25:30.180
<v Speaker 1>up a storehouse of the gold and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can live in the world.</v>

461
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.480
<v Speaker 1>And when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people often ask,</v>

462
00:25:33.481 --> 00:25:34.314
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the purpose of getting a degree </v>

463
00:25:35.371 --> 00:25:37.680
<v Speaker 1>in the humanities?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the answer to that is that</v>

464
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.880
<v Speaker 1>if you're properly trained in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities,</v>

465
00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.773
<v Speaker 1>you know how to live now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the same as having a job and </v>

466
00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:49.350
<v Speaker 1>you need to have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

467
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.633
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing how to live is a more important </v>

468
00:25:52.921 --> 00:25:56.310
<v Speaker 1>thing than having a job even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a job isn't important thing.</v>

469
00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.313
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that if you </v>

470
00:25:59.671 --> 00:26:00.504
<v Speaker 1>don't know how to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then things fall apart and that's not </v>

471
00:26:03.961 --> 00:26:06.360
<v Speaker 1>good and they can really fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

472
00:26:06.361 --> 00:26:08.670
<v Speaker 1>and part of the reason I think that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>became so,</v>

473
00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:10.613
<v Speaker 1>so much of an obsession for me is that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that we don't have the luxury </v>

474
00:26:15.061 --> 00:26:18.090
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are narrowing.</v>

475
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.410
<v Speaker 1>We've become so powerful that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of our blindness will,</v>

476
00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:31.740
<v Speaker 1>is reaching uncontrollable proportions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're weak and stupid,</v>

477
00:26:32.561 --> 00:26:33.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:36.970
<v Speaker 1>there's only so much damage you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not weak.</v>

479
00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:37.923
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have unbelievable power at our </v>

480
00:26:41.381 --> 00:26:42.214
<v Speaker 1>disposal now and a lot of weird things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to come down the pipes in the </v>

481
00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:46.770
<v Speaker 1>next 10 years.</v>

482
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.333
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

483
00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:51.640
<v Speaker 1>the more people that have their act </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

484
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:53.223
<v Speaker 1>the better because</v>
<v Speaker 1>then things will be tilted towards </v>

485
00:26:59.080 --> 00:26:59.913
<v Speaker 1>everything lining up in a positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction rather than being tilted in </v>

486
00:27:03.041 --> 00:27:05.500
<v Speaker 1>the other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's important.</v>

487
00:27:05.501 --> 00:27:09.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think people can make a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful individual contribution to that</v>

488
00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.200
<v Speaker 1>wherever you happen to be.</v>

489
00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.813
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

490
00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these myths always say the same </v>

491
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.720
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that the history,</v>

492
00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.200
<v Speaker 1>the future of the world depends on </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual choice.</v>

493
00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.480
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's literally true.</v>

494
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:31.573
<v Speaker 1>So then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you better put yourself in a </v>

495
00:27:33.021 --> 00:27:35.780
<v Speaker 1>position where you make wise choices </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't,</v>

496
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.903
<v Speaker 1>we've already seen what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got a taste of it in the 20th </v>

497
00:27:42.641 --> 00:27:45.400
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you want some more of that,</v>

498
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.100
<v Speaker 1>you could certainly have it.</v>

499
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
