WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.253
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.393
<v Speaker 2>So the last time that we met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about the idea of logos </v>

3
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:21.231
<v Speaker 2>operating on chaos in order to to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>being into being.</v>

4
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.750
<v Speaker 2>And that's predicated on a worldview </v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

5
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 2>it's not precisely materialistic and its</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental orientation.</v>

6
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:41.991
<v Speaker 2>So it's predicated on a view point that </v>
<v Speaker 2>one way of looking at being is that it's</v>

7
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place of potential,</v>

8
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.063
<v Speaker 2>maybe have unlimited potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what acts on that potential too to </v>

9
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 2>bring it into being is what modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>people would call consciousness.</v>

10
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:56.454
<v Speaker 2>But what the ancients called logos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I actually think is a better word </v>

11
00:00:59.131 --> 00:00:59.964
<v Speaker 2>than consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a more encompassing word </v>

12
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.953
<v Speaker 2>because it doesn't only involve the act </v>
<v Speaker 2>of being there so to speak like the </v>

13
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 2>existentialists would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also involves active exploration,</v>

14
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.973
<v Speaker 2>both both physical and imagine stick as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well as communication about the results </v>

15
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:19.404
<v Speaker 2>of that exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that it's perfectly </v>

16
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:22.944
<v Speaker 2>reasonable to face the world as if what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're facing is a pool of potential </v>

17
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:28.854
<v Speaker 2>that you are capable of shaping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is into what do </v>

18
00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 2>you wish to shape it?</v>

19
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's actually the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

20
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.513
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people often ask questions like what is </v>

21
00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 2>the meaning of life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think to some degree that</v>

22
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:44.244
<v Speaker 2>that's an ill posed question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you can observe the many </v>

23
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 2>meanings of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are negative,</v>

24
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.983
<v Speaker 2>no one questions their reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of them are positive and we're </v>

25
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:54.894
<v Speaker 2>more likely to question the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the positive meetings that manifest </v>

26
00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:58.914
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we get overwhelmed with our </v>

27
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 2>apprehension of the fact that life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>tragic and that we're finite in mortal.</v>

28
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>meanings aren't real.</v>

29
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 2>I would also say that</v>

31
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.633
<v Speaker 2>as I've considered more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully the way that value structures </v>

32
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:17.624
<v Speaker 2>might be hierarchically organized and on</v>
<v Speaker 2>farther and farther out to what I think </v>

33
00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:22.154
<v Speaker 2>of as the edge or the ultimate reaches </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that hierarchical organization that </v>

34
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

35
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.363
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your identity as a finite individual </v>

36
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.020
<v Speaker 2>being sort of localized in time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

37
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.883
<v Speaker 2>Now in here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that encapsulates generally what </v>

38
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 2>people think about themselves as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

39
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.683
<v Speaker 2>as real individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that there are metaphysical spaces </v>

40
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:47.960
<v Speaker 2>outside of that that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hyper real in some sense.</v>

41
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:48.794
<v Speaker 2>And in one of those metaphysical spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the embodiment of nature and </v>

42
00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:57.461
<v Speaker 2>culture in in the most real of senses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in an in a metaphysical space that's</v>

43
00:02:58.671 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 2>just beyond that.</v>

44
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.160
<v Speaker 2>You're the logos that transforms order </v>
<v Speaker 2>into chaos and sometimes the reverse and</v>

46
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 2>then outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is in some sense the final</v>

47
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical domain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is what is it exactly is it</v>

48
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:18.124
<v Speaker 2>that you're up to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that what you should be up </v>

49
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:21.304
<v Speaker 2>to is the attempt to transform being </v>
<v Speaker 2>into something resembling classical </v>

50
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.703
<v Speaker 2>conceptualizations of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that has nothing to do with the </v>

51
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:31.144
<v Speaker 2>attempt to impose an ideological </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure on the world so that you can </v>

52
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 2>bring it into alignment with your a </v>
<v Speaker 2>priori convictions.</v>

53
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 2>That's not the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The right answer is something different.</v>

54
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.513
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things you want to ask </v>

55
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:44.940
<v Speaker 2>yourself is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

56
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 2>is it better to work for the abolition </v>
<v Speaker 2>of misery or for its extension?</v>

57
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 2>We try to think in some senses the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental metaphysical question.</v>

58
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.463
<v Speaker 2>I think that was posed properly in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century because we learned at that </v>

59
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 2>point exactly how far we could push.</v>

60
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

61
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.010
<v Speaker 2>voluntary evil without bringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything to a halt.</v>

62
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.370
<v Speaker 2>And I think we pushed it right to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>limit and you know,</v>

63
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:10.110
<v Speaker 2>maybe we're still not done with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

64
00:04:10.111 --> 00:04:12.870
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but things look like they have improved.</v>

65
00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I would say overall since 1989 since the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Berlin wall fell down,</v>

66
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:17.574
<v Speaker 2>although you certainly see signs of </v>
<v Speaker 2>recidivism frequently and you see that </v>

67
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:22.590
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

68
00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:26.850
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Russia now the Russians are trying to</v>

69
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.150
<v Speaker 2>find their own way and there are afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>in many ways of western individuality.</v>

70
00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:37.920
<v Speaker 2>They believe that it's got a fatally </v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic element and that one of that,</v>

71
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:38.754
<v Speaker 2>that one of the consequences of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>nihilistic element will be the undoing </v>

72
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:44.550
<v Speaker 2>of everything that culture has produced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's of any value.</v>

73
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.953
<v Speaker 2>And so the main Russian political </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher at this point who's one of </v>

74
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:53.520
<v Speaker 2>potents advisers is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a nationalist of sorts.</v>

75
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.073
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

76
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.153
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

77
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.023
<v Speaker 2>the reason I'm telling you that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the ideological conflict that </v>

78
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 2>began in the 20th century is by no means</v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

79
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:03.394
<v Speaker 2>And it isn't obvious that liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>individualism constitutes the final </v>

80
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:12.110
<v Speaker 2>solution to the problems of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

81
00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:13.400
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that.</v>

82
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that as a cynic because</v>

83
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

84
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.650
<v Speaker 2>as far as systems go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty damn good system.</v>

85
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.030
<v Speaker 2>But I think that people in the west </v>
<v Speaker 2>still suffer from a spiritual sickness.</v>

86
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:24.864
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a consequence of what needs she </v>

87
00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:27.624
<v Speaker 2>outlined and Dostoyevsky outlined as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>major philosophical moves of the 19th </v>

88
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:33.994
<v Speaker 2>century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the demolition of </v>

89
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical belief by rationalism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>empiricism,</v>

90
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.933
<v Speaker 2>some of which was fully justified and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of which I think was an </v>

91
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 2>overextension of the emergent forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

92
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.393
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to go through the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Genesis today and explain to you what I </v>

94
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 2>think it means and then I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you why I think that's relevant.</v>

95
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:58.244
<v Speaker 2>And so this is an extension of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories that we've been talking about </v>

96
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:03.610
<v Speaker 2>during the entirety of the course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

97
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 2>we talked last time about the fact that,</v>

98
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

99
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.643
<v Speaker 2>in the second genesis story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God takes eve out of Adam and what that </v>

100
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:15.164
<v Speaker 2>might mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea there is that it's </v>

101
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:21.854
<v Speaker 2>something like the feminine or material </v>
<v Speaker 2>world has to be transposed into </v>

102
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 2>something that's symbolically masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In order for it to become</v>

103
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.273
<v Speaker 2>properly oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea in some sense is that human </v>

104
00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:34.870
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just women,</v>

105
00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:35.704
<v Speaker 2>but human beings in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to rise above their material </v>

106
00:06:38.321 --> 00:06:39.154
<v Speaker 2>substrate and transform themselves at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological level or at the level of </v>

107
00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:45.160
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that that's actually a real level.</v>

108
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.593
<v Speaker 2>And if you accept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accept the presupposition that </v>

109
00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:49.024
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is actually an active </v>
<v Speaker 2>agent in the extraction of order from </v>

110
00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:54.760
<v Speaker 2>chaos or in the extraction of reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>from potential,</v>

111
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.460
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to delegate consciousness to a empathy,</v>

112
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.240
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

113
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.950
<v Speaker 2>to the status of something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>empathy.</v>

114
00:07:02.951 --> 00:07:03.784
<v Speaker 2>Nominal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it seems to depend on the </v>

115
00:07:05.111 --> 00:07:05.944
<v Speaker 2>existence of a material substrate for </v>
<v Speaker 2>its manifestation now requires a </v>

116
00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:13.990
<v Speaker 2>different way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.870
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to start with the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the garden and the Lord.</v>

118
00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:19.704
<v Speaker 2>God took the man and put him in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>garden of Eden to dress it and to keep </v>

119
00:07:25.231 --> 00:07:26.064
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

120
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.793
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what appears to me to be happening in </v>

121
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:29.834
<v Speaker 2>this story is the f now this is multiple</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories that have been edited together </v>

122
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:33.944
<v Speaker 2>over a very long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people had evolved in some sense </v>

123
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:39.254
<v Speaker 2>their own traditions of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of accounting for the structure of </v>

124
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:42.074
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when people came together in </v>

125
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:45.650
<v Speaker 2>their tribal groups to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations that were larger,</v>

126
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.783
<v Speaker 2>it was necessary for the people who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>working at an intellectual level in </v>

127
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 2>those cultures or at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>storytelling to try to determine what to</v>

128
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 2>do with these old stories so that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>core truths could be retained.</v>

129
00:07:58.491 --> 00:07:59.324
<v Speaker 2>And the apparent paradox is ironed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that happened continually as the </v>

130
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Bible was written.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

131
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.543
<v Speaker 2>it's an ongoing process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly is not something that </v>

132
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 2>stopped yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's an attempt in some sense,</v>

133
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:11.864
<v Speaker 2>to bring the story of mankind together </v>
<v Speaker 2>into one place and to make it </v>

134
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.690
<v Speaker 2>comprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to turn it into a comprehensible literal</v>

135
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:18.524
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>

136
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that that's associated.</v>

137
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.393
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at the standard Marxist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and psychoanalytic critiques of the </v>

138
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:26.354
<v Speaker 2>religious process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they radically </v>

139
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.040
<v Speaker 2>underestimate the fundamental utility </v>
<v Speaker 2>and power of the underlying process.</v>

140
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:34.124
<v Speaker 2>Because you can become cynical about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and talk about it in terms of the </v>

141
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 2>imposition of a superstitious belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

142
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:41.850
<v Speaker 2>And you can talk about it in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>class struggle and patriarchy and,</v>

143
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:43.640
<v Speaker 2>and all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

144
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:44.474
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that those are valid in so far </v>

145
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 2>as everything that human beings do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our arc,</v>

146
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.593
<v Speaker 2>everything's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the things that human beings do </v>

147
00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:52.964
<v Speaker 2>are contaminated with those motives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's a dreadful mistake to </v>

148
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:56.574
<v Speaker 2>write off the entire rhe entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical history of mankind by </v>

149
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:02.304
<v Speaker 2>attributing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by attributing its existence to some </v>

150
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:07.930
<v Speaker 2>cause and then to make that cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that cynical and,</v>

151
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 2>and destructive.</v>

152
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 2>I think it's extremely dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think by doing that,</v>

153
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 2>we risk losing what we actually need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>

154
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that the sorts of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

155
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.440
<v Speaker 2>that the metaphysical speculations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are buried in religious systems teach us</v>

156
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:25.540
<v Speaker 2>are there are absolutely vital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot live properly without,</v>

157
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.903
<v Speaker 2>you'll become destructive or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or suffer from some variety of serious </v>

158
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 2>existential metaphysical or mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>illness.</v>

159
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.223
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've certainly observed in my clinical </v>

160
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:37.950
<v Speaker 2>practice that one of the major </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributors to mental illness,</v>

161
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly not the only one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

162
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 2>and a physical illness is the tendency </v>
<v Speaker 2>for people to deceive and betrayed.</v>

163
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

164
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:45.414
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there is any factor that </v>
<v Speaker 2>plays itself out in human interactions </v>

165
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 2>that has more of a causal connection </v>
<v Speaker 2>with what we describe as mental illness,</v>

166
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.230
<v Speaker 2>that then tendency of people to lie to </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and betray each other.</v>

167
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.573
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>shocking and surprising to me as a </v>

168
00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.364
<v Speaker 2>clinician is that those sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are almost never considered as factors </v>

169
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:06.960
<v Speaker 2>in the etl etiology of mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

170
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:07.794
<v Speaker 2>when you talk to someone in </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy and you're trying to </v>

171
00:10:09.271 --> 00:10:12.450
<v Speaker 2>straighten out their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically what you're trying to do is to</v>

172
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:17.451
<v Speaker 2>replace falsehood with truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it isn't like you do that by telling</v>

173
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:18.414
<v Speaker 2>the person what the truth is and having </v>
<v Speaker 2>them accept that as some sort of final </v>

174
00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:22.464
<v Speaker 2>ideological statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you do instead is engaged with the </v>

175
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 2>person in a form of dialogue that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed to help them understand exactly</v>

176
00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:30.414
<v Speaker 2>what it was that happened and why it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and what was good about it and </v>

177
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:37.050
<v Speaker 2>what wasn't good about it and how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we're good could continue to</v>

178
00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:37.884
<v Speaker 2>manifest themselves in the future and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe to manifest themselves more </v>

179
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:41.754
<v Speaker 2>powerfully and more strongly and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehensively in the future then they </v>

180
00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:45.270
<v Speaker 2>had in the past.</v>

181
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:46.973
<v Speaker 2>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's basically what you're doing in </v>

182
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.314
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think all the evidence points in </v>

183
00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:53.970
<v Speaker 2>that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you can do it for yourself.</v>

184
00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of the things that young said</v>
<v Speaker 2>about psychotherapy,</v>

185
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.593
<v Speaker 2>about psychoanalytic psychotherapy was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it could be replaced by a </v>

186
00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:05.481
<v Speaker 2>sufficient moral effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

187
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:09.690
<v Speaker 2>so what happens is that once God makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>man and woman,</v>

188
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 2>so what that means in some sense is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the logo's is embodied in something</v>

189
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:15.264
<v Speaker 2>that's in something that's flash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place for that to be has to be </v>

190
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:20.460
<v Speaker 2>established.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>

191
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:21.810
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the,</v>

192
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 2>this is the narcan simple story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>

193
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:25.134
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the architectural nature of </v>

194
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:28.020
<v Speaker 2>humanity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The essential nature?</v>

195
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 2>And the story says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the essential nature of humanity is that</v>

196
00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:32.304
<v Speaker 2>we are logos closed in flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's in court in </v>

197
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:38.040
<v Speaker 2>accordance with people's own subjective </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

198
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.113
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's how we experience the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world because we s we see ourselves and </v>

199
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:42.804
<v Speaker 2>perceive ourselves as conscious beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are capable of transforming </v>

200
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:49.830
<v Speaker 2>potential into reality and that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothed,</v>

201
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.693
<v Speaker 2>embodied in something that's mortal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruptible and partly the opportunity </v>

202
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:58.090
<v Speaker 2>of existence and partly it's peril and </v>
<v Speaker 2>burden.</v>

203
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 2>And then the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is actually the question that's</v>

204
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:05.851
<v Speaker 2>posed in the story of Adam and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what then can be done about that?</v>

205
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 2>What are the consequences of that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what can be done about it?</v>

206
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:11.430
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the biblical writings </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it in as a,</v>

207
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.573
<v Speaker 2>as a comprehensive unit are an attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the attempt or one of the prime </v>

208
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:17.464
<v Speaker 2>attempts of mankind to sort out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>question and answer it over a period of </v>

209
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 2>thousands and thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

210
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.293
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the first idea is that we're made in </v>

211
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:29.044
<v Speaker 2>the image of God and that what God is is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that extracted order from </v>

212
00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:34.390
<v Speaker 2>chaos at the beginning of time and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

213
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.343
<v Speaker 2>that we partake in that and embody that </v>
<v Speaker 2>as we move through life and that we can </v>

214
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:39.603
<v Speaker 2>choose how to turn potential into </v>
<v Speaker 2>actuality and that we actually choose </v>

215
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 2>what kind of reality the potential will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be turned into.</v>

216
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.313
<v Speaker 2>I think that part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>many cultures have the idea of heaven </v>

217
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:50.884
<v Speaker 2>and hell as well as the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underworld is that the archetipal </v>

218
00:12:55.270 --> 00:13:00.270
<v Speaker 2>potential poles for the transformation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of potentiality are heaven and hell.</v>

219
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.370
<v Speaker 2>If things went as badly as they possibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

220
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:04.204
<v Speaker 2>we could turn the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could turn being itself to something </v>

221
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:10.480
<v Speaker 2>that as closely enough resembles hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no reason to figure,</v>

222
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.450
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to assume that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>any distinction whatsoever.</v>

223
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.880
<v Speaker 2>And I think we've had a good taste of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

224
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 2>We had a very good taste of that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century.</v>

225
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.370
<v Speaker 2>And on the opposite pole is whatever we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do,</v>

226
00:13:21.371 --> 00:13:25.150
<v Speaker 2>if we made things as good as they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly be now,</v>

227
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I think in order to make things as good </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they possibly can be,</v>

228
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:30.700
<v Speaker 2>you have to abandon your fear and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment.</v>

229
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:32.890
<v Speaker 2>And there's lots of reasons why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't do that.</v>

230
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:33.723
<v Speaker 2>And some of the primary reasons have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with the fact of are the nature of </v>

231
00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:38.410
<v Speaker 2>our being itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that we're,</v>

232
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.633
<v Speaker 2>we're conscious cocreators of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but were invalid in a corruptible </v>

233
00:13:44.411 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 2>envelope and that's painful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>frightening and,</v>

234
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.403
<v Speaker 2>and in some sense of sufficient mystery </v>
<v Speaker 2>to undermine our faith in the entire </v>

235
00:13:53.531 --> 00:13:55.060
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

236
00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:56.680
<v Speaker 2>then that happens to people all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

237
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.650
<v Speaker 2>especially when they get sick or when </v>
<v Speaker 2>things really go badly for them.</v>

238
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:00.821
<v Speaker 2>They wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

239
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:01.654
<v Speaker 2>what's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or I was talking to one of my clients </v>

240
00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:04.264
<v Speaker 2>the other day about Ivan in the brothers</v>
<v Speaker 2>Karamozov and I don't know if you've </v>

241
00:14:06.911 --> 00:14:09.370
<v Speaker 2>read the brothers Karamazov,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you definitely should.</v>

242
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.900
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing book in that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a no novice,</v>

243
00:14:13.901 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 2>a monastery novice named a Losha and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>has an older brother named Ivan.</v>

244
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.453
<v Speaker 2>And Alicia isn't very verbal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a very good person and he's </v>

245
00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:22.414
<v Speaker 2>trying his best to be divine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose to be devout and to become a </v>

246
00:14:25.691 --> 00:14:25.990
<v Speaker 2>monk.</v>

247
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.823
<v Speaker 2>But his older brother who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily intelligent and </v>

248
00:14:28.571 --> 00:14:31.210
<v Speaker 2>charismatic is a rationalist right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the core.</v>

249
00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:34.690
<v Speaker 2>And he likes to torment a Losha with all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reasons why.</v>

250
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Believing in some kind of divine reality</v>
<v Speaker 2>is weak,</v>

251
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:39.770
<v Speaker 2>naive and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

252
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.270
<v Speaker 2>ill advised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And basically he tells,</v>

253
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:46.840
<v Speaker 2>he continually tells him stories about </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible things that happen in the world</v>

254
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.320
<v Speaker 2>and attempts to force your Losha to </v>
<v Speaker 2>justify how if being is good,</v>

255
00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:54.140
<v Speaker 2>those things could possibly occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

256
00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:56.240
<v Speaker 2>So one of the stories he tells the low </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hsa,</v>

257
00:14:56.241 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 2>which is a story that Dostoyevsky got </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the newspapers of the time,</v>

258
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:03.960
<v Speaker 2>was that it's a story about a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl whose parents locked her in and out</v>

259
00:15:03.961 --> 00:15:06.470
<v Speaker 2>house overnight when it was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>freezing outside.</v>

260
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.333
<v Speaker 2>And she screamed and cried the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>night because she was locked out there </v>

261
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:13.640
<v Speaker 2>and eventually froze to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that became quite a,</v>

262
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a scandal in Russia at that time.</v>

263
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.420
<v Speaker 2>And Ivan's basic comment Losha was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as he was concerned,</v>

264
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:21.254
<v Speaker 2>the entire course of being up to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in time wasn't worth that girls </v>

265
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.233
<v Speaker 2>suffering that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that there was no way that that </v>

266
00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:29.084
<v Speaker 2>could be justified by man nor beast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and fall under the rubric of the </v>

267
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 2>assumption that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

268
00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 2>being was good and that what all </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever created it was also good.</v>

269
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.830
<v Speaker 2>And so why even is very good at laying </v>
<v Speaker 2>out stories like that.</v>

270
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.053
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I losha has a very difficult time </v>

271
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 2>dealing with it and I think Dostoyevsky </v>
<v Speaker 2>had his finger on exactly the problem.</v>

272
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.710
<v Speaker 2>You want me to just like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

273
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 2>if life has some sort of transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>

274
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 2>then why is it pervaded by suffering and</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil?</v>

275
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:57.403
<v Speaker 2>That's basically the question that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have been asking since the </v>

276
00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:02.510
<v Speaker 2>beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

277
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.870
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my impression of the ad,</v>

278
00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:06.704
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my feeling about that is that it's a </v>

279
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:09.284
<v Speaker 2>work in progress so to speak and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things might be as good as they can be </v>

280
00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:15.590
<v Speaker 2>because no one has figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make them any better than they are.</v>

281
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:17.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

282
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.820
<v Speaker 2>that fault flies in the face of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

283
00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:20.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classical ideas of God or that God </v>

284
00:16:22.101 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 2>is omniscient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>omnipotent,</v>

285
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:26.750
<v Speaker 2>omnipresent and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always forget the other one.</v>

286
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.611
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

287
00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:30.710
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classic attributes of God it is that</v>

288
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:33.700
<v Speaker 2>he has all the power there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then of course the question is,</v>

289
00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:36.860
<v Speaker 2>is if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why are things such a mess?</v>

290
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.083
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's been various attempts to </v>

291
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.330
<v Speaker 2>address that in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical and philosophical thought.</v>

292
00:16:43.331 --> 00:16:47.440
<v Speaker 2>And one is that they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live,</v>

293
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.200
<v Speaker 2>they vary in degrees of complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one is that,</v>

294
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is set up such that human </v>

295
00:16:53.741 --> 00:16:54.574
<v Speaker 2>beings have to find their own way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we have a role to play in this in </v>

296
00:16:56.831 --> 00:17:00.280
<v Speaker 2>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although God could fix it if,</v>

297
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.390
<v Speaker 2>if he wished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other reason that there was a,</v>

298
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.560
<v Speaker 2>something went wrong near the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>of time when when people became,</v>

299
00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:09.394
<v Speaker 2>or at least the beginning of human time </v>
<v Speaker 2>when people became self conscious and </v>

300
00:17:12.011 --> 00:17:15.190
<v Speaker 2>that it's never been rectified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other is,</v>

301
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.350
<v Speaker 2>and this is how it appears to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>

302
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.733
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

303
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:26.890
<v Speaker 2>it's something that has to be worked out</v>
<v Speaker 2>as time progresses,</v>

304
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.180
<v Speaker 2>that the nature of perfection can't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>predetermined.</v>

305
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:37.140
<v Speaker 2>It's too complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in some sense that the whole,</v>

306
00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:38.243
<v Speaker 2>that being itself is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is an attempt to compute the perfect </v>

307
00:17:41.491 --> 00:17:42.324
<v Speaker 2>final solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that no one knows what that is and </v>

308
00:17:44.911 --> 00:17:47.280
<v Speaker 2>that you can't compute it without </v>
<v Speaker 2>running it as a simulation.</v>

309
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we in that,</v>

310
00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:50.484
<v Speaker 2>and I believe that every time people </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a choice that the choice that you </v>

311
00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:59.841
<v Speaker 2>make is between tilting the world war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tilting the world in the direction whose</v>

312
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:01.104
<v Speaker 2>final destination would be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>resembling hell or tilting the world in </v>

313
00:18:03.721 --> 00:18:07.560
<v Speaker 2>a direction whose final destination </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be something approximating heaven.</v>

314
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.730
<v Speaker 2>And that you're always making that </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision and that you actually know that</v>

315
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:12.564
<v Speaker 2>you're making that decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you make it consciously at that </v>

316
00:18:14.341 --> 00:18:17.880
<v Speaker 2>point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think then part of the,</v>

317
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.970
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moral duty of people is to put their</v>

318
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:21.804
<v Speaker 2>lives together so that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently without arrogance and </v>

319
00:18:25.351 --> 00:18:26.910
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently without resentment.</v>

320
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:27.743
<v Speaker 2>So that every time they make a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they choose to push things in the right </v>

321
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:32.640
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're not vengeful and,</v>

322
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.940
<v Speaker 2>and angry and they're not out for </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction and,</v>

323
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.163
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

324
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>revenge.</v>

325
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.421
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

326
00:18:41.421 --> 00:18:42.254
<v Speaker 2>and the part of the reason that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to this solution is because I've </v>

327
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:48.300
<v Speaker 2>read what people who are extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive think.</v>

328
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:50.301
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

329
00:18:50.301 --> 00:18:51.134
<v Speaker 2>I you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find those writings in various </v>

330
00:18:52.621 --> 00:18:53.454
<v Speaker 2>places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the most illuminating forms of </v>

331
00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:56.670
<v Speaker 2>those writings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw for example,</v>

332
00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:57.504
<v Speaker 2>in the writings of the kid who shot up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the columbine high school and like he </v>

333
00:19:00.421 --> 00:19:03.600
<v Speaker 2>tells you exactly what he was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

334
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.580
<v Speaker 2>very clear and it's completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical.</v>

335
00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:07.470
<v Speaker 2>He explains it didn't religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

336
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:08.603
<v Speaker 2>He basically says that the world has </v>
<v Speaker 2>presently constituted it has is so evil </v>

337
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:15.130
<v Speaker 2>and so rife with suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

338
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.480
<v Speaker 2>including all of humanity that it would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be better if it was just wiped out.</v>

339
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:20.820
<v Speaker 2>And that's what he proceeds to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

340
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:21.871
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

341
00:19:21.871 --> 00:19:22.704
<v Speaker 2>and his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his viewpoint is of course contaminated </v>

342
00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:25.524
<v Speaker 2>by the fact that he places himself not </v>
<v Speaker 2>only above all other people but above </v>

343
00:19:28.471 --> 00:19:32.040
<v Speaker 2>God himself and then proceeds to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>judge and executioner.</v>

344
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.700
<v Speaker 2>And I don't see how you can read what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>said and not come to that conclusion.</v>

345
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.930
<v Speaker 2>That's just exactly what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

346
00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.840
<v Speaker 2>the connection between that and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

347
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.913
<v Speaker 2>the nature of the satanic impulse to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationally dominate and destroy are so </v>

348
00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:52.044
<v Speaker 2>close that they could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could've been formulated by the </v>

349
00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:56.670
<v Speaker 2>same thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in some sense,</v>

350
00:19:56.671 --> 00:19:57.504
<v Speaker 2>I think they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now when God makes man and a woman </v>

351
00:20:03.011 --> 00:20:03.844
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of things we talked about last </v>

352
00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:05.934
<v Speaker 2>time that I think are extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting is that despite that the </v>

353
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.653
<v Speaker 2>fact that this book is so ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the propositions that it </v>

354
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:15.270
<v Speaker 2>formulates is that both men and women </v>
<v Speaker 2>are formulated in the image of God,</v>

355
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.800
<v Speaker 2>which I think is quite remarkable.</v>

356
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.120
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you always hear with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to,</v>

357
00:20:19.121 --> 00:20:19.954
<v Speaker 2>especially to radical feminist thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something that I am I think is </v>

358
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:24.114
<v Speaker 2>destructive beyond comprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that prior to the emergence of </v>

359
00:20:28.381 --> 00:20:29.214
<v Speaker 2>feminist thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire structure of humanity was </v>

360
00:20:31.321 --> 00:20:33.900
<v Speaker 2>basically patriarchal and aimed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressing women.</v>

361
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.573
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was a certainly the case for </v>

362
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.160
<v Speaker 2>religious traditions like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the great monotheisms,</v>

363
00:20:41.161 --> 00:20:41.994
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that you can read </v>
<v Speaker 2>genesis and come to that conclusion </v>

364
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:44.934
<v Speaker 2>because one of the first statements is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that both men and women are divided in </v>

365
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:49.624
<v Speaker 2>their fundamental essence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is by no means of patriarchal </v>

366
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:53.494
<v Speaker 2>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's actually a miraculous </v>

367
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:55.534
<v Speaker 2>statement in some sense that that idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have been formulated so early in </v>

368
00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:00.004
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that says more about the </v>

369
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.093
<v Speaker 2>true nature of the historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between men and women than </v>

370
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.633
<v Speaker 2>any attempt to rewrite history across </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody illogical using some </v>

371
00:21:10.021 --> 00:21:12.850
<v Speaker 2>ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a priority idiot logical format.</v>

372
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.750
<v Speaker 2>So men and women are both created and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're created in the nae,</v>

373
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.050
<v Speaker 2>in the image of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means.</v>

374
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:21.483
<v Speaker 2>I think it means that they have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to turn possibility into </v>

375
00:21:24.341 --> 00:21:25.174
<v Speaker 2>actuality and that that's built into our</v>
<v Speaker 2>being and then they're placed in the </v>

376
00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 2>garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the idea of a garden is a very,</v>

377
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 2>very complicated idea because the garden</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Eden is,</v>

378
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:34.383
<v Speaker 2>is a particular type of place and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me to be is that the story </v>

379
00:21:38.441 --> 00:21:41.950
<v Speaker 2>is not only are describing archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 2>what men and women are,</v>

380
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:42.993
<v Speaker 2>but it's also describing archetipal Lee </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the environment of men and women </v>

381
00:21:46.331 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Speaker 2>has to be and the environment has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a garden and a walled garden.</v>

382
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.990
<v Speaker 2>An Eden means well watered place in para</v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

383
00:21:53.991 --> 00:21:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I means Paradise Means Wald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wald,</v>

384
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.450
<v Speaker 2>guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>

385
00:21:58.690 --> 00:21:59.523
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the idea that the semantic</v>
<v Speaker 2>indicators point to is that the proper </v>

386
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.223
<v Speaker 2>place for human beings is a place that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a combination of culture and nature </v>

387
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.633
<v Speaker 2>because the walls are there to protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to keep in and to keep out where's </v>

388
00:22:13.991 --> 00:22:16.180
<v Speaker 2>the garden itself is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

389
00:22:16.181 --> 00:22:17.014
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flourishing of nature in some </v>

390
00:22:18.491 --> 00:22:19.540
<v Speaker 2>independent manner.</v>

391
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Well also under the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

392
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.840
<v Speaker 2>what under the conscious apprehension </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shaping of the,</v>

393
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.540
<v Speaker 2>of the inhabitants of that particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

394
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.943
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's part of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are struggling with right </v>

395
00:22:32.171 --> 00:22:35.170
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in the 21st century and a big part</v>

396
00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:37.420
<v Speaker 2>of what faces us is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

397
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 2>it appears that we have the ability </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether we want it or not,</v>

398
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:41.883
<v Speaker 2>to shape the manner in which the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet manifest itself over the next </v>

399
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.450
<v Speaker 2>endless span of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're,</v>

400
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:50.284
<v Speaker 2>we're caught at the moment trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide exactly what that should look </v>

401
00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:55.990
<v Speaker 2>like and whether we want the </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility or not.</v>

402
00:22:55.991 --> 00:22:58.610
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that since it's on us,</v>

403
00:22:58.611 --> 00:22:59.444
<v Speaker 2>we should wake up and take the </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility because the thing will </v>

404
00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:02.734
<v Speaker 2>deteriorate of its own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that means we have difficult </v>

405
00:23:05.561 --> 00:23:06.394
<v Speaker 2>decisions to make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the moment we're mostly fighting </v>

406
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:09.214
<v Speaker 2>about who's bad and who's good within </v>
<v Speaker 2>that entire struggle and looking for </v>

407
00:23:13.061 --> 00:23:16.060
<v Speaker 2>people to blame about why it's not as </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect as it could be.</v>

408
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a lot of reasons it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not as perfect as it could be.</v>

409
00:23:18.851 --> 00:23:21.760
<v Speaker 2>And I think that one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental reasons is that none of your</v>

410
00:23:21.761 --> 00:23:23.710
<v Speaker 2>lives or as perfect as you could make </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

411
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:25.263
<v Speaker 2>And so because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not in any position to make the </v>

412
00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:30.880
<v Speaker 2>appropriate decisions that would have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be made in order to set the world on its</v>

413
00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 2>proper course because it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated set of decisions.</v>

414
00:23:34.961 --> 00:23:35.794
<v Speaker 2>And that if you make a mistake because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're ideologically predisposed or </v>

415
00:23:38.351 --> 00:23:42.250
<v Speaker 2>because your life is full of deceit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and inadequacy,</v>

416
00:23:42.251 --> 00:23:44.350
<v Speaker 2>all of which you could conceivably </v>
<v Speaker 2>addressed,</v>

417
00:23:44.351 --> 00:23:45.184
<v Speaker 2>then why would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that you would be reliable </v>

418
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:49.820
<v Speaker 2>enough to make the kind of decisions </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would set things right?</v>

419
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.270
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complicated and you know,</v>

420
00:23:53.271 --> 00:23:54.104
<v Speaker 2>if we want to put the world in order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to extend our </v>

421
00:23:57.141 --> 00:24:00.560
<v Speaker 2>capacity tremendously because we're just</v>
<v Speaker 2>not up to the task at the moment.</v>

422
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.270
<v Speaker 2>It's not only that people won't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not only that people actively fight</v>

423
00:24:05.271 --> 00:24:06.104
<v Speaker 2>against making things better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also that we just don't know what </v>

424
00:24:08.841 --> 00:24:13.700
<v Speaker 2>to do and it's a massive problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

425
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.253
<v Speaker 2>and I don't believe that it's a problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can solve unless you put your </v>

426
00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:18.314
<v Speaker 2>own house together to begin with because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that you have the </v>

427
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:21.643
<v Speaker 2>psychological sophistication or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual stability to begin to address </v>

428
00:24:25.221 --> 00:24:26.054
<v Speaker 2>such issues before you are standing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>firm ground firm ground that you've </v>

429
00:24:30.021 --> 00:24:30.854
<v Speaker 2>placed beneath your own feet and it's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple matter to get your own life </v>

430
00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:34.934
<v Speaker 2>together and then it's no simple matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get your own life together while </v>

431
00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:38.384
<v Speaker 2>you're similar caneously getting your </v>
<v Speaker 2>family's life together and then there's </v>

432
00:24:41.151 --> 00:24:41.984
<v Speaker 2>you and your family and your community </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all those things have to be brought </v>

433
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:48.080
<v Speaker 2>into harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I've been very,</v>

434
00:24:48.081 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 2>very impressed with over the years is is</v>
<v Speaker 2>piaget's idea of and equilibrated state.</v>

435
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:53.863
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's the appropriate </v>

436
00:24:56.361 --> 00:24:57.194
<v Speaker 2>paradisical vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what piaget basically said was that </v>

437
00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:00.884
<v Speaker 2>it was possible to set up complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems so that they were voluntarily </v>

438
00:25:03.651 --> 00:25:04.484
<v Speaker 2>self sustaining and so across,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so at voluntarily self sustaining would </v>

439
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:09.224
<v Speaker 2>mean self sustaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they would mean self sustaining for </v>

440
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:15.110
<v Speaker 2>you it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means self sustaining for you and the</v>

441
00:25:15.111 --> 00:25:15.944
<v Speaker 2>people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would mean self sustaining for you </v>

442
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:20.180
<v Speaker 2>and the people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now next week,</v>

443
00:25:20.181 --> 00:25:21.014
<v Speaker 2>next month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the year after that and then across </v>

444
00:25:22.851 --> 00:25:23.684
<v Speaker 2>multiple spans of time and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a harmonious balance that that </v>

445
00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 2>implies that I think you have to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the bottom up because it's too damn</v>

446
00:25:31.341 --> 00:25:33.590
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you just don't,</v>

447
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:34.603
<v Speaker 2>you just don't know what the appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 2>next step would be and that and the </v>

448
00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:42.980
<v Speaker 2>ability to determine what the next step </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be requires certain fundamentals.</v>

449
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:43.933
<v Speaker 2>It requires certain fundamental skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skills that have to be brought to bear </v>

450
00:25:48.891 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 2>on the problem in order to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

451
00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.790
<v Speaker 2>One of them would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you and I,</v>

452
00:25:52.791 --> 00:25:53.624
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to sit together and determine how </v>

453
00:25:55.251 --> 00:25:57.950
<v Speaker 2>to establish and equilibrated space </v>
<v Speaker 2>right here and now,</v>

454
00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.053
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that we have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to be able to listen to each </v>

455
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:02.504
<v Speaker 2>other and we may have to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to each other in such a way that </v>

456
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.370
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I happen to be better at articulating</v>

457
00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:11.204
<v Speaker 2>myself than you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I have to lend you my skills of </v>

458
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:17.540
<v Speaker 2>articulation to help you understand what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want so that we can actually discuss</v>

459
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.440
<v Speaker 2>how we could mutually obtain our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

460
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.770
<v Speaker 2>our individual goals simultaneously in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same space.</v>

461
00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.410
<v Speaker 2>It's very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

462
00:26:27.411 --> 00:26:30.200
<v Speaker 2>And that would also mean that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to know what you want.</v>

463
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.780
<v Speaker 2>And I think that in order for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what you want,</v>

464
00:26:32.781 --> 00:26:35.810
<v Speaker 2>you have to know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you have to know who you are,</v>

465
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:37.700
<v Speaker 2>that means you also have to know who you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

466
00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:39.500
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the way down to the,</v>

467
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the bottom of the demonic side,</v>

468
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 2>which is no easy thing to do</v>

469
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.600
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

470
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.670
<v Speaker 3>it's bottomless Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

471
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.713
<v Speaker 3>But if you don't take it into account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what you have is an equilibrated </v>

472
00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:51.864
<v Speaker 3>solution that's unstable and naive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to be helpful because </v>

473
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:59.790
<v Speaker 3>the parts of you that you haven't called</v>
<v Speaker 3>in to the table so to speak,</v>

474
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.340
<v Speaker 3>are going to rebel and cause all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of trouble.</v>

475
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.170
<v Speaker 3>And so to some degree that means that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to make peace with this side of</v>

476
00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:08.004
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

477
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.180
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

478
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:10.523
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>predatory and destructive in order to </v>

479
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:14.274
<v Speaker 3>bring that element into the discussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that it can be incorporated into the </v>

480
00:27:18.361 --> 00:27:20.820
<v Speaker 3>solution that's going to propagate it </v>
<v Speaker 3>across time.</v>

481
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:21.923
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might think these are metaphysical </v>

482
00:27:22.771 --> 00:27:24.750
<v Speaker 3>considerations and that they're very </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstract,</v>

483
00:27:24.751 --> 00:27:26.670
<v Speaker 3>but I can tell you they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

484
00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:27.504
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you people set up your intimate </v>

485
00:27:29.101 --> 00:27:30.930
<v Speaker 3>relationships with one another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

486
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.033
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

487
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.620
<v Speaker 3>your marriages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll say for the time being,</v>

488
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:35.930
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

489
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:36.763
<v Speaker 3>Unless you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it managed to incorporate the elements </v>

490
00:27:39.021 --> 00:27:42.470
<v Speaker 3>of your own psyche that are aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sexually demanding.</v>

491
00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:43.453
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you're not going to set up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage that is the least bit </v>

492
00:27:46.641 --> 00:27:51.641
<v Speaker 3>satisfying or stable and it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>obvious at all how monstrous an awful,</v>

493
00:27:52.551 --> 00:27:56.390
<v Speaker 3>both the husband and the wife have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>across time so that they find each other</v>

494
00:27:56.391 --> 00:27:57.224
<v Speaker 3>mutually satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that you can live as you </v>

495
00:28:01.431 --> 00:28:02.264
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>naive persona together happily over any </v>

496
00:28:04.911 --> 00:28:05.744
<v Speaker 3>length of time is completely absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just will not happen because the </v>

497
00:28:08.511 --> 00:28:09.344
<v Speaker 3>parts of you that are deeply animalistic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and powerful are going to go off and </v>

498
00:28:13.341 --> 00:28:17.870
<v Speaker 3>have their own adventure at times when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you win for you,</v>

499
00:28:17.871 --> 00:28:20.480
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be the least convenient.</v>

500
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

501
00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.490
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so back to the garden.</v>

502
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.353
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the garden seems to be something like </v>

503
00:28:26.261 --> 00:28:28.600
<v Speaker 3>the optimal balance of nature and </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

504
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.943
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the genesis story is offering the </v>

505
00:28:32.441 --> 00:28:33.274
<v Speaker 3>proposition that the proper environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>for human beings is actually partly </v>

506
00:28:37.631 --> 00:28:40.660
<v Speaker 3>constructed and partly spontaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

507
00:28:40.661 --> 00:28:42.400
<v Speaker 3>And that is what a garden is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

508
00:28:42.401 --> 00:28:47.401
<v Speaker 3>Because a garden does what it wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do and it's also the product of billions</v>

509
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:50.080
<v Speaker 3>of years of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you're in the garden,</v>

510
00:28:50.081 --> 00:28:50.914
<v Speaker 3>you're tending it and shaping it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting it and walling it in so that </v>

511
00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.073
<v Speaker 3>you get the advantages of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the spontaneity that the natural </v>

512
00:28:59.351 --> 00:29:00.184
<v Speaker 3>world can produce along with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent and judicious order that </v>

513
00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.690
<v Speaker 3>heightened consciousness and attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>can bring to the situation.</v>

514
00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.093
<v Speaker 3>And so the story basically says that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>human environment is half constructed </v>

515
00:29:12.641 --> 00:29:16.270
<v Speaker 3>and half natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to me to be approximately</v>

516
00:29:16.271 --> 00:29:19.090
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we are cultural creatures.</v>

517
00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:19.924
<v Speaker 3>We're not going back to the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one wants to and no wonder because </v>

518
00:29:23.801 --> 00:29:24.634
<v Speaker 3>it's full of snakes and poisonous </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiders and you live 30 years and like </v>

519
00:29:28.781 --> 00:29:29.614
<v Speaker 3>it's not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that isn't us where culture and </v>

520
00:29:33.581 --> 00:29:35.980
<v Speaker 3>nature at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

521
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.250
<v Speaker 3>so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

522
00:29:39.251 --> 00:29:44.251
<v Speaker 3>what exactly is the proper garden?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I wrote this.</v>

523
00:29:46.871 --> 00:29:50.470
<v Speaker 3>A walled garden is a productive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural place given order by structure.</v>

524
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.993
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a localized replication of the </v>

525
00:29:53.861 --> 00:29:58.861
<v Speaker 3>interplay of chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The man who's a kenotic logos,</v>

526
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.823
<v Speaker 3>there's this idea of Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very strange idea because one of </v>

527
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:06.820
<v Speaker 3>the propositions of Christianity was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that God became man.</v>

528
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.103
<v Speaker 3>And so there's this idea that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the possibility of direct unity between </v>

529
00:30:11.921 --> 00:30:12.754
<v Speaker 3>whatever the divine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the total consciousness of </v>

530
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:20.980
<v Speaker 3>being might be at any individual person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the questions that of course,</v>

531
00:30:20.981 --> 00:30:24.820
<v Speaker 3>that particularly the Catholics tortured</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves with as a consequence of that</v>

532
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:28.930
<v Speaker 3>piece of doctrine was how could God </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly fit himself into the frame of a</v>

533
00:30:28.931 --> 00:30:32.860
<v Speaker 3>human being without blowing it into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into shattered bits.</v>

534
00:30:32.861 --> 00:30:33.694
<v Speaker 3>And the basic idea that the Catholics </v>
<v Speaker 3>came up with was that God underwent </v>

535
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Kenosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a kind of emptying.</v>

536
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.133
<v Speaker 3>And so he emptied himself to the point </v>
<v Speaker 3>where there was only enough left of him </v>

537
00:30:43.751 --> 00:30:46.450
<v Speaker 3>that he could fit inside a body without </v>
<v Speaker 3>blowing it into pieces.</v>

538
00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:47.284
<v Speaker 3>And I think what that means in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense is that the consciousness that </v>

539
00:30:49.961 --> 00:30:53.620
<v Speaker 3>each of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each of us has within us is a reflection</v>

540
00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:54.454
<v Speaker 3>of the divine consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's scaled down to the point where </v>

541
00:30:57.491 --> 00:31:01.390
<v Speaker 3>it can inhabit this sort of framework </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we constitute without,</v>

542
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.420
<v Speaker 3>without overwhelming it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without destroying it.</v>

543
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.033
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea is that Adam and eve are</v>
<v Speaker 3>these kinds of reduced divine </v>

544
00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:17.020
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and that they inhabit a </v>
<v Speaker 3>microcosm of chaos and order.</v>

545
00:31:17.021 --> 00:31:21.370
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a localized representation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the entire structure of via.</v>

546
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.593
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable because I do believe that </v>

547
00:31:24.851 --> 00:31:25.684
<v Speaker 3>it's perfectly appropriate for each of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to assume that what you inhabit in </v>

548
00:31:29.231 --> 00:31:32.680
<v Speaker 3>your own being is a microcosm of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entirety.</v>

549
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.033
<v Speaker 3>What else could it possibly be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you take seriously the </v>

550
00:31:37.211 --> 00:31:39.520
<v Speaker 3>proposition that what being is </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructed of is,</v>

551
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:40.503
<v Speaker 3>is chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you have in front of you is </v>

552
00:31:43.481 --> 00:31:46.450
<v Speaker 3>chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe you have just the right amount</v>

553
00:31:46.451 --> 00:31:49.900
<v Speaker 3>of it in front of you so that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring it into a harmonious relationship.</v>

554
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better or,</v>

555
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 3>or your or there's going to be hell to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pay.</v>

556
00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:59.500
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like it's optional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's optional is whether you accept</v>

557
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:02.890
<v Speaker 3>the responsibility of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think is optional.</v>

558
00:32:02.891 --> 00:32:05.380
<v Speaker 3>I also think that that's why people </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't wake up.</v>

559
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:06.873
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's been a story throughout </v>

560
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:08.973
<v Speaker 3>the entire history of mankind since we </v>
<v Speaker 3>became conscious that people could wake </v>

561
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:14.440
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could become enlightened,</v>

562
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.780
<v Speaker 3>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

563
00:32:16.781 --> 00:32:17.800
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear people,</v>

564
00:32:17.801 --> 00:32:18.634
<v Speaker 3>especially the new age people and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think they were sort of motivated </v>

565
00:32:21.011 --> 00:32:24.460
<v Speaker 3>to begin with by Joseph Campbell and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe by the human potential people that</v>

566
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:27.280
<v Speaker 3>if you just follow your bliss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could wake up.</v>

567
00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:31.600
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand why that idea emerged.</v>

568
00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:34.210
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a classic 1960s idea,</v>

569
00:32:34.211 --> 00:32:35.044
<v Speaker 3>which is that you could have heaven with</v>
<v Speaker 3>no responsibility whatsoever just by </v>

570
00:32:38.711 --> 00:32:41.330
<v Speaker 3>doing what felt good all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

571
00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:43.670
<v Speaker 3>and I think there's a kernel of truth in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

572
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.773
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with the whole idea is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's no responsibility in it at </v>

573
00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:50.390
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that if you wake up,</v>

574
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:54.110
<v Speaker 3>the problem with waking up is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to take responsibility.</v>

575
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 3>And then the question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

576
00:32:55.881 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 3>how much responsibility do you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take?</v>

577
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.143
<v Speaker 3>An answer to that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on how much you want to wake </v>

578
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 3>up because if you want to wake up </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely,</v>

579
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:06.710
<v Speaker 3>maybe then you have to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for the whole thing.</v>

580
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.143
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this old idea in Christianity </v>

581
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:11.893
<v Speaker 3>that Christ took the sins of the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>on his shoulders and that's a very </v>

582
00:33:14.181 --> 00:33:15.014
<v Speaker 3>strange idea and what Christianity has </v>
<v Speaker 3>done with that idea to some degree has </v>

583
00:33:18.411 --> 00:33:19.244
<v Speaker 3>made the proposition that because Christ</v>
<v Speaker 3>took the sins of the world on his </v>

584
00:33:22.371 --> 00:33:23.204
<v Speaker 3>shoulders and died for us as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence that everything has been </v>

585
00:33:26.361 --> 00:33:27.194
<v Speaker 3>redeemed.</v>

586
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.290
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the problem that you pointed</v>

587
00:33:30.291 --> 00:33:33.020
<v Speaker 3>out when he was talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>development of science from Alchemy,</v>

588
00:33:33.021 --> 00:33:36.200
<v Speaker 3>is that everything doesn't seem to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been redeemed.</v>

589
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.053
<v Speaker 3>There's still plenty of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of the reason that you and believe </v>

590
00:33:40.521 --> 00:33:41.354
<v Speaker 3>that alchemy developed into science in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe was because the Christian </v>

591
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:45.224
<v Speaker 3>community realized at an unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>level that the proposition that reality </v>

592
00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:50.714
<v Speaker 3>had been redeemed by the death of Christ</v>
<v Speaker 3>was an incomplete assumption because it </v>

593
00:33:53.451 --> 00:33:54.284
<v Speaker 3>didn't seem to be working.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there was a tremendous emphasis </v>

594
00:33:58.881 --> 00:34:01.190
<v Speaker 3>on spiritual development and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity and,</v>

595
00:34:01.191 --> 00:34:02.024
<v Speaker 3>and the idea of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the death redeeming humanity was a </v>

596
00:34:05.451 --> 00:34:08.750
<v Speaker 3>spiritual idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it left the material world behind as</v>

597
00:34:08.751 --> 00:34:13.490
<v Speaker 3>something that was essentially damned </v>
<v Speaker 3>and young's idea was that the unredeemed</v>

598
00:34:13.491 --> 00:34:17.630
<v Speaker 3>material world was crying out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And human beings,</v>

599
00:34:17.631 --> 00:34:18.464
<v Speaker 3>especially in Europe responded to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way they responded to that was </v>

600
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:21.974
<v Speaker 3>by beginning to dream the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformations of the material world </v>

601
00:34:24.891 --> 00:34:27.350
<v Speaker 3>could bring about the redeemed state.</v>

602
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.130
<v Speaker 3>And that that was the motivating dream </v>
<v Speaker 3>that led to the emergence of science.</v>

603
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.073
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't have a better theory </v>

604
00:34:35.061 --> 00:34:37.580
<v Speaker 3>for why science emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a pretty damn good one.</v>

605
00:34:37.581 --> 00:34:38.151
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

606
00:34:38.151 --> 00:34:40.460
<v Speaker 3>young spent a lot of time trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure that out.</v>

607
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:41.601
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

608
00:34:41.601 --> 00:34:44.000
<v Speaker 3>it strikes me as something that's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>much the case.</v>

609
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:45.283
<v Speaker 3>So maybe that part of niches commentary </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the Christianity lost its moral </v>

610
00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:54.800
<v Speaker 3>forest because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

611
00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:55.873
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it continually pushed paradise off to a </v>

612
00:34:57.741 --> 00:35:02.390
<v Speaker 3>place that was beyond death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>alleviated the responsibility of all the</v>

613
00:35:02.391 --> 00:35:03.224
<v Speaker 3>individuals who were currently alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It alleviated their responsibility to </v>

614
00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:07.934
<v Speaker 3>bring it about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe that's why the whole damn </v>

615
00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:13.370
<v Speaker 3>thing came crashing down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

616
00:35:13.371 --> 00:35:14.880
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it lost its moral footing.</v>

617
00:35:14.881 --> 00:35:18.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>niches are often regarded as perhaps the</v>

618
00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:21.530
<v Speaker 3>most influential antichristian who ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>lived.</v>

619
00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:25.640
<v Speaker 3>But I have always read him as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>salutary,</v>

620
00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>corrective.</v>

621
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:29.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if something's rotten,</v>

622
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.033
<v Speaker 3>something that goes in there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroys the rod is actually it's </v>

623
00:35:33.051 --> 00:35:34.250
<v Speaker 3>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not it's enemy.</v>

624
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.713
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that was the role that </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] played in relationship to </v>

625
00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Christianity.</v>

626
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:39.953
<v Speaker 2>He thought that as soon as it had </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappeared into some other world than </v>

627
00:35:42.031 --> 00:35:45.540
<v Speaker 2>it had lost its moral right to exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it left everything behind.</v>

628
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Buddhist doctrine that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can attain nirvana,</v>

629
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individually.</v>

630
00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:51.354
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should detach yourself from </v>

631
00:35:53.161 --> 00:35:53.994
<v Speaker 2>existence and attain Nirvana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Existence in and of itself can go to </v>

632
00:35:57.331 --> 00:35:59.100
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not a very,</v>

633
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.970
<v Speaker 2>it's not a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

634
00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:02.973
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

635
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.080
<v Speaker 2>it's an irresponsible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's irresponsible doctrine.</v>

636
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buddha himself left nervana to come back</v>

637
00:36:10.111 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 2>to redeem humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He decided he,</v>

638
00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:15.570
<v Speaker 2>and one of his most fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>temptations was the gods offered him the</v>

639
00:36:15.571 --> 00:36:16.404
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to stay in paradise and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>left that dose so that he could come </v>

640
00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:21.420
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

641
00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:25.620
<v Speaker 2>and spread his teachings around to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to bring everything else up to the state</v>

642
00:36:25.621 --> 00:36:26.454
<v Speaker 2>of being redeemed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think that the idea that you </v>

643
00:36:28.861 --> 00:36:29.694
<v Speaker 2>can escape as a reasonable idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a running away from </v>

644
00:36:32.341 --> 00:36:35.070
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

645
00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.860
<v Speaker 2>walled garden is a productive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural place given order by structure.</v>

646
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:41.694
<v Speaker 2>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a localized replication of the </v>

647
00:36:42.781 --> 00:36:46.510
<v Speaker 2>interplay of chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The man who's a keynotek logos says,</v>

648
00:36:46.511 --> 00:36:47.344
<v Speaker 2>place there to inhabit and keep it the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that the garden may be also a well </v>

649
00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:51.324
<v Speaker 2>watered place into meets the same water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The primal element commonly represents </v>

650
00:36:55.621 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 2>fertility and generative chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

651
00:36:58.921 --> 00:37:01.380
<v Speaker 2>the garden itself is tended structured </v>
<v Speaker 2>and ordered.</v>

652
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:02.693
<v Speaker 2>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a garden is both productive and </v>

653
00:37:03.811 --> 00:37:05.820
<v Speaker 2>sheltered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly if it is walled.</v>

654
00:37:05.821 --> 00:37:09.840
<v Speaker 2>And well-watered throughout the garden </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a microcosm of being.</v>

655
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.153
<v Speaker 2>It is in turn the place of man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>female and male who are microcosms of </v>

656
00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:17.080
<v Speaker 2>logos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say what,</v>

657
00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.120
<v Speaker 2>what that story suggests is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire destiny of being itself is played</v>

658
00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:24.594
<v Speaker 2>out in a microcosmic form in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>localized environments that every human </v>

659
00:37:27.721 --> 00:37:28.554
<v Speaker 2>being in habits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a perfectly </v>

660
00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:32.730
<v Speaker 2>reasonable way of looking at it.</v>

661
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.830
<v Speaker 2>And I can't see how it could be any </v>
<v Speaker 2>other way.</v>

662
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the garden and the tree and the Lord God</v>

663
00:37:40.741 --> 00:37:42.360
<v Speaker 2>planted a garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eastward and Eden.</v>

664
00:37:42.361 --> 00:37:46.020
<v Speaker 2>And there he put the man who even with </v>
<v Speaker 2>whom he had formed and out of the ground</v>

665
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:46.854
<v Speaker 2>made the Lord God to grow every tree </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is pleasant to the sight and good </v>

666
00:37:49.261 --> 00:37:50.094
<v Speaker 2>for food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tree of life also in the midst of </v>

667
00:37:51.901 --> 00:37:54.330
<v Speaker 2>the garden and the tree of the knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 2>of good and evil.</v>

668
00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:59.490
<v Speaker 2>Now the whole tree idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's insanely complicated.</v>

669
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:00.803
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that you might think </v>

670
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:02.934
<v Speaker 2>about with regards to trees is that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend a bloody long time in them during </v>

671
00:38:05.731 --> 00:38:08.760
<v Speaker 2>our evolutionary history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tens of millions of years.</v>

672
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.253
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that that being is a tree </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if there are snakes in the tree and </v>

673
00:38:14.971 --> 00:38:15.804
<v Speaker 2>around the bottom of the tree was </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally true for us for some tens of </v>

674
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:20.010
<v Speaker 2>millions of years.</v>

675
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.590
<v Speaker 2>And I think I talked to you about um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lynn,</v>

676
00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Isabelle and her hypothesis about snakes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and vision.</v>

677
00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her basic answer,</v>

678
00:38:27.691 --> 00:38:28.524
<v Speaker 2>biological hypothesis is that it was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>arms race between our tree dwelling </v>

679
00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:32.763
<v Speaker 2>ancestors and predatory snakes that gave</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings incredible vision that we </v>

680
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:39.010
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly the story that's laid</v>

681
00:38:39.011 --> 00:38:43.720
<v Speaker 2>out in the genesis story because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the snake that gives Adam and eve vision</v>

682
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.340
<v Speaker 2>and strangely enough to snake gives Adam</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eve enough vision so that the scales</v>

683
00:38:48.341 --> 00:38:49.174
<v Speaker 2>fall from the rise and so that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they wake up and re and re realize </v>

684
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:53.980
<v Speaker 2>that they're naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

685
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:58.870
<v Speaker 2>that seems to me to be a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that we became more and more</v>

686
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:00.920
<v Speaker 1>okay</v>

687
00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:01.753
<v Speaker 2>cognitively and attention Lee complex as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a consequence of being chased by </v>

688
00:39:06.801 --> 00:39:08.870
<v Speaker 2>something that was evolving along with </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

689
00:39:08.871 --> 00:39:09.704
<v Speaker 2>So that's an evolutionary arms race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sort of thing happens in evolution </v>

690
00:39:12.501 --> 00:39:15.410
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in order to outsmart the snake,</v>

691
00:39:15.411 --> 00:39:18.710
<v Speaker 2>we had to grow brain that was so big </v>
<v Speaker 2>that something catastrophic happened.</v>

692
00:39:18.711 --> 00:39:19.544
<v Speaker 2>And the catastrophic occurrence was that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we became so aware of the nature of </v>

693
00:39:23.301 --> 00:39:26.270
<v Speaker 2>being end up our own being that we could</v>
<v Speaker 2>start to see its limits.</v>

694
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings can envision time.</v>

695
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.313
<v Speaker 2>It's something that distinguishes us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think completely from other animals </v>

696
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:37.190
<v Speaker 2>because we can see the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can see multiple potential futures.</v>

697
00:39:37.191 --> 00:39:38.024
<v Speaker 2>And of course that's a massive advantage</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that means that we can see </v>

698
00:39:40.551 --> 00:39:43.070
<v Speaker 2>terrible futures and strive to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

699
00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.940
<v Speaker 2>But it also means that we can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitably terrible future.</v>

700
00:39:46.941 --> 00:39:47.774
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that even if you're not hungry </v>

701
00:39:49.971 --> 00:39:51.650
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be hungry in the future.</v>

702
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:55.130
<v Speaker 2>And even if you're not ill now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be ill in the future.</v>

703
00:39:55.131 --> 00:39:58.520
<v Speaker 2>And that even though you're not old now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be old in the future.</v>

704
00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.130
<v Speaker 2>And not the same as the case for </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone that you know.</v>

705
00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.410
<v Speaker 2>And then everything decays and goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

706
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:08.900
<v Speaker 2>And so that I think is what genesis </v>
<v Speaker 2>portrays as the fall.</v>

707
00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.880
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think there's any doubt </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

708
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.983
<v Speaker 2>I think if you read the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people have been reading this </v>

709
00:40:14.031 --> 00:40:14.864
<v Speaker 2>story for a very long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me it makes the case about as </v>

710
00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:20.090
<v Speaker 2>straightforwardly as any story possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

711
00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.553
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

712
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.630
<v Speaker 2>now more about the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

713
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.473
<v Speaker 2>there's the evolutionary tree and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary tree has the snake in it </v>

714
00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:53.620
<v Speaker 2>and the evolutionary tree also bears </v>
<v Speaker 2>fruit.</v>

715
00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.550
<v Speaker 2>And do you know that our color vision </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved to detect ripe fruit?</v>

716
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.550
<v Speaker 2>And I think the part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>eve</v>

717
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.083
<v Speaker 1>temps</v>

718
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Adam towards consciousness is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>women shared fruit with men.</v>

719
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.820
<v Speaker 2>And sharing food is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very weird thing.</v>

720
00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:10.654
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most mammals share food with their </v>

721
00:41:11.831 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 2>offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

722
00:41:12.851 --> 00:41:16.270
<v Speaker 2>So most other mammals will share food </v>
<v Speaker 2>with their infants,</v>

723
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:17.583
<v Speaker 2>but human beings are very peculiar in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we'll share food with each other </v>

724
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:24.130
<v Speaker 2>and we share food with strangers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's built into us.</v>

725
00:41:24.131 --> 00:41:27.730
<v Speaker 2>This isn't some cultural construct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human being share food.</v>

726
00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.980
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we don't eat communally,</v>

727
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.220
<v Speaker 2>our whole ability to regulate our eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes a strain,</v>

728
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.183
<v Speaker 2>get sick.</v>

729
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:35.263
<v Speaker 3>And we know perfectly well that our </v>
<v Speaker 3>vision evolved to detect ripe fruit </v>

730
00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:38.684
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things we're really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good at is detecting the difference </v>

731
00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:46.271
<v Speaker 3>between red and green and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between fruit and evolution</v>

732
00:41:46.581 --> 00:41:47.414
<v Speaker 3>and women and consciousness is so tight </v>
<v Speaker 3>that even many of the attributes that </v>

733
00:41:51.471 --> 00:41:55.160
<v Speaker 3>men find beautiful in women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our fruit like attributes.</v>

734
00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:56.533
<v Speaker 3>So it's an old and deep association.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think part of the reason that </v>

735
00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:01.724
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way women tempted men towards self </v>

736
00:42:03.551 --> 00:42:04.384
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is imagine that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>more self conscious if you're </v>

737
00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:08.234
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that the idea that women </v>

738
00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:10.634
<v Speaker 3>became self conscious first is probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>right because women first of all had to </v>

739
00:42:14.841 --> 00:42:17.720
<v Speaker 3>contend with the fact that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>small and easily damaged.</v>

740
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:18.943
<v Speaker 3>But even more particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to contend with the fact that </v>

741
00:42:21.231 --> 00:42:24.710
<v Speaker 3>they had infants who were small and </v>
<v Speaker 3>easily damaged.</v>

742
00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.850
<v Speaker 3>And I think that female nervous systems </v>
<v Speaker 3>have actually evolved so that they're,</v>

743
00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.073
<v Speaker 3>they're optimized for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the female infant dyad and not for </v>

744
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:35.840
<v Speaker 3>the female herself.</v>

745
00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Because you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

746
00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:41.630
<v Speaker 3>why are women more sensitive to negative</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion and higher in agreeableness than</v>

747
00:42:41.631 --> 00:42:43.640
<v Speaker 3>men?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it makes perfect sense.</v>

748
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:45.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of reasons why it </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be,</v>

749
00:42:45.261 --> 00:42:46.094
<v Speaker 3>but it particularly makes perfect sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>if the nervous system that women are </v>

750
00:42:49.011 --> 00:42:49.844
<v Speaker 3>using is adapted so that it's responding</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the world as as if the woman is a </v>

751
00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:58.550
<v Speaker 3>dyad between her and her infant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly how she's going to have</v>

752
00:42:58.551 --> 00:43:01.730
<v Speaker 3>to act if she's going to get an infant </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the age of,</v>

753
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.660
<v Speaker 3>well zero to four certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we could say from zero to 14,</v>

754
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:06.733
<v Speaker 3>it's a hell of a burden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the biggest maternal burden that </v>

755
00:43:08.841 --> 00:43:13.190
<v Speaker 3>any creature on the planet caries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for some,</v>

756
00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Speaker 3>in some manner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women were able to entice men into pr,</v>

757
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:18.440
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

758
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:19.423
<v Speaker 3>dyadic pair bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a variety of reasons why </v>

759
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:22.670
<v Speaker 3>that might be.</v>

760
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Some of the evolutionary biologists </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's because women are continually</v>

761
00:43:26.421 --> 00:43:30.500
<v Speaker 3>sexually available,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes them unique among about most</v>

762
00:43:30.501 --> 00:43:31.334
<v Speaker 3>animals and certainly unique among </v>
<v Speaker 3>primates so that it made sense from a </v>

763
00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:34.994
<v Speaker 3>sexual perspective persec perspective </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a man to bind himself to one woman </v>

764
00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:40.154
<v Speaker 3>because men are rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a strong sex drive and </v>

765
00:43:42.951 --> 00:43:44.780
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tend towards,</v>

766
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:49.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they certainly as a general rule want to</v>

767
00:43:49.701 --> 00:43:54.290
<v Speaker 3>have sexual relationships more often </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the typical woman.</v>

768
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:55.124
<v Speaker 3>But women are capable of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And women share food and women are </v>

769
00:43:58.341 --> 00:43:59.174
<v Speaker 3>gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea that women enticed men </v>

770
00:44:01.821 --> 00:44:02.654
<v Speaker 3>into self consciousness by sharing food </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them strikes me as highly probable </v>

771
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.800
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an enticement.</v>

772
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.863
<v Speaker 3>And I think that women did make men self</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious and I think they did it a </v>

773
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:15.194
<v Speaker 3>whole bunch of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think they first did it by </v>

774
00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.013
<v Speaker 3>making men more and more aware of how </v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable women and children were and </v>

775
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:22.363
<v Speaker 3>and drawing their attention to the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in principle that placed a moral </v>

776
00:44:26.121 --> 00:44:28.520
<v Speaker 3>responsibility on the man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

777
00:44:28.521 --> 00:44:32.490
<v Speaker 3>we think of that as self evident now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's certainly not self self evident</v>

778
00:44:32.491 --> 00:44:35.040
<v Speaker 3>in the animal kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

779
00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:35.874
<v Speaker 3>it's a particularly human discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I also think that women made </v>

780
00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 3>men self conscious by rejecting them </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

781
00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:49.150
<v Speaker 3>And so what that also means is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>women produced an evolutionary arms race</v>

782
00:44:49.151 --> 00:44:52.210
<v Speaker 3>in some sense among men and between men </v>
<v Speaker 3>and women.</v>

783
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.910
<v Speaker 3>Because one of the things we have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>account for you remember,</v>

784
00:44:54.911 --> 00:44:57.520
<v Speaker 3>is are incredibly rapid cortical growth.</v>

785
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

786
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:59.623
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it seems to me that our whole </v>

787
00:45:00.201 --> 00:45:03.350
<v Speaker 3>variety of positive feedback loops got </v>
<v Speaker 3>going at the same time.</v>

788
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:04.603
<v Speaker 3>And that's what produced a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 3>increase in our cortical capacity up to </v>

789
00:45:08.841 --> 00:45:11.960
<v Speaker 3>the point where we became aware of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>own vulnerability.</v>

790
00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.970
<v Speaker 3>And that was the birth of self </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

791
00:45:13.971 --> 00:45:16.310
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's very interested</v>

792
00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:17.203
<v Speaker 3>interesting in genesis is that genesis </v>
<v Speaker 3>portrays the emergence of self </v>

793
00:45:22.221 --> 00:45:23.054
<v Speaker 3>consciousness as something so profound </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it produced a cataclysmic rift in </v>

794
00:45:27.591 --> 00:45:30.020
<v Speaker 3>the structure of being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

795
00:45:30.021 --> 00:45:30.854
<v Speaker 3>and now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not you believe that depends </v>

796
00:45:32.421 --> 00:45:36.470
<v Speaker 3>on what you think of as being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea,</v>

797
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:37.543
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about the relationship that </v>

798
00:45:38.571 --> 00:45:40.250
<v Speaker 3>human beings have with being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

799
00:45:40.251 --> 00:45:42.500
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't really see ourselves as part of</v>

800
00:45:42.501 --> 00:45:43.334
<v Speaker 3>the natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We see ourselves as somehow separate </v>

801
00:45:45.801 --> 00:45:48.470
<v Speaker 3>from the natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We also see ourselves.</v>

802
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:49.303
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny because most modern people</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that the doctrine of original </v>

803
00:45:51.951 --> 00:45:55.490
<v Speaker 3>sin is an absurd doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think I've ever met a modern</v>

804
00:45:55.491 --> 00:45:59.720
<v Speaker 3>person who isn't fully convinced of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrine of original sin.</v>

805
00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.153
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you have to do is talk to an </v>

806
00:46:01.821 --> 00:46:02.654
<v Speaker 3>environmentalist for 15 seconds and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first thing they'll tell you is that </v>

807
00:46:05.091 --> 00:46:05.924
<v Speaker 3>there's something intrinsically corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 3>about human beings and that we're </v>

808
00:46:08.181 --> 00:46:10.550
<v Speaker 3>running around destroying the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

809
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:11.623
<v Speaker 3>how you can fail to see that as a modern</v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation of the idea of original </v>

810
00:46:15.411 --> 00:46:16.244
<v Speaker 3>sin is beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that there's something wrong </v>

811
00:46:18.981 --> 00:46:23.480
<v Speaker 3>with people is the idea of original sin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

812
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.370
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and do people not believe that?</v>

813
00:46:25.371 --> 00:46:26.204
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who in this room feels that they're </v>

814
00:46:27.891 --> 00:46:28.724
<v Speaker 3>everything they could be or who in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>room feels that they're not in some </v>

815
00:46:31.791 --> 00:46:34.460
<v Speaker 3>sense of fallen being?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

816
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:35.583
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never met anyone who doesn't fit </v>

817
00:46:37.011 --> 00:46:37.880
<v Speaker 3>into that category.</v>

818
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.350
<v Speaker 3>The closest you ever get is somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's like psychopathic beyond belief.</v>

819
00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:44.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean,</v>

820
00:46:44.241 --> 00:46:48.230
<v Speaker 3>people are burdened by their </v>
<v Speaker 3>inadequacies to different degrees,</v>

821
00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:49.333
<v Speaker 3>but virtually no one is virtually no one</v>
<v Speaker 3>is secure enough to stand forth as the </v>

822
00:46:55.761 --> 00:46:58.220
<v Speaker 3>flawed beating they are and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

823
00:46:58.221 --> 00:47:00.500
<v Speaker 3>everything's the way it should be with </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

824
00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:04.490
<v Speaker 3>So how the hell do you account for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I think,</v>

825
00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't exactly know what the situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

826
00:47:06.921 --> 00:47:09.350
<v Speaker 3>but it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so one of the things that happens,</v>

827
00:47:09.351 --> 00:47:12.360
<v Speaker 3>I'll get back to the tree in the minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that okay?</v>

828
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:20.583
<v Speaker 3>The serpent tap tamps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he first of all to eat the tree of the </v>

829
00:47:24.161 --> 00:47:27.460
<v Speaker 3>fruit of the knowledge of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is quite interesting.</v>

830
00:47:27.461 --> 00:47:29.800
<v Speaker 3>So it's the knowledge of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's two trees,</v>

831
00:47:29.801 --> 00:47:31.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the tree of life and there's the</v>

832
00:47:31.271 --> 00:47:34.510
<v Speaker 3>tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not good and bad.</v>

833
00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:35.344
<v Speaker 3>It's good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the serpent that tempts eve to </v>

834
00:47:38.141 --> 00:47:40.120
<v Speaker 3>take the fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

835
00:47:40.121 --> 00:47:40.954
<v Speaker 3>So we've already talked about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential role of the serpent and the </v>

836
00:47:42.911 --> 00:47:43.744
<v Speaker 3>development of visual apprehension and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that human beings cognitive </v>

837
00:47:46.721 --> 00:47:47.554
<v Speaker 3>structure is primarily visual and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have the best visual system of any </v>

838
00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:54.370
<v Speaker 3>primate on the planet and a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>visual system that anything but birds.</v>

839
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:57.220
<v Speaker 3>And that that's tightly tied with our </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to see.</v>

840
00:47:57.221 --> 00:47:58.054
<v Speaker 3>And that fact that we can see and pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention appears to be tightly tied </v>

841
00:48:00.701 --> 00:48:03.250
<v Speaker 3>with our ability to detect their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability.</v>

842
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:04.303
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

843
00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty coherent story.</v>

844
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Now what happens after Adam and eve eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>fruit?</v>

845
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.921
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

846
00:48:16.921 --> 00:48:18.160
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

847
00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:20.710
<v Speaker 3>very complicated and happens in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very,</v>

848
00:48:20.711 --> 00:48:21.544
<v Speaker 3>it's very interesting the way the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>portrays it because it's all packed </v>

849
00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:26.800
<v Speaker 3>together in almost no words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens?</v>

850
00:48:26.801 --> 00:48:29.830
<v Speaker 3>The serpent first tells eve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you eat this fruit,</v>

851
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.440
<v Speaker 3>you won't die because that's what God </v>
<v Speaker 3>has said.</v>

852
00:48:32.441 --> 00:48:33.274
<v Speaker 3>Don't eat that thing or you'll die for </v>
<v Speaker 3>God knows that in the day that you eat </v>

853
00:48:36.341 --> 00:48:37.174
<v Speaker 3>thereof,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then your eyes shall be opened and ye </v>

854
00:48:38.111 --> 00:48:38.944
<v Speaker 3>shall be as gods knowing good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's very interesting because the </v>

855
00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:44.254
<v Speaker 3>first thing that happens is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>an intimation that whatever </v>

856
00:48:46.781 --> 00:48:49.870
<v Speaker 3>transformative process occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as a consequence of this,</v>

857
00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:50.973
<v Speaker 3>of this meal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll elevate human beings further to </v>

858
00:48:54.101 --> 00:48:54.934
<v Speaker 3>the godlike status.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's now it's strange because they've </v>

859
00:48:56.531 --> 00:48:58.810
<v Speaker 3>already been attributed that to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree in the story,</v>

860
00:48:58.811 --> 00:48:59.644
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they're made in the image of </v>

861
00:49:00.611 --> 00:49:01.444
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

862
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:02.673
<v Speaker 3>But there's an intimation here that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of what happens as the </v>

863
00:49:06.071 --> 00:49:06.904
<v Speaker 3>transformation is that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>prior to eating the fruit did not see </v>

864
00:49:10.271 --> 00:49:13.420
<v Speaker 3>properly and they weren't aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that they were naked.</v>

865
00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.313
<v Speaker 3>Now that you can derive that conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 3>by noticing that that's what happens to </v>

866
00:49:17.081 --> 00:49:20.050
<v Speaker 3>them when they do eat the fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

867
00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:21.603
<v Speaker 3>and then so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's this intimation that human </v>

868
00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:24.394
<v Speaker 3>beings are at a certain plane of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that plane of being could be </v>

869
00:49:27.011 --> 00:49:27.844
<v Speaker 3>elevated in terms of power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one of the consequences of that </v>

870
00:49:30.821 --> 00:49:34.300
<v Speaker 3>elevation would be all of a sudden that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people became mortal beings.</v>

871
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:38.440
<v Speaker 3>And so what that also means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious paradise,</v>

872
00:49:38.441 --> 00:49:42.400
<v Speaker 3>primary Pri prior to the emergence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>self consciousness is,</v>

873
00:49:42.401 --> 00:49:43.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

874
00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:44.820
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

875
00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:45.723
<v Speaker 3>it's an amoral existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the way that that's being dealt </v>

876
00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:51.010
<v Speaker 3>with historically is to assume that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions in the garden of Eden,</v>

877
00:49:51.011 --> 00:49:51.844
<v Speaker 3>we're sort of like the conditions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal unconsciousness because animals </v>

878
00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:55.324
<v Speaker 3>aren't beyond good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just not in the domain of good </v>

879
00:49:57.971 --> 00:49:59.620
<v Speaker 3>and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you might ask,</v>

880
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:00.550
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is that?</v>

881
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.540
<v Speaker 3>What is there something particular about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the knowledge of good and evil?</v>

882
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:05.861
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

883
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:09.140
<v Speaker 3>modern people don't really believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of evil or in the idea of good,</v>

884
00:50:09.141 --> 00:50:10.840
<v Speaker 3>so they don't really ask questions like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

885
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:13.990
<v Speaker 3>But I think the story sheds clear light </v>
<v Speaker 3>on exactly what this means.</v>

886
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.360
<v Speaker 3>If you have a question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

887
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

888
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:18.160
<v Speaker 3>So yes.</v>

889
00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:26.723
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bit more about like what do you think </v>

890
00:50:28.701 --> 00:50:33.160
<v Speaker 4>that means that they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there had to be that extra level of</v>

891
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.180
<v Speaker 4>like thoughts even though they already </v>
<v Speaker 4>had the,</v>

892
00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.113
<v Speaker 4>they were made in the image.</v>

893
00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.133
<v Speaker 3>Well I think it has to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between consciousness and </v>

894
00:50:40.991 --> 00:50:41.824
<v Speaker 3>self consciousness because I think what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens initially is that creatures are </v>

895
00:50:45.551 --> 00:50:48.370
<v Speaker 3>conscious but they're not self </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious.</v>

896
00:50:48.371 --> 00:50:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Now you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what is self conscious mean?</v>

897
00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:52.120
<v Speaker 3>Well it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

898
00:50:52.121 --> 00:50:52.954
<v Speaker 3>Because there is some evidence from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal experimental literature that </v>

899
00:50:55.751 --> 00:50:57.850
<v Speaker 3>animals have rudimentary self </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

900
00:50:57.851 --> 00:50:58.684
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think self consciousness is a </v>

901
00:51:00.611 --> 00:51:01.444
<v Speaker 3>multifactorial construct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like something that's </v>

902
00:51:03.581 --> 00:51:04.414
<v Speaker 3>reflective and automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're self conscious in that you know </v>

903
00:51:06.911 --> 00:51:07.744
<v Speaker 3>that you exist and that you have some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of your boundaries and that you </v>

904
00:51:11.231 --> 00:51:12.064
<v Speaker 3>have some sense of who and what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're not fully self conscious </v>

905
00:51:15.221 --> 00:51:16.054
<v Speaker 3>because you don't know exactly who or </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you are and you don't know what </v>

906
00:51:18.521 --> 00:51:19.354
<v Speaker 3>your possibilities are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Limitations are and you don't know what </v>

907
00:51:20.921 --> 00:51:23.050
<v Speaker 3>your essential nature is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

908
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.033
<v Speaker 3>and part of the reason that you're self </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious is because you're the </v>

909
00:51:26.141 --> 00:51:28.080
<v Speaker 3>inheritor of a cultural tradition.</v>

910
00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:28.923
<v Speaker 3>It's linguistically predicated that </v>
<v Speaker 3>contains information about what human </v>

911
00:51:31.931 --> 00:51:32.764
<v Speaker 3>beings are like that has been worked on </v>
<v Speaker 3>by collective generations of human </v>

912
00:51:36.161 --> 00:51:38.050
<v Speaker 3>beings over thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

913
00:51:38.051 --> 00:51:38.884
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So partly the reason you're self </v>

914
00:51:39.491 --> 00:51:43.510
<v Speaker 3>conscious is because you're educated and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no real limit to that.</v>

915
00:51:43.511 --> 00:51:46.870
<v Speaker 3>You come to university to become more </v>
<v Speaker 3>self conscious.</v>

916
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:48.063
<v Speaker 3>So it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's an initial self </v>

917
00:51:50.131 --> 00:51:53.200
<v Speaker 3>consciousness that seems to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>precipitating event.</v>

918
00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:54.423
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's reasonable to assume </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's associated with cortical </v>

919
00:51:57.341 --> 00:52:00.160
<v Speaker 3>expansion and the development of </v>
<v Speaker 3>enhanced cognitive ability.</v>

920
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:03.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that that's a questionable</v>

921
00:52:03.611 --> 00:52:04.444
<v Speaker 3>assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody just just makes theK or as if </v>

922
00:52:07.751 --> 00:52:08.584
<v Speaker 3>that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're intelligent enough to have </v>

923
00:52:09.791 --> 00:52:14.050
<v Speaker 3>discovered time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with discovering time,</v>

924
00:52:14.051 --> 00:52:16.090
<v Speaker 3>which is the fourth dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

925
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:21.150
<v Speaker 3>we're minimally extendable in time now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't seem to be bothered by the fact</v>

926
00:52:21.551 --> 00:52:24.550
<v Speaker 3>that we're minimally extendable in </v>
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

927
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:25.623
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I mean here you are and you're </v>

928
00:52:26.771 --> 00:52:27.604
<v Speaker 3>not over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are obviously limitations to </v>

929
00:52:29.501 --> 00:52:30.334
<v Speaker 3>that and we do try to overcome them with</v>
<v Speaker 3>telephones and televisions and all of </v>

930
00:52:33.431 --> 00:52:35.680
<v Speaker 3>our gadgets that put us everywhere at </v>
<v Speaker 3>once.</v>

931
00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:36.933
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to discover our finitude in time is </v>

932
00:52:40.361 --> 00:52:44.560
<v Speaker 3>to discover time and it's not surprising</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's represented in this story as</v>

933
00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:47.830
<v Speaker 3>a cataclysmic disjunction in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of being.</v>

934
00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.190
<v Speaker 3>That's how we experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something's wrong.</v>

935
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:55.450
<v Speaker 3>And I don't believe that that's how </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals experience being like they might</v>

936
00:52:55.451 --> 00:52:56.284
<v Speaker 3>experience things that need to be done </v>
<v Speaker 3>temporarily to put things back into </v>

937
00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:00.453
<v Speaker 3>proper balance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not set up to question the </v>

938
00:53:03.161 --> 00:53:06.640
<v Speaker 3>nature of existence itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

939
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:08.643
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

940
00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:09.683
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible that means the story is </v>

941
00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:33.600
<v Speaker 4>or historical production back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>literary in literature or history of,</v>

942
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I think it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

943
00:53:36.021 --> 00:53:38.220
<v Speaker 3>I think it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a description.</v>

944
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Architectural stories are true on </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple levels at the same time.</v>

945
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:46.350
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's a file or genetic and an</v>
<v Speaker 3>Auntie genetic story simultaneously.</v>

946
00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:47.603
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason it can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is the paradise allow element </v>

947
00:53:51.181 --> 00:53:54.270
<v Speaker 3>of childhood prior to the emergence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>self consciousness.</v>

948
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.760
<v Speaker 3>I can tell when my children learned they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were naked.</v>

949
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Actually it didn't bother my daughter at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

950
00:53:59.101 --> 00:53:59.934
<v Speaker 3>But my son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know who's quite an emotionally </v>

951
00:54:02.041 --> 00:54:06.150
<v Speaker 3>stable person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time he was two and a half likely</v>

952
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:08.970
<v Speaker 3>there is no damn way you were going in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bathroom with him.</v>

953
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:12.150
<v Speaker 3>And if he wasn't closed he would not </v>
<v Speaker 3>show himself.</v>

954
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.373
<v Speaker 3>And as far as I could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was all his own doing because it </v>

955
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:19.080
<v Speaker 3>wasn't like we were hung up about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it didn't bother my daughter.</v>

956
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:19.913
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't the familial environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was producing that he was in an </v>

957
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:26.670
<v Speaker 3>intensely private creature and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>his own discovery.</v>

958
00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:28.043
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean part of the reason I think that </v>

959
00:54:29.221 --> 00:54:32.490
<v Speaker 3>people are self conscious is that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up right?</v>

960
00:54:32.491 --> 00:54:33.324
<v Speaker 3>And that we're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very exposed to the world in a way that </v>

961
00:54:35.551 --> 00:54:38.520
<v Speaker 3>most animals aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I also think there's more to it than</v>

962
00:54:38.521 --> 00:54:40.530
<v Speaker 3>that too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that because we were self conscious,</v>

963
00:54:40.531 --> 00:54:45.330
<v Speaker 3>we're also intensely aware of our own </v>
<v Speaker 3>inadequacies and imperfections and we're</v>

964
00:54:45.331 --> 00:54:49.440
<v Speaker 3>not willing to share them with the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>except under very limited conditions.</v>

965
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.930
<v Speaker 3>And I would also say it's no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

966
00:54:51.931 --> 00:54:52.764
<v Speaker 3>cause people run around talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how it would be better if we weren't </v>

967
00:54:54.961 --> 00:54:55.794
<v Speaker 3>ashamed of our bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's not exactly clear to me </v>

968
00:54:57.871 --> 00:55:00.060
<v Speaker 3>that it would be better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a pain in the neck,</v>

969
00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:03.330
<v Speaker 3>but it makes you take care of them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to fix them.</v>

970
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.313
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had no sense that there was </v>

971
00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:07.260
<v Speaker 3>something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why the hell would you try to fix it?</v>

972
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.350
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think you can have your cake </v>
<v Speaker 3>and eat it too.</v>

973
00:55:10.351 --> 00:55:11.161
<v Speaker 3>You can't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

974
00:55:11.161 --> 00:55:11.994
<v Speaker 3>I'm perfect just the way I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also be motivated to make </v>

975
00:55:15.151 --> 00:55:17.490
<v Speaker 3>things better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not possible.</v>

976
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Now you might be able to say the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm away,</v>

977
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:25.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm the way I am is acceptable given my </v>
<v Speaker 3>plans to make things better,</v>

978
00:55:25.531 --> 00:55:26.364
<v Speaker 3>which I think is perfectly reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be so ashamed that </v>

979
00:55:28.831 --> 00:55:31.490
<v Speaker 3>you're immobilized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems counterproductive.</v>

980
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:35.580
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that people have nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be ashamed of strikes me as naive beyond</v>

981
00:55:35.581 --> 00:55:37.440
<v Speaker 3>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

982
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.753
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think it's onto genetic and Fila </v>

983
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:44.460
<v Speaker 3>genetic simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when the woman saw that the tree was</v>

984
00:55:44.461 --> 00:55:45.294
<v Speaker 3>good for food and then it was pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the eyes and a tree to be desired to </v>

985
00:55:47.851 --> 00:55:48.684
<v Speaker 3>make one wise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she took of the fruit thereof and did </v>

986
00:55:50.191 --> 00:55:52.650
<v Speaker 3>eat and gave also unto her husband with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

987
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:53.663
<v Speaker 3>And he did eat and the eyes of both of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them were open and they knew they were </v>

988
00:55:58.921 --> 00:56:03.420
<v Speaker 3>naked and they sewed fig leaves together</v>
<v Speaker 3>and made themselves aprons.</v>

989
00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:06.990
<v Speaker 3>And there's an awful lot of information </v>
<v Speaker 3>packed into those few lines.</v>

990
00:56:06.991 --> 00:56:09.450
<v Speaker 3>So the first is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's the woman,</v>

991
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.130
<v Speaker 3>the woman precipitates this.</v>

992
00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:15.670
<v Speaker 3>And I believe that that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that,</v>

993
00:56:15.671 --> 00:56:18.490
<v Speaker 3>I think that women still make men self </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious.</v>

994
00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:21.460
<v Speaker 3>And I think they do that because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their vulnerability,</v>

995
00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:22.623
<v Speaker 3>because of their vulnerability infants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also because they're incredibly </v>

996
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:28.240
<v Speaker 3>harsh judges of men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know,</v>

997
00:56:28.241 --> 00:56:29.410
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>

998
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.513
<v Speaker 3>from the dating site studies that women </v>
<v Speaker 3>regard 85% of men is below average in </v>

999
00:56:34.071 --> 00:56:36.550
<v Speaker 3>physical appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1000
00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.850
<v Speaker 3>and we also know that the default </v>
<v Speaker 3>response to a woman in,</v>

1001
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1002
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:43.510
<v Speaker 3>in response to a mating request is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding?</v>

1003
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.393
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's nothing that makes more men </v>

1004
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:49.720
<v Speaker 3>more self conscious than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>

1005
00:56:49.721 --> 00:56:50.554
<v Speaker 3>well what's the consequence of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one is eternal enmity between the </v>

1006
00:56:54.011 --> 00:56:55.930
<v Speaker 3>sexes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So women,</v>

1007
00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.480
<v Speaker 3>men hate women because they get rejected</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

1008
00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:03.481
<v Speaker 3>And that manifests itself in all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of underground war against women.</v>

1009
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:05.103
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in some cultures the is virtually </v>

1010
00:57:06.371 --> 00:57:07.204
<v Speaker 3>total and but it also manifests it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>men's attempts to continually make </v>

1011
00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:14.560
<v Speaker 3>themselves better so that they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>attract women.</v>

1012
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.030
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1013
00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:18.580
<v Speaker 3>there's no doubt that women with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>selective mating,</v>

1014
00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:19.414
<v Speaker 3>which is partly what makes them </v>
<v Speaker 3>different than chimpanzees have been a </v>

1015
00:57:21.581 --> 00:57:25.750
<v Speaker 3>major motivating force for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>development of culture status.</v>

1016
00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:26.584
<v Speaker 3>Turns out to be important to men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think you can make a very strong </v>

1017
00:57:29.171 --> 00:57:30.004
<v Speaker 3>case that culture itself has been the </v>
<v Speaker 3>product of status competition in large </v>

1018
00:57:34.691 --> 00:57:39.691
<v Speaker 3>part be the consequence of status </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition between men driven by women.</v>

1019
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.870
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>

1020
00:57:44.871 --> 00:57:47.110
<v Speaker 3>so they both eat the fruit and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're naked.</v>

1021
00:57:47.111 --> 00:57:47.944
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an interesting thing because as </v>

1022
00:57:49.241 --> 00:57:51.280
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fruit is the fruit of the tree.</v>

1023
00:57:51.281 --> 00:57:52.390
<v Speaker 3>And the tree is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1024
00:57:52.391 --> 00:57:54.960
<v Speaker 3>very complicated thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1025
00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.100
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1026
00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:56.933
<v Speaker 3>the tree represents something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifesting itself on multiple levels </v>

1027
00:57:59.621 --> 00:58:01.390
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as there,</v>

1028
00:58:01.391 --> 00:58:06.391
<v Speaker 3>there's the actual trees in which the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual fruits grew and the actual fruits</v>

1029
00:58:07.781 --> 00:58:08.380
<v Speaker 3>that ripened.</v>

1030
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.750
<v Speaker 3>And that sharpened our vision that gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>us color vision,</v>

1031
00:58:10.751 --> 00:58:13.480
<v Speaker 3>and that constituted a large part of our</v>
<v Speaker 3>diet.</v>

1032
00:58:13.481 --> 00:58:17.950
<v Speaker 3>And that we did forge for and share.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's,</v>

1033
00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:19.143
<v Speaker 3>there's the metaphysical tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the tree that produced that </v>

1034
00:58:21.791 --> 00:58:22.624
<v Speaker 3>fruit that produced that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that neurological transformation that </v>

1035
00:58:25.031 --> 00:58:27.760
<v Speaker 3>went along with that over the course of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution.</v>

1036
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:30.550
<v Speaker 3>And then there's another tree that lurks</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there,</v>

1037
00:58:30.551 --> 00:58:35.530
<v Speaker 3>which is the tree that constitutes the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human being itself,</v>

1038
00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:38.500
<v Speaker 3>because we're also frequently symbolized</v>
<v Speaker 3>as trees.</v>

1039
00:58:38.501 --> 00:58:40.570
<v Speaker 3>And I think we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1040
00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:41.513
<v Speaker 3>it's the microcosm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>macrocosm tree that's reflected in the </v>

1041
00:58:44.531 --> 00:58:46.830
<v Speaker 3>Scandinavian figure of the world tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1042
00:58:46.831 --> 00:58:47.664
<v Speaker 3>so that's a drizzle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know that some of you have no </v>

1043
00:58:49.991 --> 00:58:54.370
<v Speaker 3>doubt watched the avengers and you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that both Loki and thor come from,</v>

1044
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:58.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as guard and as guard is actually in the</v>

1045
00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:01.180
<v Speaker 3>branches of the Scandinavian world tree.</v>

1046
00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the Scandinavian world tree?</v>

1047
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:05.583
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's even represented this way in the </v>

1048
00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:11.290
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Scandinavian world tree isn't a tree</v>

1049
00:59:11.291 --> 00:59:13.690
<v Speaker 3>like a tree in the forest to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Scandinavian world.</v>

1050
00:59:13.691 --> 00:59:18.691
<v Speaker 3>Tree is the microcosm to macrocosm tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like the subatomic realm and the</v>

1051
00:59:20.231 --> 00:59:23.120
<v Speaker 3>atomic realm and molecular realm and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>realm above that.</v>

1052
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:23.954
<v Speaker 3>And then the phenomenal logical realm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the cosmic realm emerging as a </v>

1053
00:59:27.621 --> 00:59:28.454
<v Speaker 3>set of stacked phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the gods inhabit the upper reaches </v>

1054
00:59:32.031 --> 00:59:32.864
<v Speaker 3>of that tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the same tree that the world </v>

1055
00:59:34.791 --> 00:59:35.624
<v Speaker 3>tree that's Sharman climb up and down </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they have their shamonic </v>

1056
00:59:38.051 --> 00:59:38.884
<v Speaker 3>transformation experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are usually initiated as a </v>

1057
00:59:41.571 --> 00:59:44.570
<v Speaker 3>consequence of their interactions with </v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucinogenic drugs,</v>

1058
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:49.870
<v Speaker 3>often mushrooms and the Sharman report </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they die and decompose to skeletons</v>

1059
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:52.700
<v Speaker 3>and then climb the world tree and enter </v>
<v Speaker 3>heaven.</v>

1060
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.520
<v Speaker 3>And people like Eliana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were the,</v>

1061
00:59:55.521 --> 00:59:58.490
<v Speaker 3>some of the initial observers of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shamonic phenomenon,</v>

1062
00:59:58.491 --> 01:00:01.580
<v Speaker 3>believed that the use of drugs was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>decadent,</v>

1063
01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:05.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after consequence of a pure,</v>

1064
01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:06.080
<v Speaker 3>original tradition.</v>

1065
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:06.913
<v Speaker 3>But the modern evidence suggests very </v>
<v Speaker 3>strongly that it's the use of the </v>

1066
01:00:10.251 --> 01:00:11.084
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic mushrooms in particular that</v>
<v Speaker 3>produced the death rebirth experience </v>

1067
01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:18.470
<v Speaker 3>and the climbing up and down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>microcosm to macrocosm tree.</v>

1068
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:21.050
<v Speaker 3>There's been some very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>recent downturn,</v>

1069
01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:25.610
<v Speaker 3>logical research done on Sharman who use</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca in the Amazon jungle.</v>

1070
01:00:25.611 --> 01:00:26.444
<v Speaker 3>And the tree they seem to climb up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>down is all the way down to the </v>

1071
01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:32.480
<v Speaker 3>molecular and all the way up to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmic.</v>

1072
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.870
<v Speaker 3>And there are people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who believe,</v>

1073
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:39.560
<v Speaker 3>who've given credence to the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shaman can go down far enough to see</v>

1074
01:00:39.561 --> 01:00:41.960
<v Speaker 3>DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1075
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:43.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know.</v>

1076
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:45.620
<v Speaker 3>We have no idea what to make of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of reports.</v>

1077
01:00:45.621 --> 01:00:46.620
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1078
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.833
<v Speaker 3>I would be very hesitant about </v>
<v Speaker 3>dismissing them because the world's a </v>

1079
01:00:50.421 --> 01:00:53.990
<v Speaker 3>very weird place and there's nothing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world that stranger than psychedelic</v>

1080
01:00:53.991 --> 01:00:54.824
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

1081
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:55.843
<v Speaker 3>And people have been using those for </v>
<v Speaker 3>tens of thousands of years and a </v>

1082
01:00:58.521 --> 01:00:59.354
<v Speaker 3>tremendous number of our religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditions are a consequence of use of </v>

1083
01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.673
<v Speaker 3>hallucinogenic naturally occurring </v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucinogenic chemicals and they seem </v>

1084
01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:07.664
<v Speaker 3>to produce profound transformations of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and profound enough so </v>

1085
01:01:10.401 --> 01:01:12.410
<v Speaker 3>that we have no idea what to make of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1086
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.130
<v Speaker 3>So that the tree is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very complicated thing.</v>

1087
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.200
<v Speaker 3>And it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1088
01:01:18.201 --> 01:01:21.540
<v Speaker 3>inside a cathedral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the pillars and the columns,</v>

1089
01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:24.680
<v Speaker 3>those are tree like structures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the gothic cathedrals.</v>

1090
01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:29.681
<v Speaker 3>They look almost exactly like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the canopy of of old growth forests</v>

1091
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:30.824
<v Speaker 3>and the trees that are in there are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trees that we lived in tens of millions </v>

1092
01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.070
<v Speaker 3>of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're also the tree that's growing</v>

1093
01:01:37.071 --> 01:01:37.904
<v Speaker 3>up from the tiniest micro realm up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the macro realm and attempting to </v>

1094
01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:42.614
<v Speaker 3>manifest itself in perfectly harmonious </v>
<v Speaker 3>layers at every single level of </v>

1095
01:01:47.451 --> 01:01:48.680
<v Speaker 3>structure all the way up.</v>

1096
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:50.203
<v Speaker 3>And I think that part of what people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing when they practice things like </v>

1097
01:01:52.431 --> 01:01:54.320
<v Speaker 3>yoga and they're trying to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shockers,</v>

1098
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:55.520
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aligned,</v>

1099
01:01:55.521 --> 01:01:56.354
<v Speaker 3>is that the shock was our like cross </v>
<v Speaker 3>sections of that tree at different </v>

1100
01:02:00.051 --> 01:02:03.650
<v Speaker 3>levels of emergence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the person who is practicing yoga is</v>

1101
01:02:03.651 --> 01:02:04.484
<v Speaker 3>trying to get their body aligned so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the communication from the microcosmic </v>

1102
01:02:09.471 --> 01:02:10.304
<v Speaker 3>level to the macro cosmic level is </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely facilitated and free of </v>

1103
01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:14.750
<v Speaker 3>blockages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So on.</v>

1104
01:02:14.751 --> 01:02:16.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do yoga,</v>

1105
01:02:16.821 --> 01:02:20.550
<v Speaker 3>when they really know how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't do it does them.</v>

1106
01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:25.320
<v Speaker 3>So yoga happens to people spontaneously </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they wake up and the,</v>

1107
01:02:25.321 --> 01:02:26.154
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Yogis talk about that as the </v>

1108
01:02:27.181 --> 01:02:28.014
<v Speaker 3>influence of the Kundalini serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the thing that lives at the </v>

1109
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:30.954
<v Speaker 3>base of the spine and when the Yogi is </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently sophisticated in his </v>

1110
01:02:35.341 --> 01:02:36.174
<v Speaker 3>practice there the body moves by itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>and straightens itself out and aligns </v>

1111
01:02:40.201 --> 01:02:44.640
<v Speaker 3>itself along the central axis of being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it's aligned properly,</v>

1112
01:02:44.641 --> 01:02:46.680
<v Speaker 3>that's when divine revelations will </v>
<v Speaker 3>occur.</v>

1113
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:50.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's what you see manifested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious symbolism.</v>

1114
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:51.174
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the figure of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Buddha who sitting in this triangular </v>

1115
01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:57.090
<v Speaker 3>position and he's completely covered in </v>
<v Speaker 3>gold,</v>

1116
01:02:57.091 --> 01:02:57.924
<v Speaker 3>is that he's aligned his body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the levels of the material being so </v>

1117
01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:04.950
<v Speaker 3>perfectly that the information flow </v>
<v Speaker 3>across the levels of,</v>

1118
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.173
<v Speaker 3>of structure are without flaw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that puts them simultaneously in </v>

1119
01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:14.520
<v Speaker 3>contact with the microcosmic realm and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the macro cosmic realm.</v>

1120
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:16.103
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1121
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:19.150
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1122
01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:20.890
<v Speaker 3>so the tree is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1123
01:03:20.891 --> 01:03:21.724
<v Speaker 3>very complicated idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the tree that you are and </v>

1124
01:03:23.651 --> 01:03:25.840
<v Speaker 3>there's the tree that the cosmos itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1125
01:03:25.841 --> 01:03:29.500
<v Speaker 3>And the third is the tree that we lived </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and there's the tree that bears fruit</v>

1126
01:03:29.501 --> 01:03:34.420
<v Speaker 3>and those are all the same tree from a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a broader perspective.</v>

1127
01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:42.810
<v Speaker 5>So your eyes are opened and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>realized they were naked.</v>

1128
01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:47.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm just wondering how this sort of ties</v>
<v Speaker 5>in with the time,</v>

1129
01:03:47.671 --> 01:03:50.780
<v Speaker 5>the realization of client,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they immortal before that.</v>

1130
01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:51.731
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

1131
01:03:51.731 --> 01:03:52.770
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had no set,</v>

1132
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.050
<v Speaker 3>no concept of death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1133
01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.670
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very good question.</v>

1134
01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:57.504
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the absence of death prior to </v>

1135
01:03:59.251 --> 01:04:02.190
<v Speaker 3>the emergence of self consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1136
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.810
<v Speaker 3>figuring out what death is is a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>tricky thing.</v>

1137
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:07.703
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one element of death is that you cease </v>

1138
01:04:09.361 --> 01:04:14.310
<v Speaker 3>to be as a physical form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well death for humans is a lot more than</v>

1139
01:04:14.311 --> 01:04:16.530
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not only that you cease to exist as</v>

1140
01:04:16.531 --> 01:04:19.140
<v Speaker 3>a material for is your bloody well know </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1141
01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:20.843
<v Speaker 3>And that's where death where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where dance has it's primary </v>

1142
01:04:22.891 --> 01:04:24.480
<v Speaker 3>sting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1143
01:04:24.481 --> 01:04:26.850
<v Speaker 3>if there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there was no apprehension of death,</v>

1144
01:04:26.851 --> 01:04:30.210
<v Speaker 3>it would be a lot less dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience than it actually is.</v>

1145
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.073
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's complicated because if you look at </v>

1146
01:04:32.491 --> 01:04:34.640
<v Speaker 3>elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elephants are,</v>

1147
01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:37.620
<v Speaker 3>are pretty self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They seem to be,</v>

1148
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.860
<v Speaker 3>they seem to understand to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 3>what death means.</v>

1149
01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.113
<v Speaker 3>They will return to the place where an </v>
<v Speaker 3>elephant that they knew well died and </v>

1150
01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:46.464
<v Speaker 3>they will move the bones around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they seem to be able to remember </v>

1151
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:53.100
<v Speaker 3>the cessation of being over a very long </v>
<v Speaker 3>period of time.</v>

1152
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:56.580
<v Speaker 3>But they certainly can't conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 3>it the way we do because they don't have</v>

1153
01:04:56.581 --> 01:04:59.940
<v Speaker 3>any tools of conceptualization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not linguistic.</v>

1154
01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.800
<v Speaker 3>So I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1155
01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:03.900
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1156
01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:04.973
<v Speaker 3>the self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unselfconscious pre death paradise </v>

1157
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:11.640
<v Speaker 3>is prior to self consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the same state that,</v>

1158
01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:12.863
<v Speaker 3>that a child exists in before there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before they are aware that they're </v>

1159
01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:16.591
<v Speaker 3>naked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1160
01:05:16.591 --> 01:05:19.990
<v Speaker 3>And that develops in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Russia's in some sense,</v>

1161
01:05:19.991 --> 01:05:21.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1162
01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:22.993
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the eyes of both of them were opened </v>

1163
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:25.504
<v Speaker 3>and they knew they were naked and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>sewed fig leaves together and made </v>

1164
01:05:28.001 --> 01:05:28.930
<v Speaker 3>themselves aprons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1165
01:05:28.931 --> 01:05:32.110
<v Speaker 3>that's a massive transformation in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>statement.</v>

1166
01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:34.270
<v Speaker 3>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people figure out that they're naked.</v>

1167
01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:35.141
<v Speaker 3>Now you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1168
01:05:35.141 --> 01:05:37.540
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean to figure out that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're naked?</v>

1169
01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generally that's red in a sexual sense.</v>

1170
01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:44.470
<v Speaker 3>And I think the sexual sense can't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

1171
01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:46.083
<v Speaker 3>Like it can't be ignored because I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the way that people are </v>

1172
01:05:48.791 --> 01:05:52.300
<v Speaker 3>primarily self conscious is sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1173
01:05:52.301 --> 01:05:57.301
<v Speaker 3>Because the most fundamental element of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being evaluated by another is evaluation</v>

1174
01:05:59.531 --> 01:06:01.930
<v Speaker 3>for sexual attractiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1175
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.033
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men bear the burden of that because </v>

1176
01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:05.374
<v Speaker 3>they're constantly compared to other men</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of their accomplishments and </v>

1177
01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:10.060
<v Speaker 3>their position in the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>

1178
01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:14.710
<v Speaker 3>And women bear the brunt of that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're constantly being compared to the</v>

1179
01:06:14.711 --> 01:06:15.544
<v Speaker 3>ideal feminine form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the ideal feminine form is </v>

1180
01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:20.890
<v Speaker 3>associated both with sexuality and with </v>
<v Speaker 3>reproduction.</v>

1181
01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:22.323
<v Speaker 3>And so there's no doubt that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact of a sexual ideal makes </v>

1182
01:06:27.191 --> 01:06:29.260
<v Speaker 3>everyone intensely self conscious.</v>

1183
01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:30.750
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1184
01:06:30.751 --> 01:06:31.584
<v Speaker 3>if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are all sorts of attempts </v>

1185
01:06:34.001 --> 01:06:36.490
<v Speaker 3>constantly to write that off to cultural</v>
<v Speaker 3>factors.</v>

1186
01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:38.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say that the reason that women are so</v>

1187
01:06:38.321 --> 01:06:39.154
<v Speaker 3>intensely concerned with their body </v>
<v Speaker 3>images because we've constructed false </v>

1188
01:06:42.071 --> 01:06:42.904
<v Speaker 3>cultural representations of beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I don't think there's any </v>

1189
01:06:45.191 --> 01:06:46.024
<v Speaker 3>evidence for that claim at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's plenty of evidence for </v>

1190
01:06:49.091 --> 01:06:49.924
<v Speaker 3>what is regarded as optimally healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and attractive with regards to women </v>

1191
01:06:54.221 --> 01:06:56.650
<v Speaker 3>cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Culturally there are variations in it.</v>

1192
01:06:56.651 --> 01:06:59.200
<v Speaker 3>So body size for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is one of the variations.</v>

1193
01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:04.210
<v Speaker 3>But body shape is very seldomly varied </v>
<v Speaker 3>and symmetry is virtually never varied.</v>

1194
01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.320
<v Speaker 3>And skin quality is never varied and </v>
<v Speaker 3>youth is never varied.</v>

1195
01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.790
<v Speaker 3>So there's plenty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1196
01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:10.624
<v Speaker 3>and the reason those things appear to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>never varied is because they're good </v>

1197
01:07:12.851 --> 01:07:16.480
<v Speaker 3>markers of fertility and health and </v>
<v Speaker 3>across culture.</v>

1198
01:07:16.481 --> 01:07:17.314
<v Speaker 3>Men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women like man who are higher up in the </v>

1199
01:07:18.551 --> 01:07:19.510
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy.</v>

1200
01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:20.643
<v Speaker 3>And I think what women have done is </v>
<v Speaker 3>outsourced the problem of sexual </v>

1201
01:07:22.931 --> 01:07:23.764
<v Speaker 3>selection to competition among men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all they do is let men compete and </v>

1202
01:07:27.641 --> 01:07:30.670
<v Speaker 3>then peel off the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a perfectly reasonable,</v>

1203
01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:33.250
<v Speaker 3>it's an absolutely reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>solving the problem.</v>

1204
01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.233
<v Speaker 3>But what that does is make all the men </v>
<v Speaker 3>who were in the lower stratas of the </v>

1205
01:07:36.911 --> 01:07:40.170
<v Speaker 3>socioeconomic hierarchy intensely </v>
<v Speaker 3>self-conscious,</v>

1206
01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.073
<v Speaker 3>angry and resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they become like homicidal and </v>

1207
01:07:45.491 --> 01:07:48.190
<v Speaker 3>genocidal if things are pushed too far.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1208
01:07:48.191 --> 01:07:49.024
<v Speaker 3>Martin Daly and Margo Wilson have done a</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly reasonable job of laying out </v>

1209
01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:57.100
<v Speaker 3>the consequence of very unequal </v>
<v Speaker 3>societies on male aggression.</v>

1210
01:07:57.101 --> 01:07:57.934
<v Speaker 3>And what happens is that as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>probability that young men will be able </v>

1211
01:08:01.091 --> 01:08:01.924
<v Speaker 3>to climb up a dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>decreases the young men at the bottom </v>

1212
01:08:04.961 --> 01:08:07.420
<v Speaker 3>become increasingly murderous and </v>
<v Speaker 3>impulsive.</v>

1213
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:09.340
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not surprising.</v>

1214
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:10.503
<v Speaker 3>Not only did they delineate that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they showed that the men who become </v>

1215
01:08:13.241 --> 01:08:15.890
<v Speaker 3>successfully impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive,</v>

1216
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.873
<v Speaker 3>and they did this most in their studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Chicago gang behavior actually push </v>

1217
01:08:20.131 --> 01:08:23.030
<v Speaker 3>themselves up the hierarchy fast enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>and far enough.</v>

1218
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:25.190
<v Speaker 3>So they immediately become attractive to</v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

1219
01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:29.330
<v Speaker 3>So the fact that they become impulsively</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive and even murderous,</v>

1220
01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.710
<v Speaker 3>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1221
01:08:31.711 --> 01:08:32.544
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not some side effect of some </v>

1222
01:08:33.921 --> 01:08:34.754
<v Speaker 3>process that's gone wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what you do when the competition </v>

1223
01:08:37.911 --> 01:08:41.090
<v Speaker 3>pressures become so high that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>climb the hierarchy.</v>

1224
01:08:41.091 --> 01:08:42.860
<v Speaker 3>As a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have diligent,</v>

1225
01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:43.893
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>application of prosocial behavior over </v>

1226
01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:49.640
<v Speaker 3>the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Margo daily and,</v>

1227
01:08:49.641 --> 01:08:51.050
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1228
01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Margo Wilson and he said Margo Wilson.</v>

1229
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1230
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:59.890
<v Speaker 3>it's Margo Wilson and daily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's dailies name there at mcmaster?</v>

1231
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:05.510
<v Speaker 3>Look Up David bus buses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best source for this.</v>

1232
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:08.330
<v Speaker 3>He wrote a textbook on evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology.</v>

1233
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1234
01:09:09.681 --> 01:09:10.514
<v Speaker 3>mostly textbooks aren't great books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his textbook on evolutionary </v>

1235
01:09:12.651 --> 01:09:13.484
<v Speaker 3>psychology is great book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at the sexual selection </v>

1236
01:09:15.411 --> 01:09:16.520
<v Speaker 3>chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1237
01:09:16.521 --> 01:09:19.430
<v Speaker 3>they're incredibly illuminating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1238
01:09:19.431 --> 01:09:20.264
<v Speaker 3>the correlation between male </v>
<v Speaker 3>socioeconomic success and access to </v>

1239
01:09:22.881 --> 01:09:25.910
<v Speaker 3>sexual partners is like 0.5.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's high.</v>

1240
01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:29.180
<v Speaker 3>It's the determining factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no joke.</v>

1241
01:09:29.181 --> 01:09:30.890
<v Speaker 3>And between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for women it's zero.</v>

1242
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:33.590
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that,</v>

1243
01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how it is.</v>

1244
01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:36.623
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1245
01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.673
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

1246
01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:42.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Male aggression.</v>

1247
01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.390
<v Speaker 3>They looked at Chicago in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they found for example,</v>

1248
01:09:45.391 --> 01:09:47.970
<v Speaker 3>was in the Chicago gangs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1249
01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:49.493
<v Speaker 3>generally what happened because there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are very high rates of male on male </v>

1250
01:09:51.631 --> 01:09:55.560
<v Speaker 3>homicide in the Chicago gang scene and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's usually interracial,</v>

1251
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:58.920
<v Speaker 3>not cross racial and it's usually young </v>
<v Speaker 3>man against young men.</v>

1252
01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:00.323
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're much more likely to be killed by </v>

1253
01:10:01.741 --> 01:10:02.574
<v Speaker 3>murder if you're a young man then if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're an older woman and although it's </v>

1254
01:10:04.831 --> 01:10:07.140
<v Speaker 3>the older women who are most afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of thing.</v>

1255
01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:09.690
<v Speaker 3>So young man who are always getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed by other young men.</v>

1256
01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.740
<v Speaker 3>And basically what Daly and Wilson </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed was that if you are a gang member</v>

1257
01:10:13.741 --> 01:10:16.860
<v Speaker 3>in Chicago and you were charged with </v>
<v Speaker 3>murder,</v>

1258
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:20.490
<v Speaker 3>usually the murder was a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of status,</v>

1259
01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge.</v>

1260
01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:26.340
<v Speaker 3>So maybe it's gang member ray against </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and your gang member be while you're</v>

1261
01:10:26.341 --> 01:10:28.150
<v Speaker 3>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're both arms.</v>

1262
01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:30.120
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to kill you.</v>

1263
01:10:30.121 --> 01:10:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to kill him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a toss up.</v>

1264
01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:32.850
<v Speaker 3>You kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1265
01:10:32.851 --> 01:10:34.440
<v Speaker 3>Then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1266
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:38.160
<v Speaker 3>no one testifies against you and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>plead,</v>

1267
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:39.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1268
01:10:39.031 --> 01:10:40.770
<v Speaker 3>they nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try to nail you for,</v>

1269
01:10:40.771 --> 01:10:43.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a homicide,</v>

1270
01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.573
<v Speaker 3>say second degree murder and you plead </v>
<v Speaker 3>self defense and they plea bargain it </v>

1271
01:10:47.851 --> 01:10:48.684
<v Speaker 3>down to manslaughter and they throw you </v>
<v Speaker 3>in jail for three years and you're out </v>

1272
01:10:51.241 --> 01:10:55.080
<v Speaker 3>in a year and a half on good behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your status goes way up.</v>

1273
01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.860
<v Speaker 3>So it's a perfectly reasonable,</v>

1274
01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.130
<v Speaker 3>it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a,</v>

1275
01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.830
<v Speaker 3>what would you call equilibrated </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution,</v>

1276
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.610
<v Speaker 3>but the reasons for it are quite clear </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it works.</v>

1277
01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the evolutionary rap by the Canadian?</v>

1278
01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:14.851
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one,</v>

1279
01:11:14.851 --> 01:11:16.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>

1280
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:19.590
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I babba Babba what's his name?</v>

1281
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Babba I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look it up.</v>

1282
01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Evolutionary rap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's brilliant.</v>

1283
01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:26.813
<v Speaker 3>He takes all of the evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology work that's been done over </v>

1284
01:11:28.981 --> 01:11:29.814
<v Speaker 3>the last 15 years and casts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's as a gangster rap song and it's </v>

1285
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:39.470
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily well done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

1286
01:11:45.261 --> 01:11:46.550
<v Speaker 3>Don't you have anything better to do?</v>

1287
01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:53.080
<v Speaker 4>Martha Stewart?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She Ain't,</v>

1288
01:11:53.150 --> 01:11:53.983
<v Speaker 4>she spoke and she's very funny piece by </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying it's just them that basically </v>

1289
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:04.740
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're clearly edit for president.</v>

1290
01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:06.270
<v Speaker 4>So let me give you some.</v>

1291
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:08.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1292
01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:09.750
<v Speaker 4>so she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she cooks,</v>

1293
01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:14.660
<v Speaker 4>she proceeds to give these hilarious but</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably useful tests.</v>

1294
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:18.210
<v Speaker 4>And at the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the crowds standing feet for her.</v>

1295
01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.330
<v Speaker 4>Well this is funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was,</v>

1296
01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:24.470
<v Speaker 4>I was puzzled by the finding of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing ovation.</v>

1297
01:12:24.471 --> 01:12:29.360
<v Speaker 4>But I think when you're talking about is</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically she had credit,</v>

1298
01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:30.463
<v Speaker 4>like she</v>

1299
01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:36.930
<v Speaker 3>female sexual fantasy is beauty and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beast.</v>

1300
01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:41.860
<v Speaker 3>Now if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't believe that you might give</v>

1301
01:12:41.861 --> 01:12:46.300
<v Speaker 3>some consideration to the phenomenal </v>
<v Speaker 3>popularity of 50 shades of grey.</v>

1302
01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Now why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1303
01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.450
<v Speaker 3>it's because women don't want a man who </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't dangerous.</v>

1304
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:59.810
<v Speaker 3>They want a man who's really dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>or who can be really dangerous,</v>

1305
01:12:59.811 --> 01:13:02.330
<v Speaker 3>but who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is capable of not being</v>

1306
01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.473
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's closely allied with youngs </v>

1307
01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:10.930
<v Speaker 3>idea of the incorporation of the shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're,</v>

1308
01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:11.793
<v Speaker 3>if you're a developed as a male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be too dangerous to mess </v>

1309
01:13:15.731 --> 01:13:16.564
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you should be civilized enough to </v>

1310
01:13:18.491 --> 01:13:22.270
<v Speaker 3>keep that under control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not the same as repression of</v>

1311
01:13:22.271 --> 01:13:25.210
<v Speaker 3>aggression and sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same at all.</v>

1312
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:28.060
<v Speaker 3>That just means that you're still a five</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old boy.</v>

1313
01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.340
<v Speaker 3>That's the eatable outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1314
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:31.383
<v Speaker 3>Where the mother is so terrified of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>male movement towards dominance and </v>

1315
01:13:35.651 --> 01:13:36.484
<v Speaker 3>aggression that she squashes it </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely and keeps the the male at </v>

1316
01:13:39.911 --> 01:13:44.440
<v Speaker 3>unit level for the rest of his life </v>
<v Speaker 3>turning him into something that's like a</v>

1317
01:13:44.441 --> 01:13:46.720
<v Speaker 3>potato that's grown in the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1318
01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:47.830
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1319
01:13:47.831 --> 01:13:48.880
<v Speaker 3>in the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1320
01:13:48.881 --> 01:13:49.714
<v Speaker 3>with white tubers coming up everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>and resentful and murderous underneath </v>

1321
01:13:53.021 --> 01:13:55.540
<v Speaker 3>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a positive outcome.</v>

1322
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:57.303
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's associated with the destruction of </v>

1323
01:13:58.421 --> 01:14:00.250
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the oedipal story.</v>

1324
01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:03.520
<v Speaker 3>And like women are afraid of men because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're monsters.</v>

1325
01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.673
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that for bidding a man to become a </v>

1326
01:14:08.531 --> 01:14:12.400
<v Speaker 3>monster just makes him a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It drives it underground.</v>

1327
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.863
<v Speaker 3>What has to happen is the men have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>taught how to be civilized monsters and </v>

1328
01:14:17.081 --> 01:14:20.770
<v Speaker 3>we're doing a very bad job of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1329
01:14:20.771 --> 01:14:22.750
<v Speaker 3>it's it and we're going to pay a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>price for it.</v>

1330
01:14:22.751 --> 01:14:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I think we're already paying a price for</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1331
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the prices that seems to be being</v>

1332
01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:30.340
<v Speaker 3>paid in Japan is that people in Japan </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have sex anymore.</v>

1333
01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.013
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1334
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:36.640
<v Speaker 5>maybe loaded someone try and frame it </v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1335
01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:40.850
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like their rape culture movement towards</v>

1336
01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:43.360
<v Speaker 5>educating men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not to rape women.</v>

1337
01:14:43.361 --> 01:14:47.010
<v Speaker 5>He said of educating and how big </v>
<v Speaker 5>dialogue,</v>

1338
01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.093
<v Speaker 5>and I'm wondering how much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what exactly you're talking about is </v>

1339
01:14:49.971 --> 01:14:50.804
<v Speaker 5>about incorporating sexuality and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>like women that affectual in a healthy </v>

1340
01:14:57.171 --> 01:15:00.530
<v Speaker 5>way so that it doesn't come out sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>underground in the go violet.</v>

1341
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:03.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at tremendous amount of the push to,</v>

1342
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:04.703
<v Speaker 3>to and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the push behind the whole idea of </v>

1343
01:15:06.311 --> 01:15:09.790
<v Speaker 3>rape culture is violently anti male </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>

1344
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:13.270
<v Speaker 3>The idea that there's a rape culture is </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely insane.</v>

1345
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:15.370
<v Speaker 3>No men get together and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1346
01:15:15.371 --> 01:15:17.260
<v Speaker 3>I think we should go out and rape some </v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

1347
01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:21.250
<v Speaker 3>especially not in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in like relatively civilized western and</v>

1348
01:15:21.251 --> 01:15:22.500
<v Speaker 3>North American cultures,</v>

1349
01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:28.660
<v Speaker 5>Frat boys together to get women way too </v>
<v Speaker 5>drunk.</v>

1350
01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:29.980
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1351
01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:30.814
<v Speaker 3>But I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's more that I would say that </v>

1352
01:15:34.421 --> 01:15:38.650
<v Speaker 3>that's more a consequence of stupidity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and inability than anything else.</v>

1353
01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:43.030
<v Speaker 5>Women don't get together and do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't deny that that happened.</v>

1354
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:46.590
<v Speaker 3>I can't deny that it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can deny that it's a culture</v>

1355
01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:52.320
<v Speaker 5>correct title and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1356
01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.393
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>

1357
01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:55.431
<v Speaker 3>well let's look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1358
01:15:55.431 --> 01:15:56.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to know how to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1359
01:15:56.951 --> 01:15:58.270
<v Speaker 3>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go back to it.</v>

1360
01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.393
<v Speaker 5>How am I going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you want to look at some literature </v>

1361
01:16:00.531 --> 01:16:01.900
<v Speaker 5>on that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you slipped up gentry,</v>

1362
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:03.870
<v Speaker 5>Macquarie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dr Dunkin security,</v>

1363
01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:06.863
<v Speaker 5>other interesting information about how </v>
<v Speaker 5>they might be trying to turn these are </v>

1364
01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.670
<v Speaker 5>any like and rubber line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like it's the Arab,</v>

1365
01:16:12.730 --> 01:16:13.563
<v Speaker 5>anybody in the house and like the of </v>
<v Speaker 5>brother had been covering for each </v>

1366
01:16:15.411 --> 01:16:16.244
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

1367
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:18.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all also one of the things that you</v>

1368
01:16:18.681 --> 01:16:22.190
<v Speaker 3>absolutely have to understand that no </v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol means no rape.</v>

1369
01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.593
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1370
01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:25.650
<v Speaker 3>So it's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1371
01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:30.510
<v Speaker 3>I studied the effects of alcohol and </v>
<v Speaker 3>criminal behavior for five years and the</v>

1372
01:16:30.511 --> 01:16:31.344
<v Speaker 3>truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that almost no men would be </v>

1373
01:16:32.791 --> 01:16:35.870
<v Speaker 3>aggressive ever if they weren't drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>

1374
01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:36.930
<v Speaker 3>if there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the front,</v>

1375
01:16:36.931 --> 01:16:37.764
<v Speaker 3>if the fraternities were alcohol free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost all of this would immediately </v>

1376
01:16:40.921 --> 01:16:42.990
<v Speaker 3>disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alcohol makes people,</v>

1377
01:16:44.970 --> 01:16:47.130
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>partly the reason that alcohol is fun is</v>

1378
01:16:47.131 --> 01:16:48.680
<v Speaker 3>because it's completely disinhibiting.</v>

1379
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:49.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1380
01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:50.181
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

1381
01:16:50.181 --> 01:16:51.014
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking of things like rape culture</v>
<v Speaker 5>would exist without stripping what is </v>

1382
01:16:55.251 --> 01:16:57.800
<v Speaker 5>actually making them.</v>

1383
01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:00.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens with alcohol?</v>

1384
01:17:00.781 --> 01:17:01.614
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did some studies looking at how </v>

1385
01:17:02.881 --> 01:17:06.210
<v Speaker 3>alcohol makes people aggressive because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it does,</v>

1386
01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:09.710
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the only drugs that actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes aggressive,</v>

1387
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.800
<v Speaker 3>even cocaine doesn't make people </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive,</v>

1388
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:15.050
<v Speaker 3>but alcohol does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1389
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:16.243
<v Speaker 3>one of the things my supervisor did was </v>
<v Speaker 3>he would bring people into the lab and </v>

1390
01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:21.950
<v Speaker 3>get them pretty intoxicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1391
01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:25.220
<v Speaker 3>like up enough so that they would be at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the level that you would hit if you were</v>

1392
01:17:25.221 --> 01:17:27.830
<v Speaker 3>out for a party pre drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

1393
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:31.050
<v Speaker 3>And then they would play a competitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>shark game,</v>

1394
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:34.100
<v Speaker 3>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the protagonists was a computer.</v>

1395
01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:37.910
<v Speaker 3>And so the drunk people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you could shock you're,</v>

1396
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:38.680
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1397
01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:43.680
<v Speaker 3>opponent if they violated some rule or </v>
<v Speaker 3>at any other time if you felt like it.</v>

1398
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:47.690
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the drunk people would shock them harder</v>

1399
01:17:47.691 --> 01:17:50.360
<v Speaker 3>and longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one theory was,</v>

1400
01:17:50.361 --> 01:17:51.194
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are drunk just don't know </v>

1401
01:17:52.221 --> 01:17:53.240
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing.</v>

1402
01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:56.840
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what my advisor did was he had people</v>

1403
01:17:56.841 --> 01:17:57.674
<v Speaker 3>write down the duration and level of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sharks that they were administering and </v>

1404
01:18:01.761 --> 01:18:02.594
<v Speaker 3>when they were drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that made them administer longer and </v>

1405
01:18:04.881 --> 01:18:05.714
<v Speaker 3>harder shocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it isn't at all that people don't </v>

1406
01:18:08.151 --> 01:18:08.984
<v Speaker 3>know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it is is they don't care what </v>

1407
01:18:10.941 --> 01:18:13.220
<v Speaker 3>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole different thing.</v>

1408
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:16.950
<v Speaker 3>They don't lose self consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they lose is the,</v>

1409
01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:20.840
<v Speaker 3>the worry of the fear of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences that's gone.</v>

1410
01:18:20.841 --> 01:18:21.674
<v Speaker 3>And plus for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol is also a psychomotor </v>

1411
01:18:23.571 --> 01:18:25.580
<v Speaker 3>stimulants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they get ramped up,</v>

1412
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:28.520
<v Speaker 3>especially on the ascending limb of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>blocked blood alcohol curve.</v>

1413
01:18:28.730 --> 01:18:32.930
<v Speaker 3>And then the alcohol knocks out the fear</v>
<v Speaker 3>or inhibition of their behavior.</v>

1414
01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:36.470
<v Speaker 3>So it Lord knocks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocks out any effect of significance of</v>

1415
01:18:36.471 --> 01:18:37.304
<v Speaker 3>longterm consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I thought someone had a question </v>

1416
01:18:44.761 --> 01:18:45.594
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1417
01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.473
<v Speaker 6>By not caring,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you mean like on an ethical level </v>

1418
01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:51.493
<v Speaker 6>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>boy,</v>

1419
01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.340
<v Speaker 6>they must care if they want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>administer more shock.</v>

1420
01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:56.503
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't care about the negative </v>

1421
01:18:57.141 --> 01:18:57.974
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

1422
01:18:58.090 --> 01:18:59.530
<v Speaker 6>Care,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but flipping.</v>

1423
01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:00.291
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1424
01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:00.941
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1425
01:19:00.941 --> 01:19:01.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1426
01:19:01.461 --> 01:19:04.940
<v Speaker 3>anger aggression is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a positive emotional state in park.</v>

1427
01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:07.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an approach behavior.</v>

1428
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:12.290
<v Speaker 3>So it also activates approach and </v>
<v Speaker 3>withdrawal circuits.</v>

1429
01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:15.320
<v Speaker 3>But if it's successful anger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1430
01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:17.450
<v Speaker 3>there's a huge kick in it and that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>

1431
01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:20.900
<v Speaker 3>that can be boosted upwards by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by alcohol.</v>

1432
01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:22.483
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1433
01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:30.920
<v Speaker 4>you don't need alcohol to do that sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of thing.</v>

1434
01:19:30.981 --> 01:19:32.450
<v Speaker 4>So I think that</v>

1435
01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:33.560
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was a very,</v>

1436
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:34.720
<v Speaker 3>that was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were,</v>

1437
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:35.583
<v Speaker 3>there was a very specific condition and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of that might also apply in places </v>

1438
01:19:38.391 --> 01:19:39.600
<v Speaker 3>like fraternities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1439
01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:45.300
<v Speaker 4>I think elocon innovation for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think that also this whole society</v>

1440
01:19:50.491 --> 01:19:55.491
<v Speaker 4>of Internet form and normalizing kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>violence against women has also,</v>

1441
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:57.343
<v Speaker 4>like you don't have the societal </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultural inhibition has also been </v>

1442
01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.980
<v Speaker 4>hurricane to remove some of the,</v>

1443
01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.490
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1444
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I would like to have,</v>

1445
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:13.020
<v Speaker 3>I would like to continue this </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion,</v>

1446
01:20:13.021 --> 01:20:15.030
<v Speaker 3>but let me continue to go through this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1447
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:16.103
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1448
01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:17.573
<v Speaker 3>so what happens after they wake up is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they sew fig leaves together and </v>

1449
01:20:20.251 --> 01:20:21.510
<v Speaker 3>make themselves aprons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1450
01:20:21.511 --> 01:20:24.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know this and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably don't,</v>

1451
01:20:24.001 --> 01:20:28.320
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single line of this story has bred</v>

1452
01:20:28.321 --> 01:20:32.100
<v Speaker 3>thousands and thousands of pages and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands and hours of,</v>

1453
01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:36.570
<v Speaker 3>of discussions about what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this line is no exception.</v>

1454
01:20:36.571 --> 01:20:37.404
<v Speaker 3>And basically what this story says here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least one of the interpretations </v>

1455
01:20:41.131 --> 01:20:41.964
<v Speaker 3>of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that as soon as people wake up and </v>

1456
01:20:43.381 --> 01:20:46.470
<v Speaker 3>realize they're naked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make clothing and put it on.</v>

1457
01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:48.510
<v Speaker 3>And that's culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1458
01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:52.080
<v Speaker 3>That's so as soon as nakedness is on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>table,</v>

1459
01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:53.093
<v Speaker 3>then people put culture between </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and the vision of their </v>

1460
01:20:57.661 --> 01:20:59.670
<v Speaker 3>evaluators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>

1461
01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.593
<v Speaker 3>the apron is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the representative of the fact that as </v>

1462
01:21:04.381 --> 01:21:06.630
<v Speaker 3>soon as animals wake up and realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're naked,</v>

1463
01:21:06.631 --> 01:21:07.464
<v Speaker 3>they use culture as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a coping mechanism or it's not a </v>

1464
01:21:10.501 --> 01:21:15.240
<v Speaker 3>coping mechanism as a way of adapting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that emergent situation.</v>

1465
01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:16.733
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that people do pretty </v>

1466
01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:21.780
<v Speaker 3>much worldwide is where clothes now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a universal,</v>

1467
01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:25.710
<v Speaker 3>although it does seem to be a universal </v>
<v Speaker 3>in so far as clothes are always used,</v>

1468
01:21:25.711 --> 01:21:29.640
<v Speaker 3>at least for decorative purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in virtually every culture,</v>

1469
01:21:29.641 --> 01:21:32.730
<v Speaker 3>human beings are closed and we have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a very long period of time.</v>

1470
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:33.833
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Partly that's because while we don't </v>

1471
01:21:35.221 --> 01:21:36.054
<v Speaker 3>have any body hair and so we get cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if we live in northern </v>

1472
01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:41.700
<v Speaker 3>climates or we need to protect herself </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the sun and so forth.</v>

1473
01:21:41.701 --> 01:21:44.310
<v Speaker 3>But that certainly by no means the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>

1474
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.353
<v Speaker 3>even when we're as modern people were in</v>
<v Speaker 3>temperature can clue controlled </v>

1475
01:21:48.211 --> 01:21:49.044
<v Speaker 3>climates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like we're wandering around </v>

1476
01:21:50.341 --> 01:21:54.000
<v Speaker 3>without our clothes on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

1477
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:55.330
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1478
01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:56.333
<v Speaker 3>a form of boundary between ourselves and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the natural world and we immediately </v>

1479
01:22:00.721 --> 01:22:01.530
<v Speaker 3>adopted.</v>

1480
01:22:01.530 --> 01:22:03.190
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the reason,</v>

1481
01:22:03.191 --> 01:22:04.024
<v Speaker 3>the motivational reasons that's laid out</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the stories because people know that </v>

1482
01:22:06.170 --> 01:22:07.003
<v Speaker 3>there know that they're naked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the transformation produces immediate </v>

1483
01:22:12.901 --> 01:22:13.734
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam and Eve can finally see there now </v>

1484
01:22:15.871 --> 01:22:16.704
<v Speaker 3>transcended vision produced by </v>
<v Speaker 3>incorporation of what was forbidden </v>

1485
01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:22.600
<v Speaker 3>produces within them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Avascular heightened self consciousness,</v>

1486
01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.290
<v Speaker 3>a terrible catastrophe for limited </v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

1487
01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:28.110
<v Speaker 3>but a preconditioned for genuine </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual existence.</v>

1488
01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:32.370
<v Speaker 3>Adam and eve instantly realize their </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual naked vulnerability,</v>

1489
01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.713
<v Speaker 3>a realization that emerges during </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive development at a very young </v>

1490
01:22:36.121 --> 01:22:36.954
<v Speaker 3>age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact that the only human being </v>

1491
01:22:38.411 --> 01:22:40.800
<v Speaker 3>seemed cognizant of in any complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

1492
01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:44.010
<v Speaker 3>What does knowledge of naked </v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability mean?</v>

1493
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.550
<v Speaker 3>It means that human beings are painfully</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious of their limitations.</v>

1494
01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.760
<v Speaker 3>We know that we are flawed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to our ideals.</v>

1495
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.270
<v Speaker 3>We understand that our being is limited </v>
<v Speaker 3>in place in time.</v>

1496
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:57.690
<v Speaker 3>We know we are vulnerable to death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disease and insanity.</v>

1497
01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.950
<v Speaker 3>We know that we can be betrayed by her </v>
<v Speaker 3>embodied being and undermine socially by</v>

1498
01:23:01.951 --> 01:23:04.380
<v Speaker 3>our peers and even by our friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by our friends,</v>

1499
01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.430
<v Speaker 3>and all of this makes us ashamed,</v>

1500
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:07.900
<v Speaker 2>fearful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unselfconscious.</v>

1501
01:23:09.370 --> 01:23:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next question.</v>

1502
01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.530
<v Speaker 2>So when Adam and eve become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get there,</v>

1503
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:14.403
<v Speaker 2>they eat this fruit and they figured out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're naked and then they put on </v>

1504
01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:17.854
<v Speaker 2>clothes on clothes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that the snake </v>

1505
01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:22.810
<v Speaker 2>tells them is that as soon as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>become awake,</v>

1506
01:23:23.530 --> 01:23:26.530
<v Speaker 2>they're also going to know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between good and evil.</v>

1507
01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took that long.</v>

1508
01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:32.620
<v Speaker 2>It took me an awful long time to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out what that could possibly meet.</v>

1509
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:35.380
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that I was trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out as well,</v>

1510
01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:37.563
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you know that you're naked </v>

1511
01:23:38.821 --> 01:23:41.590
<v Speaker 2>and imagine that you can really </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehend your limitations,</v>

1512
01:23:41.591 --> 01:23:43.240
<v Speaker 2>you don't really understand what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1513
01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:48.340
<v Speaker 2>then that means that you understand your</v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability or at least to some degree</v>

1514
01:23:48.341 --> 01:23:49.174
<v Speaker 2>that you understand your vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that's so interesting is </v>

1515
01:23:51.611 --> 01:23:52.444
<v Speaker 2>that the fact that I can understand my </v>
<v Speaker 2>own vulnerability means that I can be </v>

1516
01:23:56.261 --> 01:23:57.400
<v Speaker 2>empathic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1517
01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.233
<v Speaker 2>Because I can also understand your </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability and we can mirror that </v>

1518
01:24:00.581 --> 01:24:02.410
<v Speaker 2>back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say,</v>

1519
01:24:02.411 --> 01:24:05.710
<v Speaker 2>well that's part of what enables us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehend good.</v>

1520
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:08.950
<v Speaker 2>But there's a terrible downside to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

1521
01:24:08.951 --> 01:24:09.784
<v Speaker 2>which is that as soon as I know that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable and then I know exactly what </v>

1522
01:24:13.241 --> 01:24:15.970
<v Speaker 2>that means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly how I can hurt you.</v>

1523
01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:17.493
<v Speaker 2>And that's a hurt that goes beyond what </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals do when they destroy one </v>

1524
01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:20.764
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if a,</v>

1525
01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:23.240
<v Speaker 2>if a wolf is trying to take down a a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cow,</v>

1526
01:24:23.241 --> 01:24:25.630
<v Speaker 2>say it's a pretty hideous process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1527
01:24:25.631 --> 01:24:29.050
<v Speaker 2>like the wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wolves will take pieces of the cow.</v>

1528
01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's standing up.</v>

1529
01:24:30.730 --> 01:24:31.563
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that they go in for the kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they do it as fast as they possibly </v>

1530
01:24:34.931 --> 01:24:35.561
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1531
01:24:35.561 --> 01:24:36.394
<v Speaker 2>they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only because they don't want to get </v>

1532
01:24:37.481 --> 01:24:38.860
<v Speaker 2>kicked to death by the cow.</v>

1533
01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:41.380
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty bloody awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1534
01:24:41.381 --> 01:24:42.214
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've ever read about Mya </v>

1535
01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:47.800
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees hunting colobus monkeys for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1536
01:24:47.801 --> 01:24:50.410
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty brutal situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause the chimps,</v>

1537
01:24:50.411 --> 01:24:51.244
<v Speaker 2>we'll catch the call us monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which weigh about 38 pounds and tear </v>

1538
01:24:54.341 --> 01:24:56.560
<v Speaker 2>them to pieces and eat them while </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still alive.</v>

1539
01:24:56.770 --> 01:25:00.370
<v Speaker 2>So they're like screaming madly away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't stop the chimps at all.</v>

1540
01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:05.770
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like predation in the wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>is brief and,</v>

1541
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:06.783
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a merciful by any sort of natural </v>

1542
01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:11.343
<v Speaker 2>order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's no more horrible than it </v>

1543
01:25:13.211 --> 01:25:14.470
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be.</v>

1544
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Whereas with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different story,</v>

1545
01:25:18.970 --> 01:25:19.661
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>

1546
01:25:19.661 --> 01:25:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1547
01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:23.680
<v Speaker 2>if people have been torturing each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

1548
01:25:23.681 --> 01:25:26.860
<v Speaker 2>especially in warfare for a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very long period of time,</v>

1549
01:25:27.190 --> 01:25:28.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are certainly in tribal </v>

1550
01:25:30.341 --> 01:25:33.220
<v Speaker 2>warfare in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of the things that the tribes</v>

1551
01:25:33.221 --> 01:25:34.054
<v Speaker 2>pride themselves on is the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep a captured soldier long alive for </v>

1552
01:25:38.171 --> 01:25:39.004
<v Speaker 2>the longest period of time possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well torturing him in the most painful </v>

1553
01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:46.900
<v Speaker 2>way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that can mean weeks and you can't</v>

1554
01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:47.734
<v Speaker 2>understand exactly how to take someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else apart in every possible way that </v>

1555
01:25:51.101 --> 01:25:54.970
<v Speaker 2>you can take someone apart until you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how you could be taken apart.</v>

1556
01:25:55.690 --> 01:25:58.930
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that as soon as you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize your own vulnerability,</v>

1557
01:25:58.931 --> 01:25:59.764
<v Speaker 2>you have transcended mere good and bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>and moved into the domain of good and </v>

1558
01:26:03.681 --> 01:26:04.514
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

1559
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:07.760
<v Speaker 3>So cause you can treat someone else like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would want to be treated.</v>

1560
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:08.803
<v Speaker 3>But you can also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no limits to your imagination </v>

1561
01:26:11.691 --> 01:26:13.370
<v Speaker 3>for cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1562
01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:15.140
<v Speaker 3>and there are truly no limits.</v>

1563
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:16.243
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

1564
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:18.283
<v Speaker 3>you see in situations like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've ever read the </v>

1565
01:26:20.751 --> 01:26:25.190
<v Speaker 3>book the Rape of Nan King,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's a truly horrifying book.</v>

1566
01:26:25.191 --> 01:26:28.270
<v Speaker 3>The Rape Nan King.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's about what happened when Japan</v>

1567
01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.980
<v Speaker 3>occupied China during the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 3>War.</v>

1568
01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:36.010
<v Speaker 3>The estimates are that some three to </v>
<v Speaker 3>400,000</v>

1569
01:26:36.011 --> 01:26:40.000
<v Speaker 3>people were raped and brutalized and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tortured in Nan king.</v>

1570
01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:41.283
<v Speaker 3>And what seemed to happen was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japanese soldiers at that time were </v>

1571
01:26:44.141 --> 01:26:48.310
<v Speaker 3>products of the Prussian military school</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the Japanese and adopted that as</v>

1572
01:26:48.311 --> 01:26:49.144
<v Speaker 3>their model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were basically taught that </v>

1573
01:26:50.890 --> 01:26:53.650
<v Speaker 3>everyone who wasn't Japanese was </v>
<v Speaker 3>subhuman.</v>

1574
01:26:53.890 --> 01:26:54.723
<v Speaker 3>And it's pretty easy to teach people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because you can teach people that </v>

1575
01:26:57.461 --> 01:27:01.030
<v Speaker 3>those people who aren't them are </v>
<v Speaker 3>subhuman at the drop of a hat.</v>

1576
01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:03.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a natural way for us to think.</v>

1577
01:27:04.330 --> 01:27:07.540
<v Speaker 3>And so when the Japanese went into Nan </v>
<v Speaker 3>king,</v>

1578
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:11.230
<v Speaker 3>there was no limit on what they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to do to the Chinese.</v>

1579
01:27:11.231 --> 01:27:12.064
<v Speaker 3>And what basically happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can imagine this because people can </v>

1580
01:27:14.351 --> 01:27:15.184
<v Speaker 3>imitate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What basically happened was you could </v>

1581
01:27:16.661 --> 01:27:17.494
<v Speaker 3>take the most psychopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>single Japanese soldier that you could </v>

1582
01:27:20.441 --> 01:27:21.274
<v Speaker 3>possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then find a group those and then </v>

1583
01:27:23.951 --> 01:27:28.570
<v Speaker 3>find the one person who had the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>vivid imagination for may have an eval.</v>

1584
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:33.130
<v Speaker 3>And then you could imagine him setting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tone for the entire occupation.</v>

1585
01:27:33.610 --> 01:27:37.570
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was competitive brutality.</v>

1586
01:27:38.850 --> 01:27:39.683
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1587
01:27:41.150 --> 01:27:41.983
<v Speaker 3>and you don't get at competitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>brutality until you understand exactly </v>

1588
01:27:44.631 --> 01:27:45.464
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what you're doing until you </v>

1589
01:27:47.181 --> 01:27:48.014
<v Speaker 3>know how people can be hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you don't understand that until you </v>

1590
01:27:50.871 --> 01:27:51.704
<v Speaker 3>know how you can be hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's also an emergent </v>

1591
01:27:53.961 --> 01:27:55.670
<v Speaker 3>consequence of self consciousness</v>

1592
01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.440
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you might think,</v>

1593
01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:00.490
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there any,</v>

1594
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:04.390
<v Speaker 3>is there any support in this story for </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a hypothesis?</v>

1595
01:28:04.391 --> 01:28:05.224
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that thing that comes next </v>

1596
01:28:06.041 --> 01:28:06.940
<v Speaker 3>supports it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1597
01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:12.280
<v Speaker 3>and this is another part of this story </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think is by no means patriarchal.</v>

1598
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:16.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it's exactly the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that gender,</v>

1599
01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:18.940
<v Speaker 3>while I'll read you the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or read the story.</v>

1600
01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:22.330
<v Speaker 3>So now they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've found out they're naked and they</v>

1601
01:28:22.331 --> 01:28:25.480
<v Speaker 3>covered themselves up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so now God comes walking through the</v>

1602
01:28:25.481 --> 01:28:30.160
<v Speaker 3>garden and Adam and eve heard the voice </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Lord God walking in the garden in</v>

1603
01:28:30.161 --> 01:28:30.994
<v Speaker 3>the cool of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Adam and his wife hid themselves </v>

1604
01:28:33.611 --> 01:28:36.340
<v Speaker 3>from the presence of the Lord God </v>
<v Speaker 3>amongst the trees of the garden.</v>

1605
01:28:36.730 --> 01:28:40.060
<v Speaker 3>So they hadn't been doing that before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it hadn't been hiding from God.</v>

1606
01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:44.590
<v Speaker 3>So now what we have is the idea that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>soon as people become vulnerable,</v>

1607
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:46.090
<v Speaker 3>they hide from God.</v>

1608
01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:47.493
<v Speaker 3>And I believe that to be as close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally true as anything that you can </v>

1609
01:28:50.261 --> 01:28:51.094
<v Speaker 3>really utr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll talk about why that is in a </v>

1610
01:28:52.451 --> 01:28:53.284
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Lord God called Unto Adam and </v>

1611
01:28:55.691 --> 01:28:57.610
<v Speaker 3>said unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where Art Thou?</v>

1612
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.490
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard dive voice in the garden.</v>

1613
01:29:00.491 --> 01:29:03.660
<v Speaker 3>And I was because I was naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I hid myself.</v>

1614
01:29:04.890 --> 01:29:07.440
<v Speaker 3>And God said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who told you that you were naked?</v>

1615
01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:08.693
<v Speaker 3>Have you eaten of the tree?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereof I commanded thee that thou </v>

1616
01:29:10.501 --> 01:29:12.510
<v Speaker 3>should not eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the man said,</v>

1617
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:17.600
<v Speaker 3>the woman whom thou gave us to be with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she gave me of the tree and I did eat.</v>

1618
01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:19.110
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1619
01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:20.123
<v Speaker 3>that's an amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing that happens is </v>

1620
01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.333
<v Speaker 3>there's an intimation that before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emergence of self consciousness that </v>

1621
01:29:25.681 --> 01:29:27.690
<v Speaker 3>human beings walked with God in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>garden.</v>

1622
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.823
<v Speaker 3>And so there was an unbroken line of </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication in some sense between the </v>

1623
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:35.520
<v Speaker 3>creature and the divine totality.</v>

1624
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:36.383
<v Speaker 3>It's the link was not broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now one of the things that's </v>

1625
01:29:39.061 --> 01:29:41.850
<v Speaker 3>characteristic of the Shamana trends </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition,</v>

1626
01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:44.910
<v Speaker 3>and this seems to be an idea that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically spread worldwide,</v>

1627
01:29:44.911 --> 01:29:45.744
<v Speaker 3>is that there was a time back in time </v>
<v Speaker 3>when the connection between heaven and </v>

1628
01:29:50.191 --> 01:29:51.024
<v Speaker 3>earth was unbroken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that there's a fall and </v>

1629
01:29:53.581 --> 01:29:58.260
<v Speaker 3>that the fall involves a tree and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>snake is unbelievably well distributed.</v>

1630
01:29:58.710 --> 01:29:59.543
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculously well distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now that might be because maybe that </v>

1631
01:30:03.271 --> 01:30:06.030
<v Speaker 3>was the story that we all knew before </v>
<v Speaker 3>the diaspora,</v>

1632
01:30:06.031 --> 01:30:08.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before the diaspora out of Africa.</v>

1633
01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:11.100
<v Speaker 3>And that people have just been retelling</v>
<v Speaker 3>it forever since,</v>

1634
01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.113
<v Speaker 3>since then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many hundreds of thousands of years </v>

1635
01:30:13.561 --> 01:30:14.394
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or it might be that it's a story that's </v>

1636
01:30:15.601 --> 01:30:18.180
<v Speaker 3>so built into our architecture that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1637
01:30:18.181 --> 01:30:21.270
<v Speaker 3>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we come up across approximations of</v>

1638
01:30:21.271 --> 01:30:23.850
<v Speaker 3>it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in stories that people tell one another,</v>

1639
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:28.260
<v Speaker 3>that it rings true somehow and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>collected recollected and retell it.</v>

1640
01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:33.530
<v Speaker 3>Nobody really knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so what happens is that there's this</v>

1641
01:30:34.081 --> 01:30:34.914
<v Speaker 3>idea of unbroken communication between </v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam and eve before the development of </v>

1642
01:30:37.981 --> 01:30:38.814
<v Speaker 3>self consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then self consciousness emerges and </v>

1643
01:30:40.681 --> 01:30:43.440
<v Speaker 3>they both realize they're naked and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they covered themselves up.</v>

1644
01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:46.800
<v Speaker 3>But then the next thing that happens is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they hide from God.</v>

1645
01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:49.260
<v Speaker 3>Now you didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty primitive.</v>

1646
01:30:49.261 --> 01:30:50.094
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this part of the story is </v>

1647
01:30:50.941 --> 01:30:51.774
<v Speaker 3>actually a comedy because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really acting in a very </v>

1648
01:30:54.511 --> 01:30:55.770
<v Speaker 3>brainless manor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1649
01:30:55.771 --> 01:30:57.300
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they going to do?</v>

1650
01:30:57.301 --> 01:30:58.134
<v Speaker 3>They're hiding from God behind trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That strikes me that that's a very </v>

1651
01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:01.254
<v Speaker 3>ineffective way of hiding from God since</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can probably see three trees and if </v>

1652
01:31:04.021 --> 01:31:05.790
<v Speaker 3>they thought about it for two tenths of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a second,</v>

1653
01:31:05.791 --> 01:31:07.440
<v Speaker 3>they'd figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1654
01:31:07.441 --> 01:31:09.420
<v Speaker 3>So they might be conscious and self </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious,</v>

1655
01:31:09.421 --> 01:31:11.490
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not really very bright yet.</v>

1656
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:12.863
<v Speaker 3>And then God calls Adam on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the first thing Adam does is blame </v>

1657
01:31:17.190 --> 01:31:20.280
<v Speaker 3>the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which isn't exactly the opposite of what</v>

1658
01:31:20.281 --> 01:31:21.114
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would expect from a patriarchal </v>

1659
01:31:22.141 --> 01:31:26.040
<v Speaker 3>story as far as I'm concerned because he</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes across as a complete Dweeb,</v>

1660
01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:27.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>

1661
01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:28.780
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't do,</v>

1662
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:31.740
<v Speaker 3>you would think that if the writers of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this story would have wanted to,</v>

1663
01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:32.933
<v Speaker 3>wanted men to look particularly good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Adam would have stood up and </v>

1664
01:31:36.781 --> 01:31:37.590
<v Speaker 3>protected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat,</v>

1665
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:40.020
<v Speaker 3>not ratted her out the first possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

1666
01:31:40.770 --> 01:31:41.730
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>

1667
01:31:42.090 --> 01:31:45.750
<v Speaker 3>I think that men do complain to God that</v>
<v Speaker 3>women make themselves conscious.</v>

1668
01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:46.913
<v Speaker 3>I think they do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that manifests itself in </v>

1669
01:31:50.011 --> 01:31:50.844
<v Speaker 3>resentment and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially if they're not being </v>

1670
01:31:53.101 --> 01:31:54.930
<v Speaker 3>successful in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1671
01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:57.450
<v Speaker 3>in the game of attracting female </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

1672
01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.153
<v Speaker 3>So they complained to God all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the fact that women are making </v>

1673
01:32:01.871 --> 01:32:05.530
<v Speaker 3>them self conscious and that produces a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of resentment.</v>

1674
01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:08.710
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the man says,</v>

1675
01:32:08.711 --> 01:32:10.720
<v Speaker 3>the woman who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the woman who you gave to me.</v>

1676
01:32:10.721 --> 01:32:12.700
<v Speaker 3>So he blames God too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is pretty funny.</v>

1677
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.863
<v Speaker 3>She gave me of the tree and I did eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now there's a deeper meaning here </v>

1678
01:32:17.891 --> 01:32:18.724
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that the reason that human </v>

1679
01:32:19.751 --> 01:32:20.584
<v Speaker 3>beings no longer walk with God is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're embarrassed about their </v>

1680
01:32:23.141 --> 01:32:23.974
<v Speaker 3>own vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also believe that to be the case </v>

1681
01:32:26.231 --> 01:32:27.970
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think</v>

1682
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:36.880
<v Speaker 3>it isn't only the worst of ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we hide from each other,</v>

1683
01:32:36.881 --> 01:32:39.070
<v Speaker 3>it's also the best of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

1684
01:32:39.071 --> 01:32:39.904
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're more likely to hide the best of </v>

1685
01:32:41.021 --> 01:32:41.854
<v Speaker 3>ourselves in the worst because like if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>manifest the worst of myself socially </v>

1686
01:32:45.191 --> 01:32:46.570
<v Speaker 3>and it gets rejected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1687
01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.890
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the hell cares about that?</v>

1688
01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:51.880
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's my second rate attempt.</v>

1689
01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:54.800
<v Speaker 3>And it's not something I'm particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>proud of anyways.</v>

1690
01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.451
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1691
01:32:55.451 --> 01:32:58.030
<v Speaker 3>if you're not that happy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's not the real me.</v>

1692
01:32:58.031 --> 01:33:01.750
<v Speaker 3>And so who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But where are your most vulnerable is if</v>

1693
01:33:01.751 --> 01:33:02.584
<v Speaker 3>you try to do something that's as good </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you can do and you lay that out for </v>

1694
01:33:05.711 --> 01:33:06.544
<v Speaker 3>public evaluation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why neat you said for </v>

1695
01:33:08.651 --> 01:33:09.484
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you really want to punish </v>

1696
01:33:10.271 --> 01:33:11.980
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you punish them for their virtues,</v>

1697
01:33:11.981 --> 01:33:12.814
<v Speaker 3>not for their faults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so people are afraid of letting </v>

1698
01:33:15.551 --> 01:33:19.750
<v Speaker 3>their virtues be seen because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>really reveals their vulnerability,</v>

1699
01:33:19.751 --> 01:33:22.990
<v Speaker 3>like that reveals the true extent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their potential big.</v>

1700
01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:24.153
<v Speaker 3>And that's something that someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>has the motivation could immediately </v>

1701
01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.490
<v Speaker 3>capitalize on and tortured them to death</v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

1702
01:33:30.491 --> 01:33:31.324
<v Speaker 3>And I think like that's basically the </v>
<v Speaker 3>plot of every high school coming of age </v>

1703
01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:37.090
<v Speaker 3>movie that's ever been made so</v>

1704
01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:51.370
<v Speaker 3>well now they've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So God says,</v>

1705
01:33:53.150 --> 01:33:53.983
<v Speaker 3>I read here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me read this because I thought this </v>

1706
01:33:55.641 --> 01:33:56.474
<v Speaker 3>was pretty funny.</v>

1707
01:33:59.750 --> 01:34:00.583
<v Speaker 3>Self conscious knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability makes the individual too </v>

1708
01:34:02.691 --> 01:34:06.620
<v Speaker 3>afraid to walk with God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is avoidance of meaning,</v>

1709
01:34:06.621 --> 01:34:07.454
<v Speaker 3>responsibility and destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Such avoidance has catastrophic </v>

1710
01:34:10.281 --> 01:34:14.240
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Existence properly undertaken produces a</v>

1711
01:34:14.241 --> 01:34:15.074
<v Speaker 3>condition of being that makes knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>of find a tude tolerable that properly </v>

1712
01:34:18.651 --> 01:34:19.484
<v Speaker 3>undertaking undertaken existence means </v>
<v Speaker 3>the embodiment of logos in spite of </v>

1713
01:34:22.731 --> 01:34:23.564
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability to hide from God as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of revealed nakedness is to </v>

1714
01:34:27.771 --> 01:34:28.604
<v Speaker 3>destroy the incarnation of logos and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately become subject to the </v>

1715
01:34:31.371 --> 01:34:35.030
<v Speaker 3>privations of merely human existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam's sin,</v>

1716
01:34:35.031 --> 01:34:35.864
<v Speaker 3>which is partly his curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inspired rebellion is also more than </v>

1717
01:34:38.751 --> 01:34:39.584
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is more may also be more </v>

1718
01:34:41.181 --> 01:34:42.014
<v Speaker 3>significant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam refuses to continue his </v>

1719
01:34:44.631 --> 01:34:45.464
<v Speaker 3>relationship with logos because he is </v>
<v Speaker 3>awake and afraid and he believed he </v>

1720
01:34:49.461 --> 01:34:50.294
<v Speaker 3>blames the architect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>architect of femininity eve for his </v>

1721
01:34:53.061 --> 01:34:55.220
<v Speaker 3>enlightened cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After all,</v>

1722
01:34:55.221 --> 01:34:59.720
<v Speaker 3>she made him self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His immediate abandonment of courage and</v>

1723
01:34:59.721 --> 01:35:03.050
<v Speaker 3>responsibility endears him neither to </v>
<v Speaker 3>God nor to woman.</v>

1724
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.273
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps this is the real sin of Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had he not compromised himself further </v>

1725
01:35:07.941 --> 01:35:10.730
<v Speaker 3>after eating the apple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God might have relented and allowed them</v>

1726
01:35:10.731 --> 01:35:11.564
<v Speaker 3>to stay in paradise and that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading of of genesis that I've ever </v>

1727
01:35:15.351 --> 01:35:19.190
<v Speaker 3>really come across because the sin has </v>
<v Speaker 3>always presented as the original eating.</v>

1728
01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.890
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he acts pretty damn reprehensive Lee.</v>

1729
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:26.120
<v Speaker 3>In fact as badly as you possibly could </v>
<v Speaker 3>under circumstances like that.</v>

1730
01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:29.420
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's certainly the case that women,</v>

1731
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:30.283
<v Speaker 3>men acting towards women in that manner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blaming them for their own self </v>

1732
01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:34.394
<v Speaker 3>conscious vulnerability is is definitely</v>
<v Speaker 3>a major source of avoidable strife </v>

1733
01:35:38.331 --> 01:35:40.910
<v Speaker 3>throughout the world and has been for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1734
01:35:40.911 --> 01:35:44.570
<v Speaker 3>all of the centuries that we've been in </v>
<v Speaker 3>self conscious association with women</v>

1735
01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.970
<v Speaker 4>about the letter of the law.</v>

1736
01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:00.901
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I think,</v>

1737
01:36:00.901 --> 01:36:02.670
<v Speaker 3>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1738
01:36:02.671 --> 01:36:03.870
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what happens?</v>

1739
01:36:03.871 --> 01:36:05.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens is what you'd expect.</v>

1740
01:36:05.911 --> 01:36:09.330
<v Speaker 3>God just lays out the the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this.</v>

1741
01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:10.733
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>

1742
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.950
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1743
01:36:11.950 --> 01:36:13.120
<v Speaker 3>unto the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1744
01:36:13.121 --> 01:36:13.954
<v Speaker 3>I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and </v>
<v Speaker 3>die conception in sorrow shalt thou </v>

1745
01:36:17.801 --> 01:36:22.750
<v Speaker 3>bring forth children and I desire shall </v>
<v Speaker 3>be to die husband and he shall rule over</v>

1746
01:36:22.751 --> 01:36:25.870
<v Speaker 3>thee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's often read is that's often read</v>

1747
01:36:25.871 --> 01:36:30.871
<v Speaker 3>as again as a patriarchal statement that</v>
<v Speaker 3>God punishes women by dooming them to be</v>

1748
01:36:32.381 --> 01:36:33.214
<v Speaker 3>ruled by men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think that that's what it </v>

1749
01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:36.220
<v Speaker 3>says it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it says basically as,</v>

1750
01:36:36.221 --> 01:36:37.054
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well a sequence of events has just </v>

1751
01:36:38.021 --> 01:36:38.854
<v Speaker 3>occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sequence of events is that event </v>

1752
01:36:40.901 --> 01:36:41.734
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1753
01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:44.560
<v Speaker 3>which caused the emergence of self </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

1754
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Now we can assume that that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with cortical expansion.</v>

1755
01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:49.473
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things we know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened during cortical expansion is </v>

1756
01:36:51.611 --> 01:36:52.444
<v Speaker 3>that the baby's head became sedan big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it could hardly get out during </v>

1757
01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:57.610
<v Speaker 3>childbirth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's been a bunch of physiological</v>

1758
01:36:57.611 --> 01:36:58.660
<v Speaker 3>consequences of that.</v>

1759
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:59.703
<v Speaker 3>One is women's hips are wider than men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they were any wider women couldn't </v>

1760
01:37:03.731 --> 01:37:04.564
<v Speaker 3>run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So women hit the limits of hip </v>

1761
01:37:06.881 --> 01:37:10.200
<v Speaker 3>expansion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the hip expansion helped,</v>

1762
01:37:10.210 --> 01:37:15.210
<v Speaker 3>made the pelvic pelvic gap through which</v>
<v Speaker 3>the baby is born sufficiently large.</v>

1763
01:37:16.721 --> 01:37:20.020
<v Speaker 3>So they had could get through but barely</v>
<v Speaker 3>like seriously,</v>

1764
01:37:20.021 --> 01:37:20.854
<v Speaker 3>barely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why there's partly why there </v>

1765
01:37:21.741 --> 01:37:22.574
<v Speaker 3>are so many [inaudible] in sections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the other consequences of </v>

1766
01:37:25.421 --> 01:37:26.560
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were a couple of them.</v>

1767
01:37:26.561 --> 01:37:29.230
<v Speaker 3>One is babies are born way younger than </v>
<v Speaker 3>they should be.</v>

1768
01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:30.393
<v Speaker 3>So for a mammal of our size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women should have a gestation period of </v>

1769
01:37:32.981 --> 01:37:34.630
<v Speaker 3>two years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not nine months.</v>

1770
01:37:34.930 --> 01:37:39.910
<v Speaker 3>So babies are born fetal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the second is that the baby's head,</v>

1771
01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:43.780
<v Speaker 3>the bones in the head aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are grown together.</v>

1772
01:37:43.781 --> 01:37:44.614
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things that happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>during birth is the baby's head </v>

1773
01:37:46.421 --> 01:37:49.000
<v Speaker 3>compresses and it compresses a lot.</v>

1774
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Like when a baby comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually can be its head,</v>

1775
01:37:51.881 --> 01:37:52.714
<v Speaker 3>can normal speak cone shaped because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tremendous that's crushing the head </v>

1776
01:37:56.851 --> 01:37:59.610
<v Speaker 3>during the birth process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so birth is very,</v>

1777
01:37:59.611 --> 01:38:02.580
<v Speaker 3>very painful for human beings and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1778
01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:04.140
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1779
01:38:04.141 --> 01:38:09.141
<v Speaker 3>part of the human story is that the hero</v>
<v Speaker 3>is always threatened at birth.</v>

1780
01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:10.463
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that that's true among human </v>

1781
01:38:12.061 --> 01:38:14.880
<v Speaker 3>beings is because human babies are </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably vulnerable.</v>

1782
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:16.133
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even at birth they're highly likely </v>

1783
01:38:17.671 --> 01:38:18.504
<v Speaker 3>to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Child mortality has been a terrible </v>

1784
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:24.540
<v Speaker 3>burden on humanity while really up until</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last century,</v>

1785
01:38:24.541 --> 01:38:25.374
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and child mortality rates have been </v>

1786
01:38:26.161 --> 01:38:29.370
<v Speaker 3>plummeting like mad in developed </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries over the last 10 years.</v>

1787
01:38:29.371 --> 01:38:32.250
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prior to the 20th century,</v>

1788
01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:36.380
<v Speaker 3>children die didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the majority of children died.</v>

1789
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:37.263
<v Speaker 3>Women died in childbirth all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that women were going to </v>

1790
01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:42.473
<v Speaker 3>have sorrow in childbirth and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>conception doesn't seem to me to be </v>

1791
01:38:46.531 --> 01:38:48.630
<v Speaker 3>precisely a divine doctrine.</v>

1792
01:38:48.630 --> 01:38:51.390
<v Speaker 3>It's just an observation of exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to happen.</v>

1793
01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:54.390
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

1794
01:38:54.391 --> 01:38:55.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once the baby's born,</v>

1795
01:38:55.711 --> 01:38:56.544
<v Speaker 3>the same damn problem emerges because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the baby so premature and so helpless </v>

1796
01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:00.803
<v Speaker 3>that the woman is basically doomed to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonself sufficient for a reasonably </v>

1797
01:39:06.271 --> 01:39:08.400
<v Speaker 3>extensive period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we could say,</v>

1798
01:39:08.401 --> 01:39:13.401
<v Speaker 3>well that's at least until the baby is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say five absolutely minimum.</v>

1799
01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:14.843
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even chimps carry their babies around </v>

1800
01:39:16.021 --> 01:39:18.630
<v Speaker 3>for about three years with one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1801
01:39:18.631 --> 01:39:20.970
<v Speaker 3>so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the females are down to one arm.</v>

1802
01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:22.253
<v Speaker 3>And so human mothers are at a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 3>disadvantage in the immediate aftermath </v>

1803
01:39:26.341 --> 01:39:27.174
<v Speaker 3>of birth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of the consequence of that is </v>

1804
01:39:28.651 --> 01:39:30.540
<v Speaker 3>that they're doomed to be reliant on </v>
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>

1805
01:39:30.690 --> 01:39:32.640
<v Speaker 3>What the hell else could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen?</v>

1806
01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:33.713
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the women put themselves together in </v>

1807
01:39:34.681 --> 01:39:38.690
<v Speaker 3>groups and try to support each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>during pregnancy and childbirth.</v>

1808
01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:41.070
<v Speaker 3>And that happens in multiview most human</v>
<v Speaker 3>societies.</v>

1809
01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:44.850
<v Speaker 3>But it still boils down to the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to redress the balance,</v>

1810
01:39:44.851 --> 01:39:45.684
<v Speaker 3>the woman ends up dependent on a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the consequences of that is </v>

1811
01:39:48.871 --> 01:39:49.860
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1812
01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.820
<v Speaker 3>he's got more power than she does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a,</v>

1813
01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.220
<v Speaker 3>it's a statement of destiny rather than </v>
<v Speaker 3>a sentence of,</v>

1814
01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:58.830
<v Speaker 3>of revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Unto Adam,</v>

1815
01:39:58.831 --> 01:39:59.664
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have hearkened unto the </v>

1816
01:40:00.541 --> 01:40:02.460
<v Speaker 3>voice of your wife and have eaten of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tree,</v>

1817
01:40:02.461 --> 01:40:03.294
<v Speaker 3>which I commanded thee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying thou shall not eat of it cursed </v>

1818
01:40:05.881 --> 01:40:08.370
<v Speaker 3>it is the ground for the ice sake in </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorrow,</v>

1819
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:12.510
<v Speaker 3>shelldale eat of it all die days of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>life of the life of thy life.</v>

1820
01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:13.763
<v Speaker 3>Thorns also and thistles shall it bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth to thee and thou shall eat the </v>

1821
01:40:16.801 --> 01:40:19.230
<v Speaker 3>herb of the field in the sweat of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

1822
01:40:19.231 --> 01:40:23.060
<v Speaker 3>THY face shalt thou eat bread till thou </v>
<v Speaker 3>return unto the ground for out of it,</v>

1823
01:40:23.070 --> 01:40:25.620
<v Speaker 3>West thou taken for Dusko Art and unto </v>
<v Speaker 3>dust,</v>

1824
01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:28.740
<v Speaker 3>thou shall return pretty damn dismal.</v>

1825
01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:29.753
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the women get knocked really hard to </v>

1826
01:40:30.781 --> 01:40:31.614
<v Speaker 3>begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like the men get away Scot </v>

1827
01:40:33.091 --> 01:40:33.924
<v Speaker 3>free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically that the statement of the </v>

1828
01:40:37.441 --> 01:40:38.274
<v Speaker 3>consequence of the emergence of self </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is that men are doomed to </v>

1829
01:40:42.961 --> 01:40:43.794
<v Speaker 3>toil their entire life and then to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also think that that's not </v>

1830
01:40:47.491 --> 01:40:51.480
<v Speaker 3>something that characterizes any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal because human beings work.</v>

1831
01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:52.973
<v Speaker 3>And the reason we work is because we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious of the future and we're </v>

1832
01:40:55.241 --> 01:40:58.360
<v Speaker 3>conscious of all the potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophes the future can bring,</v>

1833
01:40:58.450 --> 01:41:00.520
<v Speaker 3>including the catastrophes for our </v>
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

1834
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.863
<v Speaker 3>And so the consequence of that is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of being directly immersed in </v>

1835
01:41:04.841 --> 01:41:05.674
<v Speaker 3>the pleasures of the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people always have to forego those </v>

1836
01:41:09.131 --> 01:41:09.964
<v Speaker 3>pleasures to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stave off the potential array of </v>

1837
01:41:12.761 --> 01:41:16.270
<v Speaker 3>future catastrophes that were firmly </v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of because we're self conscious.</v>

1838
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:19.380
<v Speaker 3>And so that's when history starts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1839
01:41:19.381 --> 01:41:20.214
<v Speaker 3>and the fundamentalist say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the world began when God created </v>

1840
01:41:23.171 --> 01:41:24.610
<v Speaker 3>the world after seven days.</v>

1841
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:25.443
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the funny thing is is that there's </v>

1842
01:41:26.591 --> 01:41:27.424
<v Speaker 3>an element of that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>History does not begin until human </v>

1843
01:41:30.731 --> 01:41:35.530
<v Speaker 3>beings become self conscious before that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's mere unconscious animal existence.</v>

1844
01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:36.933
<v Speaker 3>And so to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the emergence of self consciousness is </v>

1845
01:41:38.831 --> 01:41:42.820
<v Speaker 3>the beginning of the being that we would</v>
<v Speaker 3>consider specifically human being.</v>

1846
01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.433
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and exactly what that means on a cosmic </v>

1847
01:41:46.031 --> 01:41:49.180
<v Speaker 3>level is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one can be certain of that because we</v>

1848
01:41:49.181 --> 01:41:51.940
<v Speaker 3>don't understand the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>between consciousness.</v>

1849
01:41:51.941 --> 01:41:52.774
<v Speaker 3>And being so on one the one end you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of us as occupying some little </v>

1850
01:41:55.991 --> 01:41:56.824
<v Speaker 3>speck of dust at the corner of some </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrelevant galaxy and an infinite </v>

1851
01:41:59.711 --> 01:42:02.050
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But by the same token,</v>

1852
01:42:02.051 --> 01:42:02.884
<v Speaker 3>we're also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the only place that we know of </v>

1853
01:42:04.241 --> 01:42:08.320
<v Speaker 3>where consciousness exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if consciousness is,</v>

1854
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:10.960
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if being is dependent on consciousness,</v>

1855
01:42:10.961 --> 01:42:13.510
<v Speaker 3>and I think that you can make a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong case that it is,</v>

1856
01:42:13.511 --> 01:42:14.344
<v Speaker 3>then there's no reason to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't the center of things despite </v>

1857
01:42:17.981 --> 01:42:19.000
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1858
01:42:19.001 --> 01:42:22.390
<v Speaker 3>despite our reinterpretation of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the last 300 years.</v>

1859
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:28.703
<v Speaker 3>So the god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore the Lord God sent him forth </v>

1860
01:42:30.841 --> 01:42:33.720
<v Speaker 3>from the garden of Eden to till the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground from whence he was taken.</v>

1861
01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:38.190
<v Speaker 3>So we drove out the man and placed at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims</v>

1862
01:42:38.191 --> 01:42:39.024
<v Speaker 3>and a flaming sword,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which turned every way to keep the way </v>

1863
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:43.710
<v Speaker 3>of the tree of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no going back.</v>

1864
01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:45.353
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because one of the classic </v>

1865
01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:51.800
<v Speaker 3>Shamonic mythologies is the attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to get the tree of life,</v>

1866
01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:55.350
<v Speaker 3>to get the fruit of the tree of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can see that in Gilgamesh,</v>

1867
01:42:55.351 --> 01:42:56.184
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a story that's either an older </v>

1868
01:42:57.961 --> 01:42:58.794
<v Speaker 3>than the Enuma elish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Gilgamesh goes to the bottom of the </v>

1869
01:43:01.621 --> 01:43:04.200
<v Speaker 3>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he goes to the bottom of being itself</v>

1870
01:43:04.201 --> 01:43:08.670
<v Speaker 3>in one of his heroic ventures to grab </v>
<v Speaker 3>the herb of immortality,</v>

1871
01:43:08.671 --> 01:43:09.504
<v Speaker 3>but he loses it on the way up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's an idea in the shamanic </v>

1872
01:43:12.871 --> 01:43:16.260
<v Speaker 3>traditions that when the [inaudible] are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going up and down the tree of life,</v>

1873
01:43:16.261 --> 01:43:17.094
<v Speaker 3>that one of the things they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do is to go into this heavenly realm to </v>

1874
01:43:20.191 --> 01:43:23.970
<v Speaker 3>bring back that which will confer </v>
<v Speaker 3>immortality upon people.</v>

1875
01:43:23.971 --> 01:43:24.804
<v Speaker 3>But there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one has been successful at doing </v>

1876
01:43:26.821 --> 01:43:28.350
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a very,</v>

1877
01:43:28.351 --> 01:43:31.560
<v Speaker 3>very widespread story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's also something to it.</v>

1878
01:43:31.890 --> 01:43:32.723
<v Speaker 3>Something I don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something about it that's </v>

1879
01:43:34.651 --> 01:43:35.484
<v Speaker 3>accurate.</v>

1880
01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:46.320
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1881
01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:52.630
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1882
01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:57.673
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1883
01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the story,</v>

1884
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:05.520
<v Speaker 2>the story suggests that there's is a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>of obtaining it,</v>

1885
01:44:05.521 --> 01:44:09.570
<v Speaker 2>mortality that people have been able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>voyage to but not to bring back.</v>

1886
01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:11.753
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a failed hero story happens </v>

1887
01:44:13.021 --> 01:44:13.854
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the person who goes to fight </v>

1888
01:44:16.261 --> 01:44:17.094
<v Speaker 2>with the dragon to get the goal but </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't bring the gold back or ends up </v>

1889
01:44:19.441 --> 01:44:22.380
<v Speaker 2>inside the dragons belly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a failed hero story.</v>

1890
01:44:22.770 --> 01:44:23.970
<v Speaker 2>And Gilgamesh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1891
01:44:23.971 --> 01:44:28.080
<v Speaker 2>is a failed hero's story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the story is,</v>

1892
01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:29.033
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that happens in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity is that there's a twist in </v>

1893
01:44:32.041 --> 01:44:37.041
<v Speaker 2>the failed hero story because Christ </v>
<v Speaker 2>dies and then comes back.</v>

1894
01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:38.933
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this idea in Christianity that </v>

1895
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.120
<v Speaker 2>voluntary death solves the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

1896
01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:50.160
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1897
01:44:54.210 --> 01:44:58.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's an or question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an end question.</v>

1898
01:44:59.430 --> 01:45:00.263
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that it requires both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't exactly know what that </v>

1899
01:45:04.471 --> 01:45:05.304
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

1900
01:45:06.190 --> 01:45:06.730
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1901
01:45:06.730 --> 01:45:08.390
<v Speaker 2>So like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1902
01:45:08.410 --> 01:45:09.243
<v Speaker 2>there's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a very old idea that the way </v>

1903
01:45:11.201 --> 01:45:12.034
<v Speaker 2>to overcome death is to accept it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't exactly clear what except </v>

1904
01:45:16.331 --> 01:45:17.164
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it means to accept it on a </v>

1905
01:45:18.931 --> 01:45:20.840
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say,</v>

1906
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:24.680
<v Speaker 2>to not deny the validity of being merely</v>
<v Speaker 2>because your finite.</v>

1907
01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.473
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think that's all it means </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think most of these stories </v>

1908
01:45:29.361 --> 01:45:30.194
<v Speaker 2>have a reality that plays itself out at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of the material reality that </v>

1909
01:45:33.921 --> 01:45:35.870
<v Speaker 2>we're familiar with and day to day </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>

1910
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:36.883
<v Speaker 2>And if the metaphysical plane at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same time at that somehow those are the </v>

1911
01:45:40.281 --> 01:45:41.114
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's in some way that we don't </v>

1912
01:45:42.531 --> 01:45:43.364
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've had strong intimations that </v>

1913
01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:49.040
<v Speaker 2>death is partly a repair mechanism.</v>

1914
01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:51.753
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1915
01:45:52.230 --> 01:45:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of the things that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen when you go to sleep at night,</v>

1916
01:45:55.121 --> 01:45:56.020
<v Speaker 2>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1917
01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:59.320
<v Speaker 2>that's something that that brings you </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to death.</v>

1918
01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Your consciousness certainly disappears </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the deeper you go into sleep,</v>

1919
01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:04.593
<v Speaker 2>it's only in the deepest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deepest stages of sleep that your body </v>

1920
01:46:07.211 --> 01:46:10.810
<v Speaker 2>produces human growth hormone and does </v>
<v Speaker 2>the repairs that are necessary.</v>

1921
01:46:11.110 --> 01:46:11.943
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to become extraordinarily </v>

1922
01:46:13.661 --> 01:46:18.661
<v Speaker 2>relaxed and let go of everything in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to enter a physiological condition</v>

1923
01:46:18.971 --> 01:46:19.804
<v Speaker 2>where you can be optimally restructured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know how deep you can go </v>

1924
01:46:24.041 --> 01:46:24.874
<v Speaker 2>into that.</v>

1925
01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:29.980
<v Speaker 4>There seems to be a diametric opposition</v>
<v Speaker 4>analysis,</v>

1926
01:46:30.610 --> 01:46:31.443
<v Speaker 4>mystical realm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So perhaps definitely one that needs to </v>

1927
01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:36.873
<v Speaker 4>emerge.</v>

1928
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:38.151
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it served.</v>

1929
01:46:38.151 --> 01:46:40.040
<v Speaker 2>That certainly does happen when you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sleep.</v>

1930
01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:41.293
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you leave the realm of normal day to </v>

1931
01:46:43.190 --> 01:46:44.023
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual wakefulness and you descend </v>

1932
01:46:46.911 --> 01:46:50.250
<v Speaker 2>into a realm of fantasy and,</v>

1933
01:46:50.630 --> 01:46:52.930
<v Speaker 3>and immobility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's,</v>

1934
01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:53.790
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1935
01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:58.710
<v Speaker 3>there's a sick click interconnection </v>
<v Speaker 3>between those two states of being,</v>

1936
01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:00.293
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's certainly the case that when </v>

1937
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:02.783
<v Speaker 3>people become unhealthy that their sleep</v>
<v Speaker 3>wake cycles become tremendously </v>

1938
01:47:07.681 --> 01:47:08.514
<v Speaker 3>disrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't sleep properly anymore and </v>

1939
01:47:09.781 --> 01:47:12.090
<v Speaker 3>then they really start to age and </v>
<v Speaker 3>disintegrate.</v>

1940
01:47:12.930 --> 01:47:17.930
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1941
01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:20.430
<v Speaker 3>so that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I want to tell you this,</v>

1942
01:47:20.431 --> 01:47:22.140
<v Speaker 3>Cain and Abel Story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1943
01:47:22.141 --> 01:47:22.974
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1944
01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:26.593
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

1945
01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:40.771
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1946
01:47:40.771 --> 01:47:42.900
<v Speaker 3>when I placed these talks on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet,</v>

1947
01:47:42.901 --> 01:47:45.870
<v Speaker 3>people will criticize them and say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm stretching,</v>

1948
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:48.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm attempting to,</v>

1949
01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:53.900
<v Speaker 3>to use scientific evidence to justify </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality of these stories.</v>

1950
01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:57.090
<v Speaker 3>So I don't mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that is what I'm trying to</v>

1951
01:47:57.091 --> 01:47:57.924
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what I'm trying to do is to </v>

1952
01:47:58.501 --> 01:48:00.570
<v Speaker 3>figure out what the hell these stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>

1953
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:03.420
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

1954
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:04.583
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1955
01:48:04.710 --> 01:48:07.620
<v Speaker 3>isomorphism is there is because these </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories are true.</v>

1956
01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:10.950
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think we know what that </v>
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>

1957
01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:14.673
<v Speaker 4>So would you expect this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly this one or maybe if we </v>

1958
01:48:18.101 --> 01:48:19.160
<v Speaker 4>look closer at,</v>

1959
01:48:24.730 --> 01:48:27.430
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that the story,</v>

1960
01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:31.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We missed a lecture unfortunately.</v>

1961
01:48:31.541 --> 01:48:34.990
<v Speaker 3>But what are the stories I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you is the story of Buddha.</v>

1962
01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:37.113
<v Speaker 3>The Buddhist story is exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>story as the story in genesis plus the </v>

1963
01:48:41.561 --> 01:48:44.500
<v Speaker 3>story of the reincarnation of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the resurrection of Christ.</v>

1964
01:48:44.590 --> 01:48:48.490
<v Speaker 3>It's the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Buddha obtains enlightenment under a</v>

1965
01:48:48.491 --> 01:48:50.140
<v Speaker 3>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1966
01:48:50.141 --> 01:48:52.950
<v Speaker 3>Christ attains enlightenment on a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1967
01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:57.960
<v Speaker 3>the tree that Christ attains a </v>
<v Speaker 3>resurrection on is the tree of life.</v>

1968
01:48:59.230 --> 01:49:02.410
<v Speaker 3>And it's the tree that grows out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place where Adam died.</v>

1969
01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:03.900
<v Speaker 3>So that's part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1970
01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:08.110
<v Speaker 3>the story that this association </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with Christian symbolism.</v>

1971
01:49:08.710 --> 01:49:11.590
<v Speaker 3>If you look at Greek Orthodox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian Orthodox,</v>

1972
01:49:11.591 --> 01:49:15.820
<v Speaker 3>crucifixions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crucifix is always got Adam Skull at</v>

1973
01:49:15.821 --> 01:49:17.680
<v Speaker 3>the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Adam dies.</v>

1974
01:49:17.681 --> 01:49:21.790
<v Speaker 3>And what Christ represents is the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that transcends that death and that,</v>

1975
01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:22.793
<v Speaker 3>and this is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the ideas that's nested </v>

1976
01:49:25.841 --> 01:49:27.880
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is the prime idea,</v>

1977
01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.930
<v Speaker 3>is that you can overcome death if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can accept it voluntarily,</v>

1978
01:49:32.710 --> 01:49:35.950
<v Speaker 3>if you can embrace it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can see it as a necessary part of</v>

1979
01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:36.813
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can detach from it your </v>

1980
01:49:38.201 --> 01:49:40.750
<v Speaker 3>presupposition that it's only evil and </v>
<v Speaker 3>destructive.</v>

1981
01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:44.500
<v Speaker 3>And so now that's a hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1982
01:49:44.530 --> 01:49:46.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1983
01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:51.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things you got to ask</v>

1984
01:49:51.831 --> 01:49:52.970
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1985
01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:57.870
<v Speaker 3>you can say that existence is </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaninglessness,</v>

1986
01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:59.170
<v Speaker 3>meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that,</v>

1987
01:49:59.171 --> 01:50:02.640
<v Speaker 3>that we're in a clockwork world in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Newtonian world,</v>

1988
01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:03.713
<v Speaker 3>which we're clearly not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you could except the Newtonian </v>

1989
01:50:06.001 --> 01:50:06.834
<v Speaker 3>worldview that we're in a mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe and that things unfolded and </v>

1990
01:50:10.771 --> 01:50:14.100
<v Speaker 3>mechanical and deterministic way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness has empathy.</v>

1991
01:50:14.101 --> 01:50:15.780
<v Speaker 3>Phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you're done,</v>

1992
01:50:15.781 --> 01:50:16.770
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>

1993
01:50:16.771 --> 01:50:17.604
<v Speaker 3>And this is all a consequence of random,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of randomness laying itself out across </v>

1994
01:50:21.151 --> 01:50:22.710
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>randomness and causality.</v>

1995
01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:27.000
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's powerful reasons for looking</v>

1996
01:50:27.001 --> 01:50:28.950
<v Speaker 3>at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are,</v>

1997
01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:31.470
<v Speaker 3>there are consequences to looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

1998
01:50:31.471 --> 01:50:32.304
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do not know that that's true and we </v>

1999
01:50:34.351 --> 01:50:36.510
<v Speaker 3>certainly know that the world is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>deterministic.</v>

2000
01:50:36.750 --> 01:50:37.583
<v Speaker 3>And we certainly understand that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>were plenty of processes at play that </v>

2001
01:50:39.811 --> 01:50:43.470
<v Speaker 3>are not random.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sexual selection is not random.</v>

2002
01:50:45.010 --> 01:50:47.680
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sexual selection,</v>

2003
01:50:47.681 --> 01:50:51.490
<v Speaker 3>it's the reason we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they we are is because of sexual</v>

2004
01:50:51.491 --> 01:50:52.324
<v Speaker 3>selection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've made conscious decisions the </v>

2005
01:50:54.641 --> 01:50:56.500
<v Speaker 3>entire way about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2006
01:50:56.590 --> 01:51:00.490
<v Speaker 3>what elements of human forms should </v>
<v Speaker 3>propagate themselves into the future.</v>

2007
01:51:00.970 --> 01:51:01.480
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nino,</v>

2008
01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:06.280
<v Speaker 3>nobody seems to take the metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 3>implications of that seriously.</v>

2009
01:51:06.281 --> 01:51:08.500
<v Speaker 3>And basically what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darwin was,</v>

2010
01:51:08.770 --> 01:51:09.603
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was extremely impressed by the power of </v>

2011
01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:12.664
<v Speaker 3>sexual selection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because people couldn't handle the </v>

2012
01:51:15.251 --> 01:51:17.830
<v Speaker 3>notion that evolution was shaped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2013
01:51:17.831 --> 01:51:18.664
<v Speaker 3>in large part by female choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biologist ignored sexual selection </v>

2014
01:51:22.241 --> 01:51:25.370
<v Speaker 3>for 100 years after Darwin published,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2015
01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:27.700
<v Speaker 3>hip published his great work on </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution.</v>

2016
01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:31.390
<v Speaker 3>It's only recently that people have been</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to take the sort of thing seriously</v>

2017
01:51:31.391 --> 01:51:34.330
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we also don't understand epigenetics</v>

2018
01:51:34.331 --> 01:51:35.580
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2019
01:51:35.581 --> 01:51:36.414
<v Speaker 3>over the epigenetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's obvious that our own experiences </v>

2020
01:51:39.461 --> 01:51:40.294
<v Speaker 3>can modify our genetic structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that we don't </v>

2021
01:51:42.611 --> 01:51:44.160
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2022
01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:46.660
<v Speaker 3>there's some animations and I'll send </v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys the link to this,</v>

2023
01:51:46.661 --> 01:51:49.000
<v Speaker 3>but I saw some amazing animations in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>recent,</v>

2024
01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:52.540
<v Speaker 3>in the last couple of weeks showing how </v>
<v Speaker 3>DNA,</v>

2025
01:51:52.710 --> 01:51:55.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2026
01:51:55.180 --> 01:51:58.870
<v Speaker 3>separates and then reassembles during </v>
<v Speaker 3>cell division.</v>

2027
01:51:59.530 --> 01:52:00.363
<v Speaker 3>And so they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've modeled this at the molecular </v>

2028
01:52:02.621 --> 01:52:05.750
<v Speaker 3>level using x Ray crystallography.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you could,</v>

2029
01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:08.740
<v Speaker 3>it's unbelievable what's going on down </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the ad level.</v>

2030
01:52:08.770 --> 01:52:09.603
<v Speaker 3>Basically what you see is there's these </v>
<v Speaker 3>little machines that are made out of </v>

2031
01:52:12.251 --> 01:52:16.300
<v Speaker 3>molecules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like single molecules that have arms and</v>

2032
01:52:16.301 --> 01:52:19.840
<v Speaker 3>legs that walk around and move things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and put things together.</v>

2033
01:52:19.870 --> 01:52:23.350
<v Speaker 3>Like you look at it down there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think that's computational.</v>

2034
01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:24.453
<v Speaker 3>Those bloody things are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think their quantum super computers </v>

2035
01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:30.130
<v Speaker 3>operating at that level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause those goddamn things are smart.</v>

2036
01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:32.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there are these little machines,</v>

2037
01:52:32.051 --> 01:52:32.884
<v Speaker 3>they pull dna apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they loop it around and cut it and </v>

2038
01:52:35.891 --> 01:52:36.724
<v Speaker 3>they send the loops often at the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>time as the DNA separates and it has to </v>

2039
01:52:39.971 --> 01:52:40.804
<v Speaker 3>be remade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These things are grabbing molecules as </v>

2040
01:52:42.791 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 3>they come by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally mechanically and sticking</v>

2041
01:52:46.041 --> 01:52:49.700
<v Speaker 3>them on the DNA chain and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2042
01:52:49.730 --> 01:52:52.760
<v Speaker 3>it's so computational that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's mind boggling.</v>

2043
01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:54.770
<v Speaker 3>I'll send you the links.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I looked at that.</v>

2044
01:52:54.771 --> 01:52:56.720
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just blew me away.</v>

2045
01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:57.973
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we have no idea what kind of </v>

2046
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.863
<v Speaker 3>computational processes are available at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the micro scale that we do know that </v>

2047
01:53:03.141 --> 01:53:05.810
<v Speaker 3>quantum computation as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2048
01:53:05.811 --> 01:53:09.200
<v Speaker 3>that means that computation can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>occurring in,</v>

2049
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:11.450
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it with extreme power,</v>

2050
01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:14.270
<v Speaker 3>at levels of resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would have never imagined possible.</v>

2051
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:18.470
<v Speaker 3>But I can tell you look at those bloody </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos and you look at them with a fresh</v>

2052
01:53:18.471 --> 01:53:19.304
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that what's happening down at </v>

2053
01:53:20.871 --> 01:53:25.220
<v Speaker 3>the molecular level is it the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not intelligent is insane.</v>

2054
01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:28.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean those bloody things or making </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions,</v>

2055
01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:29.053
<v Speaker 3>it's not deterministic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's way too complicated to be </v>

2056
01:53:31.071 --> 01:53:31.904
<v Speaker 3>deterministic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looks more like a car factory or </v>

2057
01:53:34.251 --> 01:53:39.251
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible molecules,</v>

2058
01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:47.440
<v Speaker 3>single molecules like sometimes a five </v>
<v Speaker 3>or six Adams.</v>

2059
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:49.663
<v Speaker 3>So there's like the one things that when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're making the telomeres that pull </v>

2060
01:53:52.281 --> 01:53:55.940
<v Speaker 3>the DNA apart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like whip out these telomeres which</v>

2061
01:53:55.941 --> 01:54:00.020
<v Speaker 3>are made out of four molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kind of make a square that extends,</v>

2062
01:54:00.530 --> 01:54:03.590
<v Speaker 3>there's little gadgets that are putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>those together and then when they've got</v>

2063
01:54:03.591 --> 01:54:07.280
<v Speaker 3>them all done and they need to signal </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that they were finished,</v>

2064
01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:10.130
<v Speaker 3>these other little molecules that look </v>
<v Speaker 3>like little stick man,</v>

2065
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:11.383
<v Speaker 3>they grab a molecule and they walked </v>
<v Speaker 3>down the telomeres like one foot after </v>

2066
01:54:16.071 --> 01:54:19.310
<v Speaker 3>another carrying this thing that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be the message.</v>

2067
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:21.560
<v Speaker 3>It's it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could show it to you.</v>

2068
01:54:21.561 --> 01:54:22.394
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like just make your jaw drop and </v>

2069
01:54:25.011 --> 01:54:25.844
<v Speaker 3>it's intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way that that's bierly </v>

2070
01:54:27.771 --> 01:54:28.604
<v Speaker 3>deterministic nor a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus those bloody things can fix </v>

2071
01:54:31.611 --> 01:54:32.444
<v Speaker 3>mistakes in DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because your cells are repairing </v>

2072
01:54:35.761 --> 01:54:37.470
<v Speaker 3>mistakes in Dna all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2073
01:54:37.471 --> 01:54:38.790
<v Speaker 3>well how do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2074
01:54:38.791 --> 01:54:40.260
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you bought a limit,</v>

2075
01:54:40.261 --> 01:54:42.330
<v Speaker 3>looks like they look at it and look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2076
01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:43.193
<v Speaker 3>whatever the hell that means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're evaluating it to see where </v>

2077
01:54:45.571 --> 01:54:47.850
<v Speaker 3>there's a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

2078
01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:50.360
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2079
01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:53.240
<v Speaker 3>it's like their little robots that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing diagnostics.</v>

2080
01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Diagnostics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2081
01:54:55.410 --> 01:54:57.510
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all right.</v>

2082
01:54:57.511 --> 01:54:58.261
<v Speaker 3>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2083
01:54:58.261 --> 01:55:00.420
<v Speaker 3>so what happens after Adam and eve?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2084
01:55:00.450 --> 01:55:01.283
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2085
01:55:03.530 --> 01:55:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's have a short break.</v>

2086
01:55:04.791 --> 01:55:05.624
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only let's do it for five minutes </v>

2087
01:55:06.591 --> 01:55:09.530
<v Speaker 3>because I really want to finish this </v>
<v Speaker 3>part before we end.</v>

2088
01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:14.240
<v Speaker 3>So while you're gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you this.</v>

2089
01:55:14.241 --> 01:55:15.074
<v Speaker 3>I'll find this animation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys can come up here and take a </v>

2090
01:55:16.761 --> 01:55:18.410
<v Speaker 3>look at it cause it's mind boggling.</v>
