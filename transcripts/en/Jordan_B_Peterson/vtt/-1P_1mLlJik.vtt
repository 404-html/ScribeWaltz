1
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:51.790
<v Speaker 1>it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

3
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:06.380
<v Speaker 1>ha</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha ha,</v>

4
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:53.343
<v Speaker 2>please reasonable opposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's best to let the unreasonable </v>

5
00:23:57.311 --> 00:23:58.144
<v Speaker 2>opposition speak because they manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves as unreasonable and then </v>

6
00:24:02.771 --> 00:24:03.604
<v Speaker 2>everyone can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of the reason that you </v>

7
00:24:06.041 --> 00:24:08.830
<v Speaker 2>want free speech because you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

8
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

9
00:24:15.511 --> 00:24:16.800
<v Speaker 2>at least the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back</v>

10
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.190
<v Speaker 2>leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Peterson.</v>

11
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.080
<v Speaker 2>No one's security can't help no matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>what their job,</v>

12
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.120
<v Speaker 2>no matter what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wrong.</v>

13
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.050
<v Speaker 2>They're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause trouble for any students,</v>

14
00:24:40.051 --> 00:24:42.040
<v Speaker 2>no matter who the students are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing</v>

15
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.373
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just about horse take care of </v>

16
00:24:58.561 --> 00:25:01.160
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

17
00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:06.170
<v Speaker 2>so I can tell you a little bit about why</v>
<v Speaker 2>I opposed to build seasick and there's a</v>

18
00:25:08.491 --> 00:25:11.300
<v Speaker 2>variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the most,</v>

19
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.633
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the first piece of Canadian </v>

20
00:25:14.671 --> 00:25:15.504
<v Speaker 2>legislation that's ever been put forward</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually requires people to use the </v>

21
00:25:19.561 --> 00:25:24.060
<v Speaker 2>particular center works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there is other legislation that does</v>

22
00:25:24.061 --> 00:25:26.040
<v Speaker 2>govern to some degree what you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

23
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.003
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't incite and crime and that's </v>

24
00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.700
<v Speaker 2>perfectly logical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable restriction on free speech,</v>

25
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:33.563
<v Speaker 2>but we've never had a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation ever that would require you </v>

26
00:25:36.241 --> 00:25:37.074
<v Speaker 2>to use a certain kind of vocabulary and </v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of what it is and the fact </v>

27
00:25:41.221 --> 00:25:44.910
<v Speaker 2>that it happens to be about </v>
<v Speaker 2>transgendered terminology hypothetically</v>

28
00:25:44.911 --> 00:25:47.190
<v Speaker 2>is almost beside the point as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>

29
00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.570
<v Speaker 2>it's all focused on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a focused,</v>

30
00:25:50.571 --> 00:25:54.390
<v Speaker 2>on this particular issue to focus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>some issue,</v>

31
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.360
<v Speaker 2>but this isn't the issue that's at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom of it.</v>

32
00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:58.523
<v Speaker 2>It's just that complex things manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves in very particular locations </v>

33
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:06.090
<v Speaker 2>and this just happens to be the location</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is manifesting itself here.</v>

34
00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.653
<v Speaker 2>Now the other thing that I really didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it still don't like about bill cc </v>

35
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.993
<v Speaker 2>is the surrounding policies that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically part of what it's embedded in </v>

36
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.300
<v Speaker 2>that were produced by the Ontario Human </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rights Commission,</v>

37
00:26:18.301 --> 00:26:20.980
<v Speaker 2>which I think is an appallingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous organization,</v>

38
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:24.000
<v Speaker 2>not at least because they're terribly </v>
<v Speaker 2>muddy thinkers.</v>

39
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.460
<v Speaker 2>One of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's happened,</v>

40
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.560
<v Speaker 2>but I think from a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

41
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.710
<v Speaker 2>is there anyone terrio soon likely in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>

42
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.280
<v Speaker 2>We're going to write into law an idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>

43
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.230
<v Speaker 2>It's just radically insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me give you some examples.</v>

44
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:49.770
<v Speaker 2>So the way that bill see 16 is currently</v>
<v Speaker 2>coordinated.</v>

45
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 2>If you take into account the surrounding</v>
<v Speaker 2>policy documents,</v>

46
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.573
<v Speaker 2>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a proposition embedded in the </v>

47
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:59.820
<v Speaker 2>law and that is that biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender identity,</v>

48
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.833
<v Speaker 2>gender expression and sexual preference </v>
<v Speaker 2>vary independently and the fact of the </v>

49
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 2>matter is that's not true and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrate it very straightforwardly.</v>

50
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.563
<v Speaker 2>The first thing you observed is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually everyone whose biological sex </v>

51
00:27:16.141 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 2>is either male or female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a gender identity of male or female.</v>

52
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:21.583
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the the people who go into that </v>

53
00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:26.820
<v Speaker 2>category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they exist.</v>

54
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.290
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're very small minority.</v>

55
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:30.803
<v Speaker 2>The reason I'm pointing out with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>minority because makes the claim that </v>

56
00:27:35.191 --> 00:27:36.024
<v Speaker 2>those things very independently</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you know to that most of the </v>

57
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:41.094
<v Speaker 2>people who have a binary biological sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the binary gender identity also </v>

58
00:27:47.401 --> 00:27:48.234
<v Speaker 2>present themselves in a manner that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same as their gender identity in </v>

59
00:27:51.851 --> 00:27:52.684
<v Speaker 2>their biological sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's another indication of the </v>

60
00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:58.470
<v Speaker 2>non independence of the three layers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>purported identity.</v>

61
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.543
<v Speaker 2>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see too that the vast majority </v>

62
00:28:01.801 --> 00:28:03.000
<v Speaker 2>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

63
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:03.983
<v Speaker 2>men who are biologically male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who present themselves as male or who </v>

64
00:28:07.531 --> 00:28:09.720
<v Speaker 2>identify as male present themselves at </v>
<v Speaker 2>male,</v>

65
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:10.703
<v Speaker 2>are also heterosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety five percent of the perhaps 98 </v>

66
00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:15.880
<v Speaker 2>percent of them depends on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics,</v>

67
00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:25.920
<v Speaker 2>but we don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

68
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:32.570
<v Speaker 2>That event now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he is on top</v>

69
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.233
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason that I think that this is a </v>

70
00:28:41.881 --> 00:28:42.714
<v Speaker 2>problem is because it's written into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>law and the law isn't the place where </v>

71
00:28:46.051 --> 00:28:47.340
<v Speaker 2>you debate those sorts of things.</v>

72
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't instantiate a particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy into the law,</v>

73
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.340
<v Speaker 2>especially one that's predicated on what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's.</v>

74
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.930
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely incoherent and not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

75
00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.793
<v Speaker 2>like even if you're thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the perspective of someone say </v>

76
00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.970
<v Speaker 2>who's who's homosexual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the arguments that people who are</v>

77
00:29:05.971 --> 00:29:06.804
<v Speaker 2>gay very frequently used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's actually the biological </v>

78
00:29:09.511 --> 00:29:13.410
<v Speaker 2>underpinning to their homosexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're going to dispense with that,</v>

79
00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:15.660
<v Speaker 2>but what happens if we dispense with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

80
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:17.323
<v Speaker 2>What happens if we dispense with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that there's a biological </v>

81
00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:23.400
<v Speaker 2>underpinnings of homosexuality that mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it can just be changed and what are</v>

82
00:29:23.401 --> 00:29:26.910
<v Speaker 2>people gonna do with that piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information except trying to change it.</v>

83
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:28.643
<v Speaker 2>The people who are who've been fighting </v>
<v Speaker 2>for homosexual rights for the last 30 </v>

84
00:29:31.681 --> 00:29:32.514
<v Speaker 2>years very frequently made the case that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that the rights were </v>

85
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:38.460
<v Speaker 2>necessary was because there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality to the condition.</v>

86
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not arguing for that or against it.</v>

87
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:44.710
<v Speaker 2>What saying is that the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it's currently constituted makes</v>

88
00:29:44.711 --> 00:29:45.544
<v Speaker 2>arguments like that completely invalid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does the same thing with </v>

89
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:51.590
<v Speaker 2>transsexuality and which are we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know enough about to.</v>

90
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.730
<v Speaker 2>We don't know enough about it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine,</v>

91
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.350
<v Speaker 2>say it's its manner of causal origins </v>
<v Speaker 2>now it looks to me like,</v>

92
00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:58.403
<v Speaker 2>like I think it's premature to exclude a</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological component and especially </v>

93
00:30:02.321 --> 00:30:03.154
<v Speaker 2>because of what we know about how gender</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity and biological sex are </v>

94
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:08.000
<v Speaker 2>instantiated in utero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we know</v>

95
00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:09.820
<v Speaker 3>it's an apple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

96
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:16.580
<v Speaker 3>the standard human fetus has a female </v>
<v Speaker 3>morphology.</v>

97
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.753
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter whether take six weeks</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it's transformed into a male </v>

98
00:30:23.511 --> 00:30:28.010
<v Speaker 3>morphology</v>
<v Speaker 3>with testosterone.</v>

99
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:30.580
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

100
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:36.610
<v Speaker 3>the reason I tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

101
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:41.870
<v Speaker 3>save your breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got all night.</v>

102
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.660
<v Speaker 3>The reason that I'm telling you this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because</v>

103
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.673
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason whatsoever you can </v>

104
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.753
<v Speaker 3>presume that the laws are being put in </v>
<v Speaker 3>place to protect the people that these </v>

105
00:31:10.131 --> 00:31:14.280
<v Speaker 3>laws are supposed to protect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that remotely</v>

106
00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.690
<v Speaker 3>and as I mentioned when we were in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hall,</v>

107
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.910
<v Speaker 3>talk to you about the letters that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>received from sexual abuse,</v>

108
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:24.663
<v Speaker 3>terrifying about all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of them don't want to </v>

109
00:31:27.861 --> 00:31:30.860
<v Speaker 3>be as invisible as everyone else wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>

110
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Noisily</v>
<v Speaker 3>by people who want to speak for them.</v>

111
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.193
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we really have to get </v>

112
00:31:48.441 --> 00:31:53.441
<v Speaker 3>over in a serious idea that just because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking to someone black or white</v>

113
00:31:54.141 --> 00:31:54.974
<v Speaker 3>or color,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a member of a homogenous try and </v>

114
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:01.663
<v Speaker 3>get the opinion that they happened to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the opinion that all those who are </v>

115
00:32:04.401 --> 00:32:05.234
<v Speaker 3>like them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing that's more racist than </v>

116
00:32:08.871 --> 00:32:09.704
<v Speaker 3>that assumption</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can predict everything that you </v>

117
00:32:18.531 --> 00:32:19.364
<v Speaker 3>are and everything that you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of terrible thing to believe and </v>

118
00:32:22.761 --> 00:32:24.530
<v Speaker 3>it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patently untrue.</v>

119
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:25.803
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason to assume that any </v>

120
00:32:27.501 --> 00:32:28.334
<v Speaker 3>group of people who don't fit into </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional society for some rea or any </v>

121
00:32:32.841 --> 00:32:33.674
<v Speaker 3>more homogenous in their general makeup </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your political views than any other </v>

122
00:32:37.611 --> 00:32:38.700
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

123
00:32:38.701 --> 00:32:42.760
<v Speaker 3>all evidence suggests precisely</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

124
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.610
<v Speaker 3>Another thing I really don't like about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

125
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:55.003
<v Speaker 3>Talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about why it's important to be able to </v>

126
00:33:09.601 --> 00:33:14.601
<v Speaker 3>have this discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

127
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:19.310
<v Speaker 3>I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you</v>

128
00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.693
<v Speaker 3>these</v>
<v Speaker 3>tends to shut people down or being made </v>

129
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.660
<v Speaker 3>because you need to know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

130
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 3>as far as I've been able to determine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of protest is an expression of</v>

131
00:33:37.121 --> 00:33:40.150
<v Speaker 3>a philosophy that's grounded partly in </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism.</v>

132
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.473
<v Speaker 3>Pardon me and Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The postmodern element is basically </v>

133
00:33:45.191 --> 00:33:46.024
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no such genuine individual </v>

134
00:33:49.411 --> 00:33:50.244
<v Speaker 3>identity is this identity and you liked </v>
<v Speaker 3>it or not only have the interests of </v>

135
00:33:55.661 --> 00:33:56.494
<v Speaker 3>your group and the whole world is </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing but a battle ground between </v>

136
00:34:00.221 --> 00:34:03.070
<v Speaker 3>groups of different interests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no dialogue,</v>

137
00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:08.350
<v Speaker 3>there's no parking between the groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a power stage.</v>

138
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:09.603
<v Speaker 3>Combat has to take place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the reason that speakers with </v>

139
00:34:13.571 --> 00:34:14.404
<v Speaker 3>whom the radical postmodernists and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxists don't agree or deny the </v>

140
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:23.110
<v Speaker 3>platform was because most people do not </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe from a philosophical position.</v>

141
00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:27.400
<v Speaker 3>The dialogue can bring consensus and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's left.</v>

142
00:34:27.401 --> 00:34:32.401
<v Speaker 3>If you forgo that particular principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is only where it start.</v>

143
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.250
<v Speaker 3>You know the fact that you're all pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn setting.</v>

144
00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Thank God for that because if there were</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough fools in the crowd,</v>

145
00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:44.650
<v Speaker 3>especially those who are intent on </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence,</v>

146
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:49.590
<v Speaker 3>this would turn out very differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do not want to go down that pathway.</v>

147
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been down that pathway many,</v>

148
00:34:53.541 --> 00:34:54.374
<v Speaker 3>many years.</v>

149
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:59.623
<v Speaker 3>I would certainly not conformed to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consensus that was against my belief </v>

150
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.770
<v Speaker 3>merely because it was a consensus in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>group is wrong.</v>

151
00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:08.573
<v Speaker 3>The question was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there was a consensus against my </v>

152
00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:11.894
<v Speaker 3>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going with them and answer </v>

153
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.870
<v Speaker 3>that would be well first it would depend</v>
<v Speaker 3>on what my conscience said.</v>

154
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.740
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to assume that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consensus is correct?</v>

155
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.270
<v Speaker 3>The Nazis had a consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

156
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.413
<v Speaker 3>The individual has a conscience and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to know when the group is made a </v>

157
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.173
<v Speaker 3>mistake.</v>

158
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.370
<v Speaker 4>Jordan talked a lot in your personality </v>
<v Speaker 4>clause,</v>

159
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.040
<v Speaker 4>very confronting your shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your shadow.</v>

160
00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.043
<v Speaker 4>Do you find that people who care less </v>
<v Speaker 4>about what other people think and care </v>

161
00:36:00.481 --> 00:36:01.314
<v Speaker 4>more about their conscience have </v>
<v Speaker 4>integrated their shadow maybe more than </v>

162
00:36:03.901 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 4>people who care more about others?</v>

163
00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Can you hear me at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was a question.</v>

164
00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.190
<v Speaker 3>The question wise stemming from my </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality class,</v>

165
00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:21.363
<v Speaker 3>I think that people are willing to abide</v>
<v Speaker 3>by their are those who have integrated </v>

166
00:36:26.711 --> 00:36:27.544
<v Speaker 3>their shadow and I would say yes because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be a bit of a monster to </v>

167
00:36:32.051 --> 00:36:34.210
<v Speaker 3>stand up to the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

168
00:36:34.211 --> 00:36:39.040
<v Speaker 3>If you're too concerned with people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and if you're to avoid conflict,</v>

169
00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:44.460
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to cave to pressure </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you don't want to do that because if</v>

170
00:36:44.531 --> 00:36:47.740
<v Speaker 3>you let people stop you from moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward,</v>

171
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.890
<v Speaker 3>you just end up being something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you have someone who stopped,</v>

172
00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.750
<v Speaker 3>you've got no life in you and that's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

173
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.033
<v Speaker 3>So you have to get tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to give tough in a way </v>

174
00:36:59.561 --> 00:37:01.510
<v Speaker 3>that's controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

175
00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:02.344
<v Speaker 3>It has to be controlled because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise you're the puppet of your </v>

176
00:37:05.501 --> 00:37:08.830
<v Speaker 3>worst impulses and that's a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to be.</v>

177
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.640
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other questions?</v>

178
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:19.403
<v Speaker 3>The question was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we called the police and had them </v>

179
00:37:21.851 --> 00:37:23.650
<v Speaker 3>removed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would've that been a failure?</v>

180
00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:30.450
<v Speaker 3>I think the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason to assume that this is</v>

181
00:37:32.591 --> 00:37:36.790
<v Speaker 3>a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's noisy and it's annoying,</v>

182
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.423
<v Speaker 3>but that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to let things go to follow what </v>

183
00:37:42.341 --> 00:37:46.360
<v Speaker 3>you believe to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about it,</v>

184
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.313
<v Speaker 3>and then let things happen and see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens because it's perfectly possible </v>

185
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.463
<v Speaker 3>that if you're trying to do the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and you're trying to say that </v>

186
00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.120
<v Speaker 3>whatever happens around you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it's a good thing.</v>

187
00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.553
<v Speaker 3>So we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll have weeks after this event to </v>

188
00:38:05.051 --> 00:38:10.051
<v Speaker 3>analyze its consequences and so far all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those of you that are there to listen</v>

189
00:38:10.931 --> 00:38:11.764
<v Speaker 3>to me talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're peaceful and reasonable and you </v>

190
00:38:13.841 --> 00:38:16.780
<v Speaker 3>got a chance to show that to hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of people.</v>

191
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.290
<v Speaker 3>This is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a bad thing.</v>

192
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:30.040
<v Speaker 3>How do we get these people to understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dialogue needs to consensus</v>

193
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.710
<v Speaker 3>cannot make people who don't listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

194
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.830
<v Speaker 3>they have to decide to listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you do that by listening,</v>

195
00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:46.550
<v Speaker 3>engage in dialogue and softened contract</v>
<v Speaker 3>consensus among you.</v>

196
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:50.590
<v Speaker 3>You live by example because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting through this.</v>

197
00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.650
<v Speaker 3>It's an ideological war and the harder </v>
<v Speaker 3>you push against it,</v>

198
00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:59.680
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't.</v>

199
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.910
<v Speaker 3>Don't get pushed around and don't let </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in</v>

200
00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:08.243
<v Speaker 3>doctrinaire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's clearly a liberal left bias on </v>

201
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 3>campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The documentation is very clear.</v>

202
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.760
<v Speaker 3>If you go online and watch Jonathan </v>
<v Speaker 3>Heights' videos,</v>

203
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.950
<v Speaker 3>he explains it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Partly.</v>

204
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.910
<v Speaker 3>The reason for that is that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher in openness.</v>

205
00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:43.810
<v Speaker 3>A trait are more likely to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>university and into academia,</v>

206
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:45.003
<v Speaker 3>so there is some trait reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but over the last 30 years he's become </v>

207
00:39:48.161 --> 00:39:49.590
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmingly left wing.</v>

208
00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.380
<v Speaker 3>Take your club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you're not under the control of</v>

209
00:39:59.381 --> 00:40:02.960
<v Speaker 3>the professors at university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're here to educate yourself.</v>

210
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Some professors will</v>
<v Speaker 3>help</v>

211
00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:23.420
<v Speaker 3>yourself as you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to know about</v>

212
00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:52.240
<v Speaker 3>the peach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't enroll in the</v>

213
00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:02.530
<v Speaker 3>humanities paper</v>
<v Speaker 3>citations.</v>

214
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.940
<v Speaker 3>We also have no idea how widespread this</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of thing is.</v>

215
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:15.220
<v Speaker 3>Maybe two or three percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very tiny minority,</v>

216
00:41:15.221 --> 00:41:17.410
<v Speaker 3>but very well organized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very noisy.</v>

217
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:22.970
<v Speaker 3>So the other thing you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>organize yourself,</v>

218
00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:39.720
<v Speaker 3>you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your damn arguments together,</v>

219
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.160
<v Speaker 3>pushed back</v>
<v Speaker 3>against them.</v>

220
00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:51.390
<v Speaker 3>You're pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's you're</v>

221
00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:01.500
<v Speaker 3>someone who's articulate</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that you learn how to</v>

222
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:17.710
<v Speaker 3>make</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful and that's what universities</v>

223
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.353
<v Speaker 3>articulates.</v>

224
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:38.080
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've made a good idea to let your</v>

225
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.890
<v Speaker 3>questionnaires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened,</v>

226
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.160
<v Speaker 3>guide you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to happen</v>

227
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:59.050
<v Speaker 3>and you want to rely on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to make sure that</v>

228
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:05.000
<v Speaker 3>I</v>
<v Speaker 3>apologize.</v>

229
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.610
<v Speaker 3>You're</v>
<v Speaker 3>speak to you properly.</v>
