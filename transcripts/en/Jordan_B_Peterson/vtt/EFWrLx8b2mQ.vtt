00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.640
<v Speaker 2>Hi everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the September version of my q</v>

3
00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:16.780
<v Speaker 2>and a's and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much for tuning in again.</v>

4
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.433
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully we'll have an interesting </v>

5
00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:21.484
<v Speaker 2>discussion tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to stop start that is with a </v>

6
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 2>demonstration of some new newly managed </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical wizardry.</v>

7
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.000
<v Speaker 2>I have a program that I developed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>my colleagues that I want to talk to you</v>

8
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:34.834
<v Speaker 2>guys about for just a few seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of you already know about this </v>

9
00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:37.534
<v Speaker 2>called self authoring and self authoring</v>
<v Speaker 2>helps people write about their past to </v>

10
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:45.070
<v Speaker 2>guide it autobiography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the past authoring program and to</v>

11
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:46.660
<v Speaker 2>write about their virtues and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>faults.</v>

12
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:47.494
<v Speaker 2>That's there's to present autherine </v>
<v Speaker 2>programs and a future authoring program </v>

13
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 2>that helps people write out a vision and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a destination,</v>

14
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:55.804
<v Speaker 2>let's say an ethical destination for </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives as well as formulate a plan </v>

15
00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 2>to put that vision into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make that vision into reality.</v>

16
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.660
<v Speaker 2>And our experimental investigations have</v>
<v Speaker 2>indicated,</v>

17
00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:08.494
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that university students who complete </v>

18
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:11.344
<v Speaker 2>this program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they do it badly and I would </v>

19
00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:17.230
<v Speaker 2>recommend at least doing it badly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase their probability of staying at</v>

20
00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:18.064
<v Speaker 2>university by about 30% and it has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive effect on their grade point </v>

21
00:01:21.071 --> 00:01:21.904
<v Speaker 2>average as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a fair bit of evidence that </v>

22
00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:25.924
<v Speaker 2>your personality is organized at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest level through articulated </v>

23
00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:29.734
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of that you can formulate </v>

24
00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:33.280
<v Speaker 2>internally by thinking in some of it you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to do,</v>

25
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.143
<v Speaker 2>you can do by writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also do that in discussion with </v>

26
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:39.250
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these programs are designed to break</v>

27
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 2>down the problem of articulating your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life in the past,</v>

28
00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:44.074
<v Speaker 2>present and future into a series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps that are at least in principle </v>

29
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.813
<v Speaker 2>manageable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thousands of people have done </v>

30
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 2>them and I think they're very helpful </v>
<v Speaker 2>programs and uh,</v>

31
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:55.384
<v Speaker 2>we spent a lot of time perfecting them I</v>
<v Speaker 2>suppose to the degree that they are </v>

32
00:01:58.601 --> 00:01:59.434
<v Speaker 2>perfected.</v>

33
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

34
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.653
<v Speaker 2>here's the high tech part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that's the website self </v>

35
00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 2>authoring.com and I put a coupon </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

36
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coupon name is September.</v>

37
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 2>So that's what you have to enter for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>coupon.</v>

38
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:19.660
<v Speaker 2>And that gives you a 20% discount at </v>
<v Speaker 2>self authoring.</v>

39
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.943
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now all this is even more high tech </v>

40
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 2>because this marker is in a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>

41
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 2>And this program is a personality test </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the big five aspect scale,</v>

42
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:34.684
<v Speaker 2>which is a scale that calling the young </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my students developed when he </v>

43
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:41.560
<v Speaker 2>worked in my lab along with Lena quilty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

44
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.423
<v Speaker 2>the big five aspects scale offers you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>five dimensional readout of your </v>

45
00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:47.290
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extroversion,</v>

46
00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:48.550
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness,</v>

47
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classic big five.</v>

48
00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:55.150
<v Speaker 2>And then it breaks each of the factors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each of the traits into two aspects.</v>

49
00:02:55.151 --> 00:02:58.900
<v Speaker 2>So you get a high resolution map of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality that takes the,</v>

50
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.033
<v Speaker 2>takes about a hundred questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes about 15 minutes to do and you'll </v>

51
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 2>learn about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'll learn interesting things.</v>

52
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:07.264
<v Speaker 2>I had my kids do repeated iterations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the big five aspects scale when they </v>

53
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:10.984
<v Speaker 2>were teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I learned a lot about them even </v>

54
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 2>though I thought I knew them quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned things that were very useful.</v>

55
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 2>So you can do that and maybe you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand yourself a little bit better.</v>

56
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.423
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

57
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 2>this is the site</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the coupon is September,</v>

58
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 2>just as it was for self authoring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's 20% as well.</v>

59
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

60
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.910
<v Speaker 2>And you'll see that amazingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this advertisement,</v>

61
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what it is,</v>

62
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.583
<v Speaker 2>is in purple instead of blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's another technological </v>

63
00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:56.064
<v Speaker 2>miracle brought to you by the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the intelligence of modern human </v>

64
00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:03.210
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all right,</v>

65
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:04.044
<v Speaker 2>so we've dispensed with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's self authoring and understand </v>

66
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:11.991
<v Speaker 2>myself and you might find those useful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hope you do so onto more,</v>

67
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>von to different things.</v>

68
00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:20.730
<v Speaker 2>I guess I just got back to Toronto </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday,</v>

69
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it was yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was out in western Canada.</v>

70
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.033
<v Speaker 2>I went to a family reunion on Vancouver </v>
<v Speaker 2>Island and then a reunion of sorts as </v>

71
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:33.870
<v Speaker 2>well in Saskatchewan with my side of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>family and uh,</v>

72
00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:37.260
<v Speaker 2>finished the talk and Regina and went </v>
<v Speaker 2>into saskatoon as well,</v>

73
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.810
<v Speaker 2>which seemed to be relatively well </v>
<v Speaker 2>received.</v>

74
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.063
<v Speaker 2>So hurray for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've really enjoyed all these lectures </v>

75
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:44.910
<v Speaker 2>that I've been giving.</v>

76
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.890
<v Speaker 2>And tammy and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tammy's my wife,</v>

77
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.173
<v Speaker 2>we visited 65 cities now on this tour </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're starting again on September </v>

78
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.750
<v Speaker 2>5th we're going to go down the eastern </v>
<v Speaker 2>seaboard.</v>

79
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:57.480
<v Speaker 2>There's 20 cities in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the northeastern us.</v>

80
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.930
<v Speaker 2>And then we're off to Europe for another</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 cities or so.</v>

81
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.810
<v Speaker 2>And then in February I think we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to Australia.</v>

82
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.660
<v Speaker 2>And then in March and April back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>

83
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:07.494
<v Speaker 2>And then in May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to spend four months </v>

84
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.300
<v Speaker 2>diligently finishing up what I hope to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be my next book,</v>

85
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:18.600
<v Speaker 2>if assuming that I can get that done in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that period of time.</v>

86
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:21.660
<v Speaker 2>And also that other opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

87
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:25.530
<v Speaker 2>or distractions don't rear their head </v>
<v Speaker 2>either positively or negatively.</v>

88
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:26.940
<v Speaker 2>And who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

89
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Because life is a very uncertain </v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

90
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.460
<v Speaker 2>I've really enjoyed the lecture tour a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

91
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

92
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.453
<v Speaker 2>I've been speaking to audiences of about</v>
<v Speaker 2>2,500 to 3000 people and mostly about </v>

93
00:05:40.981 --> 00:05:43.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say mostly about the nexus,</v>

94
00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:47.310
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>

95
00:05:47.311 --> 00:05:48.144
<v Speaker 2>trying to make the case that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>life is difficult as everyone with any </v>

96
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Speaker 2>sense knows.</v>

97
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.143
<v Speaker 2>And because we can make that worse with </v>
<v Speaker 2>our own stupidity and malevolence that </v>

98
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 2>it's necessary to find a sustaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning in life.</v>

99
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.603
<v Speaker 2>And my sense is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think people tend to agree to </v>

100
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:05.204
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the most sustaining meaning can </v>

101
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 2>be found a and the adoption of voluntary</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

102
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:12.074
<v Speaker 2>So in attempts to decrease the suffering</v>
<v Speaker 2>in life and to do things that are </v>

103
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:16.694
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile and admirable and to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>care of yourself individually and your </v>

104
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:21.164
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to have a little bit leftover for </v>

105
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:23.264
<v Speaker 2>your community and to have goodwill </v>
<v Speaker 2>across all those dimensions if you can </v>

106
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:27.014
<v Speaker 2>possibly manage it despite the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is something in life to make </v>

107
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 2>people relatively bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

108
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.773
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well the necessity of conducting </v>

109
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 2>yourself in a truthful manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

110
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.513
<v Speaker 2>making also the case to my listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that that one of the most </v>

111
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 2>ancient presuppositions that underlies </v>
<v Speaker 2>the structure of Western civilization,</v>

112
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 2>which is a very functional civilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my estimation,</v>

113
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:57.380
<v Speaker 2>is the idea derived from genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that truthful speech,</v>

114
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 2>if you confront truthful speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you confront potential,</v>

115
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 2>the chaos and potential that is in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you with truthful speech,</v>

116
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 2>that you engender the order that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

117
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's a fundamental ethical dictum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

118
00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a presupposition in some sense that</v>

119
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 2>the order that you bring into existence </v>
<v Speaker 2>in all the choices that you make will be</v>

120
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:19.034
<v Speaker 2>the best possible order in proportion to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the degree that you conduct yourself in </v>

121
00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 2>a truthful manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so those ideas seem to be falling on</v>

122
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:27.584
<v Speaker 2>very receptive ears and they are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most resilient ideas that I think I've </v>

123
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 2>ever come across.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

124
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:34.514
<v Speaker 2>I always take an ice pick and a hammer </v>
<v Speaker 2>to any idea that I encounter and I </v>

125
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:38.984
<v Speaker 2>really do that diligently because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to rely on ideas that can </v>

126
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 2>fall apart and break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when they're stressed.</v>

127
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 2>And I don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

128
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I haven't come across ideas that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>more solid than that.</v>

129
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first proposition,</v>

130
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.250
<v Speaker 2>you know that life is suffering and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make it worse with our malevolence.</v>

131
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone understands that to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

132
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.873
<v Speaker 2>But the second is that the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>confront that is to shoulder </v>

133
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 2>responsibility voluntarily and to live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in truth.</v>

134
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.543
<v Speaker 2>I think those are even more powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas because you could say that the </v>

135
00:08:10.221 --> 00:08:11.054
<v Speaker 2>cure for a malaise or the treatment for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a disease is more powerful than the </v>

136
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:15.134
<v Speaker 2>Malaysia Malays or the disease itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And If responsibility and truth are </v>

137
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:23.820
<v Speaker 2>antidotes to suffering and malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that means that they're there.</v>

138
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.990
<v Speaker 2>They have a power that's transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 2>over suffering malevolence and you know,</v>

139
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very pessimistic viewpoint.</v>

140
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm stressing for everybody that</v>

141
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.113
<v Speaker 2>is coming to listen to me talk the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that life has an inalienable element of </v>

142
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.793
<v Speaker 2>difficulty and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and travail and suffering and all of </v>

143
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you certainly see that sort of thing</v>

144
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 2>when you go to a family reunion.</v>

145
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of my relatives,</v>

146
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.910
<v Speaker 2>my parents generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting,</v>

147
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:51.730
<v Speaker 2>all of my parents are in their eighties </v>
<v Speaker 2>now and,</v>

148
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:52.810
<v Speaker 2>and their friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of,</v>

149
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.693
<v Speaker 2>they have friends that are older and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's starting to suffer from the </v>

150
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 2>inevitable deterioration that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with old age.</v>

151
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.164
<v Speaker 2>And it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very trying and very difficult for </v>

152
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.030
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

153
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.873
<v Speaker 2>it's in those situations that you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>more clearly the fragility of life and </v>

154
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:10.770
<v Speaker 2>also the importance of having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

155
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.473
<v Speaker 2>having a family that's functional and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people around you that love you and all </v>

156
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 2>those things that in principle can help </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustain you through difficult times.</v>

157
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here in Toronto for about 10 days,</v>

158
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.320
<v Speaker 2>got a lot of media interviews again </v>
<v Speaker 2>partly to discuss the upcoming talks.</v>

159
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.903
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my book 12 rules for life still appears </v>

160
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 2>to be selling extraordinarily well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

161
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.143
<v Speaker 2>it's quite</v>

162
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All things considered.</v>

163
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.823
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's approaching 2 million sales and in </v>

164
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.400
<v Speaker 2>the English version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

165
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.030
<v Speaker 2>there are foreign versions coming out </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

166
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.090
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've also,</v>

167
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.403
<v Speaker 2>I'm also in the process of putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>together the final arrangements for my </v>

168
00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 2>next book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I talked about.</v>

169
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:02.920
<v Speaker 2>So the plan is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

170
00:10:02.921 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing that now.</v>

171
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:07.200
<v Speaker 2>I've got it about half written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little bit more expanding on the</v>

172
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:08.034
<v Speaker 2>themes that I developed in 12 rules for </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and also extending them as much as </v>

173
00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:14.380
<v Speaker 2>I possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

174
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.890
<v Speaker 2>and I hope to continue writing during </v>
<v Speaker 2>this period of touring as well so that I</v>

175
00:10:19.891 --> 00:10:20.724
<v Speaker 2>can stay on top of my deadlines and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>from May to September to spend most of </v>

176
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:28.050
<v Speaker 2>that time finalizing and editing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>polishing and all of that.</v>

177
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.273
<v Speaker 2>And then hopefully the book is due in </v>
<v Speaker 2>September and the current plan is to </v>

178
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.300
<v Speaker 2>spend September through December,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

179
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 2>likely concentrating on a return to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biblical lectures starting with exodus,</v>

180
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:42.024
<v Speaker 2>which is something I'm really looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward to but haven't really been able </v>

181
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:45.570
<v Speaker 2>to turn my hand to.</v>

182
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.760
<v Speaker 2>The other thing I'm really thinking hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>about doing,</v>

183
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.780
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to do a series of lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I could do them publicly</v>

184
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:52.614
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I might be able to finagle that in </v>

185
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:54.384
<v Speaker 2>some manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to do a series of lectures on </v>

186
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.743
<v Speaker 2>the sacred icons of the radical left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd like to do a lecture series on </v>

187
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Marx and foucault and Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then some,</v>

188
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.713
<v Speaker 2>some of the famous feminist too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like betty for Dan whose work I'm not a </v>

189
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:11.650
<v Speaker 2>fan of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

190
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.640
<v Speaker 2>for a variety of reasons and do Judith </v>
<v Speaker 2>Butler as well.</v>

191
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.980
<v Speaker 2>But I'd really like to concentrate on </v>
<v Speaker 2>marks.</v>

192
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.173
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

193
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.460
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I might duty for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys tonight or two you have,</v>

194
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.573
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I might do to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight is I found a poem by Karl Marx </v>

195
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:29.750
<v Speaker 2>that is extraordinarily interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

196
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 2>that might be worth reading if I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought about doing that if I can</v>

197
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.023
<v Speaker 2>scrape it up in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me just check very quickly and </v>

198
00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:42.180
<v Speaker 2>see if I can find it and then I'll get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to some questions because after all,</v>

199
00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:44.290
<v Speaker 2>this is a q and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

200
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.580
<v Speaker 2>That's the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

201
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 2>give me 30 seconds if you can indulge </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

202
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:59.310
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

203
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.510
<v Speaker 2>So let me read this to you and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get to the Q.</v>

204
00:12:02.511 --> 00:12:03.260
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

205
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.093
<v Speaker 2>I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the kind of thing that I'd like </v>

206
00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:10.040
<v Speaker 2>to shed light on in any possible lecture</v>
<v Speaker 2>series on marks.</v>

207
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.070
<v Speaker 2>So this is called invocation</v>

208
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.943
<v Speaker 2>invocation of one in despair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So God has snatched from me my all in </v>

209
00:12:34.911 --> 00:12:37.760
<v Speaker 2>the curse and rack of destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

210
00:12:37.761 --> 00:12:38.594
<v Speaker 2>his worlds are gone beyond recall </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but revenge is left to me on </v>

211
00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:49.700
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Revenge all proudly wreak on that.</v>

212
00:12:49.701 --> 00:12:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Being that in thrown Lord make my </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength of patchwork of what's week.</v>

213
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Leave my better self without reward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shall build my throne.</v>

214
00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:01.100
<v Speaker 2>High overhead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold,</v>

215
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.820
<v Speaker 2>tremendous shell at summit be for it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>bulwark,</v>

216
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.073
<v Speaker 2>superstitious dread for it's Marshall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blackest agony who looks on it with a </v>

217
00:13:12.231 --> 00:13:13.064
<v Speaker 2>healthy I shall turn back struck </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely pale and dumb clutched by </v>

218
00:13:17.751 --> 00:13:22.640
<v Speaker 2>blind and chill mortality me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his happiness prepare his too.</v>

219
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.830
<v Speaker 2>And the Almighty's lightning shell </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebound from that massive iron giant.</v>

220
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.220
<v Speaker 2>If he bring my walls and towers down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eternity shall raise them up defiant.</v>

221
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on that happy note,</v>

222
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.283
<v Speaker 2>that's perhaps perhaps some insight into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spirit that motivated our friend Mr </v>

223
00:13:46.141 --> 00:13:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Carl Marx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

224
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:50.740
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

225
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I've really been thinking a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Marxist critique of Western culture,</v>

226
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:57.220
<v Speaker 2>especially the fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

227
00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.473
<v Speaker 2>Marxist critique is something eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental mark Marxist critique is a </v>

228
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 2>criticism of the fact that in capitalist</v>
<v Speaker 2>societies,</v>

229
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a disproportionate amount of the spoils,</v>

230
00:14:11.381 --> 00:14:12.214
<v Speaker 2>let's say the wealth goes to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disproportionately small part of the </v>

231
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:16.984
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is of course a truism by the </v>

232
00:14:19.661 --> 00:14:21.400
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the case that that occurs,</v>

233
00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:22.234
<v Speaker 2>which is why the richest dozen people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world have as much money as the </v>

234
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:26.590
<v Speaker 2>bottom 2 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

235
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also the case,</v>

236
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.213
<v Speaker 2>it's part of a more generalized law </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes called prices law and </v>

237
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.530
<v Speaker 2>represented with the prieto </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>

238
00:14:35.531 --> 00:14:40.531
<v Speaker 2>Prieto is p a r e t o showing that not </v>
<v Speaker 2>only do the bulk of the spoils,</v>

239
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.123
<v Speaker 2>let's say the wealth go to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disproportionately small number of </v>

240
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:45.994
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bulk of the productive work is </v>

241
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 2>also done by a disproportionately small </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of people,</v>

242
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.300
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily the same people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the wealth,</v>

243
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:55.790
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although in a functional society,</v>

244
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:56.750
<v Speaker 2>there's some overlap.</v>

245
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.213
<v Speaker 2>Now mark's was correct and observing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that happened in capitalist </v>

246
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:03.800
<v Speaker 2>societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but incorrect in assuming that there are</v>

247
00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:04.634
<v Speaker 2>any societies that have ever been </v>
<v Speaker 2>formulated or that could ever be </v>

248
00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:09.020
<v Speaker 2>formulated that would escape from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>destiny.</v>

249
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Because you see that same tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>pareto distribution,</v>

250
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:14.474
<v Speaker 2>that proclivity of wealth to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to accrue in the hands of small of a </v>

251
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.573
<v Speaker 2>small number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that in every human society </v>

252
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:23.480
<v Speaker 2>that's ever been studied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's not wealth,</v>

253
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:26.900
<v Speaker 2>it's sexual access or reproductive well </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the same thing.</v>

254
00:15:26.901 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Reproductive Opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

255
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.440
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

256
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or material possessions,</v>

257
00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 2>which is obviously a form of wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

258
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.800
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that characterizes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the west is that all our,</v>

259
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.200
<v Speaker 2>although our society's produced </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality,</v>

260
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.930
<v Speaker 2>like every other society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including animal societies,</v>

261
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:46.760
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even among plants,</v>

262
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:47.623
<v Speaker 2>even among stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a disproportionate number of the </v>

263
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:52.040
<v Speaker 2>heavenly bodies have most of the mass by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

264
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.370
<v Speaker 2>which is not something that you can lay </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the feet of western capitalism.</v>

265
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that the West has been able to</v>

266
00:15:58.761 --> 00:15:59.594
<v Speaker 2>do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that other societies haven't been able </v>

267
00:16:03.471 --> 00:16:06.290
<v Speaker 2>to do is to produce wealth along with </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality.</v>

268
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.393
<v Speaker 2>And that wealth is definitely</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fair proportion of that wealth is </v>

269
00:16:12.081 --> 00:16:12.914
<v Speaker 2>actually going to benefit the people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are in the diaries straights and not </v>

270
00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:20.240
<v Speaker 2>processes been accelerating over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last 20 years.</v>

271
00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:21.074
<v Speaker 2>So from the year 2000 till the year 2012</v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of absolute poverty in the </v>

272
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:26.954
<v Speaker 2>world is halved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the fastest rate of economic </v>

273
00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:32.690
<v Speaker 2>development in the history of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that rate is accelerating,</v>

274
00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:34.940
<v Speaker 2>at least in part because the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union,</v>

275
00:16:34.941 --> 00:16:35.774
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't around anymore to agitate the </v>

276
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:39.703
<v Speaker 2>economic masters in leaders of </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing countries into the adoption </v>

277
00:16:42.891 --> 00:16:45.620
<v Speaker 2>of counterproductive collectivist </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic strategies.</v>

278
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.693
<v Speaker 2>And so what appears to be happening is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as we spread the fundamental </v>

279
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.953
<v Speaker 2>western ethos of individuality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>private property and free markets and </v>

280
00:16:54.561 --> 00:16:57.620
<v Speaker 2>freedom in general for men and for women</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world,</v>

281
00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:00.890
<v Speaker 2>that the poorest people are becoming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well at least they're not starving.</v>

282
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.350
<v Speaker 2>They're becoming richer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though at the same time we do pay a</v>

283
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:04.184
<v Speaker 2>price for that in inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a rule and I don't know how </v>

284
00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:08.714
<v Speaker 2>to formulate it exactly or there seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a rule which is a given unit of </v>

285
00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:16.720
<v Speaker 2>wealth is produced at the cost of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of certain production of inequality,</v>

286
00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:20.600
<v Speaker 2>a certain number of units of inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that seems to be inalienable to some</v>

287
00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:22.730
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

288
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.520
<v Speaker 2>that's part of a Marxist critique the </v>
<v Speaker 2>poem first,</v>

289
00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:29.720
<v Speaker 2>which is like you want to listen to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>poem a couple of times I would say,</v>

290
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.610
<v Speaker 2>but then more fundamentally a critique </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Marxist critique of the West.</v>

291
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the West produces inequality,</v>

292
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.140
<v Speaker 2>but it's not something that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>lay at the feet of capitalism.</v>

293
00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:40.940
<v Speaker 2>It's a much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much deeper problem.</v>

294
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.133
<v Speaker 2>And what that means too is that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who purport to be on the side of </v>

295
00:17:44.691 --> 00:17:45.524
<v Speaker 2>the poor and dispossessed are not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends to them by any stretch of the </v>

296
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 2>imagination at all by attempting to tear</v>
<v Speaker 2>down the very hierarchies that seemed to</v>

297
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 2>be leveraging the world's poorest people</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of poverty as rapidly as possible.</v>

298
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 2>There's evidence as well that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to become very concerned about the</v>

299
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can get their family income.</v>

300
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I think arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>GDP,</v>

301
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:08.250
<v Speaker 2>I think up about 40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>above about 4,500 us a year,</v>

302
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:09.323
<v Speaker 2>they start to have a little bit of spare</v>
<v Speaker 2>time to be concerned with the </v>

303
00:18:11.581 --> 00:18:14.480
<v Speaker 2>environment around them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the right way to,</v>

304
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.430
<v Speaker 2>to ecological balance in the world seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

305
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.653
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make people rich as fast as we </v>

306
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:23.460
<v Speaker 2>possibly can to make the poor rich as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast as we possibly can.</v>

307
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.980
<v Speaker 2>And wouldn't that be lovely if that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really the way out?</v>

308
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.390
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

309
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.080
<v Speaker 2>and now for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's,</v>

310
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.930
<v Speaker 2>let's try some questions here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

311
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.910
<v Speaker 2>any advice on effectively implementing </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I learned into my life?</v>

312
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I resonate with 12 rules so much when </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading,</v>

313
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:49.140
<v Speaker 2>but struggle to remember it in my day to</v>
<v Speaker 2>day life.</v>

314
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not alone.</v>

315
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Not with Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not alone in that,</v>

316
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

317
00:18:53.881 --> 00:18:54.714
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to figure out what your </v>

318
00:18:55.591 --> 00:18:56.760
<v Speaker 2>timeframe is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

319
00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:57.963
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the truisms of clinical </v>

320
00:19:00.631 --> 00:19:05.631
<v Speaker 2>psychology is that slow and incremental </v>
<v Speaker 2>improvement is first of all,</v>

321
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 2>normative in the best possible way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the most optimistic situation,</v>

322
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.003
<v Speaker 2>but also very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so of course you struggled to </v>

323
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:13.824
<v Speaker 2>remember it in your day to day life </v>
<v Speaker 2>because life is difficult and it's </v>

324
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:17.304
<v Speaker 2>harder to do things the not to do them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's harder to do them well than to </v>

325
00:19:19.711 --> 00:19:21.240
<v Speaker 2>do them badly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

326
00:19:21.241 --> 00:19:23.340
<v Speaker 2>and it's easy to sit around and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>hopeless.</v>

327
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean it's emotionally easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not,</v>

328
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:31.140
<v Speaker 2>but it's procedural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy to be useless and to fall back into</v>

329
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:33.900
<v Speaker 2>your old habits and to not discipline </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

330
00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:37.080
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of continual practice,</v>

331
00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:38.640
<v Speaker 2>slow continual practice.</v>

332
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.480
<v Speaker 2>And I think a good example of that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like weightlifting.</v>

333
00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:44.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you start a weightlifting program,</v>

334
00:19:44.281 --> 00:19:46.380
<v Speaker 2>which I would recommend by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>

335
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.400
<v Speaker 2>it's tremendously advantageous </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically and cognitively,</v>

336
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.743
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to really see results </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a number of weeks and then the </v>

337
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:54.654
<v Speaker 2>results are rather slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can get pretty decent results </v>

338
00:19:57.091 --> 00:20:00.720
<v Speaker 2>over a six month period and absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>stellar results over a couple of years.</v>

339
00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:01.554
<v Speaker 2>And so you have to make sure your </v>
<v Speaker 2>timeframe is right and not to be too </v>

340
00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:04.434
<v Speaker 2>hard on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did mention the future authoring </v>

341
00:20:07.261 --> 00:20:08.370
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

342
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.713
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I would recommend </v>

343
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:16.260
<v Speaker 2>too is if you're having a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 2>implementing your,</v>

344
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.573
<v Speaker 2>your decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you're ethical decisions that you </v>

345
00:20:19.591 --> 00:20:20.424
<v Speaker 2>spend a bit more time thinking them </v>
<v Speaker 2>through and writing them down in the </v>

346
00:20:22.231 --> 00:20:24.140
<v Speaker 2>future authoring program is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>helpful thought.</v>

347
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.013
<v Speaker 2>That's why we designed it and so get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your goal straight and continue to </v>

348
00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:33.270
<v Speaker 2>practice every day and if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>succeeding then make your goals slightly</v>

349
00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:34.080
<v Speaker 2>smaller.</v>

350
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.170
<v Speaker 2>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to make your goals large enough</v>

351
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.123
<v Speaker 2>so that they challenge you but small </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough so that you have a reasonable </v>

352
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:41.814
<v Speaker 2>probability of succeeding at them on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day to day basis and then you have to </v>

353
00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 2>also understand that if you fail on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>given day,</v>

354
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.223
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're trying to quit smoking </v>

355
00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:52.510
<v Speaker 2>and you quit for two weeks and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a cigarette and you think,</v>

356
00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:54.010
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I've screwed it up.</v>

357
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I've not quitting anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You smoke a whole pack of cigarettes.</v>

358
00:20:57.341 --> 00:20:58.174
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's a couple of mistakes there </v>

359
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.040
<v Speaker 2>and one is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

360
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:05.800
<v Speaker 2>just because you had a cigarette doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean you failed.</v>

361
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.053
<v Speaker 2>It just means that you had a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can start stopping again the next </v>

362
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:11.733
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that you had one cigarette </v>

363
00:21:13.691 --> 00:21:14.524
<v Speaker 2>in the last two weeks is a hell of a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>better than the two weeks that you had </v>

364
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:17.584
<v Speaker 2>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you've gotta be realistically </v>

365
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:21.454
<v Speaker 2>humble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be ambitious enough in </v>

366
00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:23.734
<v Speaker 2>your goals so that you're pursuing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you regard as truly </v>

367
00:21:26.381 --> 00:21:28.810
<v Speaker 2>meaningful and worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

368
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:31.480
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you can judge that to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

369
00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:32.314
<v Speaker 2>If you think about someone you love </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempting the same thing and think </v>

370
00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:36.880
<v Speaker 2>about how you would feel if they managed</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

371
00:21:36.881 --> 00:21:39.700
<v Speaker 2>And if you would feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's probably a good,</v>

372
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say that would be a good</v>

373
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.950
<v Speaker 2>evaluation strategy to use on yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

374
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.520
<v Speaker 2>so you want your goals to be of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficient nobility so that you can live</v>

375
00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.560
<v Speaker 2>with yourself properly if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuing them,</v>

376
00:21:55.561 --> 00:21:56.394
<v Speaker 2>but you want them to be small enough so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have a reasonable probability </v>

377
00:21:58.981 --> 00:22:02.160
<v Speaker 2>of implementing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if your implementation,</v>

378
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

379
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:16.870
<v Speaker 1>You can start again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe</v>

380
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.010
<v Speaker 2>we're back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

381
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

382
00:23:27.931 --> 00:23:28.764
<v Speaker 2>that was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The software that I use on my camera </v>

383
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.110
<v Speaker 2>crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I reopened it,</v>

384
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.220
<v Speaker 2>it told me I hadn't purchased it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted me to reenter the serial number,</v>

385
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.140
<v Speaker 2>which is quite the interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

386
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:41.543
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just getting my questions back </v>

387
00:23:44.371 --> 00:23:45.204
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

388
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.680
<v Speaker 2>this three quarter person that you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>here is Julian,</v>

389
00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:49.640
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

390
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:51.890
<v Speaker 2>reasonably helpful about these sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things now.</v>

391
00:23:51.891 --> 00:23:52.724
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

392
00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:56.403
<v Speaker 2>I've Al,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've almost actually learned how to do </v>

393
00:23:57.401 --> 00:23:58.091
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell you,</v>

394
00:23:58.091 --> 00:24:00.370
<v Speaker 2>you do get slower technologically as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get older.</v>

395
00:24:00.371 --> 00:24:03.700
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of annoying or maybe get just </v>
<v Speaker 2>fed up with it more.</v>

396
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.593
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you probably stupider and less </v>

397
00:24:06.911 --> 00:24:11.470
<v Speaker 2>patient and so then you justify your </v>
<v Speaker 2>less pay your stupidity by just assuming</v>

398
00:24:11.471 --> 00:24:13.660
<v Speaker 2>that you're less patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

399
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.250
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

400
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're back.</v>

401
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Thanks Julian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

402
00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.493
<v Speaker 2>So Paul Maloney says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned analyzing one of your </v>

403
00:24:28.481 --> 00:24:29.314
<v Speaker 2>wife's dreams that left you feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>hopeful that will emerge from this </v>

404
00:24:32.081 --> 00:24:33.160
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

405
00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Do you still feel this way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any new signs?</v>

406
00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

407
00:24:38.561 --> 00:24:39.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because</v>

408
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 2>because the future is complicated and no</v>
<v Speaker 2>one's a profit.</v>

409
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this,</v>

410
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:54.524
<v Speaker 2>I guess I already mentioned earlier in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this q and a that on a global level </v>

411
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.760
<v Speaker 2>there is all sorts of reasons for real </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimism as far as I'm concerned.</v>

412
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:08.653
<v Speaker 2>There's reasons for pessimism as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's reasons for real optimism </v>

413
00:25:11.841 --> 00:25:13.340
<v Speaker 2>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

414
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Speaker 2>it looks to me like what's happening is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this spread of</v>

415
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.233
<v Speaker 2>the western free market individualists </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethos around the world is producing a </v>

416
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:32.320
<v Speaker 2>substantive increment in wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a substantive decrease in poverty.</v>

417
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:38.350
<v Speaker 2>And the consequence of that decrease in </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty is also in places like China,</v>

418
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.700
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China is reforesting.</v>

419
00:25:40.701 --> 00:25:41.534
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>China's now rich enough so that it can </v>

420
00:25:44.031 --> 00:25:44.864
<v Speaker 2>afford to reforest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's more forest in China than </v>

421
00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:49.640
<v Speaker 2>there was in 1990 which is quite a </v>
<v Speaker 2>remarkable thing.</v>

422
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point is,</v>

423
00:25:51.041 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 2>is that on the global scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things appeared to be very positive</v>

424
00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.213
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then in the West we seem to be </v>

425
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:01.124
<v Speaker 2>suffering from a crisis of confidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's destabilizing us and making </v>

426
00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:07.364
<v Speaker 2>us act foolishly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know how much of a threat </v>

427
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.980
<v Speaker 2>that is to the integrity of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>political system.</v>

428
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.373
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm so much in the middle of this </v>

429
00:26:17.811 --> 00:26:19.620
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

430
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.020
<v Speaker 2>personally that it's hard for me to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a clear head about it.</v>

431
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm very optimistic about a variety </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things that I see.</v>

432
00:26:29.271 --> 00:26:30.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm very optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

433
00:26:30.921 --> 00:26:31.754
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that so many people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>are coming out to these long form </v>

434
00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:41.231
<v Speaker 2>lectures and paying attention to high </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity,</v>

435
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.090
<v Speaker 2>educational and political material on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube.</v>

436
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.190
<v Speaker 2>There's a real hunger for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

437
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.163
<v Speaker 2>as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lecture tour that I'm on has been </v>

438
00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:52.260
<v Speaker 2>extremely positive.</v>

439
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.903
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really something to see all these </v>

440
00:26:54.991 --> 00:26:55.824
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people come out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on getting their lives </v>

441
00:26:59.071 --> 00:26:59.904
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do believe that that's why people </v>

442
00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:02.191
<v Speaker 2>are coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

443
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:03.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

444
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:04.973
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember if I did a q and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>since I did the discussions with Sam </v>

445
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

446
00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:12.054
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did for discussions with him for </v>

447
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:15.564
<v Speaker 2>debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say each of which was about two </v>

448
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:19.080
<v Speaker 2>hours long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two in Vancouver,</v>

449
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.080
<v Speaker 2>one in Dublin and one in London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>UK.</v>

450
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.950
<v Speaker 2>And there were about 3000 people at each</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Vancouver events,</v>

451
00:27:25.951 --> 00:27:26.784
<v Speaker 2>8,500 people in Dublin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And something approximating 6,500 in </v>

452
00:27:30.811 --> 00:27:31.644
<v Speaker 2>London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the audience was very attentive for </v>

453
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.190
<v Speaker 2>the two hour stretch for all four </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions.</v>

454
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.053
<v Speaker 2>And so I do see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see more intelligence in the general </v>

455
00:27:46.871 --> 00:27:47.704
<v Speaker 2>population say then I think we presumed </v>
<v Speaker 2>was there and more hunger for serious </v>

456
00:27:52.991 --> 00:27:57.991
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm hoping that people who are clear</v>

457
00:27:59.621 --> 00:28:00.454
<v Speaker 2>headed and sensible can push back the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiot collectivist radicals on the left </v>

458
00:28:06.521 --> 00:28:08.920
<v Speaker 2>and on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

459
00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

460
00:28:11.531 --> 00:28:12.364
<v Speaker 2>I'm hopeful because I think that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are remarkable creatures despite their </v>

461
00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:17.494
<v Speaker 2>limitations and the absurdity of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence and our proclivity toward </v>

462
00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.220
<v Speaker 2>malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that</v>

463
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.220
<v Speaker 1>w</v>

464
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.053
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever constitutes our essence is </v>

465
00:28:32.301 --> 00:28:36.320
<v Speaker 2>capable of transcending that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that people know that.</v>

466
00:28:36.321 --> 00:28:37.154
<v Speaker 2>And I think the more people that realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>that consciously and start to implement </v>

467
00:28:40.011 --> 00:28:41.150
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better off we'll be.</v>

468
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.313
<v Speaker 2>And so nested inside my extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>pessimism about the structure of life </v>

469
00:28:46.941 --> 00:28:50.870
<v Speaker 2>and the frailty of human character is an</v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable optimism,</v>

470
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.110
<v Speaker 2>exceptional optimism about our </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>

471
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.183
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would also say to all of you that </v>

472
00:28:58.401 --> 00:29:00.110
<v Speaker 2>are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

473
00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:01.123
<v Speaker 2>it is my firm belief that each of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a responsibility to set the world </v>

474
00:29:06.951 --> 00:29:09.530
<v Speaker 2>right in the manner that we are able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

475
00:29:09.531 --> 00:29:14.531
<v Speaker 2>That that is a fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a fundamental import.</v>

476
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:16.543
<v Speaker 2>I really believe in some sense it's of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmic import in the same way that </v>

477
00:29:20.181 --> 00:29:25.130
<v Speaker 2>consciousness itself is of cosmic import</v>
<v Speaker 2>and consciousness reflects being itself.</v>

478
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.923
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do believe that we have the </v>

479
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.033
<v Speaker 2>ability and the responsibility to bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>new creation into being and that our </v>

480
00:29:34.911 --> 00:29:39.911
<v Speaker 2>ethical decisions help us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our ethical decisions,</v>

481
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.143
<v Speaker 2>that the value of that new being is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent directly on the ethical </v>

482
00:29:44.381 --> 00:29:45.214
<v Speaker 2>decisions that each of us make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we can realize that even </v>

483
00:29:47.951 --> 00:29:49.630
<v Speaker 2>though it's a frightening thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>

484
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Marcus Perry asks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>

485
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.580
<v Speaker 2>the narrow bandwidth of TV has made us </v>
<v Speaker 2>think we are stupider than we are.</v>

486
00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 2>We'll internet center censorship lead to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same problem once TV is supplanted.</v>

487
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

488
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.820
<v Speaker 2>another incredibly complicated question.</v>

489
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I think about censorship,</v>

490
00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.153
<v Speaker 2>I actually talked to mark Zuckerberg </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile back and we had a good </v>

491
00:30:16.221 --> 00:30:17.630
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

492
00:30:17.631 --> 00:30:18.464
<v Speaker 2>and Zuckerberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I think is a very straightforward </v>

493
00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.130
<v Speaker 2>person as far as I could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

494
00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:27.503
<v Speaker 2>is optimistic about facebook and does </v>
<v Speaker 2>see it as a platform whose primary goal </v>

495
00:30:32.821 --> 00:30:36.540
<v Speaker 2>is to connect people and mostly at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal level,</v>

496
00:30:36.541 --> 00:30:37.374
<v Speaker 2>although they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook has made forays into news </v>

497
00:30:40.711 --> 00:30:43.440
<v Speaker 2>provision and that's complicated their </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate vision.</v>

498
00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:44.693
<v Speaker 2>Now I am not a pro censorship character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not like hate speech legislation </v>

499
00:30:50.371 --> 00:30:51.204
<v Speaker 2>and I am absolutely opposed to compelled</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech legislation of the sort that's </v>

500
00:30:55.561 --> 00:30:56.394
<v Speaker 2>been introduced into Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a violation of the </v>

501
00:30:59.311 --> 00:31:01.230
<v Speaker 2>principle of free speech and free </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>

502
00:31:01.231 --> 00:31:03.210
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's exceptionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

503
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.360
<v Speaker 2>But having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

504
00:31:06.361 --> 00:31:07.194
<v Speaker 2>nothing is ever simple and that's part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the reason that things are so </v>

505
00:31:09.751 --> 00:31:11.910
<v Speaker 2>annoying politically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

506
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.073
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that apple and </v>

507
00:31:15.181 --> 00:31:18.500
<v Speaker 2>facebook and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

508
00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:22.170
<v Speaker 2>the large social media platforms had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>contend with say,</v>

509
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:23.483
<v Speaker 2>was the attempts by organizations like </v>
<v Speaker 2>isis to use their platforms for </v>

510
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.400
<v Speaker 2>recruitment.</v>

511
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.953
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that I'm a free speech </v>

512
00:31:31.861 --> 00:31:32.694
<v Speaker 2>absolutist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't exactly true because I </v>

513
00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.413
<v Speaker 2>realize that there are the constraints </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he evolved in some sense naturally </v>

514
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.780
<v Speaker 2>in the English common law system on free</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech and that they're necessary.</v>

515
00:31:45.781 --> 00:31:48.570
<v Speaker 2>You can't libel someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't outright lie about someone,</v>

516
00:31:48.571 --> 00:31:49.404
<v Speaker 2>you can't slandered them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't counsel them to criminal </v>

517
00:31:52.201 --> 00:31:53.730
<v Speaker 2>conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera.</v>

518
00:31:53.731 --> 00:31:56.940
<v Speaker 2>There are restrictions on free speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

519
00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.800
<v Speaker 2>but I think those restrictions should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>minimal.</v>

520
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.233
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that one of the restrictions </v>

521
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.280
<v Speaker 2>you assume should be placed on free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech is that those that you are at war</v>

522
00:32:09.481 --> 00:32:13.950
<v Speaker 2>with are not allowed to use your </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform to recruit,</v>

523
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:18.180
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't seem to be an unreasonable</v>
<v Speaker 2>proposition and is perhaps even the sort</v>

524
00:32:18.181 --> 00:32:21.150
<v Speaker 2>of thing and a conservative or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian,</v>

525
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:25.440
<v Speaker 2>much less a liberal or a left winger </v>
<v Speaker 2>might get behind.</v>

526
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.023
<v Speaker 2>Well then that means that you've defined</v>
<v Speaker 2>already a framework in which is that </v>

527
00:32:31.891 --> 00:32:34.950
<v Speaker 2>censorship and or maybe I'm not thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>this through clearly,</v>

528
00:32:34.951 --> 00:32:36.540
<v Speaker 2>but is that censorship?</v>

529
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:37.853
<v Speaker 2>It certainly self protection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then having established the </v>

530
00:32:41.061 --> 00:32:45.020
<v Speaker 2>principle that a certain amount of Mod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call,</v>

531
00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:47.870
<v Speaker 2>monitoring of the use of your platform </v>
<v Speaker 2>is necessary.</v>

532
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Where do you stop and answer is</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated.</v>

533
00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what facebook,</v>

534
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.780
<v Speaker 2>etc. Did with Alex Jones was a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>

535
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.510
<v Speaker 2>I think that was because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

536
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.450
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't just Alex Jones that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>punished,</v>

537
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:08.330
<v Speaker 2>let's say it was all the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were watching him and not everybody that</v>

538
00:33:08.331 --> 00:33:10.970
<v Speaker 2>was watching him was an avid follower of</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

539
00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:12.483
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people were just watching him to </v>

540
00:33:14.961 --> 00:33:17.720
<v Speaker 2>see what the hell he was doing and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was up to.</v>

541
00:33:17.721 --> 00:33:18.554
<v Speaker 2>And that's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't just sensor the one </v>

542
00:33:20.451 --> 00:33:21.284
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you censor everybody that's paying </v>

543
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:23.174
<v Speaker 2>attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you make him a martyr and you </v>

544
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:26.563
<v Speaker 2>persecute someone who's paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which all that does is validate his </v>

545
00:33:29.571 --> 00:33:34.280
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theories is conspiratorial </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories and the conspiratorial theories</v>

546
00:33:34.281 --> 00:33:35.270
<v Speaker 2>of his followers.</v>

547
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:36.883
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess one of the things I've really </v>

548
00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:40.274
<v Speaker 2>been wondering is if the wild and woolly</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality of facebook and Youtube and </v>

549
00:33:47.271 --> 00:33:48.104
<v Speaker 2>twitter are actually sustainable in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate environment or if the radical </v>

550
00:33:54.261 --> 00:33:58.370
<v Speaker 2>freedom that was associated with those </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies was only something that was</v>

551
00:33:58.371 --> 00:34:00.800
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when in some sense,</v>

552
00:34:00.801 --> 00:34:01.634
<v Speaker 2>all of that material provision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the provision of that material was </v>

553
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:10.330
<v Speaker 2>outside the standard legal framework </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was too new to regulate.</v>

554
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell,</v>

555
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.053
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if corporations can manage </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like youtube or twitter or </v>

556
00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:22.121
<v Speaker 2>facebook for that matter because their </v>
<v Speaker 2>internal conservatism and there,</v>

557
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.990
<v Speaker 2>and I mean that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the temperamental sense,</v>

558
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.590
<v Speaker 2>their unwillingness to take risk is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

559
00:34:29.591 --> 00:34:34.400
<v Speaker 2>is what I mean in that particular case </v>
<v Speaker 2>is liable to make it impossible for them</v>

560
00:34:34.401 --> 00:34:35.234
<v Speaker 2>to be neutral purveyors of information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of which is going to be extremely </v>

561
00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:39.434
<v Speaker 2>radical.</v>

562
00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.350
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

563
00:34:42.351 --> 00:34:46.880
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no conclusions to offer there.</v>

564
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.053
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess I'm glad in some sense that </v>

565
00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:51.554
<v Speaker 2>these complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these particular complicated problems </v>

566
00:34:53.121 --> 00:34:57.140
<v Speaker 2>aren't mine to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly think that the production of</v>

567
00:34:57.141 --> 00:34:59.780
<v Speaker 2>automated sensors is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bad idea.</v>

568
00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:00.614
<v Speaker 2>But I'm also someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutionally opposed to such things </v>

569
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:04.184
<v Speaker 2>as closed circuit TV monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monitoring of the general public as </v>

570
00:35:08.331 --> 00:35:09.164
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

571
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.033
<v Speaker 2>and cameras that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that watch people at stoplights and any </v>

572
00:35:12.861 --> 00:35:13.694
<v Speaker 2>automated system that that enforces the </v>
<v Speaker 2>law or the or what's hypothetically the </v>

573
00:35:20.361 --> 00:35:23.300
<v Speaker 2>law to me is to be regarded with deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep suspicion.</v>

574
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.000
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

575
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:29.900
<v Speaker 2>That's that much of my early work deals </v>
<v Speaker 2>with alcoholism.</v>

576
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with Ann at the biological level,</v>

577
00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:33.284
<v Speaker 2>that's what I did my phd thesis on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>much of my early published papers where </v>

578
00:35:36.621 --> 00:35:40.500
<v Speaker 2>I learned brain function because alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 2>affects every part of the brain.</v>

579
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.490
<v Speaker 2>So I had learned a lot about the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What prompted my interest in that area.</v>

580
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:47.280
<v Speaker 2>And you're a parent shift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two issues clustered around personality.</v>

581
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.600
<v Speaker 2>While I was always interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation for drug and alcohol abuse,</v>

582
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:55.650
<v Speaker 2>you know what it was that drove people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to use drugs of,</v>

583
00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.330
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of abuse,</v>

584
00:35:57.331 --> 00:35:58.800
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

585
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:01.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the opportunity to study at Miguel</v>

586
00:36:01.381 --> 00:36:02.214
<v Speaker 2>under Dr Robert Peel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was an excellent supervisor and he </v>

587
00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:07.430
<v Speaker 2>was deeply involved with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

588
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:12.060
<v Speaker 2>drug and alcohol abuse research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at motivation for alcoholism.</v>

589
00:36:12.061 --> 00:36:14.000
<v Speaker 2>And he offered me a position in his lab </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

590
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:16.470
<v Speaker 2>and that was what he was working on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

591
00:36:16.471 --> 00:36:19.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was one of my cardinal interests,</v>

592
00:36:19.021 --> 00:36:22.980
<v Speaker 2>although perhaps not my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my fundamental interest,</v>

593
00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:23.814
<v Speaker 2>which even at that point had to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation for totalitarianism and the </v>

594
00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:29.250
<v Speaker 2>commission of a trustee in the service </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

595
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:30.840
<v Speaker 2>of group belief.</v>

596
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 2>But I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

597
00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:33.324
<v Speaker 2>it's a broad topic and I could learn a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot about biology and neurobiology as a </v>

598
00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:40.020
<v Speaker 2>consequence of working on something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was so biological.</v>

599
00:36:40.021 --> 00:36:40.854
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my early work in psychology was </v>

600
00:36:42.421 --> 00:36:45.660
<v Speaker 2>extremely biologically oriented and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was unbelievably useful.</v>

601
00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:48.720
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot from the animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimentalists in particular,</v>

602
00:36:48.721 --> 00:36:51.720
<v Speaker 2>people like Jeffrey Gray and later Jaak </v>
<v Speaker 2>Panksepp.</v>

603
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a reading list at Jordan B.</v>

604
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:58.260
<v Speaker 2>Peterson Dotcom that outlines some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those emotional,</v>

605
00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.240
<v Speaker 2>so those books on emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience.</v>

606
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was my,</v>

607
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.080
<v Speaker 2>why did I shift?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While there was a variety of reasons.</v>

608
00:37:07.081 --> 00:37:12.081
<v Speaker 2>One was that the National Institute of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol Abuse and alcoholism and I aaa,</v>

609
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:13.493
<v Speaker 2>which funded grant research in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States essentially made the </v>

610
00:37:17.461 --> 00:37:19.470
<v Speaker 2>corner of research I was doing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert Peale.</v>

611
00:37:19.471 --> 00:37:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's part of the consequence.</v>

612
00:37:22.561 --> 00:37:23.394
<v Speaker 2>I think this is one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the universities are doing so terribly </v>

613
00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:26.214
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the ethics committees made our </v>

614
00:37:27.991 --> 00:37:32.070
<v Speaker 2>research impossible both to fund and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>implement.</v>

615
00:37:32.071 --> 00:37:35.190
<v Speaker 2>So here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were bringing people into the lab.</v>

616
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:36.923
<v Speaker 2>So here's who we pick for subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are going to be a subject in one </v>

617
00:37:39.751 --> 00:37:43.920
<v Speaker 2>of our experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to be a young man and you had to</v>

618
00:37:43.921 --> 00:37:48.450
<v Speaker 2>have an alcoholic father and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholic grandfather,</v>

619
00:37:48.451 --> 00:37:52.530
<v Speaker 2>and at least one other first or second </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree male alcoholic relative.</v>

620
00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:04.973
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

621
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:39.463
<v Speaker 2>Well I hope I'm back again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what my software updated and </v>

622
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:47.000
<v Speaker 2>obviously the update has a bug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's rather annoying.</v>

623
00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

624
00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Pauly g's for that once again.</v>

625
00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

626
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.070
<v Speaker 2>So back to the alcoholism discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

627
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.930
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

628
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.280
<v Speaker 2>where was I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

629
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.550
<v Speaker 2>So we would get these subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned who they were,</v>

630
00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.500
<v Speaker 2>they were young men who weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholic,</v>

631
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:08.130
<v Speaker 2>but who drank socially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had an alcoholic father,</v>

632
00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.413
<v Speaker 2>an alcoholic grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at least one other male alcoholic </v>

633
00:39:12.211 --> 00:39:14.310
<v Speaker 2>relative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now why did we pick subjects like that?</v>

634
00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.173
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we knew alcoholism ran in families and </v>

635
00:39:16.951 --> 00:39:20.250
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't really study its </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmission and women because if you're</v>

636
00:39:20.251 --> 00:39:23.730
<v Speaker 2>a female alcoholic and you drink when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a child in Utero,</v>

637
00:39:23.731 --> 00:39:24.564
<v Speaker 2>then the child can have fetal alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 2>syndrome and whatever abnormalities in </v>

638
00:39:28.561 --> 00:39:32.450
<v Speaker 2>psychophysiological response or </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopathology is,</v>

639
00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.293
<v Speaker 2>might be associated with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholism can easily be masked by the </v>

640
00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:41.430
<v Speaker 2>presence of fetal alcohol syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we couldn't use women.</v>

641
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:46.050
<v Speaker 2>And besides alcoholism is a problem that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally characterized as men.</v>

642
00:39:46.051 --> 00:39:48.570
<v Speaker 2>Although there are female alcoholics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's four to one,</v>

643
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.910
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly from from those </v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

644
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.650
<v Speaker 2>it's four to one male to female.</v>

645
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.633
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know when we thought if we </v>

646
00:39:54.751 --> 00:39:55.584
<v Speaker 2>concentrated on those who had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest probability of developing </v>

647
00:39:58.081 --> 00:39:58.914
<v Speaker 2>alcoholism because of their loaded </v>
<v Speaker 2>family history that we could shed some </v>

648
00:40:01.561 --> 00:40:02.394
<v Speaker 2>light on the mechanisms associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholism and that would be useful for </v>

649
00:40:04.831 --> 00:40:07.680
<v Speaker 2>men and for women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we studied sons of male alcoholics,</v>

650
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.380
<v Speaker 2>sons of multigenerational male </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholics.</v>

651
00:40:10.381 --> 00:40:13.290
<v Speaker 2>Those were our target group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard populations to fight.</v>

652
00:40:13.291 --> 00:40:14.124
<v Speaker 2>We have people hired full time to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but find us research subjects </v>

653
00:40:17.461 --> 00:40:18.294
<v Speaker 2>and so we did relatively small end </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies because we were lucky if we </v>

654
00:40:21.151 --> 00:40:25.770
<v Speaker 2>could gather four or five subjects a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month in the Montreal urban area.</v>

655
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

656
00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did discover a lot about alcoholism.</v>

657
00:40:28.971 --> 00:40:29.804
<v Speaker 2>We discovered for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if people with this </v>

658
00:40:32.601 --> 00:40:36.230
<v Speaker 2>multigenerational history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a substantial proportion of them,</v>

659
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:41.530
<v Speaker 2>if they drank enough alcohol to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>their blood level up above 0.08 which is</v>

660
00:40:41.541 --> 00:40:42.374
<v Speaker 2>legal intoxication level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if they did that relatively short </v>

661
00:40:45.201 --> 00:40:46.034
<v Speaker 2>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then their heart rate would increase </v>

662
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.273
<v Speaker 2>above.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the average was about 12 beats </v>

663
00:40:50.871 --> 00:40:55.871
<v Speaker 2>per minute compared to the standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>control of of zero zero or one or two.</v>

664
00:40:56.601 --> 00:40:58.580
<v Speaker 2>It was is very low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

665
00:40:58.581 --> 00:40:59.414
<v Speaker 2>and then we did figure out over time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our whole team that that seemed to be a </v>

666
00:41:02.361 --> 00:41:07.361
<v Speaker 2>consequence of susceptibility to </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol's effect on opioid production in</v>

667
00:41:07.491 --> 00:41:09.570
<v Speaker 2>the brain and secondary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

668
00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.513
<v Speaker 2>or opioid effects on dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is both opiates and dopamine are </v>

669
00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.593
<v Speaker 2>primarily primary reward chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it looked to us like people with </v>

670
00:41:17.211 --> 00:41:18.044
<v Speaker 2>multigenerational family histories of </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholism got an opiate response from </v>

671
00:41:21.411 --> 00:41:22.244
<v Speaker 2>alcohol.</v>

672
00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.413
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we had to get people drunk in order </v>

673
00:41:25.341 --> 00:41:29.030
<v Speaker 2>to find this response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it turned out that 0.08,</v>

674
00:41:29.031 --> 00:41:29.864
<v Speaker 2>which was the legal limit at that time </v>
<v Speaker 2>for driving was approximately the place </v>

675
00:41:32.661 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 2>where we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychophysiological effects and also</v>

676
00:41:35.211 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 2>saw fairly pronounced cognitive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>motor effects of alcohol because we also</v>

677
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:42.980
<v Speaker 2>studied that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now to bring it,</v>

678
00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:43.814
<v Speaker 2>we bring people into the lab and we'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>give them three large shots of alcohol </v>

679
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:49.700
<v Speaker 2>that they consumed in 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We use laboratory alcohol,</v>

680
00:41:49.701 --> 00:41:53.420
<v Speaker 2>which was I think 95% pure alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually put it in orange juice.</v>

681
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so people would be,</v>

682
00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably intoxicated.</v>

683
00:41:58.011 --> 00:42:01.730
<v Speaker 2>And then we would let them sober up </v>
<v Speaker 2>until they were at 0.04,</v>

684
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.670
<v Speaker 2>which is half legal intoxication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we thought was useful.</v>

685
00:42:04.671 --> 00:42:07.310
<v Speaker 2>And then we put them into cabin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd go home and we,</v>

686
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had our odd mishap now and then </v>

687
00:42:10.311 --> 00:42:12.230
<v Speaker 2>someone would throw up and that was,</v>

688
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.970
<v Speaker 2>well I'm at least getting better at </v>
<v Speaker 2>fixing it when it screws up now.</v>

689
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:21.530
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

690
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:22.693
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in anyways now and then we would </v>

691
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:28.400
<v Speaker 2>have somebody who would be become ill in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lab and that was always unpleasant.</v>

692
00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:29.234
<v Speaker 2>But then we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd also let people sober up and it </v>

693
00:42:30.501 --> 00:42:34.010
<v Speaker 2>actually takes quite a long time to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>from point a to 0.04,</v>

694
00:42:34.011 --> 00:42:36.230
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're a big guy cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

695
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.720
<v Speaker 2>your dose of El Calls proportionate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body weight.</v>

696
00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:41.540
<v Speaker 2>And so we used to have people wait in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lab for a couple of hours,</v>

697
00:42:41.541 --> 00:42:44.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were not very happy necessarily</v>

698
00:42:44.751 --> 00:42:47.150
<v Speaker 2>about having to wait before we paid them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so forth.</v>

699
00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:48.230
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

700
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.050
<v Speaker 2>and if we didn't treat them </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily well,</v>

701
00:42:51.051 --> 00:42:51.884
<v Speaker 2>which we tried to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then of course they were much less </v>

702
00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:55.580
<v Speaker 2>likely to come back and participate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>another study.</v>

703
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:58.580
<v Speaker 2>And since it was very difficult to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>research subjects,</v>

704
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:59.803
<v Speaker 2>then we wanted to treat them very well </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from the fact that we would have </v>

705
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:04.160
<v Speaker 2>done that anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

706
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.600
<v Speaker 2>and I aaa said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

707
00:43:05.601 --> 00:43:06.434
<v Speaker 2>you can't let your research subjects go </v>
<v Speaker 2>home until they have a blood alcohol </v>

708
00:43:09.321 --> 00:43:11.480
<v Speaker 2>level of point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh two was like,</v>

709
00:43:11.481 --> 00:43:13.340
<v Speaker 2>we would have had to have people in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>lab,</v>

710
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sobering up for</v>

711
00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:20.043
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

712
00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.690
<v Speaker 2>for six to eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This keeps happening.</v>

713
00:43:22.691 --> 00:43:24.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm very sorry about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

714
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to say about it except</v>

715
00:43:30.061 --> 00:43:32.070
<v Speaker 2>that that's a consequence of software </v>
<v Speaker 2>updates,</v>

716
00:43:32.071 --> 00:43:33.720
<v Speaker 2>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

717
00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:39.143
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that made it impossible because we </v>

718
00:43:41.641 --> 00:43:43.590
<v Speaker 2>just couldn't keep people in the lab for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that long.</v>

719
00:43:43.591 --> 00:43:46.260
<v Speaker 2>All it did was annoyed them to death and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they hated us and they,</v>

720
00:43:46.261 --> 00:43:47.094
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would get quite irritable and </v>

721
00:43:48.481 --> 00:43:51.510
<v Speaker 2>upset and no bloody wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then also,</v>

722
00:43:51.511 --> 00:43:52.344
<v Speaker 2>and I aaa decided that half our subjects</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to be women or we couldn't get </v>

723
00:43:55.471 --> 00:43:59.100
<v Speaker 2>funding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now our subjects couldn't be women.</v>

724
00:43:59.101 --> 00:43:59.934
<v Speaker 2>It was impossible to do the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>research that we were doing with women </v>

725
00:44:03.511 --> 00:44:05.130
<v Speaker 2>for the reasons that I just outlined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

726
00:44:05.131 --> 00:44:06.660
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

727
00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:11.100
<v Speaker 2>alcoholism doesn't affect women as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>as it affects men.</v>

728
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Depression and anxiety tend to affect </v>
<v Speaker 2>women more and it's perfectly reasonable</v>

729
00:44:15.061 --> 00:44:17.160
<v Speaker 2>to study those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't what we were doing.</v>

730
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:18.443
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

731
00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.513
<v Speaker 2>and then we couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>multigenerational studies for genetic </v>

732
00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:28.300
<v Speaker 2>predisposition with women because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fetal alcohol syndrome problem.</v>

733
00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:30.100
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was something,</v>

734
00:44:30.101 --> 00:44:30.934
<v Speaker 2>I think this came in under Clintons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this re requirement for absolute gender </v>

735
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:38.400
<v Speaker 2>equality in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in subject selection.</v>

736
00:44:38.401 --> 00:44:39.234
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't give a damn if that </v>
<v Speaker 2>meant that there were certain kinds of </v>

737
00:44:41.341 --> 00:44:43.350
<v Speaker 2>research that just couldn't be done </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

738
00:44:43.351 --> 00:44:47.790
<v Speaker 2>And so I had to stop doing it and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one's really doing that kind of research</v>

739
00:44:47.791 --> 00:44:48.624
<v Speaker 2>anymore because it's just too difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it was always a pain because </v>

740
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:52.554
<v Speaker 2>it was really hard to get the subjects </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you had to get people quite </v>

741
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:55.403
<v Speaker 2>intoxicated and then you had to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them when they were drunk and you </v>

742
00:44:57.871 --> 00:45:00.660
<v Speaker 2>had to do your psychophysiological </v>
<v Speaker 2>recording and all that sort of thing.</v>

743
00:45:00.661 --> 00:45:02.610
<v Speaker 2>And then they had to sober up and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

744
00:45:02.611 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 2>it was complicated.</v>

745
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Clinical research is unbelievably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably complicated and difficult.</v>

746
00:45:07.951 --> 00:45:08.784
<v Speaker 2>And then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to more restrictions to it and </v>

747
00:45:10.261 --> 00:45:11.220
<v Speaker 2>people just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

748
00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:12.300
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we,</v>

749
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:13.134
<v Speaker 2>I guess we won't study the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychophysiological consequences of </v>

750
00:45:15.571 --> 00:45:18.450
<v Speaker 2>alcohol anymore or so people would use </v>
<v Speaker 2>low doses,</v>

751
00:45:18.451 --> 00:45:19.284
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and want to get their subject's blood </v>

752
00:45:20.311 --> 00:45:22.560
<v Speaker 2>alcohol level up to like 0.02 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] three.</v>

753
00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:23.394
<v Speaker 2>But that's completely irrelevant because</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol doesn't have much of a </v>

754
00:45:26.311 --> 00:45:29.520
<v Speaker 2>physiological effect at those low doses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

755
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:33.660
<v Speaker 2>well this is one of the things that made</v>
<v Speaker 2>me absolutely despise ethics committees.</v>

756
00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:34.494
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that the proliferation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethics committees is one of the reasons </v>

757
00:45:36.871 --> 00:45:39.620
<v Speaker 2>that university research human research </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

758
00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.490
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is doing badly.</v>

759
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Psychological research is doing badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a variety of reasons,</v>

760
00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:47.730
<v Speaker 2>but that's certainly one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was interested,</v>

761
00:45:47.731 --> 00:45:48.564
<v Speaker 2>sorry this is a very long answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was interested in personality as </v>

762
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:51.120
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

763
00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:51.953
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was a clinical psychologist </v>

764
00:45:53.161 --> 00:45:57.810
<v Speaker 2>and I had read Freud and Jung and Adler </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the great clinicians of the 20th</v>

765
00:45:57.811 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 2>century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I went to Harvard,</v>

766
00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:01.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was offered,</v>

767
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:02.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

768
00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

769
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:03.503
<v Speaker 2>when you're a new faculty member there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually a set course that they require </v>

770
00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:09.060
<v Speaker 2>you to teach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the core courses.</v>

771
00:46:09.061 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 2>And then you have some freedom with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>other courses.</v>

772
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.413
<v Speaker 2>And so I said I'd teach personality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I got more and more and we were </v>

773
00:46:16.081 --> 00:46:19.800
<v Speaker 2>looking at personality models with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholism research too.</v>

774
00:46:19.801 --> 00:46:20.634
<v Speaker 2>At that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big five was starting to establish </v>

775
00:46:21.991 --> 00:46:22.824
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't much of an admirer of the </v>

776
00:46:23.971 --> 00:46:24.804
<v Speaker 2>big five because I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I like theories as well as </v>

777
00:46:27.031 --> 00:46:29.220
<v Speaker 2>empirical research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought the big five,</v>

778
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.520
<v Speaker 2>while there was just no theory at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just brute force empiricism,</v>

779
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.390
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

780
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.490
<v Speaker 2>that data eventually became convincing.</v>

781
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:40.290
<v Speaker 2>And as I got more and more interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

782
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:44.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in personality,</v>

783
00:46:44.431 --> 00:46:45.264
<v Speaker 2>I got more and more interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>use of personality and other </v>

784
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:49.163
<v Speaker 2>psychometric technologies to predict </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like academic and creative </v>

785
00:46:53.641 --> 00:46:56.820
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see it at mcgill,</v>

786
00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:01.080
<v Speaker 2>my bob and I and a variety of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were using,</v>

787
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.353
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological tests of various sorts to </v>

788
00:47:04.201 --> 00:47:07.300
<v Speaker 2>predict things like alcoholism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>antisocial personality.</v>

789
00:47:07.301 --> 00:47:11.010
<v Speaker 2>So we could use the big five and </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychological tests,</v>

790
00:47:11.011 --> 00:47:13.050
<v Speaker 2>tests of Dorsolateral prefrontal </v>
<v Speaker 2>function,</v>

791
00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.453
<v Speaker 2>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to predict to some degree who might be </v>

792
00:47:16.501 --> 00:47:19.290
<v Speaker 2>susceptible to the development of anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>social personality.</v>

793
00:47:19.291 --> 00:47:20.550
<v Speaker 2>And then when I went to Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

794
00:47:20.551 --> 00:47:20.911
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

795
00:47:20.911 --> 00:47:21.744
<v Speaker 2>maybe we could use those tests to </v>
<v Speaker 2>predict who was going to be good at </v>

796
00:47:25.321 --> 00:47:27.300
<v Speaker 2>things as well as who was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

797
00:47:27.301 --> 00:47:28.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are creative are the,</v>

798
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.680
<v Speaker 2>who were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

799
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:32.380
<v Speaker 2>academically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

800
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.273
<v Speaker 2>outstanding or people who did well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>managers and administrators and </v>

801
00:47:35.801 --> 00:47:38.770
<v Speaker 2>corporations might do well on </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality tests.</v>

802
00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:42.190
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and neuropsychological tests that assess</v>

803
00:47:42.191 --> 00:47:45.040
<v Speaker 2>dorsolateral prefrontal functions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's higher order cognition.</v>

804
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:47.470
<v Speaker 2>So we started to put together test </v>
<v Speaker 2>batteries that,</v>

805
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:48.843
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assessed that and that was fascinating </v>

806
00:47:50.231 --> 00:47:51.970
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did that with Daniel Higgins,</v>

807
00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:52.953
<v Speaker 2>who's the partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my partner in the development of the </v>

808
00:47:54.431 --> 00:47:58.270
<v Speaker 2>self authoring program and understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself that things that he's labored for</v>

809
00:47:58.271 --> 00:48:01.090
<v Speaker 2>20 years on before they really became </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

810
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wrote a bang up thesis.</v>

811
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:05.343
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the best thing ever </v>

812
00:48:07.271 --> 00:48:09.610
<v Speaker 2>written on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the topic of intelligence.</v>

813
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:10.713
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and launched that he started working on </v>

814
00:48:12.401 --> 00:48:13.930
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1993,</v>

815
00:48:13.931 --> 00:48:16.210
<v Speaker 2>which is about the same time that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bell curve came out.</v>

816
00:48:16.211 --> 00:48:20.200
<v Speaker 2>And so his research actually became row </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively politically contentious,</v>

817
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:21.034
<v Speaker 2>even though all we were trying to do was</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to determine what attributes </v>

818
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.153
<v Speaker 2>predicted success among creative people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and among managers and administrators </v>

819
00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.440
<v Speaker 2>and in it and in academia and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pure empirical research.</v>

820
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 2>But it became real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly politicized anyways.</v>

821
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:41.560
<v Speaker 2>So I just got more and more interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in psychometrics,</v>

822
00:48:41.561 --> 00:48:42.394
<v Speaker 2>partly because I realized way back when </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1993 that almost nothing that's </v>

823
00:48:45.691 --> 00:48:47.860
<v Speaker 2>psychologists measured was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

824
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:50.020
<v Speaker 2>And so we were interested in what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

825
00:48:50.021 --> 00:48:52.270
<v Speaker 2>And Daniel is an engineer and trained at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mit.</v>

826
00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.780
<v Speaker 2>And so he was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very method method,</v>

827
00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:56.873
<v Speaker 2>a methodical person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't like to move ahead with </v>

828
00:48:59.561 --> 00:49:04.000
<v Speaker 2>his research at all unless he had nailed</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely everything down in a way that</v>

829
00:49:04.001 --> 00:49:06.550
<v Speaker 2>only an engineer and a software coder </v>
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>

830
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:07.983
<v Speaker 2>And so we started working on personality</v>
<v Speaker 2>models and I've been doing that and </v>

831
00:49:11.591 --> 00:49:14.020
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on that more specifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever since,</v>

832
00:49:14.021 --> 00:49:17.950
<v Speaker 2>as well as writing the more theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 2>material that was associated say with 12</v>

833
00:49:17.951 --> 00:49:20.290
<v Speaker 2>rules for life in maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

834
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's that answer.</v>

835
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Are you aware of any of your critics?</v>

836
00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Are you aware of any critics of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>work who are deep and credible?</v>

837
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>

838
00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:32.633
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who had a minimum had read maps </v>

839
00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:35.440
<v Speaker 2>of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

840
00:49:35.441 --> 00:49:37.570
<v Speaker 2>it's a complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

841
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:38.883
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never read a critic of young who </v>

842
00:49:43.961 --> 00:49:46.180
<v Speaker 2>actually understood what you and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

843
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:47.463
<v Speaker 2>And I actually knew a number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists including Jaak Panksepp who </v>

844
00:49:50.531 --> 00:49:52.930
<v Speaker 2>wrote an affect of neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a great book,</v>

845
00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.400
<v Speaker 2>who is a real admirer of young and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the psychoanalysts.</v>

846
00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:57.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

847
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:59.463
<v Speaker 2>Panksepp was very interested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuro psycho analysis and most of the </v>

848
00:50:02.081 --> 00:50:03.940
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of the people who are interested in</v>

849
00:50:03.941 --> 00:50:04.774
<v Speaker 2>the F in the neuroscience of emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're also very interested in the </v>

850
00:50:07.861 --> 00:50:08.694
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalytic types.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the people who criticize young </v>

851
00:50:10.991 --> 00:50:13.180
<v Speaker 2>don't have a clue what he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

852
00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:15.370
<v Speaker 2>And it's not surprising cause he's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

853
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:16.743
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't come across a credible critic </v>

854
00:50:18.971 --> 00:50:21.580
<v Speaker 2>of maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

855
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:25.510
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that may also be because,</v>

856
00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:28.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until I became notorious,</v>

857
00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:31.050
<v Speaker 2>let's say over the last couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

858
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:33.890
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it influential.</v>

859
00:50:33.891 --> 00:50:36.920
<v Speaker 2>It did pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book did pretty well for a,</v>

860
00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.950
<v Speaker 2>an academic work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was no massive seller,</v>

861
00:50:39.951 --> 00:50:41.770
<v Speaker 2>although it's hit the best seller list </v>
<v Speaker 2>now on the,</v>

862
00:50:41.771 --> 00:50:44.630
<v Speaker 2>in the audio version,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is pretty amusing.</v>

863
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:47.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's The New York Times bestseller</v>
<v Speaker 2>list,</v>

864
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:49.070
<v Speaker 2>given that they wouldn't list 12 rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>for life.</v>

865
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.213
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

866
00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:51.370
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

867
00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:53.590
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the lack of criticism is</v>

868
00:50:53.591 --> 00:50:57.100
<v Speaker 2>a consequence of its lack of influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>or</v>

869
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:02.450
<v Speaker 2>it's difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had social psychologists talk to me</v>

870
00:51:02.451 --> 00:51:04.400
<v Speaker 2>a little bit about the ideas of maps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

871
00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:05.253
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the people that are </v>

872
00:51:06.501 --> 00:51:08.510
<v Speaker 2>interested in such things as terror </v>
<v Speaker 2>management.</v>

873
00:51:08.511 --> 00:51:09.720
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

874
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:11.023
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they usually don't know the </v>

875
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:13.790
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychology and they don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythology.</v>

876
00:51:13.791 --> 00:51:14.624
<v Speaker 2>And there are very few people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>versed in the world of neuropsychology </v>

877
00:51:17.601 --> 00:51:19.910
<v Speaker 2>and in the world of mythology </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>

878
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:21.590
<v Speaker 2>And I'm drawing these parallels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

879
00:51:21.591 --> 00:51:22.790
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

880
00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:27.080
<v Speaker 2>and they're very complicated parallels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I made the assumption,</v>

881
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.033
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I studied these Russian </v>

882
00:51:28.491 --> 00:51:29.324
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vinegar Dova and Sokolov who were </v>

883
00:51:31.821 --> 00:51:34.370
<v Speaker 2>students of Alexander Luria brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>

884
00:51:34.371 --> 00:51:37.670
<v Speaker 2>and they discovered this phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the orienting reflex,</v>

885
00:51:37.671 --> 00:51:39.560
<v Speaker 2>which I wrote a lot about in maps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

886
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:44.210
<v Speaker 2>And the orienting reflex is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>automatic response to what is unknown.</v>

887
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.650
<v Speaker 2>And you have a very deep automatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to what is unknown.</v>

888
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:52.580
<v Speaker 2>And that really means that the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a conceptual category.</v>

889
00:51:52.581 --> 00:51:53.414
<v Speaker 2>And it was my proposition developed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>maps of meaning that the unknown is a </v>

890
00:51:58.941 --> 00:51:59.774
<v Speaker 2>fundamental cognitive category or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>even a fundamental category of reality </v>

891
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:04.003
<v Speaker 2>depending on how you define reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm defining reality </v>

892
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:09.310
<v Speaker 2>phenomenologically as experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

893
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:11.263
<v Speaker 2>but as experienced universally and has </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced biologically by animals and </v>

894
00:52:14.271 --> 00:52:15.990
<v Speaker 2>by human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

895
00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:17.413
<v Speaker 2>the unknown is something like unexplored</v>
<v Speaker 2>territory and it's reasonable to assume </v>

896
00:52:20.781 --> 00:52:25.310
<v Speaker 2>that there's a fundamental distinction </v>
<v Speaker 2>even neurologically between the patterns</v>

897
00:52:25.311 --> 00:52:26.144
<v Speaker 2>of action that are obtained in </v>
<v Speaker 2>territories that you've thoroughly </v>

898
00:52:29.511 --> 00:52:30.344
<v Speaker 2>explored and the pattern of action </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's necessary when you step outside </v>

899
00:52:33.441 --> 00:52:34.274
<v Speaker 2>the domain that you're familiar with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where your reaction as a prey animal or </v>

900
00:52:38.241 --> 00:52:41.210
<v Speaker 2>perhaps as a Predator has to become </v>
<v Speaker 2>paramount.</v>

901
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:42.793
<v Speaker 2>And so the fundamental proposition in </v>
<v Speaker 2>maps of meaning is something like the </v>

902
00:52:46.011 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 2>domain of the unknown that's reflexively</v>
<v Speaker 2>responded to with the orienting reflex,</v>

903
00:52:50.811 --> 00:52:55.010
<v Speaker 2>which is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fundamental reflex and basic to the</v>

904
00:52:55.011 --> 00:52:55.844
<v Speaker 2>entire process of learning itself is </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflected in our mythological </v>

905
00:53:00.591 --> 00:53:04.970
<v Speaker 2>representations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that is a absolutely.</v>

906
00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

907
00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's true,</v>

908
00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:13.610
<v Speaker 2>then it's a profound realization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't exactly say discovery because</v>

909
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:15.503
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you bring two </v>
<v Speaker 2>literatures together that have never </v>

910
00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.400
<v Speaker 2>been conjoined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that constitutes of discovery.</v>

911
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:25.020
<v Speaker 2>But I've certainly never found anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was able.</v>

912
00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

913
00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:27.973
<v Speaker 2>Suggest to me any reason why I should </v>
<v Speaker 2>assume that that hypothesis is </v>

914
00:53:31.891 --> 00:53:32.790
<v Speaker 2>incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

915
00:53:32.791 --> 00:53:33.624
<v Speaker 2>I've had pretty damn bright graduate </v>
<v Speaker 2>students and they've gone off to be </v>

916
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:40.350
<v Speaker 2>credible professors and most of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>have maintained that viewpoint.</v>

917
00:53:40.351 --> 00:53:43.080
<v Speaker 2>And I think calling the youngest </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably foremost among them.</v>

918
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.453
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

919
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:46.403
<v Speaker 1>mmm.</v>

920
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be nice actually,</v>

921
00:53:49.591 --> 00:53:50.424
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I could encounter critics of maps of </v>

922
00:53:52.621 --> 00:53:53.454
<v Speaker 2>meaning who were credible because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure there's some things in it that I </v>

923
00:53:57.061 --> 00:53:59.330
<v Speaker 2>wrote that were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

924
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:02.460
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

925
00:54:02.461 --> 00:54:07.440
<v Speaker 2>I'd be thinking about the damn book </v>
<v Speaker 2>since 1982 and I'd been thinking about a</v>

926
00:54:07.441 --> 00:54:08.274
<v Speaker 2>lot in my work in 12 rules for life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>an extension of what I did in maps of </v>

927
00:54:11.011 --> 00:54:11.844
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't see holes in it and nothing </v>

928
00:54:13.981 --> 00:54:14.814
<v Speaker 2>I've learned since then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that might be a consequence of my </v>

929
00:54:16.441 --> 00:54:18.750
<v Speaker 2>own stupidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a narrow mindedness is,</v>

930
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:24.170
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen any reason to radically </v>
<v Speaker 2>revise the propositions that I put forth</v>

931
00:54:25.531 --> 00:54:29.250
<v Speaker 2>in maps of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're credible.</v>

932
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.653
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's actually more </v>

933
00:54:32.671 --> 00:54:36.540
<v Speaker 2>evidence now that the propositions were </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct then there were,</v>

934
00:54:36.541 --> 00:54:39.720
<v Speaker 2>when I wrote the book originally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea for example,</v>

935
00:54:39.721 --> 00:54:40.554
<v Speaker 2>that our hemispheres are specialized one</v>
<v Speaker 2>for action in the domain of the known </v>

936
00:54:45.871 --> 00:54:48.300
<v Speaker 2>and the other for action in the domain </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the unknown.</v>

937
00:54:48.301 --> 00:54:51.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that's well supported by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>work of um,</v>

938
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:54.480
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No other student of Lyria,</v>

939
00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Greenberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greenberg,</v>

940
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:59.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elk,</v>

941
00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Conan Goldberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elkhorn and Goldberg.</v>

942
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Rama Shondra and as well,</v>

943
00:55:04.091 --> 00:55:05.850
<v Speaker 2>and a neuro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

944
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:09.270
<v Speaker 2>a physician who's well versed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience has,</v>

945
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.460
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a theory that's quite similar.</v>

946
00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:12.793
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

947
00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:14.883
<v Speaker 2>so no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think maps of meaning has been </v>

948
00:55:16.211 --> 00:55:19.600
<v Speaker 2>subject to proper critical evaluation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

949
00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:23.530
<v Speaker 2>and then with regards to critics of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of 12 rules for life,</v>

950
00:55:23.531 --> 00:55:24.364
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time they don't criticize </v>

951
00:55:26.111 --> 00:55:28.660
<v Speaker 2>what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They criticized there,</v>

952
00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:32.740
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ideologically motivated,</v>

953
00:55:32.741 --> 00:55:35.890
<v Speaker 2>pathological oversimplification of who </v>
<v Speaker 2>they wish I was.</v>

954
00:55:35.891 --> 00:55:38.380
<v Speaker 2>So they didn't have to take anything I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said seriously.</v>

955
00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.930
<v Speaker 2>And those people don't constitute </v>
<v Speaker 2>critics.</v>

956
00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:42.550
<v Speaker 2>They constitute,</v>

957
00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:44.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

958
00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:49.560
<v Speaker 2>they constitute the chattering puppets </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

959
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:51.703
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a certain form of ideological </v>

960
00:55:53.781 --> 00:55:54.614
<v Speaker 2>possession.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wesley Yang reported that you met with </v>

961
00:55:59.031 --> 00:56:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Tech Titans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marc Andreessen and Peter Teal,</v>

962
00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:04.370
<v Speaker 2>both of whom advocate decentralized </v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

963
00:56:04.371 --> 00:56:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Can you share anything about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

964
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I dunno if I can share anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

965
00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:12.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean I enjoyed the meeting mark and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter.</v>

966
00:56:12.501 --> 00:56:14.570
<v Speaker 2>I met mark several times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

967
00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.433
<v Speaker 2>I've only met Peter Wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I've spent some time with Eric </v>

968
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein who works with Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

969
00:56:21.141 --> 00:56:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Peter is Libertarian oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

970
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.353
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

971
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:26.323
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

972
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:27.303
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

973
00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.283
<v Speaker 2>he shares concerns about the potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian function of Internet </v>

974
00:56:34.261 --> 00:56:37.740
<v Speaker 2>technology and manifesting itself well </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

975
00:56:37.741 --> 00:56:41.370
<v Speaker 2>in the constant monitoring of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior and also in,</v>

976
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:46.330
<v Speaker 2>in the emergent censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say Marc Andreessen,</v>

977
00:56:46.331 --> 00:56:47.164
<v Speaker 2>well mark's a smart guy and he knows a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of other smart guys and we spent a </v>

978
00:56:50.651 --> 00:56:55.180
<v Speaker 2>lot of time talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of online education and,</v>

979
00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.910
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

980
00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:00.160
<v Speaker 2>but there isn't anything really exciting</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can report about that.</v>

981
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were all preliminary </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions of a sort to see if we could</v>

982
00:57:04.181 --> 00:57:06.970
<v Speaker 2>get long and if we could talk and so far</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been able to,</v>

983
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:12.300
<v Speaker 2>I am making a hair fair bit of headway </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this university project,</v>

984
00:57:12.521 --> 00:57:15.850
<v Speaker 2>although we don't really conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 2>it as a university project anymore.</v>

985
00:57:15.851 --> 00:57:16.684
<v Speaker 2>We're conceptualizing it as an adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning system and we're trying to use </v>

986
00:57:21.701 --> 00:57:22.534
<v Speaker 2>it to index people's no index knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the web funnel money to creative </v>

987
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:28.023
<v Speaker 2>producers of educational content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow people to test their knowledge no </v>

988
00:57:31.811 --> 00:57:32.644
<v Speaker 2>matter how it's generated and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accredit people properly and we'll </v>

989
00:57:35.651 --> 00:57:36.484
<v Speaker 2>release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>release more information about that in </v>

990
00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:41.830
<v Speaker 2>the upcoming months as we move closer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and closer to a functional prototype.</v>

991
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:42.873
<v Speaker 2>The plan at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to lots of people like </v>

992
00:57:44.921 --> 00:57:45.754
<v Speaker 2>Andrea said and teal who who are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in technology and education </v>

993
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.823
<v Speaker 2>who also are very well capitalized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have had the opportunity multiple times </v>

994
00:57:54.281 --> 00:57:57.460
<v Speaker 2>to pull in investors into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>educational project.</v>

995
00:57:57.461 --> 00:58:00.820
<v Speaker 2>But I haven't done that partly because </v>
<v Speaker 2>weirdly enough,</v>

996
00:58:00.821 --> 00:58:01.654
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think money is a solution to a </v>

997
00:58:03.371 --> 00:58:04.480
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also,</v>

998
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:05.583
<v Speaker 2>it's often a problem in and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I generated several million </v>

999
00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:09.611
<v Speaker 2>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1000
00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:13.690
<v Speaker 2>to fund this educational</v>
<v Speaker 2>endeavor,</v>

1001
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:14.733
<v Speaker 2>then I would not only have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how to design the educational </v>

1002
00:58:17.051 --> 00:58:17.884
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I'd have to worry about how to </v>

1003
00:58:18.731 --> 00:58:21.640
<v Speaker 2>spend that money and shepherd that money</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligently.</v>

1004
00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.713
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrative problem of sufficient </v>

1005
00:58:25.691 --> 00:58:28.780
<v Speaker 2>magnitude to stop you from doing any </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative thinking at all.</v>

1006
00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:30.363
<v Speaker 2>So what we're doing instead is I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>funding the university project at the </v>

1007
00:58:33.491 --> 00:58:34.324
<v Speaker 2>moment or the online education project </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of my patriot and </v>

1008
00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:38.164
<v Speaker 2>funding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fix that in about five seconds this </v>

1009
00:58:57.471 --> 00:58:58.790
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1010
00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:59.633
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1011
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm funding that from my patrion </v>
<v Speaker 2>donations in our,</v>

1012
00:59:03.541 --> 00:59:06.220
<v Speaker 2>I like that model better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only problem is,</v>

1013
00:59:06.221 --> 00:59:07.054
<v Speaker 2>is that I would like to offer the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have his employees a certain </v>

1014
00:59:09.641 --> 00:59:12.160
<v Speaker 2>amount of financial stability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1015
00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:13.113
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't obvious to me how stable the </v>

1016
00:59:14.981 --> 00:59:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Patriot on funding is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's been very stable so far,</v>

1017
00:59:17.771 --> 00:59:20.020
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows how that will work out.</v>

1018
00:59:20.021 --> 00:59:25.021
<v Speaker 2>So I think what we're going to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowdfund in October or November once we</v>

1019
00:59:26.511 --> 00:59:29.570
<v Speaker 2>have a minimal viable product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1020
00:59:29.571 --> 00:59:30.404
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd rather do that than raise </v>
<v Speaker 2>money privately anyways because I don't </v>

1021
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:36.710
<v Speaker 2>want this project to be beholden to </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>

1022
00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:37.873
<v Speaker 2>And I wanted to maintain control over </v>
<v Speaker 2>its direction with a small group of </v>

1023
00:59:41.871 --> 00:59:42.800
<v Speaker 2>programmers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1024
00:59:42.801 --> 00:59:43.634
<v Speaker 2>it's often a small group of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are working tightly together that solve </v>

1025
00:59:46.281 --> 00:59:47.600
<v Speaker 2>very complicated problems.</v>

1026
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.550
<v Speaker 2>And that's certainly been the case with </v>
<v Speaker 2>working,</v>

1027
00:59:49.551 --> 00:59:50.384
<v Speaker 2>say with Daniel Higgins and Robert Peel </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the self authoring programs and so </v>

1028
00:59:53.541 --> 00:59:55.010
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Small team.</v>

1029
00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:56.143
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've thought about going the venture </v>

1030
00:59:57.111 --> 01:00:00.410
<v Speaker 2>capital route and expanding and trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make a big business out of it.</v>

1031
01:00:00.411 --> 01:00:04.070
<v Speaker 2>But our sense was more that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe we were wrong about this,</v>

1032
01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:04.904
<v Speaker 2>but that was better to go directly after</v>
<v Speaker 2>customers and to build the business </v>

1033
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:08.744
<v Speaker 2>incrementally and to test it along each </v>
<v Speaker 2>step and not to get enticed by the </v>

1034
01:00:13.101 --> 01:00:16.760
<v Speaker 2>possibility of Unicorn level money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1035
01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

1036
01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.290
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the situation there.</v>

1037
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:24.140
<v Speaker 2>And I've got three really bright people </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on this,</v>

1038
01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.353
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open educational platform and it's </v>

1039
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:30.590
<v Speaker 2>really quite exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say we're,</v>

1040
01:00:30.591 --> 01:00:33.530
<v Speaker 2>we're well ahead of schedule from where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we would be.</v>

1041
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.633
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you spoken to Nassim to lab </v>

1042
01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.770
<v Speaker 2>following your brief twitter exchange?</v>

1043
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Would love to hear a conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the two of you?</v>

1044
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.670
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to talk to him too because he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1045
01:00:43.671 --> 01:00:44.960
<v Speaker 2>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

1046
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:48.780
<v Speaker 2>he's touchy though and so I have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>apprehension about that.</v>

1047
01:00:48.781 --> 01:00:49.614
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to lots of touchy people </v>

1048
01:00:50.541 --> 01:00:53.420
<v Speaker 2>over the last couple of years and I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit apprehensive about it,</v>

1049
01:00:53.421 --> 01:00:56.150
<v Speaker 2>but I would like to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people I'd like to talk</v>

1050
01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:59.140
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of them in and you know,</v>

1051
01:00:59.141 --> 01:00:59.974
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a hard time setting up those </v>

1052
01:01:01.281 --> 01:01:03.770
<v Speaker 2>conversations at the moment because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing so much touring.</v>

1053
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:04.783
<v Speaker 2>I am talking again to Jonathan Heit </v>
<v Speaker 2>though in the near future and I think </v>

1054
01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:11.870
<v Speaker 2>probably to Steven pinker as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1055
01:01:11.871 --> 01:01:14.160
<v Speaker 2>for those of you who are wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1056
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I am going to release the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so is Sam.</v>

1057
01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:23.291
<v Speaker 2>We're going to release the videos from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sam Harris Peterson debates.</v>

1058
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put them on my youtube channel.</v>

1059
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll put them on his will,</v>

1060
01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:28.484
<v Speaker 2>make them into podcasts as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to just release the first one </v>

1061
01:01:31.131 --> 01:01:35.810
<v Speaker 2>on September 1st and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone will have access to it.</v>

1062
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:36.833
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's taken us a while to figure out </v>

1063
01:01:38.241 --> 01:01:39.074
<v Speaker 2>exactly how to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because Travis Pangbourne who </v>

1064
01:01:41.151 --> 01:01:41.984
<v Speaker 2>hosted the events,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to raise some money with the </v>

1065
01:01:43.971 --> 01:01:45.530
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1066
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.510
<v Speaker 2>at least in part to help offset the </v>
<v Speaker 2>costs that he incurred for those events,</v>

1067
01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:53.030
<v Speaker 2>which were very expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

1068
01:01:53.031 --> 01:01:56.780
<v Speaker 2>and difficult to generate a profit for </v>
<v Speaker 2>from on his end.</v>

1069
01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:58.043
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also he wants to translate the </v>

1070
01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:05.810
<v Speaker 2>material that he already has into </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple languages.</v>

1071
01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:10.250
<v Speaker 2>So we agreed to let him when we had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a three way agreement for this,</v>

1072
01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:11.084
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Sam was involved and I was </v>

1073
01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.820
<v Speaker 2>involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was paying burn and so,</v>

1074
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.160
<v Speaker 2>and we didn't know how the events would </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1075
01:02:16.161 --> 01:02:16.994
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we weren't actually that concerned </v>

1076
01:02:17.991 --> 01:02:20.760
<v Speaker 2>with the damn videos to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we take,</v>

1077
01:02:20.761 --> 01:02:21.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1078
01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:22.560
<v Speaker 2>we'd take an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1079
01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:23.603
<v Speaker 2>a risk.</v>

1080
01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not complaining about this by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1081
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.940
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not complaining about taking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk,</v>

1082
01:02:26.941 --> 01:02:28.340
<v Speaker 2>but we didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salmon,</v>

1083
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't even met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1084
01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:32.370
<v Speaker 2>we didn't know if you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations that were worthwhile.</v>

1085
01:02:32.371 --> 01:02:34.650
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know if anybody would show up </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the events.</v>

1086
01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:35.723
<v Speaker 2>And so we were way more concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not we'd get a crowd of any </v>

1087
01:02:37.951 --> 01:02:38.784
<v Speaker 2>sort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether the events would be successful </v>

1088
01:02:39.841 --> 01:02:44.841
<v Speaker 2>and whether we could actually talk then </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we would do with the videos if the,</v>

1089
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:48.180
<v Speaker 2>or even if there would be videos if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>events were successful.</v>

1090
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.440
<v Speaker 2>And so it turned out that we couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk and we did have useful discussions.</v>

1091
01:02:52.441 --> 01:02:53.274
<v Speaker 2>At least we thought so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the audiences responded very well </v>

1092
01:02:55.741 --> 01:02:58.200
<v Speaker 2>and there was large crowds and so it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

1093
01:02:58.201 --> 01:03:00.420
<v Speaker 2>So then it turned out that the videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>were worthwhile,</v>

1094
01:03:00.421 --> 01:03:05.421
<v Speaker 2>but we hadn't discussed who had control </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the videos or who was going to edit</v>

1095
01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:07.380
<v Speaker 2>them or any of those things.</v>

1096
01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.290
<v Speaker 2>And we had to do that post hoc after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>

1097
01:03:10.291 --> 01:03:11.124
<v Speaker 2>which isn't the best way of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it took travis awhile to </v>

1098
01:03:14.551 --> 01:03:16.770
<v Speaker 2>assemble a team to do the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>editing.</v>

1099
01:03:16.771 --> 01:03:20.190
<v Speaker 2>And so that was our compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1100
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.053
<v Speaker 2>it would've been better if we could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>released the videos and all of that </v>

1101
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:26.400
<v Speaker 2>immediately after the talks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1102
01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:30.000
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing something new and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know exactly what you're doing,</v>

1103
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:34.470
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to do it perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we didn't do that perfectly,</v>

1104
01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:35.304
<v Speaker 2>but the events were good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I enjoyed talking to Sam and I </v>

1105
01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.460
<v Speaker 2>learned a lot from the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really had to sharpen my thinking.</v>

1106
01:03:41.461 --> 01:03:43.140
<v Speaker 2>I really figured out something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1107
01:03:43.141 --> 01:03:43.974
<v Speaker 2>I figured out that I think the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental issue here is how you take </v>

1108
01:03:48.181 --> 01:03:51.840
<v Speaker 2>the infinite world of facts that </v>
<v Speaker 2>presents itself to you,</v>

1109
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:54.900
<v Speaker 2>independent of the value of those facts.</v>

1110
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.890
<v Speaker 2>So value neutral facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have to be filtered to a single</v>

1111
01:03:58.891 --> 01:03:59.724
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a single point of perception </v>

1112
01:04:01.501 --> 01:04:02.334
<v Speaker 2>because you have to point your eyes at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing and your attention at one </v>

1113
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:05.064
<v Speaker 2>thing and a single point of action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a tremendous reducing of </v>

1114
01:04:08.731 --> 01:04:09.564
<v Speaker 2>the world of fact to the extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple and targeted rule of Vail or </v>

1115
01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:15.984
<v Speaker 2>world of value and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain is the instrument that does </v>

1116
01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:21.624
<v Speaker 2>that reducing and it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in keeping with Elvis Huxley's </v>

1117
01:04:24.811 --> 01:04:25.644
<v Speaker 2>suppositions about and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were motivated by Henri </v>

1118
01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.293
<v Speaker 2>Bergson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the brain was a reducing </v>

1119
01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:32.334
<v Speaker 2>valve and that what psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience did was open the doors of </v>

1120
01:04:34.711 --> 01:04:35.544
<v Speaker 2>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something William Blake also talked </v>

1121
01:04:37.051 --> 01:04:37.884
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The brain seems to be in some sense the </v>

1122
01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:41.963
<v Speaker 2>part of the structure that reduces the </v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite complexity of the world of </v>

1123
01:04:44.701 --> 01:04:49.110
<v Speaker 2>facts to the finite and single point </v>
<v Speaker 2>domain of world of values.</v>

1124
01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.153
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly neurologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>instantiated and partly sociologically </v>

1125
01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:57.870
<v Speaker 2>instantiated as we come to a negotiated </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement about what constitutes value,</v>

1126
01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:01.080
<v Speaker 2>just like we do about what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>value economically.</v>

1127
01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:06.380
<v Speaker 2>And so the structure that reduces facts </v>
<v Speaker 2>to values is a reducing structure that's</v>

1128
01:05:07.861 --> 01:05:08.694
<v Speaker 2>similar caneously in Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shelia instantiated neurologically and </v>

1129
01:05:11.071 --> 01:05:14.100
<v Speaker 2>sociologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I understand that a lot more clearly</v>

1130
01:05:14.101 --> 01:05:17.440
<v Speaker 2>because I had these discussions with Sam</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm writing a lot about that in this</v>

1131
01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:19.060
<v Speaker 2>next book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1132
01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:20.143
<v Speaker 2>it's a followup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I s I suspect that's the plan at the </v>

1133
01:05:22.721 --> 01:05:26.410
<v Speaker 2>moment to 12 rules for life because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had written originally 40 rules,</v>

1134
01:05:26.411 --> 01:05:29.860
<v Speaker 2>so I have more to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written about half the new book and</v>

1135
01:05:29.861 --> 01:05:30.694
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot of time writing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part what I had to become </v>

1136
01:05:34.361 --> 01:05:37.090
<v Speaker 2>clearer about as a consequence of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions with Harris.</v>

1137
01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.510
<v Speaker 2>And so I took a look at the videos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1138
01:05:39.511 --> 01:05:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I think the debates were productive and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their audiences seem to find them.</v>

1139
01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:44.390
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and certainly salmon.</v>

1140
01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed meeting him.</v>

1141
01:05:46.361 --> 01:05:49.180
<v Speaker 2>We got along quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has much better sense of humor than I</v>

1142
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:51.250
<v Speaker 2>presumed from listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1143
01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:52.930
<v Speaker 2>from the two podcasts we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

1144
01:05:52.931 --> 01:05:55.030
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't in great humor when I did those</v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

1145
01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:57.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1146
01:05:57.461 --> 01:05:58.294
<v Speaker 2>I also think that I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say I'm a fan of Sam's </v>

1147
01:06:02.861 --> 01:06:04.390
<v Speaker 2>motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1148
01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.490
<v Speaker 2>or at least as far as I could determine </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1149
01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.353
<v Speaker 2>I mean he wants to ground the world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>value in something that isn't merely </v>

1150
01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:13.270
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Fair enough,</v>

1151
01:06:13.271 --> 01:06:14.260
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good,</v>

1152
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:19.420
<v Speaker 2>that's a good aim to ground ethics in </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that it's solid.</v>

1153
01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1154
01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.153
<v Speaker 2>and not just arbitrary opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the devil's in the </v>

1155
01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:24.604
<v Speaker 2>details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's basically what we </v>

1156
01:06:26.201 --> 01:06:27.670
<v Speaker 2>discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1157
01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:28.504
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1158
01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:30.550
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1159
01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:31.383
<v Speaker 2>How do you reconcile studies that show </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic superseding environment in life </v>

1160
01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:37.720
<v Speaker 2>outcomes with your own experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>conducting successful psychotherapy?</v>

1161
01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:40.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1162
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1163
01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:43.143
<v Speaker 2>that I've really come to realize more </v>
<v Speaker 2>and more in the last three or four </v>

1164
01:06:47.411 --> 01:06:48.244
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly I would say from dealing with my </v>

1165
01:06:49.361 --> 01:06:50.194
<v Speaker 2>own health problems to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also watching the health problems </v>

1166
01:06:53.711 --> 01:06:55.550
<v Speaker 2>that my daughter had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1167
01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of what we think of as </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental illness is physical illness.</v>

1168
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:04.930
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more than we think even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1169
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:08.080
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that is reflected in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the genetic studies.</v>

1170
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.333
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1171
01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.393
<v Speaker 2>but I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also still think that that doesn't </v>

1172
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:18.220
<v Speaker 2>eliminate the rule of learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1173
01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:19.103
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people obviously learn and they can </v>

1174
01:07:21.221 --> 01:07:22.054
<v Speaker 2>learn better or worse and they learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>better when they voluntary voluntarily </v>

1175
01:07:25.391 --> 01:07:26.224
<v Speaker 2>approach things that are frightening and</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatening and they challenged </v>

1176
01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:30.130
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1177
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:33.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's made me more humble,</v>

1178
01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:34.713
<v Speaker 2>I would say in some sense both as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person and as a psychotherapist because </v>

1179
01:07:38.801 --> 01:07:39.634
<v Speaker 2>I'm more attuned to the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently psychological difficulties </v>

1180
01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:44.674
<v Speaker 2>that my clients might be experiencing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a consequence of an underlying </v>

1181
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:51.970
<v Speaker 2>destabilization of physical health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really unwilling to discount that.</v>

1182
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if what they're experiencing is </v>

1183
01:07:54.131 --> 01:07:54.964
<v Speaker 2>very idiosyncratic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it still seems to me that there is </v>

1184
01:07:58.121 --> 01:07:58.954
<v Speaker 2>credible evidence that exposure to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what you would rather avoid is </v>

1185
01:08:04.361 --> 01:08:05.194
<v Speaker 2>curative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so is the weaving together of a </v>

1186
01:08:07.361 --> 01:08:12.361
<v Speaker 2>coherent and a coherent map or narrative</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your experience.</v>

1187
01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I believe that those doctrines are </v>
<v Speaker 2>solid.</v>

1188
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what psychotherapists do.</v>

1189
01:08:17.871 --> 01:08:18.704
<v Speaker 2>Essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they help you get your story straight </v>

1190
01:08:20.271 --> 01:08:22.310
<v Speaker 2>about your past and your present and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your future.</v>

1191
01:08:22.311 --> 01:08:24.530
<v Speaker 2>They help you establish your point in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1192
01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.633
<v Speaker 2>They help you lay out a map so that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can negotiate through the territory of </v>

1193
01:08:30.141 --> 01:08:31.010
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>

1194
01:08:31.011 --> 01:08:31.844
<v Speaker 2>present and future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they help you develop strategies to </v>

1195
01:08:33.741 --> 01:08:34.574
<v Speaker 2>deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to help deal with emergent complexity </v>

1196
01:08:37.101 --> 01:08:40.190
<v Speaker 2>and the fear that goes along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1197
01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:42.133
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1198
01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Michael Tom Rose House,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very hard question.</v>

1199
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Please comment on young Paulie's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Wolfgang Paulie's.</v>

1200
01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:08.243
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mundus hypothesis one world hypothesis </v>

1201
01:09:10.501 --> 01:09:11.780
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1202
01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.570
<v Speaker 2>so Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Ross ass,</v>

1203
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:39.540
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got frozen there again momentarily.</v>

1204
01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Please comment on Yom [inaudible] Mundus</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis.</v>

1205
01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Does this correlate with quantum theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>solutions to the hard problem?</v>

1206
01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:51.770
<v Speaker 2>Eg Penrose Hameroff or church or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or C,</v>

1207
01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:54.750
<v Speaker 2>H R I don't know what orange or is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know penrose and Hameroff.</v>

1208
01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an admirer of the pen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Penrose and Hameroff,</v>

1209
01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:00.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt to reduce consciousness to,</v>

1210
01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.130
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1211
01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.193
<v Speaker 2>microtubule function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics and microtubule </v>

1212
01:10:05.791 --> 01:10:08.040
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did my best to understand it.</v>

1213
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed hollow to me.</v>

1214
01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:14.670
<v Speaker 2>My experience has generally been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I find something incomprehensible and</v>

1215
01:10:14.671 --> 01:10:16.200
<v Speaker 2>hollow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it generally is.</v>

1216
01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read better books on consciousness,</v>

1217
01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:21.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the user illusion,</v>

1218
01:10:21.061 --> 01:10:23.130
<v Speaker 2>which I really liked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the user illusion,</v>

1219
01:10:23.131 --> 01:10:23.964
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Jeffrey Gray wrote a good book on </v>

1220
01:10:24.901 --> 01:10:26.770
<v Speaker 2>consciousness as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1221
01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:28.351
<v Speaker 2>the only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Paulie,</v>

1222
01:10:28.351 --> 01:10:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be able to answer this </v>
<v Speaker 2>question very well cause I'm starting to</v>

1223
01:10:30.721 --> 01:10:32.860
<v Speaker 2>get a bit worn out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1224
01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Wolfgang and Pauli and young recognized </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1225
01:10:40.050 --> 01:10:42.060
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really a complicated problem.</v>

1226
01:10:44.610 --> 01:10:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can answer this.</v>

1227
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's try this.</v>

1228
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:52.223
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been years since I thought about </v>

1229
01:10:53.191 --> 01:10:55.620
<v Speaker 2>this and wrote about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see how I can do.</v>

1230
01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:06.300
<v Speaker 2>You could think about this from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of psg,</v>

1231
01:11:06.301 --> 01:11:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Hattie and constructivism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that what you confront.</v>

1232
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1233
01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:13.613
<v Speaker 2>What you fundamentally in the world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is unknowable and what is </v>

1234
01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:22.830
<v Speaker 2>unknowable has an intrinsic meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's both frightening and compelling.</v>

1235
01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:23.963
<v Speaker 2>Simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it activates Predator detection systems </v>

1236
01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:29.394
<v Speaker 2>that protect you in the way that a prey </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal is protected by freezing and </v>

1237
01:11:33.481 --> 01:11:34.314
<v Speaker 2>withdrawal and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also makes you curious so that </v>

1238
01:11:38.191 --> 01:11:39.024
<v Speaker 2>which you do not understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something that you can </v>

1239
01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:45.240
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize as that which has not yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>been made.</v>

1240
01:11:45.241 --> 01:11:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Habitable world has an intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

1241
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.593
<v Speaker 2>Now the question is whether the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental stuff of the world is that </v>

1242
01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:58.920
<v Speaker 2>meaningful unknown or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>

1243
01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.053
<v Speaker 2>You can make the case that what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize as material is actually a </v>

1244
01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:11.871
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic reconceptualization of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning of the ambivalent meaning of the</v>

1245
01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.710
<v Speaker 2>unknowable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I know that that's hard.</v>

1246
01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:22.890
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard concept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but imagine you see,</v>

1247
01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:24.173
<v Speaker 2>it depends on whether or not you believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our descriptions of material </v>

1248
01:12:26.731 --> 01:12:27.564
<v Speaker 2>reality are the superordinate </v>
<v Speaker 2>descriptions of reality or whether our </v>

1249
01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:34.403
<v Speaker 2>conceptualization of material is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a form of pragmatic tool use </v>

1250
01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.780
<v Speaker 2>that's oriented towards our survival and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not an easy thing to sort out.</v>

1251
01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:48.510
<v Speaker 2>It's something that I did try to sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to some degree with Sam,</v>

1252
01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:49.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is do we have an objective description </v>

1253
01:12:52.711 --> 01:12:53.544
<v Speaker 2>of reality and his reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that can be objectively </v>

1254
01:12:55.591 --> 01:12:56.424
<v Speaker 2>described or are we using a technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>that produces so called objective </v>

1255
01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:05.550
<v Speaker 2>representations to facilitate our tool </v>
<v Speaker 2>use?</v>

1256
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.930
<v Speaker 2>And it's a hard question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1257
01:13:06.931 --> 01:13:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously our advanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>

1258
01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:14.630
<v Speaker 2>which we use in a tool like fashion is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of our materialist science.</v>

1259
01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:16.043
<v Speaker 2>Which begs the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the science is the fundamental </v>

1260
01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:22.260
<v Speaker 2>purpose of the science descriptive or </v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic?</v>

1261
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.153
<v Speaker 2>Now I think I tend to think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic because I think our </v>

1262
01:13:25.321 --> 01:13:28.260
<v Speaker 2>fundamental problem is a problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>survival.</v>

1263
01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:30.023
<v Speaker 2>So there's a way of looking at the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the fundamental reality is the </v>

1264
01:13:35.581 --> 01:13:39.690
<v Speaker 2>chaotic potential that gives rise to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear and curiosity.</v>

1265
01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:42.060
<v Speaker 2>And that's how your nervous system </v>
<v Speaker 2>response by the way,</v>

1266
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.580
<v Speaker 2>and see that's interesting to me because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1267
01:13:44.581 --> 01:13:49.581
<v Speaker 2>well it's a truism of evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology that what your nervous system is</v>

1268
01:13:50.251 --> 01:13:51.084
<v Speaker 2>adapted to what you're adapted to as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of view three and a half </v>

1269
01:13:53.581 --> 01:13:56.310
<v Speaker 2>billion years of evolution is reality.</v>

1270
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:58.620
<v Speaker 2>And that there's no other real way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>defining it.</v>

1271
01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:04.070
<v Speaker 2>And so the way your brain construes </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality is as if what you're confronting</v>

1272
01:14:05.161 --> 01:14:05.994
<v Speaker 2>is an indeterminant chaotic potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>that first generates something like </v>

1273
01:14:10.411 --> 01:14:13.060
<v Speaker 2>apprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear and curiosity.</v>

1274
01:14:13.061 --> 01:14:13.894
<v Speaker 2>Secondarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the apprehension to freeze you so that </v>

1275
01:14:15.971 --> 01:14:16.804
<v Speaker 2>you don't get eaten or destroyed and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity to allow you to engage with </v>

1276
01:14:20.531 --> 01:14:21.364
<v Speaker 2>what's known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to transform it into habitable </v>

1277
01:14:24.011 --> 01:14:27.670
<v Speaker 2>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in large part consists of tools.</v>

1278
01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.133
<v Speaker 2>Now the Munis Mundus that Paulie and </v>
<v Speaker 2>young talked about seems to me to be </v>

1279
01:14:34.781 --> 01:14:39.781
<v Speaker 2>associated with this idea of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic potential.</v>

1280
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:44.920
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's related to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>physicist wheeler's proposition,</v>

1281
01:14:44.921 --> 01:14:45.754
<v Speaker 2>that the fundamental reality of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is information rather than </v>

1282
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:52.270
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That material is a secondary,</v>

1283
01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.233
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a secondary manifestation of </v>

1284
01:14:57.341 --> 01:15:01.000
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that what we confront in the</v>

1285
01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:02.020
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

1286
01:15:02.021 --> 01:15:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're driven by the past </v>
<v Speaker 2>and or determined by the president.</v>

1287
01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:10.180
<v Speaker 2>I think what we do is we apprehend the </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential of the future,</v>

1288
01:15:10.181 --> 01:15:12.590
<v Speaker 2>that chaotic potential of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1289
01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:32.320
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Tohu wa Bohu,</v>

1290
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.393
<v Speaker 2>which is the chaotic potential that God </v>
<v Speaker 2>confronted with the logos at the </v>

1291
01:15:37.421 --> 01:15:39.250
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time in Genesis.</v>

1292
01:15:39.251 --> 01:15:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I think the genesis story is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflection of that fundamental truth.</v>

1293
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:46.360
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that capability </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterizes us.</v>

1294
01:15:46.361 --> 01:15:51.361
<v Speaker 2>And so the onus Mundus is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>informational substrate that constitutes</v>

1295
01:15:52.151 --> 01:15:55.510
<v Speaker 2>the world before it's divided into </v>
<v Speaker 2>psyche.</v>

1296
01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:58.510
<v Speaker 2>So that would be spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be human spirit and consciousness</v>

1297
01:15:58.690 --> 01:16:01.540
<v Speaker 2>and material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's something underneath that.</v>

1298
01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:04.270
<v Speaker 2>And this is what young and Paulie we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving out in my understanding,</v>

1299
01:16:04.271 --> 01:16:09.271
<v Speaker 2>there's something underneath that which </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the pre division unity of reality.</v>

1300
01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:14.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's something like the Tohu wa </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bohu or the tail,</v>

1301
01:16:14.351 --> 01:16:16.690
<v Speaker 2>which is etymologically cognate by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1302
01:16:16.691 --> 01:16:17.524
<v Speaker 2>with the word Tiamat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Tiamat is the goddess that the </v>

1303
01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:21.543
<v Speaker 2>message Damien Creator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Marduk confronted and cut into </v>

1304
01:16:25.961 --> 01:16:26.794
<v Speaker 2>pieces and made the world from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's all outlined in maps of </v>

1305
01:16:29.411 --> 01:16:30.244
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although not so much the onus Mundus </v>

1306
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.420
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1307
01:16:34.421 --> 01:16:35.650
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't thought about that for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>

1308
01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:36.513
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these were in papers I never </v>

1309
01:16:37.661 --> 01:16:39.550
<v Speaker 2>published because they were too damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

1310
01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:42.040
<v Speaker 2>And I tried to publish them a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>times with people.</v>

1311
01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.243
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1312
01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:04.320
<v Speaker 2>But people didn't understand what I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about and you know,</v>

1313
01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:06.790
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't even thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man.</v>

1314
01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:25.503
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1315
01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:26.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1316
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:31.430
<v Speaker 2>here's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1317
01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:03.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rate at which my camera equipment is</v>

1318
01:18:05.401 --> 01:18:06.234
<v Speaker 2>crashing seems to be accelerating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it appears that discussion of the </v>

1319
01:18:10.591 --> 01:18:11.880
<v Speaker 2>onus Mundus is</v>

1320
01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.950
<v Speaker 2>irritating the structure of reality in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some manner.</v>

1321
01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get back to it for a minute.</v>

1322
01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:21.260
<v Speaker 2>So this is a different way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualizing the world.</v>

1323
01:18:21.261 --> 01:18:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a phenomenological </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

1324
01:18:23.631 --> 01:18:25.550
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know what to make of it.</v>

1325
01:18:25.551 --> 01:18:30.551
<v Speaker 2>So think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like your left hemisphere is</v>

1326
01:18:31.191 --> 01:18:34.160
<v Speaker 2>specialized for operation in territory </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you understand.</v>

1327
01:18:34.161 --> 01:18:34.994
<v Speaker 2>So it's specialized for operation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those places where behavioral patterns </v>

1328
01:18:38.871 --> 01:18:39.704
<v Speaker 2>have been made habitual and explicit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas the right hemisphere is </v>

1329
01:18:43.461 --> 01:18:47.390
<v Speaker 2>specialized for response to chaos itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the unknown.</v>

1330
01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:51.770
<v Speaker 2>And what that implies is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>division that's expressed,</v>

1331
01:18:51.771 --> 01:18:52.604
<v Speaker 2>for example in the in Yang symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially chaos and order is </v>

1332
01:18:55.641 --> 01:18:56.474
<v Speaker 2>actually actually represents something </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental about the structure of </v>

1333
01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:01.220
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>

1334
01:19:01.221 --> 01:19:02.054
<v Speaker 2>well only the structure of reality in so</v>
<v Speaker 2>far as biological organisms </v>

1335
01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:05.804
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if we can talk about </v>

1336
01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:11.810
<v Speaker 2>the structure of reality outside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptions of biological organisms.</v>

1337
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.883
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're a strict believer in </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective material reality in that </v>

1338
01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:18.170
<v Speaker 2>transcended existence of strict material</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

1339
01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:19.430
<v Speaker 2>then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1340
01:19:19.431 --> 01:19:20.264
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course you could talk about it </v>

1341
01:19:20.661 --> 01:19:21.494
<v Speaker 2>because strict material reality exists </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the absence of biology and </v>

1342
01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:25.634
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't so obvious to me that </v>

1343
01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:33.280
<v Speaker 2>material reality does exist in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absence of consciousness because I can't</v>

1344
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:37.250
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize what existence would mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the absence of consciousness.</v>

1345
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Like is there time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is their duration,</v>

1346
01:19:39.501 --> 01:19:42.740
<v Speaker 2>is their size?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these things are relative.</v>

1347
01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:43.753
<v Speaker 2>In some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these things presuppose a </v>

1348
01:19:45.261 --> 01:19:48.560
<v Speaker 2>conscious observer even in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>materialist description.</v>

1349
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:54.430
<v Speaker 2>So it looks to me like what reality is </v>
<v Speaker 2>is this newness Mundus that union Paulie</v>

1350
01:19:55.371 --> 01:19:57.890
<v Speaker 2>we're pointing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's chaotic potential.</v>

1351
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.903
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that we treat each other </v>

1352
01:20:00.351 --> 01:20:03.410
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm treating you properly,</v>

1353
01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:04.483
<v Speaker 2>then I treat you as if you're a moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>agent who is actively engaged in the </v>

1354
01:20:07.741 --> 01:20:08.574
<v Speaker 2>transformation of the chaotic potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>that manifest itself as the dawning of </v>

1355
01:20:13.321 --> 01:20:15.570
<v Speaker 2>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that attracts your attention.</v>

1356
01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:18.070
<v Speaker 2>I treat you as if you're an act of moral</v>
<v Speaker 2>engage,</v>

1357
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:19.103
<v Speaker 2>active moral agent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged in making the moral decisions </v>

1358
01:20:21.841 --> 01:20:25.770
<v Speaker 2>that determine how that potential is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to manifest itself.</v>

1359
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:29.100
<v Speaker 2>And if I don't treat you that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm patronizing.</v>

1360
01:20:29.101 --> 01:20:29.934
<v Speaker 2>I don't give you your full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't grant you your full stature as </v>

1361
01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:35.760
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a a sovereign being.</v>

1362
01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:40.680
<v Speaker 2>And I impinge upon your knit at your </v>
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic value,</v>

1363
01:20:40.681 --> 01:20:44.430
<v Speaker 2>the same value that that allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim,</v>

1364
01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:48.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the existence of natural rights and also</v>

1365
01:20:48.001 --> 01:20:50.460
<v Speaker 2>the presence I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of natural responsibility.</v>

1366
01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.473
<v Speaker 2>So I treat you as if you're well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say made in the image of God in </v>

1367
01:20:55.621 --> 01:20:56.454
<v Speaker 2>the genesis terminology that you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the process that turns the Tohu </v>

1368
01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:05.040
<v Speaker 2>wa Bohu of should I never pronounced </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

1369
01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into habitable order.</v>

1370
01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:10.530
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's the soonest </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mundus.</v>

1371
01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:14.040
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's reflected in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your neurological structure.</v>

1372
01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:14.873
<v Speaker 2>And I think the fact that it's reflected</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your neurological structure and in </v>

1373
01:21:17.221 --> 01:21:18.054
<v Speaker 2>the neurological structure of animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this almost universal dual </v>

1374
01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:27.450
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere neurological structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which also by the way is it is something</v>

1375
01:21:27.451 --> 01:21:29.400
<v Speaker 2>that's necessary even in neural </v>
<v Speaker 2>networks,</v>

1376
01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:34.080
<v Speaker 2>which is where we got the idea for </v>
<v Speaker 2>plasticity and stability by the way,</v>

1377
01:21:34.081 --> 01:21:34.914
<v Speaker 2>for the in the big five aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scale models in the higher order </v>

1378
01:21:36.841 --> 01:21:38.670
<v Speaker 2>personality factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1379
01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:40.463
<v Speaker 2>I think the fact that that bifurcation </v>
<v Speaker 2>is reflected in neurology is a </v>

1380
01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:48.930
<v Speaker 2>reflection of the fact that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it exists in reality.</v>

1381
01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defining reality is no simple thing.</v>

1382
01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:53.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1383
01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:56.250
<v Speaker 2>you can think about it as an objective </v>
<v Speaker 2>materials,</v>

1384
01:21:56.260 --> 01:22:01.020
<v Speaker 2>but you can also think of reality as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sum total of that which is experienced.</v>

1385
01:22:01.230 --> 01:22:02.063
<v Speaker 2>And those aren't the same things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They aren't the same fundamental </v>

1386
01:22:04.201 --> 01:22:05.034
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that we've predicated our </v>

1387
01:22:08.431 --> 01:22:09.264
<v Speaker 2>society in so far as our society is </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional on the proposition that each </v>

1388
01:22:14.371 --> 01:22:18.380
<v Speaker 2>individual is a sovereign entity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1389
01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:19.733
<v Speaker 2>what would you say characterized by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spark of divinity that uses the </v>

1390
01:22:23.431 --> 01:22:24.264
<v Speaker 2>responsible truthful word to confront </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chaos of potential and generate the </v>

1391
01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:30.900
<v Speaker 2>habitable order?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is good.</v>

1392
01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.393
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1393
01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:48.693
<v Speaker 2>I think we act out and look guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to call it a night eight </v>

1394
01:22:54.231 --> 01:22:55.064
<v Speaker 2>because obviously this has gotta be </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting somewhat annoying for you to be </v>

1395
01:22:58.871 --> 01:23:03.871
<v Speaker 2>constantly interrupted by these idiot </v>
<v Speaker 2>software crashes and um,</v>

1396
01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:07.990
<v Speaker 2>it's also approaching nine o'clock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even with the delays,</v>

1397
01:23:07.991 --> 01:23:12.991
<v Speaker 2>that's a good hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think maybe we'll call it a day</v>

1398
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:16.360
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get too many questions,</v>

1399
01:23:16.361 --> 01:23:18.400
<v Speaker 2>although some of them were very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complicated.</v>

1400
01:23:18.401 --> 01:23:19.234
<v Speaker 2>And I would like to thank you for tuning</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and maybe I can remind you again </v>

1401

<v Speaker 2>understand myself.com and the discount </v>

1403
01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:36.880

1404
01:23:36.881 --> 01:23:40.000
<v Speaker 2>that's how people experience them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can do that.</v>

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:09.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks very much for tuning in and,</v>

1413
01:24:09.851 --> 01:24:11.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope you enjoyed the discussion.</v>

1414
01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:17.020
<v Speaker 2>It got quite well far beyond what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it would get too.</v>

1415
01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:18.063
<v Speaker 2>I haven't talked about that newness </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mundus idea for a long time and it's </v>

1416
01:24:20.801 --> 01:24:22.210
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very radical idea.</v>

1417
01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.410
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of central.</v>

1418
01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:46.100
<v Speaker 2>That idea is central,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1419
01:24:46.101 --> 01:24:46.934
<v Speaker 2>or at least central in an implicit sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>to maps of meaning and God fucking </v>

1420
01:24:53.871 --> 01:24:54.704
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1421
01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:01.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1422
01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:04.010
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

1423
01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:04.873
<v Speaker 2>obviously the technological problems are</v>
<v Speaker 2>mounting it exponentially by all </v>

1424
01:25:09.441 --> 01:25:12.230
<v Speaker 2>appearances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to call it a night.</v>

1425
01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1426
01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:16.760
<v Speaker 2>good luck to all of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your lives together,</v>

1427
01:25:16.761 --> 01:25:17.870
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1428
01:25:20.650 --> 01:25:22.990
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a good thing for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including you,</v>

1429
01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:26.740
<v Speaker 2>but also everyone else and maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure of the world itself.</v>

1430
01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:30.850
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that's true by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for what that's worth.</v>

1431
01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

1432
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:32.583
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>

1433
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:41.443
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
