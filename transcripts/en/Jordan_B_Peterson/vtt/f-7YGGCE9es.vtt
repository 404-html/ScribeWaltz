1
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is the second part of my</v>

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>proposed three part series on political</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness.</v>

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Looks like I'll probably expand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this one deals with the Department</v>

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>of human resources policy to make anti</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism and anti bias training mandatory</v>

5
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>among human resources staff at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto.</v>

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>And I wanted to explain a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to you in relationship to that</v>

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>mostly why I think it's extremely ill</v>
<v Speaker 1>advised policy,</v>

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>but also I'm a little bit more about</v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness and general and</v>

9
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.060
<v Speaker 1>also about why you should care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this even though it doesn't directly</v>

10
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>affect you or at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't directly affect you.</v>

11
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.310
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>in order to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or any more about political correctness,</v>

13
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I guess I probably have to justify my</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief that such a thing exists.</v>

14
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you have already done</v>
<v Speaker 1>some empirical research on that.</v>

15
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

16
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>we did this psychometrically which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics is the science of</v>

17
00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:58.490
<v Speaker 1>psychological measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we,</v>

18
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>we took an agnostic view to begin with</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

19
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>and the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

20
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>are there a set of political beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aggregate together so that they can</v>

21
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>be described using a single term such as</v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness?</v>

22
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.540
<v Speaker 1>What are the personality and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictors of those beliefs and do,</v>

23
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.170
<v Speaker 1>how do they associate with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>classical forms of political belief like</v>

24
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>liberalism and conservatism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the Conservatives often assume</v>

25
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>that a political correctness is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme form of liberalism.</v>

26
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>So we're also interested in whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that was true.</v>

27
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>And so basically what we found was</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

28
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are beliefs that aggregate</v>

29
00:01:32.101 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>together coherently in a manner that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

30
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it reasonable to bring them under a</v>

31
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>single,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring them under the umbrella of a</v>

32
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:40.494
<v Speaker 1>single term.</v>

33
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 1>There's actually two dimensions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be associated with political</v>

34
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 1>correctness and one is radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism.</v>

35
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>And the other is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's kind of left wing</v>

37
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the desire to use censorship and</v>

38
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>language control to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to read,</v>

39
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.783
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>to obtain certain kinds of political</v>
<v Speaker 1>lands.</v>

41
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also found out that the fundamental</v>

42
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>personality trait that predicts a</v>
<v Speaker 1>adherence to such belief is trait</v>

43
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that does differentiate political</v>

44
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>correctness from liberalism say because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental traits that seem to be</v>

45
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>associated with liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite ones that are associated</v>

46
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>with conservatives and liberals are</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher in trait,</v>

47
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>openness and lower in trait</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

48
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>And I'm all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking of traits in a big five</v>

49
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.460
<v Speaker 1>manner and there are five cardinal</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality traits.</v>

50
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of information about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my website if you're interested in</v>

51
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the personality predictors of</v>

52
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>political correct belief are not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same as the personality predictors of,</v>

53
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal belief or at least their</v>

54
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>substantive difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

55
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>there is such a thing as political</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness from a,</v>

56
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>from a technical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's perfectly reasonable to talk</v>

57
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>about it and it's not merely an</v>
<v Speaker 1>invention of the,</v>

58
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a politically motivated invention of the</v>

60
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>enemies of such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of such doctrines.</v>

61
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>So not as far as I can tell anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we will eventually publish that.</v>

62
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Next thing question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 2>why should you care about what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening at the University of Toronto</v>

64
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Human Resources Department?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's a number of reasons</v>

65
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 2>for this and the first is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

66
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 2>it offers a real world case study and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really important because you want</v>

67
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 2>to talk about something like political</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness and what might be done about</v>

68
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 2>it at the level of high resolution and</v>
<v Speaker 2>high detail.</v>

69
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 2>And so imagine if something's gone wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the military military helicopter,</v>

70
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 2>which is a very complicated device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want a four year olds drawing</v>

71
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 2>of a military helicopter as a guide to</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to fix it.</v>

72
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 2>You want a detailed schematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about real world case</v>

73
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 2>studies is they give you detailed</v>
<v Speaker 2>schematics and so we're going to take</v>

74
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 2>this particular occurrence apart very</v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully.</v>

75
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to describe to you what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's significance is and what the</v>

76
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:48.020
<v Speaker 2>errors are in the conceptualizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualization underlying the policy.</v>

77
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 2>And so we're gonna walk through it very</v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully.</v>

78
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.620
<v Speaker 2>The other thing I would say is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

79
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 2>hr departments are doing this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in many organizations.</v>

80
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 2>In many organizations it's the HR</v>
<v Speaker 2>department,</v>

81
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 2>that's the vanguard of political</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness and that's in private and</v>

82
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.750
<v Speaker 2>public organizations is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

83
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

84
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that it's not.</v>

85
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:10.890
<v Speaker 2>This is not something that by any means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is limited to universities.</v>

86
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 2>And so I would also like to say that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>might want to write this off by saying,</v>

87
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 2>well the university is a bubble and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that happen there have no bearing</v>

88
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 2>on the rest of society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really foolish thing to</v>

89
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 2>think because the university trade</v>
<v Speaker 2>trains the leaders of tomorrow.</v>

90
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 2>I know that sounds like a cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it technically the smart kids</v>

91
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 2>that are in university right now are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids that in 15 years they're gonna be</v>

92
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 2>running the world.</v>

93
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 2>And so what's happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>universities is an indication of the</v>

94
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 2>shape of things to come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

95
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 2>and I think the universities are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>large part responsible for the wave of</v>

96
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 2>political correctness that has rolled</v>
<v Speaker 2>across north America and,</v>

97
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.810
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

98
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and much of Europe as well.</v>

99
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll talk about all that at a</v>

100
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 2>different time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I want,</v>

101
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to begin with is don't be thinking that</v>

102
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 2>the universities are isolated from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the real world because they're not,</v>

103
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 2>they're not isolated from the world at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

104
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're not nearly as much of a</v>

105
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 2>bubble as you might think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

106
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here we're going to go to the memo</v>

107
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this memo was sent out to all the HR</v>

108
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 2>staff at the University of Toronto on</v>
<v Speaker 2>September Twenty Six,</v>

109
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 2>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was sent out by Angela Hildegard</v>

110
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 2>who's the vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human resources and equity.</v>

111
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so here's,</v>

112
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the content,</v>

113
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 2>dear colleagues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next month we will be providing</v>

114
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 2>mandatory antidiscrimination and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti-biased training for all staff in</v>

115
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 2>the division of human resources and</v>
<v Speaker 2>equity and the hrl divisional offices</v>

116
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 2>motivated by conversations that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken place over the past year with the</v>

117
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 2>black liberation collective and</v>
<v Speaker 2>racialized staff members of our</v>

118
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:50.560
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This training is intended to build and</v>

119
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 2>reinforce the work already occurring</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the organization and within</v>

120
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 2>human resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Recognizing that there is for</v>

121
00:05:57.291 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 2>improvement to embed common</v>
<v Speaker 2>understandings and evidence based best</v>

122
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 2>practice within our work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The training will be co presented by</v>

123
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Tina Turner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope I have that right.</v>

124
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Principal at Turner Consulting Group and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merlin,</v>

125
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Charles Concurrent Teacher Education</v>
<v Speaker 2>Program,</v>

126
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Ontario Institute for Studies of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Education.</v>

127
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 2>So noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the place that trains all our</v>

128
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 2>teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There will be six sessions hosted for</v>

129
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 2>all human resources staff throughout</v>
<v Speaker 2>October 12,</v>

130
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 2>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Note that six sessions.</v>

131
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will receive a registration link</v>

132
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:31.310
<v Speaker 2>soon to attend.</v>

133
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 2>One of the training sessions hosted on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the St George campus.</v>

134
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 2>I asked that all colleagues working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's three campuses on the University</v>

135
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 2>of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are somewhat distributed around</v>

136
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 2>the city so that people are being asked</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come to the central campus in order</v>

137
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 2>to to finish the training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please note that this is required</v>

138
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 2>training for all HR staff at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto and we will be</v>

139
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:55.380
<v Speaker 2>tracking attendance and completion</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus via h,</v>

140
00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 2>r I s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I guess is obviously their</v>

141
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 2>attendance and completion tracking</v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

142
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 2>so it's mandatory and there's much made</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that that it's mandatory.</v>

143
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.760
<v Speaker 2>If you have questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please contact Erin Jackson,</v>

144
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 2>executive director Ihr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

145
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:14.960
<v Speaker 2>So fundamentally human resources staff</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the University of Toronto are now</v>

146
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 2>required to attend anti racist and anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>bias training six sessions.</v>

147
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 2>And they have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The attendance is mandatory.</v>

148
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why is that a problem?</v>

149
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:30.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's actually eight problems</v>

150
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 2>with it and I'm going to go through them</v>
<v Speaker 2>in detail.</v>

151
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 2>The first problem is the assumption of</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism and bias at the University of</v>

152
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.181
<v Speaker 2>Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

153
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 2>because if there's no racism and bias</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem at the University of Toronto,</v>

154
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 2>then why bother with it at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one assumption.</v>

155
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

156
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 2>another problem and not in assumption is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is in my estimation and the</v>

157
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 2>question of the legitimacy of the groups</v>
<v Speaker 2>and individuals who are serving as</v>

158
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 2>consultants to the University of Toronto</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human Resources Department.</v>

159
00:07:57.441 --> 00:08:01.280
<v Speaker 2>And we already identified them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them was Tana Turner,</v>

160
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Turner and the other was Mervyn Charles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll talk about them momentarily.</v>

161
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also the black liberation</v>

162
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:07.820
<v Speaker 2>collective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

163
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 2>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the HR people have been consulting with</v>

164
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:14.630
<v Speaker 2>the black liberation collective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are people now who have been</v>

165
00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:19.460
<v Speaker 2>deemed appropriate to advise the</v>
<v Speaker 2>university in its internal policies.</v>

166
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Third assumption that I think is</v>

167
00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 2>problematic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assumption that anti racism and anti</v>

168
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 2>bias training is the way to address</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism and bias at the University of</v>

169
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Toronto assuming that it exists because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that that hypothesis can be</v>

170
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:34.694
<v Speaker 2>questioned.</v>

171
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 2>The willingness to introduce what is</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly politicized training or,</v>

172
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 2>or could easily become that into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace.</v>

173
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 2>And on a university campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I would think would be the last</v>

174
00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 2>place where such things should be done</v>
<v Speaker 2>casually.</v>

175
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

176
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.190
<v Speaker 2>the fifth problem is assumption of guilt</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the part of the HR staff.</v>

177
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 2>The sixth problem is the assumption that</v>
<v Speaker 2>such training should be mandatory.</v>

178
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 2>The seventh problem is the assumption</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the people hired have the</v>

179
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 2>competence to conduct such training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's obviously linked to my earlier</v>

180
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 2>point about questioning whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are being consulted to</v>

181
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 2>make the policy to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the competence and authority</v>

182
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 2>necessary authority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimacy to,</v>

183
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

184
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to promote such policies.</v>

185
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 2>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assumption that such training will</v>

186
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 2>make the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assuming there is a situation that needs</v>

187
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 2>to be addressed better rather than</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>

188
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.030
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's eight problems and we're going</v>

189
00:09:29.031 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 2>to take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna take a very close look at</v>

190
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:34.080
<v Speaker 2>each of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if even one of those problems</v>

191
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.273
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

192
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.110
<v Speaker 2>is properly formulated as I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's enough of a reason to</v>

193
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 2>question the validity of this policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believe that all eight of these</v>

194
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 2>problems exist and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all each that serious.</v>

195
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can make up your own mind about</v>

196
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:51.420
<v Speaker 2>whether you believe that once you hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument.</v>

197
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.040
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so first,</v>

198
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 2>let's start with the assumption of</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism and bias at the University of</v>

199
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

200
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.240
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I would say is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

201
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you compare any organization to a</v>

202
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 2>hypothetical Utopian ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can be sure that it will fall</v>

203
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 2>short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say however,</v>

204
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:13.560
<v Speaker 2>that comparing any organization to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetical Utopian ideal is a very</v>

205
00:10:13.561 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 2>dangerous thing to do because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're cognizant of the history of</v>

206
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that there's certain dangers</v>

207
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 2>associated with Utopian political</v>
<v Speaker 2>idealism.</v>

208
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.040
<v Speaker 2>And that what Utopian political</v>
<v Speaker 2>idealists do is to pause it some perfect</v>

209
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:30.210
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then denigrate every organization</v>

210
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:33.870
<v Speaker 2>that human beings have ever managed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce on the basis that it's not up to</v>

211
00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:36.750
<v Speaker 2>that level of perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

212
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.120
<v Speaker 2>compared to Utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the University of Toronto has its</v>

213
00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:41.010
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not going to do that.</v>

214
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:44.790
<v Speaker 2>We're going to compare it to actual real</v>
<v Speaker 2>other places.</v>

215
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 2>And so we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about this.</v>

216
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:49.350
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you picked a country that was the</v>

217
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 2>hallmark of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it tolerance and I mean</v>

218
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:54.510
<v Speaker 2>reasonable tolerance if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

219
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.890
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to identify a country that</v>
<v Speaker 2>exemplified that above all else in the</v>

220
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:01.320
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be a few contenders,</v>

221
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:03.120
<v Speaker 2>but Canada would definitely be in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>list.</v>

222
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>

223
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 2>we're a tolerant culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Ontario,</v>

224
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.190
<v Speaker 2>I would say within Canada is one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the more liberal provinces,</v>

225
00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:12.630
<v Speaker 2>more liberal tolerant provinces.</v>

226
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.150
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very multicultural and ethnically</v>

227
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 2>diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's particularly true of Toronto,</v>

228
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:23.181
<v Speaker 2>which prides itself rightly or wrongly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on being the most multicultural city in</v>

229
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:25.890
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Toronto's a great city,</v>

230
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:26.571
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's big,</v>

231
00:11:26.571 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 2>gets exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's developing well,</v>

232
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:32.880
<v Speaker 2>it's got a booming economy and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone who comes here seems to get</v>

233
00:11:32.881 --> 00:11:35.040
<v Speaker 2>along and that's great and I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>why that is,</v>

234
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:38.910
<v Speaker 2>but partly it's because the city is</v>
<v Speaker 2>embedded in Canada and Ontario and</v>

235
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Toronto is doing some good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so hooray for that.</v>

236
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.510
<v Speaker 2>And then within Toronto you have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto and that the</v>

237
00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:50.340
<v Speaker 2>campus is so multi ethnic and racially</v>
<v Speaker 2>diverse that I would,</v>

238
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I would challenge anyone to find an</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in the world that has those</v>

239
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:59.140
<v Speaker 2>attributes more firmly in place than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto.</v>

240
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 2>So then so I don't see that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem with with racism and</v>

241
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:07.780
<v Speaker 2>bias at the University of Toronto and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to point out that measurements are</v>

242
00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Speaker 2>real issue here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

243
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:11.170
<v Speaker 2>because you have to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm speaking from a technical</v>

244
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

245
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:18.160
<v Speaker 2>how it is that you measure racism and</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking people individually if they think</v>

246
00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 2>there is racism isn't a reasonable way</v>
<v Speaker 2>of doing it.</v>

247
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.800
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you partly why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If if you ask people to what degree they</v>

248
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their group has experienced racism in a</v>

249
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 2>given context or in a given culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll generally report a fairly high</v>

250
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:35.920
<v Speaker 2>degree of racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you ask them how much they as</v>

251
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 2>individuals have suffered from racism or</v>
<v Speaker 2>other forms of bias,</v>

252
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.690
<v Speaker 2>the estimates are much lower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's just one indication of the</v>

253
00:12:43.691 --> 00:12:45.520
<v Speaker 2>measurement difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

254
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is part and parcel of trying to</v>

255
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 2>deal with something as complicated as</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism has been.</v>

256
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:51.910
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you mean.</v>

257
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.340
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by racism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a tricky thing.</v>

258
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 2>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how exactly do you measure it?</v>

259
00:12:56.801 --> 00:13:00.570
<v Speaker 2>So you know what degree of racism there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and you have to do that before you.</v>

260
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.850
<v Speaker 2>You run around deciding that there's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much racism that people need to be</v>

261
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:04.684
<v Speaker 2>educated.</v>

262
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a technical problem and I can tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>you that if I conducted a research study</v>

263
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:13.000
<v Speaker 2>that was reviewed by the University of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto Ethics Board on an organization</v>

264
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:16.810
<v Speaker 2>which are not very fond of by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but assuming I wanted to do a research</v>

265
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 2>project of this sort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you I'd have to have a lot</v>

266
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 2>better measures of racism then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>measures that the hr department is using</v>

267
00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:26.190
<v Speaker 2>to accuse their own staff have</v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficient racism to,</v>

268
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.240
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to necessitate training.</v>

269
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.280
<v Speaker 2>So that's something to think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

270
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.410
<v Speaker 2>The black liberation collective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the group,</v>

271
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.170
<v Speaker 2>one of the groups that the UFT has</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically be consulting with a</v>

272
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 2>claims that you've t is a racially</v>
<v Speaker 2>biased,</v>

273
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.360
<v Speaker 2>a entity because we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have as many black people in</v>

274
00:13:48.971 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 2>its in its faculty and administration as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would expect to be there if you use</v>

275
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 2>the census as a guideline.</v>

276
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.810
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

277
00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.210
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that because there's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of reasons other than racism wipe</v>

278
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.300
<v Speaker 2>a population might be underrepresented</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

279
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:09.310
<v Speaker 2>in an organization and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it also ignores the broader context.</v>

280
00:14:09.311 --> 00:14:11.200
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

281
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 2>if you're thinking about non-consensus</v>
<v Speaker 2>related representation at the University</v>

282
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.920
<v Speaker 2>of Toronto and you're going to use that</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a hallmark of discrimination,</v>

283
00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:20.980
<v Speaker 2>you're really in trouble because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more women than men.</v>

284
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Students say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the humanities,</v>

285
00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:24.900
<v Speaker 2>and there's way more men in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

286
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.940
<v Speaker 2>in the sciences and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

287
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.800
<v Speaker 2>the hard sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

288
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.400
<v Speaker 2>There's more Jews among the faculty or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

289
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's almost always the case among</v>

290
00:14:36.101 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 2>faculty because Jewish people tend to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>overrepresented in disciplines where</v>

291
00:14:40.061 --> 00:14:42.970
<v Speaker 2>intellectual prowess is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is valued.</v>

292
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more Asians on campus in</v>

293
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.470
<v Speaker 2>mathematics and say then there are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>than you would estimate from the census</v>

294
00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:53.270
<v Speaker 2>preference or is the census data.</v>

295
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.760
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to use census data as the</v>

296
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:57.200
<v Speaker 2>hallmark of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

297
00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.200
<v Speaker 2>of representation at the university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've really got a lot of problems and</v>

298
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to get rid of a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people who have positions that are</v>

299
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 2>already members of what are often</v>
<v Speaker 2>regarded as minority.</v>

300
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:12.221
<v Speaker 2>So it's an insane policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also over older people are all obviously</v>

301
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.590
<v Speaker 2>overrepresented among the faculty and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the administration.</v>

302
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:18.130
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean necessarily that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

303
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.420
<v Speaker 2>that is because of bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

304
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 2>because of bias of the same sort that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would associate with racism and</v>

305
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.300
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's all sorts of problems</v>

306
00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Speaker 2>associated with that and if it's black</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are under represented,</v>

307
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:31.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which black people are we going to try</v>

308
00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:35.120
<v Speaker 2>to try who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which black people or are we going to</v>

309
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:38.620
<v Speaker 2>try to represent more specifically?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

310
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.460
<v Speaker 2>are we going to use recent immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean recent black immigrants into the</v>

311
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 2>United States for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to do better than multigenerational</v>

312
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:47.790
<v Speaker 2>black and habits of the U s.</v>

313
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.190
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

314
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.640
<v Speaker 2>the people who are really being a what a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bias against or are the people who are</v>

315
00:15:56.511 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 2>the multigenerational inhabitants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>block multigenerational inhabitants of</v>

316
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:02.390
<v Speaker 2>North America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like this sort of thing can be</v>

317
00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:05.960
<v Speaker 2>infinitely fractionated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not helpful and will never get a</v>

318
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.040
<v Speaker 2>precise representation by census in any</v>
<v Speaker 2>institution.</v>

319
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:11.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a stupid way of thinking about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

320
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.560
<v Speaker 2>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that the groups that are</v>

321
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:19.490
<v Speaker 2>consulting with the University of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto hr people are legitimate.</v>

322
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.300
<v Speaker 2>They're not legitimate as groups and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're legitimate as people who have a</v>

323
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:25.460
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not legitimate as people who</v>

324
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:29.690
<v Speaker 2>should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>consulted on with regards to policy at</v>

325
00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:31.310
<v Speaker 2>the University of Toronto because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

326
00:16:31.311 --> 00:16:33.800
<v Speaker 2>by no means there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have no legitimacy.</v>

327
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Legitimacy among the people that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>purport to represent.</v>

328
00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:39.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not none of the kind of legitimacy that</v>

329
00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:42.350
<v Speaker 2>we recognize as legitimacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in a democracy,</v>

330
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.080
<v Speaker 2>you recognize elected representatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

331
00:16:45.081 --> 00:16:47.360
<v Speaker 2>as legitimate representate</v>
<v Speaker 2>representatives.</v>

332
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 2>So there their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a negotiating with the or consulting</v>

333
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:55.430
<v Speaker 2>with the black liberation collective is</v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily a US group.</v>

334
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 2>The racial situation in Canada and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>racial situation in the United States</v>

335
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:02.120
<v Speaker 2>are not the same at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is as far as I can tell,</v>

336
00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:05.120
<v Speaker 2>it's a spill over of what are</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally American problems into the</v>

337
00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Canadian political scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

338
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk more about the black</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberation collective shortly and also</v>

339
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:15.920
<v Speaker 2>racialized members of the t community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't even sure what racialized</v>

340
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:19.770
<v Speaker 2>members mean because I guess I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of keeping up with a rep</v>

341
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:23.090
<v Speaker 2>constant rapid transformation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically correct terminology.</v>

342
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 2>So I had to look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a sociological term,</v>

343
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:28.830
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't really surprise me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

344
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.310
<v Speaker 2>because I think sociology is</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally corrupt,</v>

345
00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:32.230
<v Speaker 2>disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

346
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.750
<v Speaker 2>there's a variety of corrupt disciplines</v>
<v Speaker 2>on university campuses and sociology is</v>

347
00:17:35.751 --> 00:17:40.340
<v Speaker 2>certainly one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Racialization or ethnicized nation is</v>

348
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 2>the process of ascribing ethnic or</v>
<v Speaker 2>racial identities to a relationship,</v>

349
00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:47.210
<v Speaker 2>social practice or group that did not</v>
<v Speaker 2>identify itself as such.</v>

350
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't seem to be the definition</v>

351
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 2>that the HR people are using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I looked at the Ontario human rights</v>

352
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:57.050
<v Speaker 2>commission website because it come up on</v>
<v Speaker 2>very quickly in the Google search and</v>

353
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.360
<v Speaker 2>not surprisingly because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an appalling website and in a</v>

354
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:02.530
<v Speaker 2>multitude of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

355
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ontario Human Rights Commission says</v>

356
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.750
<v Speaker 2>recognizing that race is a social</v>
<v Speaker 2>construct.</v>

357
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:15.290
<v Speaker 2>The HRC describes people as racialized</v>
<v Speaker 2>person or racialized group instead of</v>

358
00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:18.270
<v Speaker 2>the more outdated and inaccurate terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racial minority,</v>

359
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:21.180
<v Speaker 2>visible minority person of color or non</v>
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

360
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.770
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it wasn't very long ago that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that as far as I can remember,</v>

361
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:29.430
<v Speaker 2>that visible minority and person of</v>
<v Speaker 2>color were the correct socially or the</v>

362
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:31.370
<v Speaker 2>correct politically correct terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

363
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.820
<v Speaker 2>they change very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly.</v>

364
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:35.070
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep changing the terms,</v>

365
00:18:35.071 --> 00:18:37.350
<v Speaker 2>you can keep playing the stupid</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically correct game.</v>

366
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.260
<v Speaker 2>That's at least one reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said I'll make a video on the</v>

367
00:18:40.261 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 2>nature of the PC game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a short video.</v>

368
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.580
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of,</v>

369
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.620
<v Speaker 2>one of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the rules of the game is keep</v>

370
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:49.170
<v Speaker 2>changing the terminology so everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>always at fault.</v>

371
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess what consulting with racialized</v>

372
00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:58.110
<v Speaker 2>members of the uft community means is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the u of t somehow consulted,</v>

373
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they would define who</v>

374
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:06.870
<v Speaker 2>constituted a minority on the University</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Toronto campus because like I said,</v>

375
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:08.940
<v Speaker 2>it's a very multiethnic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>

376
00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:12.090
<v Speaker 2>very multiethnic campus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not obvious at all on first,</v>

377
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not obvious at all who's,</v>

378
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:15.990
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

379
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.390
<v Speaker 2>underrepresented and who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>overrepresented.</v>

380
00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:21.720
<v Speaker 2>But I suppose it's probably the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overrepresented people would</v>

381
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:26.721
<v Speaker 2>certainly be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm black or white middle class males.</v>

382
00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I suspected that people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're probably not very happy about.</v>

383
00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:31.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean those guys are on their way out</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

384
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Speaker 2>And males in general are on the way out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the university.</v>

385
00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:37.170
<v Speaker 2>So it's not going to be a problem if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem now,</v>

386
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly not going to be a problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>for very long.</v>

387
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.580
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

388
00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that those groups are</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly legitimate as,</v>

389
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.820
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I'm speaking more particularly of the</v>

390
00:19:47.821 --> 00:19:52.821
<v Speaker 2>black liberation collective racialized</v>
<v Speaker 2>members of the ut community is so vague</v>

391
00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:55.370
<v Speaker 2>that I don't know exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get a handle on the standing of</v>

393
00:19:59.821 --> 00:20:03.700
<v Speaker 2>those people and I don't know how what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did was measured there.</v>

394
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:04.530
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

395
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand the validity of the</v>

396
00:20:07.201 --> 00:20:09.540
<v Speaker 2>constructs that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're being applied to the,</v>

397
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.090
<v Speaker 2>to these particular groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

398
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:13.830
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at the black liberation</v>
<v Speaker 2>collective.</v>

399
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

400
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:19.080
<v Speaker 2>this is from their website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a collective consisting of black</v>

401
00:20:19.081 --> 00:20:22.590
<v Speaker 2>students who are dedicated to</v>
<v Speaker 2>transforming institutions of higher</v>

402
00:20:22.591 --> 00:20:26.460
<v Speaker 2>education through unity coalition</v>
<v Speaker 2>building direct action and political</v>

403
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:27.294
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

404
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.133
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

405
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.010
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose if that's what they want to</v>

406
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.220
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they want to do.</v>

407
00:20:32.221 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what they're aimed</v>

408
00:20:34.771 --> 00:20:37.890
<v Speaker 2>at with regards to transforming</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions of higher education through</v>

409
00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:40.790
<v Speaker 2>unity coalition building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. It's a,</v>

410
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.290
<v Speaker 2>it's a typical activist group as far as</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell,</v>

411
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.860
<v Speaker 2>and as as you would expect from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>typical activist group,</v>

412
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.300
<v Speaker 2>they don't negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have demands,</v>

413
00:20:49.301 --> 00:20:52.570
<v Speaker 2>they have national demands and campus</v>
<v Speaker 2>demands,</v>

414
00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:56.050
<v Speaker 2>and so they make demands to universities</v>
<v Speaker 2>across north America and the</v>

415
00:20:56.051 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 2>universities are appallingly willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kowtow to those demands without,</v>

416
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I think without sufficient thought to</v>
<v Speaker 2>merely as a consequence of mostly as a</v>

417
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:09.631
<v Speaker 2>consequence of fear and the desire to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>viewed as always being on the side of</v>

418
00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:14.140
<v Speaker 2>moral virtue without having to undertake</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thought necessary to actually ensure</v>

419
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:15.730
<v Speaker 2>that that is where you're standing.</v>

420
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.810
<v Speaker 2>So here's some of the demands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

421
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to tell you a bit more about the</v>

422
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.800
<v Speaker 2>liberation collective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't find them on wikipedia.</v>

423
00:21:23.801 --> 00:21:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Weirdly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that they demanded segregated</v>

424
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:29.650
<v Speaker 2>spaces at several universities that</v>
<v Speaker 2>segregated spaces.</v>

425
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Can I say that again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They demanded segregated spaces at</v>

426
00:21:32.861 --> 00:21:35.500
<v Speaker 2>several universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including ucla and at New York</v>

427
00:21:35.501 --> 00:21:39.760
<v Speaker 2>university they wanted black people only</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be living together and queer people</v>

428
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:43.390
<v Speaker 2>only to be living together and they also</v>
<v Speaker 2>demanded safe spaces at oberland</v>

429
00:21:43.391 --> 00:21:45.400
<v Speaker 2>college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that gives you some indication of the</v>

430
00:21:45.401 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things that they're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>

431
00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Third assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The third assumption the hr department</v>

432
00:21:52.871 --> 00:21:57.610
<v Speaker 2>is making is that anti racism and anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>bias training is the way to address the</v>

433
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.880
<v Speaker 2>hypothetical racism and bias problem at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university of toronto.</v>

434
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.890
<v Speaker 2>And this brings up a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>this opens a whole multitude of cans of</v>

435
00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:07.840
<v Speaker 2>worms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a lot of cans of worms.</v>

436
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.460
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

437
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.920
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to measure something like</v>

438
00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:14.200
<v Speaker 2>racism and bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily difficult,</v>

439
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.590
<v Speaker 2>especially bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a rat's nest of fear of</v>

440
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:21.340
<v Speaker 2>theoretical and empirical investIgation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in social psychology.</v>

441
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:23.080
<v Speaker 2>And there's some terrible things</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening there.</v>

442
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.090
<v Speaker 2>So they're very difficult things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>measure.</v>

443
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.580
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't only have to measure</v>

444
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.140
<v Speaker 2>racism and bias to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to indicate that such things exist in a,</v>

445
00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.140
<v Speaker 2>in a university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to indicate not only that they</v>

446
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Speaker 2>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they exist and that they're causing</v>

447
00:22:37.451 --> 00:22:41.290
<v Speaker 2>problems of a certain magnitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to also,</v>

448
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a posit that the problems that such</v>

449
00:22:44.651 --> 00:22:49.240
<v Speaker 2>things are causing if they exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the most compelling problems that</v>

450
00:22:49.241 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 2>need to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs need to be addressed because</v>

451
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 2>you have to address problems one at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>time in terms of their importance and so</v>

452
00:22:57.911 --> 00:22:58.780
<v Speaker 2>you need a ranking.</v>

453
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:02.140
<v Speaker 2>So let's say there is racism at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>university of toronto and I suppose</v>

454
00:23:02.141 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 2>there is some because there's some</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere that doesn't validate just</v>

455
00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:10.720
<v Speaker 2>because there is some doesn't mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is where our efforts should be</v>

456
00:23:10.721 --> 00:23:15.490
<v Speaker 2>devoted as a university and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>university has put a lot of resources</v>

457
00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:18.370
<v Speaker 2>into this sort of thing and I think in</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ill advised way and they're paying an</v>

458
00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:21.430
<v Speaker 2>awful lot of money and they're paying</v>
<v Speaker 2>the staff that are doing this crazy</v>

459
00:23:21.431 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 2>amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in comparison to their,</v>

460
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

461
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Credentials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

462
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.810
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a good indication of the</v>

463
00:23:28.811 --> 00:23:29.970
<v Speaker 2>actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

464
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.010
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual value hierarchy of the</v>

465
00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:36.040
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't obvious to me that the</v>

466
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:39.490
<v Speaker 2>university of toronto whose primary</v>
<v Speaker 2>function is to address racism on the,</v>

467
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.520
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the university of toronto campus.</v>

468
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:43.660
<v Speaker 2>So especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

469
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I've already made that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to measure and define racism</v>

470
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:51.260
<v Speaker 2>and bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to measure and define the,</v>

471
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

472
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:55.520
<v Speaker 2>you have to define what your training</v>
<v Speaker 2>program is going to look like and</v>

473
00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:59.210
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically why it'll work and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of work and then you also have</v>

474
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 2>to assess the outcome and I don't see</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of that happening properly with,</v>

475
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the way that the human resources</v>

476
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 2>department is going about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular training program.</v>

477
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 2>And as I said already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would not be allowed as a researcher</v>

478
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:15.020
<v Speaker 2>at u of t to conduct this as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention in an experiment.</v>

479
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.240
<v Speaker 2>It would violate the ethics provisions</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the uft uses to restrict to</v>

480
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.260
<v Speaker 2>researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like it's okay to inflict on</v>

481
00:24:21.261 --> 00:24:23.840
<v Speaker 2>your employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wouldn't be okay for scientists</v>

482
00:24:23.841 --> 00:24:26.930
<v Speaker 2>to ask people to volunteer for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

483
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.190
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

484
00:24:28.191 --> 00:24:32.930
<v Speaker 2>so the point here is that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence that anti racism and</v>

485
00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:37.370
<v Speaker 2>anti-biased training actually lowers</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism and bias.</v>

486
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a supposition.</v>

487
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:40.760
<v Speaker 2>It might be true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it might not be true.</v>

488
00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:43.530
<v Speaker 2>And for all we know that it would</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually increase it and I'll,</v>

489
00:24:43.531 --> 00:24:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go back to that.</v>

490
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the next issue is,</v>

491
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.300
<v Speaker 2>should employers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially employers at public</v>

492
00:24:55.301 --> 00:25:00.280
<v Speaker 2>universities be allowed to enforce</v>
<v Speaker 2>political training in force,</v>

493
00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a training that's politically motivated</v>

494
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.690
<v Speaker 2>on their employees and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could debate whether or not</v>

495
00:25:07.691 --> 00:25:10.930
<v Speaker 2>this constitutes political training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it does and if,</v>

496
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.890
<v Speaker 2>and if it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's close enough to it so that it,</v>

497
00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.330
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

498
00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.060
<v Speaker 2>it should be discussed at least as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>potential problem.</v>

499
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.730
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think that employers should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be allowed to politically indoctrinate,</v>

500
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.310
<v Speaker 2>let's use that word or even educate for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that matter.</v>

501
00:25:27.311 --> 00:25:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Although I don't see any evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the uft hr department is doing</v>

502
00:25:30.881 --> 00:25:34.540
<v Speaker 2>actually qualifies as education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that an employer should be</v>

503
00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:39.541
<v Speaker 2>allowed to indoctrinate its employees on</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain of the threat of job loss and you</v>

504
00:25:40.661 --> 00:25:42.400
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that this particular training</v>

505
00:25:42.401 --> 00:25:46.420
<v Speaker 2>program is mandatory and that that set a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of times and that attendance will</v>

506
00:25:46.421 --> 00:25:49.480
<v Speaker 2>be taken indicates to me an implicit</v>
<v Speaker 2>threat that,</v>

507
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

508
00:25:50.891 --> 00:25:51.521
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

509
00:25:51.521 --> 00:25:54.100
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your employment viability is going to be</v>

510
00:25:54.101 --> 00:25:57.160
<v Speaker 2>judged to some degree depending on</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you go attend these</v>

511
00:25:57.161 --> 00:25:57.730
<v Speaker 2>seminars.</v>

512
00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.530
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think that's acceptable at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

513
00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this looks very political to me.</v>

514
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.540
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas are associated with radical</v>

515
00:26:04.541 --> 00:26:05.560
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he ology,</v>

516
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

517
00:26:06.921 --> 00:26:11.560
<v Speaker 2>the people who are promoting this use</v>
<v Speaker 2>highly politicized language and all of</v>

518
00:26:11.561 --> 00:26:15.700
<v Speaker 2>it's predicated on the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 2>assumption that group based oppression</v>

519
00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:18.910
<v Speaker 2>is everywhere and that should be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>primary consideration of,</v>

520
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.320
<v Speaker 2>of social policy and economic policy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

521
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:23.543
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

522
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.410
<v Speaker 2>organizational policy even in places</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the university.</v>

523
00:26:26.411 --> 00:26:30.970
<v Speaker 2>So that looks all political to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the worst one,</v>

524
00:26:30.971 --> 00:26:32.230
<v Speaker 2>I think probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

525
00:26:32.231 --> 00:26:36.010
<v Speaker 2>So let's look at it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say I'm an hr person at the</v>

526
00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.680
<v Speaker 2>university of toronto and I get this</v>
<v Speaker 2>memo and uh,</v>

527
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.850
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I decided that I'm going to go here.</v>

528
00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Here's what the memo presumes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presumes that the,</v>

529
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.340
<v Speaker 2>that I'm sufficiently racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

530
00:26:50.341 --> 00:26:54.750
<v Speaker 2>that my membership in the hr department</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the cardinal element here about which</v>

531
00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 2>my guilt or innocence with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism can be adjudicated [inaudible].</v>

532
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.650
<v Speaker 2>The fundamental presumption is that as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>

533
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:05.580
<v Speaker 2>the hr department,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are sufficiently racist and</v>

534
00:27:05.581 --> 00:27:08.130
<v Speaker 2>biased so that they need reeducation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

535
00:27:08.131 --> 00:27:11.730
<v Speaker 2>So that to me is the presumption of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's two problems with that.</v>

536
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:13.051
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

537
00:27:13.051 --> 00:27:15.480
<v Speaker 2>it's group based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's group identity based and second of</v>

538
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:17.640
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the presumption of guilt before</v>

539
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:18.570
<v Speaker 2>innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

540
00:27:18.571 --> 00:27:19.630
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

541
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.170
<v Speaker 2>and so that means that if I exceed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

542
00:27:22.171 --> 00:27:27.150
<v Speaker 2>if I agree to go to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm acting out the proposition that</v>

543
00:27:27.151 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I am in fact sufficiently guilty of</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism and bias so that I need to be</v>

544
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.330
<v Speaker 2>reeducated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

545
00:27:33.331 --> 00:27:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that it's reasonable for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hr department to assume that it's</v>

546
00:27:37.551 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 2>staff is guilty of such nefarious</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

547
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.330
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it violates a fundamental,</v>

548
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.530
<v Speaker 2>a fundamental presupposition that's at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the western legal code and</v>

549
00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:48.220
<v Speaker 2>at western culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

550
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:49.860
<v Speaker 2>and the freedom that goes along with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

551
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:53.940
<v Speaker 2>And that's the assumption of innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're innocent until proven guilty and</v>

552
00:27:53.941 --> 00:27:57.150
<v Speaker 2>you're innocent even if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if there's reasonable doubt about</v>

553
00:27:57.151 --> 00:28:01.890
<v Speaker 2>your guilt and you also have the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a reasonable to a thorough,</v>

554
00:28:01.891 --> 00:28:04.560
<v Speaker 2>thorough defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think it's reasonable for any</v>

555
00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:06.000
<v Speaker 2>given hr person to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

556
00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:08.610
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sufficiently racist to be</v>

557
00:28:08.611 --> 00:28:12.570
<v Speaker 2>reeducated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that it's appropriate</v>

558
00:28:12.571 --> 00:28:16.590
<v Speaker 2>for you to be implying that I am and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think that it's appropriate for</v>

559
00:28:16.591 --> 00:28:20.700
<v Speaker 2>you to demaNd that I attend and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's appropriate thAt you hold out</v>

560
00:28:20.701 --> 00:28:23.130
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of punishment if I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>attend.</v>

561
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:27.540
<v Speaker 2>So there's something even worse that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with this is that,</v>

562
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.870
<v Speaker 2>and we'll get to this in more detail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there's an idea that's become</v>

563
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:34.020
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very popular and it's partly a</v>

564
00:28:34.021 --> 00:28:38.550
<v Speaker 2>consequence of a certain brand of social</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology associated with an idea</v>

565
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:41.580
<v Speaker 2>called a or with a test called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>implicit association test.</v>

566
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.680
<v Speaker 2>And that is the idea that people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>characterized by unconscious racism and</v>

567
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:48.870
<v Speaker 2>bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is that might be true,</v>

568
00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:51.210
<v Speaker 2>but that's not really relevant because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>

569
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.390
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is guilty of all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things unconsciously,</v>

570
00:28:54.391 --> 00:28:56.910
<v Speaker 2>instructionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that isn't how you judge the</v>

571
00:28:56.911 --> 00:28:59.190
<v Speaker 2>innocence or guilt of somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And besides that,</v>

572
00:28:59.191 --> 00:29:02.730
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious bias and unconscious racism</v>

573
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:07.020
<v Speaker 2>anywhere near well enough or are able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>measure it anywhere near well enough to</v>

574
00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:09.240
<v Speaker 2>start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assuming that we can start making</v>

575
00:29:09.241 --> 00:29:12.270
<v Speaker 2>statements and educating people out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their unconscious bias is it's an</v>

576
00:29:12.271 --> 00:29:14.850
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably dangerous idea and it's an</v>

577
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.050
<v Speaker 2>absolute misuse of social science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a terrible misuse of social science and</v>

578
00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I should say that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's coming out of social psychology and</v>

579
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.610
<v Speaker 2>it's by and done and the research has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been done by some of the top researchers</v>

580
00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:29.790
<v Speaker 2>in the field of social psychology and</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now the field of social psychology</v>

581
00:29:29.791 --> 00:29:33.750
<v Speaker 2>is under tremendous attack for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental poor quality of its</v>

582
00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:35.130
<v Speaker 2>scientific investigations.</v>

583
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.980
<v Speaker 2>So that's all very much worth thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

584
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.280
<v Speaker 2>So and to me the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once we allow the idea that unconscious</v>

585
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.500
<v Speaker 2>racism and bias constitutes a form of</v>
<v Speaker 2>guilt and here's the road we're walking</v>

586
00:29:47.501 --> 00:29:49.900
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can be punished or threatened for</v>

587
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:52.930
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of your guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means you're the sort of person</v>

588
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:56.350
<v Speaker 2>that could conceivably do something</v>
<v Speaker 2>about which you could be held guilty</v>

589
00:29:56.351 --> 00:29:57.280
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

590
00:29:57.281 --> 00:30:00.520
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like that because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone has a dark side,</v>

591
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.820
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

592
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.720
<v Speaker 2>but we can't be punished because we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark sides.</v>

593
00:30:04.721 --> 00:30:07.720
<v Speaker 2>We can be punished because we express</v>
<v Speaker 2>those in illegal actions.</v>

594
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.850
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't punIsh people or fix them</v>

595
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:11.650
<v Speaker 2>up until they've actually broken the</v>
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>

596
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.490
<v Speaker 2>not because they might break the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody might break the law.</v>

597
00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:17.590
<v Speaker 2>So if the rule is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we might break the law,</v>

598
00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:20.350
<v Speaker 2>we should be punished to reeducated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then everyone should be punished to</v>

599
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.810
<v Speaker 2>reeducated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's unless you want to be</v>

600
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:24.010
<v Speaker 2>punished or reeducated.</v>

601
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.760
<v Speaker 2>That's not a very good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's even worse is that we could</v>

602
00:30:27.761 --> 00:30:31.150
<v Speaker 2>be punished or reeducated for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility that we might have the</v>

603
00:30:31.151 --> 00:30:34.340
<v Speaker 2>intent to do something so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

604
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.360
<v Speaker 2>the level of abstraction of guilt here</v>
<v Speaker 2>is becoming truly,</v>

605
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.830
<v Speaker 2>truly absurd and it's truly dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the ontario human rights</v>

606
00:30:41.831 --> 00:30:42.664
<v Speaker 2>commission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

607
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.190
<v Speaker 2>if you need a terrible quote about</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

608
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.590
<v Speaker 2>if you need a quote too about that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>help you support your assumption of</v>

609
00:30:50.591 --> 00:30:53.860
<v Speaker 2>creeping authoritarianism on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is go to the ontario</v>

610
00:30:53.861 --> 00:30:57.970
<v Speaker 2>human rights commission website and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>will give you something you need every</v>

611
00:30:57.971 --> 00:30:58.690
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ruth,</v>

612
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.230
<v Speaker 2>virtually every sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism can be openly displayed in racial</v>

613
00:31:02.231 --> 00:31:04.540
<v Speaker 2>jokes or slurs and slurs are hate</v>
<v Speaker 2>crimes.</v>

614
00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.381
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

615
00:31:05.381 --> 00:31:06.270
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much for,</v>

616
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.010
<v Speaker 2>for all sorts of comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean toronto has a very,</v>

617
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:11.110
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very famous comedian who does nothing</v>

618
00:31:11.111 --> 00:31:14.050
<v Speaker 2>but racial jokes and I mean people love</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

619
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.870
<v Speaker 2>People from races all over the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

620
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.840
<v Speaker 2>from every race you can possibly imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>flocked to his show to be insulted by</v>

621
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:22.140
<v Speaker 2>him because it's such a relief for</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone to,</v>

622
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:26.860
<v Speaker 2>to state straight out such things</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of instead of,</v>

623
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Speaker 2>and make a joke about them instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking down this particular path that</v>

624
00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:34.990
<v Speaker 2>people are relieved and happy to see it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen openly.</v>

625
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

626
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Russell peters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the guy.</v>

627
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:42.000
<v Speaker 2>And so as far as I can tell what Russell</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peters does is becoming close to illegal</v>

628
00:31:42.001 --> 00:31:44.380
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russell Peters is pretty damn funny guy.</v>

629
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.870
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to think of him as a racist is</v>

630
00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:51.370
<v Speaker 2>absolutely insane and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was a comedian already in</v>

631
00:31:51.371 --> 00:31:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Canada who was fined $40,000 by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>quebec human rights commission for.</v>

632
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean he said some nasty things and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the point.</v>

633
00:31:57.521 --> 00:31:58.240
<v Speaker 2>He's a comedian.</v>

634
00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Leave the damn comedians alone right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

635
00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Like the gestures in the king's courts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're allowed to say what they want to</v>

636
00:32:03.701 --> 00:32:06.670
<v Speaker 2>say so that we can keep stupid things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and crooked things out where everybody</v>

637
00:32:06.671 --> 00:32:11.110
<v Speaker 2>can pay attention to them anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Racism can be openly displayed in racial</v>

638
00:32:11.111 --> 00:32:14.860
<v Speaker 2>jokes and slurs or hate crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but can be more deeply rooted in here.</v>

639
00:32:14.861 --> 00:32:16.420
<v Speaker 2>We go out attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>values,</v>

640
00:32:16.421 --> 00:32:19.120
<v Speaker 2>and stereotypical beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck defining them,</v>

641
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:23.050
<v Speaker 2>and what will happen is there'll be</v>
<v Speaker 2>defined in a way that maximizes people's</v>

642
00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:25.810
<v Speaker 2>guilt because that's the way you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the pc game going.</v>

643
00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.500
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some cases these are unconsciously</v>

644
00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:30.730
<v Speaker 2>held.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh good.</v>

645
00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:34.600
<v Speaker 2>So now we're going to be held liable for</v>
<v Speaker 2>our unconscious biases.</v>

646
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bad idea,</v>

647
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.010
<v Speaker 2>especially because we just do not</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand things very well.</v>

648
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.360
<v Speaker 2>We can't measure the very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand them very well.</v>

649
00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:45.470
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of debate about what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are and even if they do exist in the way</v>

650
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:49.760
<v Speaker 2>that people claim we don't know what to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do about it and like it conscious</v>

651
00:32:49.761 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 2>retraining programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no evidence that conscious</v>

652
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:55.490
<v Speaker 2>retraining programs are gonna are gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>fix this sort of thing.</v>

653
00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.940
<v Speaker 2>So if there is evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't know it and worse and</v>

654
00:32:58.941 --> 00:33:01.190
<v Speaker 2>if there is evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the people who are doing</v>

655
00:33:01.191 --> 00:33:05.560
<v Speaker 2>the reeducation programs demanded by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hr people have demonstrated that there</v>

656
00:33:05.561 --> 00:33:08.690
<v Speaker 2>are particular programs have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive benefit that's being claimed.</v>

657
00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next is the assumption that such</v>

658
00:33:16.621 --> 00:33:18.780
<v Speaker 2>training should be mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

659
00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that reeks to me of again,</v>

660
00:33:21.661 --> 00:33:24.990
<v Speaker 2>of creeping authoritarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like not only are you biased and</v>

661
00:33:24.991 --> 00:33:27.450
<v Speaker 2>racist and you don't get to say anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that,</v>

662
00:33:27.451 --> 00:33:29.130
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to assume it right off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bat,</v>

663
00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.980
<v Speaker 2>but you better be damn well go to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

664
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't there's going to be a</v>

665
00:33:34.351 --> 00:33:35.700
<v Speaker 2>problem for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

666
00:33:35.701 --> 00:33:36.534
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody,</v>

667
00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:37.590
<v Speaker 2>if all you have,</v>

668
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.960
<v Speaker 2>why not make it voluntary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not make it voluntary?</v>

669
00:33:44.961 --> 00:33:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Why not ask people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

670
00:33:46.251 --> 00:33:49.250
<v Speaker 2>maybe you get a 95 percent show rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then of course it wouldn't be the</v>

671
00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:51.200
<v Speaker 2>real racists that would go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know that.</v>

672
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't know that you could ask your</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to go.</v>

673
00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.550
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could ask them to go and see if</v>

674
00:33:55.551 --> 00:33:58.130
<v Speaker 2>anybody showed up because he would also</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to judge that way if there was</v>

675
00:33:58.131 --> 00:33:59.450
<v Speaker 2>any interest in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but oh no,</v>

676
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:02.150
<v Speaker 2>we're going to force people to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to impose our particular</v>

677
00:34:02.151 --> 00:34:04.940
<v Speaker 2>political perspective on the morgan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I accused them of guilt.</v>

678
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.500
<v Speaker 2>We're going to punish them if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

679
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:09.680
<v Speaker 2>if they don't go along with our mandate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the policy.</v>

680
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Even though we have no evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to work.</v>

681
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now more.</v>

682
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Neither one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The competence and impartiality of</v>

683
00:34:17.641 --> 00:34:19.170
<v Speaker 1>people hired his trainers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

684
00:34:19.171 --> 00:34:23.550
<v Speaker 1>so let's say that there is a problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>with racism and bias at the university</v>

685
00:34:23.551 --> 00:34:26.670
<v Speaker 1>of toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which which I don't believe and or at</v>

686
00:34:26.671 --> 00:34:29.580
<v Speaker 1>least I don't believe it's enough of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem so that it should be like so</v>

687
00:34:29.581 --> 00:34:33.300
<v Speaker 1>high up the hierarchy of problems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying strenuously to fix</v>

688
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:38.730
<v Speaker 1>as an imperfect organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as imperfect organizations,</v>

689
00:34:38.731 --> 00:34:39.870
<v Speaker 1>ngos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty good one.</v>

690
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.131
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

691
00:34:41.131 --> 00:34:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that this racism and bias does</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist even though I don't think the</v>

692
00:34:44.401 --> 00:34:47.280
<v Speaker 1>evidence for that is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then the question is,</v>

693
00:34:47.281 --> 00:34:49.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are the people that are coming in to</v>

694
00:34:49.591 --> 00:34:51.570
<v Speaker 1>do the training?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I can tell you this is</v>

695
00:34:51.571 --> 00:34:53.710
<v Speaker 1>tantamount to a psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

696
00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:56.460
<v Speaker 1>it certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tantamount to a psychological</v>

697
00:34:56.461 --> 00:34:58.680
<v Speaker 1>intervention and so then you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

698
00:34:58.681 --> 00:35:00.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the people who are conducting this</v>

699
00:35:00.301 --> 00:35:02.310
<v Speaker 1>sort of intervention qualified to do so?</v>

700
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:05.160
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things you'd hope is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had the right credentials and the</v>

701
00:35:05.161 --> 00:35:07.500
<v Speaker 1>second is that you'd hope is that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had published something,</v>

702
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a respectable journal that had been</v>

703
00:35:09.631 --> 00:35:12.720
<v Speaker 1>peer reviewed indicating that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular training program actually</v>

704
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.920
<v Speaker 1>reduced racism in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a cost effective and measurable</v>

705
00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.980
<v Speaker 1>manner instead of increasing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

706
00:35:19.981 --> 00:35:22.050
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility that a</v>

707
00:35:22.051 --> 00:35:24.120
<v Speaker 1>well meaning intervention will make</v>
<v Speaker 1>things worse.</v>

708
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.880
<v Speaker 1>And we will get to that in a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to look at the two people</v>

709
00:35:26.881 --> 00:35:28.980
<v Speaker 1>who are being hired as trainers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to,</v>

710
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I'll just tell you about them and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can draw your own conclusions.</v>

711
00:35:31.561 --> 00:35:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first one is tina turner.</v>

712
00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Her qualifications are a master's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>sociology.</v>

713
00:35:38.191 --> 00:35:40.800
<v Speaker 1>And as I said already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sociology is one of those disciplines</v>

714
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:43.410
<v Speaker 1>that I at least as fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>

715
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't think that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes qualification.</v>

716
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.350
<v Speaker 1>She worked in public service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on print,</v>

717
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 1>provincial employment equity</v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation.</v>

718
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.870
<v Speaker 1>She's responsible for work identifying</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific groups to be designated for</v>

719
00:35:54.871 --> 00:35:59.070
<v Speaker 1>employment equity 12 years as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent consultant providing human</v>

720
00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:02.130
<v Speaker 1>resource diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equity research program evaluation and</v>

721
00:36:02.131 --> 00:36:05.430
<v Speaker 1>community consultants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She expertise to a range of clients.</v>

722
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.820
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the principal at turner consulting</v>

723
00:36:08.821 --> 00:36:09.990
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she does this.</v>

724
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:11.040
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

725
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:16.040
<v Speaker 1>this is her primary occupation and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an equity diversity and inclusion</v>

726
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.310
<v Speaker 1>consultant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She offers their offers clients a</v>

727
00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:23.340
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive approach to help them</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand they're changing employee</v>

728
00:36:23.341 --> 00:36:26.910
<v Speaker 1>population and client base and how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>leverage that diversity for</v>

729
00:36:26.911 --> 00:36:28.920
<v Speaker 1>organizational success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of course,</v>

730
00:36:28.921 --> 00:36:32.520
<v Speaker 1>one of our presuppositions is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity defined in the politically</v>

731
00:36:32.521 --> 00:36:35.400
<v Speaker 1>correct manner is a precondition for</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizational success.</v>

732
00:36:35.401 --> 00:36:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Even though I don't think that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>any literature bearing on that,</v>

733
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:40.200
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that indicates that that's the case.</v>

734
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

735
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Here's some of the things that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims and thinks inclusion goes.</v>

736
00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:52.410
<v Speaker 1>B goes beyond having a diverse workforce</v>
<v Speaker 1>and complying with equity related</v>

737
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.990
<v Speaker 1>legislation as important as these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are</v>

738
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.820
<v Speaker 1>and inclusive organization can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>defined as an organization that</v>

739
00:36:59.821 --> 00:37:03.030
<v Speaker 1>integrates the values of equity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity because of those,</v>

740
00:37:03.031 --> 00:37:06.960
<v Speaker 1>of course are the top two values within</v>
<v Speaker 1>all aspects of the organization,</v>

741
00:37:06.961 --> 00:37:10.290
<v Speaker 1>including policies and procedures as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as individual behaviors and</v>

742
00:37:10.291 --> 00:37:13.560
<v Speaker 1>organizational culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in my estimation,</v>

743
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:17.250
<v Speaker 1>she's someone who fundamentally holds</v>
<v Speaker 1>politically correct beliefs and the</v>

744
00:37:17.251 --> 00:37:20.100
<v Speaker 1>reason she's hired by the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>hire them,</v>

745
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.980
<v Speaker 1>hire her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to spread those beliefs as white as</v>

746
00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:26.190
<v Speaker 1>widely as possible within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization and now at the university</v>

747
00:37:26.191 --> 00:37:28.850
<v Speaker 1>of toronto that will be mandatory and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll.</v>

748
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:32.280
<v Speaker 1>There are implicit punishments waiting</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wings for people who aren't</v>

749
00:37:32.281 --> 00:37:33.540
<v Speaker 1>really happy about doing that.</v>

750
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.733
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

751
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.400
<v Speaker 1>a diverse workforce includes people of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different races,</v>

752
00:37:41.401 --> 00:37:42.270
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>

753
00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:43.440
<v Speaker 1>ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex abilities,</v>

754
00:37:43.441 --> 00:37:45.780
<v Speaker 1>and sexual and gender identities at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>job levels.</v>

755
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one way of defining diverse.</v>

756
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gueSs I would think more about what</v>

757
00:37:50.431 --> 00:37:53.370
<v Speaker 1>constitutes a competent and effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>workforce,</v>

758
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.030
<v Speaker 1>but that is a secondary consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it is a secondary</v>

759
00:37:57.031 --> 00:37:58.950
<v Speaker 1>consideration at the university of</v>
<v Speaker 1>toronto,</v>

760
00:37:58.951 --> 00:38:01.530
<v Speaker 1>at least in the administration as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been able to tell.</v>

761
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.450
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean it isn't a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration,</v>

762
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:04.470
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

763
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.260
<v Speaker 1>you don't see this kind of discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>about competence and excellence,</v>

764
00:38:07.261 --> 00:38:09.420
<v Speaker 1>which is what a dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a university should really be</v>

765
00:38:09.421 --> 00:38:12.990
<v Speaker 1>aiming at right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Institutions of excellence and the idea</v>

766
00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:15.660
<v Speaker 1>that excellence is best served by this</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of diversity as a,</v>

767
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a specious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a specious.</v>

768
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

769
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.940
<v Speaker 1>at least it's a highly debatable claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any evidence for</v>

770
00:38:23.941 --> 00:38:25.410
<v Speaker 1>it whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

771
00:38:25.411 --> 00:38:26.244
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

772
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Diversity is seen by the Organization</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's employees as a source of</v>

773
00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:36.700
<v Speaker 1>strength and creativity sets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's by the organization of its</v>

774
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 1>employees as a source of strength and</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

775
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.480
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean it is a source of</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and creativity.</v>

776
00:38:41.481 --> 00:38:44.770
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you I know the creatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity literature very well and I</v>

777
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:47.980
<v Speaker 1>know the productivity literature pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and I don't think that there's any</v>

778
00:38:47.981 --> 00:38:49.840
<v Speaker 1>evidence at all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

779
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:52.510
<v Speaker 1>diversity produces an increment in</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

780
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.650
<v Speaker 1>CreatIvity seems to me to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be fundamentally a,</v>

781
00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a cardinal personality trait</v>

782
00:38:58.631 --> 00:39:01.180
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also associated with high</v>

783
00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually quite rare and there's no</v>

784
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:08.290
<v Speaker 1>evidence whatsoever that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that diversity increases workplace</v>

785
00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:09.130
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

786
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:12.010
<v Speaker 1>not that I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adding to the effective and efficient</v>

787
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:15.220
<v Speaker 1>delivery of servers services to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse client population.</v>

788
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are stated as facts and I don't</v>

789
00:39:17.441 --> 00:39:19.480
<v Speaker 1>think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the evidence for them is weak at</v>

790
00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:21.610
<v Speaker 1>best and nonexistent at worst.</v>

791
00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.950
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they're sorry,</v>

792
00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:24.880
<v Speaker 1>that false,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are false claims.</v>

793
00:39:24.881 --> 00:39:26.720
<v Speaker 1>At worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence for them is,</v>

794
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.800
<v Speaker 1>is nonexistent at best or weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And inclusive organizational culture is</v>

795
00:39:32.171 --> 00:39:34.210
<v Speaker 1>one in which the values of equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>

796
00:39:34.211 --> 00:39:34.961
<v Speaker 1>inclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

797
00:39:34.961 --> 00:39:37.960
<v Speaker 1>those have got to be the only values and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you as well that those are</v>

798
00:39:37.961 --> 00:39:40.760
<v Speaker 1>associated with trait agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what these,</v>

799
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.810
<v Speaker 1>these ideologies are expressions of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

800
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.713
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

801
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:44.741
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

802
00:39:44.741 --> 00:39:48.300
<v Speaker 1>of an underlying personality trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like the,</v>

803
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideological expression is the</v>

804
00:39:50.801 --> 00:39:53.250
<v Speaker 1>mouthpiece of the trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people who are very high and</v>

805
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.710
<v Speaker 1>traits like agreeableness are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to hold this sort of a value</v>

806
00:39:56.711 --> 00:39:58.720
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there are positing it as an</v>

807
00:39:58.721 --> 00:40:00.760
<v Speaker 1>absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an absolute because there are</v>

808
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:05.761
<v Speaker 1>at least five dimensions of personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are associated with values that are</v>

809
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:07.660
<v Speaker 1>necessary for people to live a balanced</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

810
00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.040
<v Speaker 1>So agaIn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a specious claim.</v>

811
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.030
<v Speaker 1>An inclusive organizational culture is</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in which the values of equity,</v>

812
00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:15.040
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inclusion are reflected in both the</v>

813
00:40:15.041 --> 00:40:17.920
<v Speaker 1>formal structure and in the informal</v>
<v Speaker 1>practices and norms.</v>

814
00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so her basic claim is that what she's</v>

815
00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:24.040
<v Speaker 1>going to do is to come in and help you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ensure that the hierarchy of values in</v>

816
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:26.290
<v Speaker 1>your organization is transformed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that equity,</v>

817
00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:27.940
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inclusion are at the top.</v>

818
00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's not obvious to me at all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the</v>

819
00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.080
<v Speaker 1>values that should be at the top of any</v>
<v Speaker 1>given organization.</v>

820
00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:39.580
<v Speaker 1>And certainly even if they are among the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest values of an organization,</v>

821
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:42.460
<v Speaker 1>there are many other organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other values that should be</v>

822
00:40:42.461 --> 00:40:46.570
<v Speaker 1>considered at least of equal importance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in an organization like the</v>

823
00:40:46.571 --> 00:40:49.240
<v Speaker 1>university of toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in principle is aiming at</v>

824
00:40:49.241 --> 00:40:52.360
<v Speaker 1>excellence in such an organizational</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

825
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:54.640
<v Speaker 1>All employees feel respected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable,</v>

826
00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.310
<v Speaker 1>and are able to bring their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his or her,</v>

827
00:40:57.311 --> 00:40:59.530
<v Speaker 1>their full self to work and have it</v>
<v Speaker 1>valued.</v>

828
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

829
00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:02.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't buy it because I don't think that</v>

830
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:08.250
<v Speaker 1>this emphasis on diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equity and inclusion has help employees</v>

831
00:41:08.501 --> 00:41:11.290
<v Speaker 1>feel respected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable and valued,</v>

832
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.860
<v Speaker 1>or that that is what makes them able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring their full self to work and have</v>

833
00:41:14.861 --> 00:41:18.280
<v Speaker 1>it valued propositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not facts not supported by the data.</v>

834
00:41:18.281 --> 00:41:20.920
<v Speaker 1>As far as I knoW,</v>
<v Speaker 1>research hasn't been done that would</v>

835
00:41:20.921 --> 00:41:23.710
<v Speaker 1>indicate that any of this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as far as I'm concerned,</v>

836
00:41:23.711 --> 00:41:27.790
<v Speaker 1>it's basically political cliche and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ill advised at best they are then able</v>

837
00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:29.650
<v Speaker 1>to contribute their best to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

838
00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>

839
00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:31.750
<v Speaker 1>but probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd had.</v>

840
00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any evidence for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know the literature</v>

841
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.230
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if anybody would like to have a</v>

842
00:41:36.231 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 2>debate about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be perfectly willing to,</v>

843
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do so.</v>

844
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.050
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

845
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is what else she does to address</v>

846
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:49.310
<v Speaker 2>the governance needs of an inclusive</v>
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>

847
00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Our services include tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques,</v>

848
00:41:51.621 --> 00:41:55.370
<v Speaker 2>and assistance such as assessing</v>
<v Speaker 2>existing diversity among board members</v>

849
00:41:55.371 --> 00:41:58.900
<v Speaker 2>to establish a benchmark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing a board recruitment process</v>

850
00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:03.410
<v Speaker 2>that incorporates her definition of</v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity and tailoring board documents</v>

851
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:05.750
<v Speaker 2>and statements to be more inclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

852
00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:07.070
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

853
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.850
<v Speaker 2>it's the dissemination of a politically</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct viewpoint through absolutely</v>

854
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.750
<v Speaker 2>every level of the organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also provide training to board</v>

855
00:42:14.751 --> 00:42:18.200
<v Speaker 2>members and offer board manuals to help</v>
<v Speaker 2>board members understand and integrate</v>

856
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:22.520
<v Speaker 2>issues related to her definition of</v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity into their decision making,</v>

857
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:26.180
<v Speaker 2>so that's what she offers and she worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>on her,</v>

858
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:31.040
<v Speaker 2>conducted 22 employment systems reviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's how widespread her influences</v>

859
00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 2>for a number of private nonprofit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>public sector organizations.</v>

860
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:37.940
<v Speaker 2>She also developed and delivered human</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights and here we go.</v>

861
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Unconscious bias training and what she</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually means by that is training</v>

862
00:42:42.231 --> 00:42:47.231
<v Speaker 2>against unconscious bias and already</v>
<v Speaker 2>laid out my objections to the idea of</v>

863
00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.470
<v Speaker 2>trading against unconscious bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really like this is a terrible thing.</v>

864
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.040
<v Speaker 2>We do not understand this anywhere near</v>
<v Speaker 2>well enough for people to go around</v>

865
00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:58.040
<v Speaker 2>telling themselves and offering their</v>
<v Speaker 2>services for sale.</v>

866
00:42:58.041 --> 00:42:58.521
<v Speaker 2>Saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

867
00:42:58.521 --> 00:43:01.430
<v Speaker 2>I Can come Into your organization and</v>
<v Speaker 2>help your employees reduce their</v>

868
00:43:01.431 --> 00:43:06.140
<v Speaker 2>unconscious bias and then also to accuse</v>
<v Speaker 2>your employees of having unconscious</v>

869
00:43:06.141 --> 00:43:09.680
<v Speaker 2>bias to a degree that necessitates their</v>
<v Speaker 2>retraining.</v>

870
00:43:09.681 --> 00:43:11.290
<v Speaker 2>That's an awful thing to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

871
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.030
<v Speaker 2>it is the presumption of guilt or</v>
<v Speaker 2>innocence and it's the presumption,</v>

872
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.900
<v Speaker 2>the presumption of a kind of guilt that</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one can escape from being accused of.</v>

873
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.560
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So conducted program reviews,</v>

874
00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:24.710
<v Speaker 2>conducted gender equity analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. So anyway,</v>

875
00:43:24.711 --> 00:43:27.800
<v Speaker 2>so that's the sort of person who's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be doing the training and I guess</v>

876
00:43:27.801 --> 00:43:32.801
<v Speaker 2>that's not really all that surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next person is.</v>

877
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one other thing.</v>

878
00:43:35.011 --> 00:43:37.610
<v Speaker 2>So this is tina turner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's one of the things that she sells</v>

879
00:43:37.611 --> 00:43:40.820
<v Speaker 2>on her website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called</v>

880
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:46.840
<v Speaker 2>defeating unconscious bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a dvd or usb,</v>

881
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:50.930
<v Speaker 2>it's for the lovely price of 775 to</v>
<v Speaker 2>$825.</v>

882
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Defeating unconscious bias is designed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to address the hidden biases that can</v>

883
00:43:54.861 --> 00:43:56.660
<v Speaker 2>affect hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting and team building.</v>

884
00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:58.880
<v Speaker 2>And that challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ability to create an inclusive</v>

885
00:43:58.881 --> 00:43:59.900
<v Speaker 2>workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

886
00:43:59.901 --> 00:44:01.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

887
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that that's something</v>

888
00:44:03.591 --> 00:44:06.890
<v Speaker 2>that can be done yet and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who claim that they can do it,</v>

889
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you can make up your own mind about</v>

890
00:44:10.401 --> 00:44:12.150
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

891
00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:17.260
<v Speaker 2>so next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

892
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:26.810
<v Speaker 2>so the final one is the assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assumption that training programs of</v>

893
00:44:26.811 --> 00:44:30.530
<v Speaker 2>this type would be effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's assume that there is a problem</v>

894
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 2>at the university of toronto</v>

895
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.120
<v Speaker 1>with racism and bias even though I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think there is not particularly,</v>

896
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the next and then let's assume that</v>

897
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:41.940
<v Speaker 1>the people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

898
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:46.260
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to bring people in to</v>
<v Speaker 1>train everyone out of their racism and</v>

899
00:44:46.261 --> 00:44:48.210
<v Speaker 1>bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious or otherwise,</v>

900
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:52.350
<v Speaker 1>then we might have to ensure that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to buy the idea that this</v>

901
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:53.910
<v Speaker 1>sort of training is effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

902
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Well no problem except here except this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a clinician and a research</v>

903
00:44:58.141 --> 00:45:01.230
<v Speaker 1>scientist say like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you've learned is</v>

904
00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:05.730
<v Speaker 1>that you do not put in place and</v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention without assessing its</v>

905
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.520
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because there</v>

906
00:45:08.521 --> 00:45:11.910
<v Speaker 1>have been well publicized failures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>social science interventions,</v>

907
00:45:11.911 --> 00:45:13.950
<v Speaker 1>which I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would consider this sort of</v>

908
00:45:13.951 --> 00:45:18.390
<v Speaker 1>training exactly that it falls under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same rubric because it's an educational</v>

909
00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:19.740
<v Speaker 1>or a psychological intervention.</v>

910
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.650
<v Speaker 1>There've been well documented</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic failures of such</v>

911
00:45:22.651 --> 00:45:24.570
<v Speaker 1>interventions in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most famous,</v>

912
00:45:24.571 --> 00:45:26.820
<v Speaker 1>one of those was called the somerville</v>
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>

913
00:45:26.821 --> 00:45:30.560
<v Speaker 1>which was done in the 19 thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A woman named joan mccord.</v>

914
00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very good criminologist conducted a</v>

915
00:45:33.211 --> 00:45:35.610
<v Speaker 1>lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the followup research to the somerville</v>

916
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:40.350
<v Speaker 1>study and the somerville study was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to take kids who are in a kind</v>

917
00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:44.280
<v Speaker 1>of rough inner city neighborhoods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them through psychological and</v>

918
00:45:44.281 --> 00:45:49.170
<v Speaker 1>sociological interventions to reduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>their risk of especially of crime in the</v>

919
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:51.750
<v Speaker 1>later years of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually what happened was that the</v>

920
00:45:51.751 --> 00:45:53.790
<v Speaker 1>intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although very carefully designed and I</v>

921
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:57.840
<v Speaker 1>would say admirably designed and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed by people who I did do think</v>

922
00:45:57.841 --> 00:46:01.830
<v Speaker 1>had the best interest of the kids at</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind in mind or at heart.</v>

923
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.520
<v Speaker 1>My consequences were that the kids who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in the intervention program</v>

924
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.120
<v Speaker 1>actually ended up being more criminal</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the kids that weren't,</v>

925
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.950
<v Speaker 1>and there's a large literature on this.</v>

926
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:13.890
<v Speaker 1>It was a very shocking study at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular set of the people who did it.</v>

927
00:46:13.891 --> 00:46:16.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic and and it's not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only.</v>

928
00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:21.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only study of its type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm posting the introduction to this</v>

929
00:46:21.841 --> 00:46:24.420
<v Speaker 1>book was written by joan mccord called</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime and family.</v>

930
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:28.110
<v Speaker 1>There's two chapters in that book that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the selected writings of john mccord,</v>

931
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:30.510
<v Speaker 1>one's called the cambridge somerville</v>
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>

932
00:46:30.511 --> 00:46:33.900
<v Speaker 1>a pioneering longitudinal experimental</v>
<v Speaker 1>study of delinquency prevention,</v>

933
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:39.380
<v Speaker 1>and then chapter four is cures that harm</v>
<v Speaker 1>unanticipated outcomes of crime</v>

934
00:46:39.391 --> 00:46:41.910
<v Speaker 1>prevention programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that could be of any kind of</v>

935
00:46:41.911 --> 00:46:44.540
<v Speaker 1>prevention program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll post the introduction so that</v>

936
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.040
<v Speaker 1>you guys can read that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point is quite clear.</v>

937
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.950
<v Speaker 1>You have an intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think there's a problem,</v>

938
00:46:49.951 --> 00:46:53.190
<v Speaker 1>you design an intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then it's incumbent on you to</v>

939
00:46:53.191 --> 00:46:56.760
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate carefully that the intention</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the intervention produces its</v>

940
00:46:56.761 --> 00:46:59.580
<v Speaker 1>desired effects because there's a high</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that it won't.</v>

941
00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.530
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a high probability that will</v>

942
00:47:01.531 --> 00:47:05.610
<v Speaker 1>produce the word reverse effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for all the hr department knows their</v>

943
00:47:05.611 --> 00:47:10.440
<v Speaker 1>mandatory training program could make</v>
<v Speaker 1>people more racist and more biased and I</v>

944
00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:15.441
<v Speaker 1>would say the mere fact that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>training is mandatory is highly likely</v>

945
00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:18.120
<v Speaker 1>to produce precisely that outcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to generate</v>

946
00:47:18.121 --> 00:47:20.940
<v Speaker 1>resentment among people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even people who are going who,</v>

947
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.730
<v Speaker 1>who would be relatively unwilling to</v>
<v Speaker 1>express that resentment.</v>

948
00:47:23.731 --> 00:47:26.730
<v Speaker 1>So my hypothesis would be as a scientist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a researcher,</v>

949
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:29.950
<v Speaker 1>if I was conducting this as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment that heidi to have two</v>

950
00:47:29.951 --> 00:47:30.784
<v Speaker 1>conditions</v>

951
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:33.340
<v Speaker 2>voluntary and mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I wouldn't be allowed to do</v>

952
00:47:33.341 --> 00:47:35.230
<v Speaker 2>that because that would be unethical by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

953
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:37.860
<v Speaker 2>according to the will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be an.</v>

954
00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:42.670
<v Speaker 2>That would be unethical research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would test to see if mandatory</v>

955
00:47:42.671 --> 00:47:46.210
<v Speaker 2>trading and voluntary trading had</v>
<v Speaker 2>different effects and my guess is that</v>

956
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 2>mandatory training would kick back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would reverse the effects of the</v>

957
00:47:49.001 --> 00:47:50.620
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we don't care about that sort of</v>

958
00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we put policy like this into place</v>

959
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:54.430
<v Speaker 2>because we already assume that we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing.</v>

960
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 2>And partly we do that because we know so</v>
<v Speaker 2>little about what we're doing that we</v>

961
00:47:59.531 --> 00:48:02.350
<v Speaker 2>can't even see what sort of mistakes we</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be making.</v>

962
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.270
<v Speaker 2>We just make assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is racism,</v>

963
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.550
<v Speaker 2>we know where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a training program,</v>

964
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.980
<v Speaker 2>the training program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll fix the racism and then things</v>

965
00:48:08.981 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 2>will be better and it doesn't matter if</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make it mandatory.</v>

966
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:11.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

967
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.500
<v Speaker 2>none of those propositions are viable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are all debatable.</v>

968
00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:18.490
<v Speaker 2>They all need to be tested and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>all dangerous in that they might produce</v>

969
00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:20.680
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an unintended consequence,</v>

970
00:48:20.681 --> 00:48:23.080
<v Speaker 2>a negative consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that there's lots of reason in the</v>

971
00:48:23.081 --> 00:48:25.030
<v Speaker 2>literature to assume that that might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case.</v>

972
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.250
<v Speaker 2>So I'll post that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys can read it.</v>

973
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.113
<v Speaker 2>You can think about it.</v>

974
00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Marilyn charles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's the one along with tan and</v>

975
00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:36.800
<v Speaker 2>turner who's going to be doing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

976
00:48:36.801 --> 00:48:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't find out that much about her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

977
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:42.650
<v Speaker 2>she's a sessional lecturer at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ontario institute of studies on</v>

978
00:48:42.651 --> 00:48:44.750
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I need to say something about</v>

979
00:48:44.751 --> 00:48:48.280
<v Speaker 2>noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that educational psychology is a</v>

980
00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:50.390
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily fad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>written discipline.</v>

981
00:48:50.391 --> 00:48:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I think the level of scholarship is</v>
<v Speaker 2>appallingly low.</v>

982
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can identify a number of fads that,</v>

983
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:57.440
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that rushed through the educational</v>

984
00:48:57.441 --> 00:48:58.850
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it pushed through by</v>

985
00:48:58.851 --> 00:49:01.100
<v Speaker 2>educational psychologists over the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>

986
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:04.250
<v Speaker 2>The idea of practical intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of them,</v>

987
00:49:04.251 --> 00:49:07.100
<v Speaker 2>the idea of whole word reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a catastrophe in the</v>

988
00:49:07.101 --> 00:49:09.320
<v Speaker 2>California school system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was another,</v>

989
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:12.500
<v Speaker 2>the notion that self esteem training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that self esteem even exists,</v>

990
00:49:12.501 --> 00:49:14.420
<v Speaker 2>which I don't think it does technically</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking.</v>

991
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:16.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very fundamentally have</v>
<v Speaker 2>trait.</v>

992
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't really movable.</v>

993
00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

994
00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.600
<v Speaker 2>there's some reasonable evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 2>self esteem training turn children into</v>

995
00:49:23.601 --> 00:49:26.090
<v Speaker 2>narcissists rather than increasing their</v>
<v Speaker 2>self esteem.</v>

996
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think there's any evidence</v>

997
00:49:28.881 --> 00:49:32.060
<v Speaker 2>that the self esteem programs had the</v>
<v Speaker 2>desired effect.</v>

998
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a variety of,</v>

999
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:34.960
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1000
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.550
<v Speaker 2>and then there's also the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple intelligences,</v>

1001
00:49:37.551 --> 00:49:40.490
<v Speaker 2>which is an absolutely specious idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a scientific perspective.</v>

1002
00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:44.600
<v Speaker 2>So educational psychology is</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably fad written and so,</v>

1003
00:49:44.601 --> 00:49:46.910
<v Speaker 2>and noisy is a major offender in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>regard.</v>

1004
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

1005
00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:49.280
<v Speaker 2>merlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>charles is,</v>

1006
00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:52.720
<v Speaker 2>it has a phd in education and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason I'm bringing up the fad</v>

1007
00:49:52.721 --> 00:49:55.850
<v Speaker 2>written issue is because she's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>specialist in what's called holistic</v>

1008
00:49:55.851 --> 00:49:58.670
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a philosophy of education based on</v>

1009
00:49:58.671 --> 00:50:02.390
<v Speaker 2>the premise that each person finds</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity meaning and purpose in life's</v>

1010
00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:05.170
<v Speaker 2>through connections to the community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the natural world entity,</v>

1011
00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.360
<v Speaker 2>humanitarian values such as compassion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and peace,</v>

1012
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:09.800
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1013
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.580
<v Speaker 2>which I would say also those values are</v>
<v Speaker 2>reflective of trait agreeableness by the</v>

1014
00:50:13.581 --> 00:50:14.720
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially compassion,</v>

1015
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.680
<v Speaker 2>holistic education names to call forth</v>
<v Speaker 2>from people and intrinsic reverence for</v>

1016
00:50:18.681 --> 00:50:20.570
<v Speaker 2>life and a passionate love of learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1017
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.360
<v Speaker 2>to me that's all cliche fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1018
00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:24.580
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1019
00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:27.920
<v Speaker 2>I sold the fact that she's a specialist</v>
<v Speaker 2>in education,</v>

1020
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:32.570
<v Speaker 1>does not indicate to me that she holds</v>
<v Speaker 1>the qualifications necessary to serve as</v>

1021
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 1>an advisor to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to policymakers at the university of</v>

1022
00:50:35.961 --> 00:50:36.980
<v Speaker 1>toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1023
00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.490
<v Speaker 1>so why is the university of toronto</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to these individuals and</v>

1024
00:50:42.491 --> 00:50:43.670
<v Speaker 1>groups?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1025
00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.220
<v Speaker 1>I Think there was a lot of reasons for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1026
00:50:45.221 --> 00:50:49.030
<v Speaker 1>but I think one of them is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they effectively present</v>

1027
00:50:49.031 --> 00:50:52.570
<v Speaker 1>themselves as oppressed or as experts in</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppression.</v>

1028
00:50:52.571 --> 00:50:53.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's enough,</v>

1029
00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:04.550
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things we might further</v>
<v Speaker 1>discusses what value should be being</v>

1030
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.620
<v Speaker 1>supported,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presented out the university.</v>

1031
00:51:06.621 --> 00:51:11.621
<v Speaker 1>And right now the pc onslaught is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is predicated on the idea that the</v>

1032
00:51:12.291 --> 00:51:15.710
<v Speaker 1>fundamental values are equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity and inclusion.</v>

1033
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:20.360
<v Speaker 1>And what I find troublesome about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is two fold,</v>

1034
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:25.580
<v Speaker 1>one that that's a very one sided</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of values and I mean that</v>

1035
00:51:25.581 --> 00:51:29.720
<v Speaker 1>technically because it's the values that</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people would hold as as,</v>

1036
00:51:29.721 --> 00:51:30.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrosanct.</v>

1037
00:51:30.981 --> 00:51:33.860
<v Speaker 1>And there's other sets of values that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be included in a properly</v>

1038
00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:38.590
<v Speaker 1>function in value hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for individuals and for society</v>

1039
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:42.290
<v Speaker 1>to stay balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that what also needs to</v>

1040
00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:45.830
<v Speaker 1>be included at the university are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>values associated with</v>

1041
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.500
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be roughly competence,</v>

1042
00:51:48.501 --> 00:51:51.140
<v Speaker 1>excellence and quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also of openness,</v>

1043
00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:56.141
<v Speaker 1>which is creative free inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those have to be considered at</v>

1044
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.060
<v Speaker 1>least as important and arguably as more</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

1045
00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:04.460
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that bothers me is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the definitions of equity and diversity</v>

1046
00:52:04.461 --> 00:52:09.461
<v Speaker 1>and inclusion are defined by precisely</v>
<v Speaker 1>the criteria that the social justice</v>

1047
00:52:09.531 --> 00:52:13.370
<v Speaker 1>warrior and pc types believe are</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible in some sense.</v>

1048
00:52:13.371 --> 00:52:17.000
<v Speaker 1>For all the ills in society and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're asking,</v>

1049
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:20.300
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're being required to construe</v>

1050
00:52:20.301 --> 00:52:22.670
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in terms of our group</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

1051
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:25.040
<v Speaker 1>whatever that group might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

1052
00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:25.970
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>

1053
00:52:25.971 --> 00:52:28.400
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual preference,</v>

1054
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.070
<v Speaker 1>sexual expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender expression,</v>

1055
00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.610
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Undoubtedly a plethora of new terms</v>

1056
00:52:34.611 --> 00:52:37.370
<v Speaker 1>to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're being asked to accept those,</v>

1057
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:39.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>divisions as,</v>

1058
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:42.440
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as indicative of indicative of the</v>

1059
00:52:42.441 --> 00:52:46.710
<v Speaker 1>fundamental differences between us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then to assume that the only way</v>

1060
00:52:46.711 --> 00:52:51.140
<v Speaker 1>that that you can judge whether or not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>society is fuNctioning properly is to</v>

1061
00:52:51.141 --> 00:52:55.220
<v Speaker 1>determine whether everY person where</v>
<v Speaker 1>were there,</v>

1062
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:59.120
<v Speaker 1>all of those categories are represented</v>
<v Speaker 1>numerically,</v>

1063
00:52:59.121 --> 00:53:02.420
<v Speaker 1>equally in every single situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1064
00:53:02.421 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1065
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a poor game that and Uh,</v>

1066
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:10.250
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the pc game and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to release a video on the pc game,</v>

1067
00:53:10.251 --> 00:53:12.380
<v Speaker 1>a short one to define exactly what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1068
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:16.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1069
00:53:16.071 --> 00:53:19.140
<v Speaker 1>so what might be done about such things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the next question in,</v>

1070
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:21.140
<v Speaker 1>in this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should be done?</v>

1071
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that her staff at the</v>

1072
00:53:25.111 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>university of toronto</v>

1073
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.300
<v Speaker 2>and and also and people everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>should refuse to subject themselves to</v>

1074
00:53:30.301 --> 00:53:34.560
<v Speaker 2>reeducation regarding their putative</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism and bias unless they want to</v>

1075
00:53:34.561 --> 00:53:38.310
<v Speaker 2>convict themselves by attending and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's exactly what they're doing</v>

1076
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:43.340
<v Speaker 2>is that if you're forced to undergo such</v>
<v Speaker 2>training and you agree,</v>

1077
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:47.850
<v Speaker 2>then by the fact that you attend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you agree that the intervention is</v>

1078
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:51.210
<v Speaker 2>justified and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that it's difficult for people to</v>

1079
00:53:51.211 --> 00:53:55.110
<v Speaker 2>stand up against this sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's as difficult as</v>

1080
00:53:55.111 --> 00:53:59.790
<v Speaker 2>people presume at least in in impossible</v>
<v Speaker 2>in at least possibly because I think</v>

1081
00:53:59.791 --> 00:54:02.640
<v Speaker 2>that the people who are pushing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing are actually not very</v>

1082
00:54:02.641 --> 00:54:04.590
<v Speaker 2>brave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they construe themselves</v>

1083
00:54:04.591 --> 00:54:09.190
<v Speaker 2>continually as victims and I have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sneaking suspicion that if people push</v>

1084
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:12.840
<v Speaker 2>back with any degree of firmness that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would back off very,</v>

1085
00:54:12.841 --> 00:54:15.140
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we need to find out because these,</v>

1086
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:16.950
<v Speaker 2>this sort of thing has to be stopped</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1087
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:21.810
<v Speaker 2>It can be still be stopped by peaceful</v>
<v Speaker 2>means and and I don't think that that's</v>

1088
00:54:21.811 --> 00:54:24.630
<v Speaker 2>going to be the case in 10 years if</v>
<v Speaker 2>things continue the way they are,</v>

1089
00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:29.250
<v Speaker 2>so it's time for people to stand up</v>
<v Speaker 2>using peaceful means and here's some</v>

1090
00:54:29.251 --> 00:54:33.750
<v Speaker 2>ways you should contact some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in charge and all of your</v>

1091
00:54:33.751 --> 00:54:37.770
<v Speaker 2>organization or in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university of toronto and express</v>

1092
00:54:37.771 --> 00:54:40.630
<v Speaker 2>your concern and you should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should say what you have to say in a</v>

1093
00:54:40.631 --> 00:54:43.950
<v Speaker 2>cool headed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear and well articulated manner.</v>

1094
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:48.210
<v Speaker 2>And you assumed to begin with</v>
<v Speaker 2>rationality and goodwill on the part of</v>

1095
00:54:48.211 --> 00:54:50.040
<v Speaker 2>the recipients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1096
00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:53.160
<v Speaker 2>you can consider that assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an act of courage on your part.</v>

1097
00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:57.660
<v Speaker 2>If you can't formulate your own words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can tell them that you found</v>

1098
00:54:57.661 --> 00:55:00.570
<v Speaker 2>the arguments in this video convincing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you want to highlight one or</v>

1099
00:55:00.571 --> 00:55:00.930
<v Speaker 2>two of them.</v>

1100
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I gave eight different arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could send them the link might,</v>

1101
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:07.320
<v Speaker 2>might also be interesting to ask these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people how much the university is</v>

1102
00:55:07.321 --> 00:55:09.960
<v Speaker 2>planning to pay for these training</v>
<v Speaker 2>sessions because that's something I'd be</v>

1103
00:55:09.961 --> 00:55:13.350
<v Speaker 2>very interested in knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's something that,</v>

1104
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:14.243
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1105
00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:17.190
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a valid manner matter for public</v>

1106
00:55:17.191 --> 00:55:18.620
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1107
00:55:18.621 --> 00:55:22.140
<v Speaker 2>And so here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the connections of the people,</v>

1108
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:27.250
<v Speaker 2>the contact information that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>enable you to contact the people who</v>

1109
00:55:27.271 --> 00:55:29.610
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are responsible for the policies.</v>

1110
00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Here they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first is erin jackson.</v>

1111
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:36.450
<v Speaker 2>She's the executive director,</v>
<v Speaker 2>internal resources,</v>

1112
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.330
<v Speaker 2>internal human resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took a look at her credentials.</v>

1113
00:55:39.331 --> 00:55:43.020
<v Speaker 2>She has a bachelor's degree with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced certificate from the rodman</v>

1114
00:55:43.021 --> 00:55:46.980
<v Speaker 2>advanced program in human resources</v>
<v Speaker 2>management and I can't see that,</v>

1115
00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:50.520
<v Speaker 2>that level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that level of qualification ensures that</v>

1116
00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:55.521
<v Speaker 2>she has the expertise necessary to</v>
<v Speaker 2>evaluate the effectiveness of the kind</v>

1117
00:55:55.581 --> 00:55:57.720
<v Speaker 2>of program that she's considering</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting in place.</v>

1118
00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.060
<v Speaker 2>So that's erin jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's at aaron dot jackson,</v>

1119
00:56:01.061 --> 00:56:02.640
<v Speaker 2>that you toronto dot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ca.</v>

1120
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:07.440
<v Speaker 2>And then she works for angela hilliard</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the vice president of human</v>

1121
00:56:07.441 --> 00:56:10.060
<v Speaker 2>resources and equity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1122
00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:15.290
<v Speaker 2>angela dot hilliard@utoronto.ca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then finally up above at the highest</v>

1123
00:56:17.821 --> 00:56:19.650
<v Speaker 2>plateau is the president of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>

1124
00:56:19.651 --> 00:56:22.860
<v Speaker 2>dr merrick hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can reach him at,</v>

1125
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:27.580
<v Speaker 2>at u toronto.ca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say email these folks,</v>

1126
00:56:27.581 --> 00:56:29.710
<v Speaker 2>if you email one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>email all three of them,</v>

1127
00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:33.250
<v Speaker 2>express your concern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would also say to the hr staff</v>

1128
00:56:33.251 --> 00:56:37.390
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be affected by this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should make your opposition</v>

1129
00:56:37.391 --> 00:56:42.391
<v Speaker 2>known unless you agree to convict</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself of your racism and bias by</v>

1130
00:56:42.491 --> 00:56:45.430
<v Speaker 2>attending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if enough of you did it,</v>

1131
00:56:45.431 --> 00:56:48.730
<v Speaker 2>it would come to a halt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least at least it could be put</v>

1132
00:56:48.731 --> 00:56:51.610
<v Speaker 2>forward that this program should not be</v>
<v Speaker 2>mandatory.</v>

1133
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So thank you very much for listening.</v>

1134
00:56:54.431 --> 00:56:56.740
<v Speaker 2>and soon enough I'll put up lecture</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

1135
00:56:56.741 --> 00:57:01.390
<v Speaker 2>which is going to be a very pragmatic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and focused lecture on tactics that can</v>

1136
00:57:01.391 --> 00:57:04.140
<v Speaker 2>be used to push back against the</v>
<v Speaker 2>political correct,</v>

1137
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.210
<v Speaker 2>against political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct excesses.</v>

1138
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Bye for now.</v>
