00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.570
<v Speaker 1>So I have a plan I'd like to talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I presume that most of you watching this</v>
<v Speaker 1>video are subscribers and are interested</v>

3
00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:15.550
<v Speaker 1>in the content of this channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to improve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some features of the videos,</v>

5
00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 1>especially the class lectures that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not happy about and I presume you're not</v>

6
00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>all that happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both them either.</v>

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most importantly,</v>

8
00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:28.564
<v Speaker 1>I think they lack the proper images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are also segments of the </v>

9
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>videos that are only relevant to an in </v>
<v Speaker 1>class audience,</v>

10
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:42.270
<v Speaker 1>so information about tests and so on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's parts of them that arena audible</v>

11
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:43.104
<v Speaker 1>or where the digressions aren't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate and as well there are </v>

12
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>lectures across years that pertained to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same theme that should be unified in</v>

13
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>some manner so that they're as </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible and tight as they could be.</v>

14
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.180
<v Speaker 1>I'd also like to make transcripts </v>
<v Speaker 1>available to people and it would be good</v>

15
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:03.014
<v Speaker 1>if the lectures were subtitled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The transcriptions would help with that </v>

16
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe they can also be </v>
<v Speaker 1>translated.</v>

17
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.023
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some volunteers who are already </v>

18
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:16.601
<v Speaker 1>working on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I set up a page for this channel on a</v>

19
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>site called Patrion.</v>

20
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Patriot allows people who are interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the contents of say a youtube channel</v>

21
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:26.384
<v Speaker 1>like this one</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help in the further development of </v>

22
00:01:30.261 --> 00:01:31.094
<v Speaker 1>the projects that are posted there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're interested in doing that </v>

23
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:38.540
<v Speaker 1>and you'd like to see the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I just described,</v>

24
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.660
<v Speaker 1>then you could click and subscribe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that would be good.</v>

25
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the plan.</v>
