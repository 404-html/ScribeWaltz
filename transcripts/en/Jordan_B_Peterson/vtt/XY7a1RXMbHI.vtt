1
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we're going to talk about the</v>

2
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological existential slash</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological psych guy trusts and</v>

3
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 1>their theories from the 1950s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I mentioned to you before,</v>

4
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>a lot of their thinking was motivated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>what had happened did in World War II.</v>

5
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I lecture to you last,</v>

6
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pointed out,</v>

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I described Nietzschean Dostoyevsky's</v>
<v Speaker 1>summation of the world situation and</v>

8
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>really the world psychological situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the 18 hundreds.</v>

9
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>And that was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>our new modes of thinking had undermined</v>

10
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>our faith and our old modes of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a problem because people</v>

11
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 1>need something firm to stand on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to orient themselves and to move</v>

12
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Nietzschean Dostoyevsky basically</v>

13
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>both prophesied that the consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dissolution would be,</v>

14
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased probability of nihilism and</v>

15
00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>everything that went along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dusty Yefsky wrote about that</v>

16
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>actually quite extensively in a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>called notes from underground,</v>

17
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>which if any of you are interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in clinical psychology,</v>

18
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>that's a book you should really read</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's one of the most brilliant</v>

19
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.550
<v Speaker 1>psychological studies of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a psychologically disturbed man</v>

21
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>that's ever been written.</v>

22
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It's very accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are sections in crime and</v>

23
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>punishment that are like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are unsurpassed in their</v>

24
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>representation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of psych,</v>

25
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.920
<v Speaker 1>of psychological phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

26
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he managed it.</v>

27
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean Dostoyevsky was epileptic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know that,</v>

28
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>he was arrested by the czar's men in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>late 18 hundreds for being a student</v>

30
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:45.501
<v Speaker 1>radical and they threw him in the main</v>
<v Speaker 1>prison in Moscow.</v>

31
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>And then one day they took him out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of a firing squad and shot him at</v>

32
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>six in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they only use blanks,</v>

33
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>which of course he didn't know about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that scared him so badly.</v>

34
00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>He developed epilepsy and then he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy.</v>

35
00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>That can happen by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>at Andy had epilepsy for the rest of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

37
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>but he had this strange kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy,</v>

38
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>which is actually not all that rare.</v>

39
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when people have epilepsy,</v>

40
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>they experienced this phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call an aura,</v>

41
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>which is an altered state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness before the epileptic</v>

42
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>seizure hits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can be very strange these</v>

43
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 1>auras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I read a case study once about a guy</v>

44
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:19.640
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>his aura was that his hand was being</v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed by devils from hell and he</v>

46
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>could feel the possession move up his</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm and into his shoulder.</v>

47
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>And once it hit his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd have an epileptic seizure.</v>

48
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.790
<v Speaker 1>And so then there was another case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where this man,</v>

50
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>his aura was that his exact double had</v>
<v Speaker 1>appeared behind him.</v>

51
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>But if you turn and if you turned to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

52
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>then you'd have an epileptic seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if he didn't turn to look,</v>

53
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>then he wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>

54
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain disorders are very strange things</v>

55
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>the system that is disordered is alive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's capable of any number of</v>

57
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily peculiar misbehaviors.</v>

58
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky's aura was a world revealing</v>

59
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>aura.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what Dostoyevsky would experience</v>

60
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>was that the meaning of things got</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper</v>

61
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>and deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then just as he was on the verge of</v>

62
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>discovering the secret to everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd have an epileptic seizure.</v>

63
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>But he said that the quality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience during the aura was so high,</v>

64
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>so overpowering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so deep that he would've traded all</v>

65
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>of his normal experience just to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>had those experiences.</v>

66
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>And he had them repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really do believe that it was this</v>

67
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>broadening of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his vision and concept by his</v>

68
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy that transformed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Among other things.</v>

69
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went through some pretty damn rough</v>

70
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>experiences because he was in prison</v>
<v Speaker 1>with rapists and murderers for a long</v>

71
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>time in Siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he was kind of an</v>

72
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>aristocratic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

73
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a rough time of it.</v>

74
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>And I imagine that that also broadened</v>
<v Speaker 1>him tremendously given that it didn't</v>

75
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:54.270
<v Speaker 1>kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

76
00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe that the epileptic</v>

77
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>insight was key to his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his unsurpassed genius.</v>

78
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the his aura and other people do</v>

79
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 1>experience epileptic aura symptoms like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that by the way.</v>

80
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And some people are so enamored of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aura that they won't take their</v>

81
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>antiepileptic epilepsy medication</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want to forego the</v>

82
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>experience that precedes the aura or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual,</v>

83
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>our actual epileptic seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Dostoyevsky's experiences,</v>

84
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>the op element of the aura is also</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant to what we're going to talk</v>

85
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>about today because both been swagger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and boss,</v>

86
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>we're very interested in how meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>revealed itself in the world.</v>

87
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.080
<v Speaker 1>And they had an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had opposing explanations.</v>

88
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I actually think they're parallel</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanations.</v>

89
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning that Dostoyevsky experienced</v>

90
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an amplification of the normal manner</v>

91
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>in which meaning reveals itself in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

92
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people experience that sort of thing</v>

93
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in various altered states of</v>

94
00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been swearing or in boss.</v>

95
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 1>So they work mostly in the 1950s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said,</v>

96
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:07.290
<v Speaker 1>they were very concerned about what had</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in world war two.</v>

97
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:11.030
<v Speaker 1>And so Dostoyevsky and Nichi had</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically predicted that it was going to</v>

98
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>be nihilism or ideological</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism.</v>

99
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

100
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 1>And by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time the 1930s appeared on the</v>

101
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans who had been,</v>

102
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.210
<v Speaker 1>they'd gone through an absolutely brutal</v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war and then they went</v>

104
00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:32.390
<v Speaker 1>through hyperinflation of insane</v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion.</v>

105
00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:37.340
<v Speaker 1>So in the 1920s Germany underwent this</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because they had such heavy war</v>

106
00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:41.900
<v Speaker 1>debts to pay for World War One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The German German inflation got to the</v>

107
00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:46.901
<v Speaker 1>point where it was literally upwards of</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 million marks to buy a loaf of</v>

108
00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:49.070
<v Speaker 1>bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:05:49.071 --> 00:05:52.970
<v Speaker 1>so they were taking wheelbarrows full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money to the grocery stores.</v>

110
00:05:52.971 --> 00:05:54.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened was their currency</v>

111
00:05:54.531 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 1>devalued to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

112
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 1>that actually happens to economies more</v>
<v Speaker 1>often than you might think.</v>

113
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>So the thing just hit zero and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

114
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And then it has to be rebooted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

115
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>So they had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war was dreadful in hundreds of</v>

116
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>thousands of men were killed or</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutalized.</v>

117
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Then their economy just absolutely fell</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

118
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

119
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>well a little bit earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revolution had taken place in</v>

120
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>

121
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

122
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the first world war and</v>

123
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>the communists had come to power and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>communists were agitating all over</v>

124
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Europe and in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

125
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>their goal was to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to produce a communist revolution that</v>

126
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>was worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Germans were all shorted out</v>

127
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 1>that the communists were going to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the country,</v>

128
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 1>which was a perfectly reasonable fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

129
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 1>instead of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened was that fascism or ropes</v>

130
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:48.860
<v Speaker 1>and fascism was a form of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of state and totalitarianism.</v>

131
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>And I think the Germans were so</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate for order by that point,</v>

132
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the fascists basically</v>

133
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 1>offered them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in theory.</v>

134
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately as it turned out,</v>

135
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>they offered them a little bit too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>order or maybe a lot too much order and</v>

136
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:05.620
<v Speaker 1>things went dreadfully south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

137
00:07:05.621 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 1>so then the whole world had to walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the horrors of World War Two.</v>

138
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was shocking in a variety of</v>

139
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only because of the brutality of the</v>

140
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 1>warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of the genocidal actions</v>

141
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:19.310
<v Speaker 1>that took place consciously by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>

142
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:22.550
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those actions were in many ways very</v>

143
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 1>difficult to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

144
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.010
<v Speaker 1>mean here's why they're particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to understand.</v>

145
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>There were certainly times where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutality that the Nazis employed in</v>

146
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:39.881
<v Speaker 1>their eradication of their theoretical</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies far surpassed the necessity for</v>

147
00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>the mere eradication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even worse than that,</v>

148
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 1>so it went past eradication into real</v>
<v Speaker 1>torture constantly.</v>

149
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many situations in which the</v>

150
00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially near the end of the war,</v>

151
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:56.420
<v Speaker 1>they had to decide really whether they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to continue exterminating</v>

152
00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Jews and Gypsies and homosexuals and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people they felt didn't fit into</v>

153
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:03.320
<v Speaker 1>their culture or whether they were going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to win the war.</v>

154
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 1>And there were decisions they had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make about the distribution of resources</v>

155
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:10.370
<v Speaker 1>where if they were going to pursue the</v>
<v Speaker 1>genocidal extermination,</v>

156
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 1>that would mean it would decrease the</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that they would win.</v>

157
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 1>The war not happened a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at the end.</v>

158
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>And the Nazis always picked continuing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extermination.</v>

159
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Now that's pretty damn interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 1>because you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well on the one hand,</v>

161
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

162
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.540
<v Speaker 1>if they are serving a creed and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>creed is world domination and this is</v>

163
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.840
<v Speaker 1>the extermination processes are</v>
<v Speaker 1>considered a step towards the actual end</v>

164
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the establishment of a world</v>

165
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 1>state of fascist world state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least a fascist European state,</v>

166
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 1>then you would think that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>extermination attempts would be</v>

167
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:49.610
<v Speaker 1>subordinate to that goal if they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually pursuing the goal that they</v>

168
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:52.100
<v Speaker 1>said they were pursuing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

169
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.130
<v Speaker 1>there's an old psychoanalytic idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really worthwhile.</v>

170
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like a surgical tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say if you're gonna use it</v>

171
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:01.020
<v Speaker 1>in your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use it carefully because you don't want</v>

172
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>to do unnecessary surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the rule is,</v>

173
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is union rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't remember exactly where I</v>

174
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 1>read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't understand why someone is</v>

175
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 1>doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the consequences of their</v>

176
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 1>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever those might be,</v>

177
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.370
<v Speaker 1>and then infer the motivation from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

178
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.660
<v Speaker 1>So if you see someone who seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing nothing except making everyone</v>

179
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>around them and themselves miserable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't understand why,</v>

180
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 1>one of the hypotheses that you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertain is that they're trying to make</v>

181
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>everyone around them miserable as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as themselves.</v>

182
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually their goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard for people to understand</v>

183
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of things because when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>see phenomena like the columbine</v>

184
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>shooters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.630
<v Speaker 1>we always assume that the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are doing these sorts of</v>

186
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>things is for other reasons.</v>

187
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Then the reasons they that the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>that appear to motivate them or even the</v>

188
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:57.400
<v Speaker 1>reasons they say they're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the columbine killer,</v>

189
00:09:57.401 --> 00:10:00.930
<v Speaker 1>especially the more literate one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said exactly why he was doing what he</v>

190
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:02.060
<v Speaker 1>was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

191
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.210
<v Speaker 1>it's as clear as it could possibly be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is go online and read</v>

192
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:08.640
<v Speaker 1>what he said and he tells you what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was up to.</v>

193
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 1>But people don't like to think that way</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't believe that anybody</v>

194
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:16.620
<v Speaker 1>could be consciously possessed of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>much malevolence without there being</v>

195
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:18.750
<v Speaker 1>some other kind of cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

196
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was bullied at school or you know,</v>

197
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:24.840
<v Speaker 1>he was an outcast and those things were</v>
<v Speaker 1>only vaguely true and they certainly</v>

198
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 1>weren't more true of having them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were true of,</v>

199
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people in high school are,</v>

200
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullied in somewhat outkast?</v>

201
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be 10%.</v>

202
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more like 30 you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that the schools are</v>

203
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:39.030
<v Speaker 1>blowing up all over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 1>all over all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely insufficient</v>

205
00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:45.150
<v Speaker 1>explanation anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

206
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:48.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people turn to possession by very,</v>

207
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:51.630
<v Speaker 1>very strict ideological ideas and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

208
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 1>they were willing to be possessed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas to the point where they</v>

209
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 1>would undertake actions that you'd think</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be completely impossible for</v>

210
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.700
<v Speaker 1>theoretically civilized people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

211
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 1>it turned out that those sec actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only,</v>

212
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:07.590
<v Speaker 1>we're not impossible for civilized</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

213
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 1>but the people themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.290
<v Speaker 1>especially in Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pretty much knew what the hell was</v>

215
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:14.220
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

216
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 1>you don't take several million people</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of your population without rumors</v>

217
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:19.530
<v Speaker 1>spreading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

218
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:20.581
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:22.710
<v Speaker 1>we should never forget that Hitler was</v>
<v Speaker 1>elected,</v>

220
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was elected by a large margin</v>

221
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>majority too.</v>

222
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.530
<v Speaker 1>It was a landslide vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kind of vote that no modern</v>

223
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:31.530
<v Speaker 1>democratic leader ever gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

224
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's difficult to,</v>

225
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.740
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult for people to swallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

226
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:43.490
<v Speaker 1>it's hard not to assign culpability for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in Germany to the society</v>

227
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:49.410
<v Speaker 1>at every strata.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just dump it on the leaders</v>

228
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:49.680
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

229
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.050
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that,</v>

230
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's something to think about with</v>

231
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:55.300
<v Speaker 1>regards to Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

232
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:58.540
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you might ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>is how the hell could he be so,</v>

233
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.010
<v Speaker 1>so absolutely compelling to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>audiences.</v>

234
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:03.491
<v Speaker 1>But here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

235
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

236
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:08.020
<v Speaker 1>let's make the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's make a few assumptions.</v>

237
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:12.610
<v Speaker 1>The first assumption is there are a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of resentful Germans kicking around.</v>

238
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

239
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.050
<v Speaker 1>they lost the first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't so good.</v>

240
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And then there were a lot of brutal man</v>
<v Speaker 1>left because they'd been in the trenches</v>

241
00:12:20.861 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 1>and they'd been shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting and shooting at each other</v>

242
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 1>under absolutely aborad conditions for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like years and years.</v>

243
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.230
<v Speaker 1>And so there were plenty of brutalized</v>
<v Speaker 1>men around.</v>

244
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then their whole damned economy</v>

245
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Speaker 1>collapsed because they were forced into</v>
<v Speaker 1>signing what historians regard is a very</v>

246
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:41.080
<v Speaker 1>punitive peace treaty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like everything had fallen apart</v>

247
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 1>to a degree that we can't even begin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

248
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

249
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.620
<v Speaker 1>in the 1930s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans were starting to get back on</v>

250
00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:49.510
<v Speaker 1>their feet and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

251
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.840
<v Speaker 1>when Hitler came to power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started not only to rearm but to ray</v>

252
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:55.780
<v Speaker 1>industrialize the economy and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually pretty damn good at that.</v>

253
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:58.930
<v Speaker 1>So now Hitler was a good orator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

254
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.870
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't exactly clear that he was a</v>

255
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.880
<v Speaker 1>coherent philosophical theorize or</v>
<v Speaker 1>although to think of him as stupid as it</v>

256
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 1>is completely missing the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was by no means stupid.</v>

257
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that he was particularly</v>

258
00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 1>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had a very powerfully developed</v>

259
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic sense and he spent a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his time designing the cities that would</v>

260
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 1>be built after World War II was over in</v>
<v Speaker 1>those cities were generally</v>

261
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.390
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize by him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has places where the arts or at least a</v>

262
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Nazi version of the arts could flourish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:35.500
<v Speaker 1>so there's no real evidence that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>was wrong with the Nazis was that they</v>

264
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:36.760
<v Speaker 1>were civilized.</v>

265
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.600
<v Speaker 1>There's more evidence actually I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were too civilized and I'll</v>

266
00:13:40.601 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 1>talk to you about that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

267
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did Hitler get all these people</v>

268
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.040
<v Speaker 1>under his spell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

269
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 1>here's a hypothesis that's basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>derived from union thinking.</v>

270
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:54.730
<v Speaker 1>And I should let you know by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes young has been accused</v>

271
00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:57.730
<v Speaker 1>of being an anti Semite and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>various reasons for this,</v>

272
00:13:57.731 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Speaker 1>partly because of what happened during</v>
<v Speaker 1>World War II.</v>

273
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.910
<v Speaker 1>And pardon me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm,</v>

274
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.500
<v Speaker 1>his theory drew heavily from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

275
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:08.920
<v Speaker 1>although for many other sources as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did believe that there were</v>

276
00:14:08.921 --> 00:14:12.280
<v Speaker 1>differences in the psychology of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>with different ethnicities.</v>

277
00:14:12.281 --> 00:14:13.330
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.360
<v Speaker 1>whether that's racist or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on whether or not you like the</v>

279
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 1>person you're talking to because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lefties think that there are cultural</v>

280
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.450
<v Speaker 1>differences in they're important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you ever talk about them in the</v>

281
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:24.670
<v Speaker 1>wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're racist and the right</v>

282
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:26.320
<v Speaker 1>wingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they just think there are ethnic</v>

283
00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:27.550
<v Speaker 1>differences to begin with.</v>

284
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's a tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tricky issue.</v>

285
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:33.430
<v Speaker 1>If there aren't differences that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>important than who the hell cares about</v>

286
00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:36.100
<v Speaker 1>multiculturalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even worth preserving.</v>

287
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.950
<v Speaker 1>And if there are differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're stuck with having to</v>

288
00:14:38.951 --> 00:14:41.530
<v Speaker 1>deal with the differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're basically screwed either way.</v>

289
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.950
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young has been the target of many</v>

290
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:49.060
<v Speaker 1>accusations of antisemitism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly by biographers who were</v>

291
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>resentful and clueless and historically</v>
<v Speaker 1>uninformed.</v>

292
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.700
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say malevolent fundamentally.</v>

293
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he worked as a CIA agent,</v>

294
00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 1>it was just revealed last year and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

295
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:05.660
<v Speaker 1>he provided psychological reports to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American government on the underlying</v>

296
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:08.690
<v Speaker 1>psychological structure of the Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders for years.</v>

297
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.330
<v Speaker 1>And he never told anybody about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>while he was alive.</v>

298
00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:14.570
<v Speaker 1>It only came to light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it only came to light as far as I</v>

299
00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:16.730
<v Speaker 1>know last year or perhaps a year before</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

300
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

301
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:19.851
<v Speaker 1>the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

302
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:22.010
<v Speaker 1>they weren't very happy about the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn situation.</v>

303
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.920
<v Speaker 1>And so when they were aggregating on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohs you think,</v>

304
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:27.230
<v Speaker 1>well what happens when all people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>together in a group?</v>

305
00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:29.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talked about that last time when</v>

306
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:32.480
<v Speaker 1>we talked about Kierkegaard is idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you get a bunch of people</v>

307
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how truthful they are,</v>

308
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:38.900
<v Speaker 1>all as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly the crowd is not a truthful</v>

309
00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:40.040
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

310
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:40.660
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

311
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.000
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are real reasons for that.</v>

312
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Real psychological reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the famous ash experiments,</v>

313
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I hope that those are the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments.</v>

314
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 1>A S C h about line length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:55.370
<v Speaker 1>so you draw two lines on the board and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the same length and you get the</v>

316
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.750
<v Speaker 1>crowd to collaborate with you and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask some poor sucker who doesn't know</v>

317
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:01.180
<v Speaker 1>about the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

318
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.510
<v Speaker 1>to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

319
00:16:02.511 --> 00:16:04.070
<v Speaker 1>you ask one person and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

320
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:05.810
<v Speaker 1>those lines are different in length.</v>

321
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.010
<v Speaker 1>And you ask another person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

322
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:07.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

323
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.740
<v Speaker 1>they're quite different in length.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another person says,</v>

324
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sure I can see the difference in</v>

325
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:13.670
<v Speaker 1>length.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you ask the poor pigeon,</v>

326
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they different in length?</v>

327
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.200
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

328
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can understand why.</v>

329
00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:25.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like if all those other people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying it does either there's either</v>

330
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:29.570
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems unlikely or he's the victim</v>

331
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:32.450
<v Speaker 1>of a conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a little on the paranoid side</v>

332
00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:34.970
<v Speaker 1>but happens to actually be true in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

333
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or he's just not looking at it.</v>

334
00:16:38.361 --> 00:16:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

335
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:41.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the humble thing to think is he's wrong.</v>

336
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.681
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

337
00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:45.620
<v Speaker 1>the fact that somebody might go along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the crowd,</v>

338
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

339
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:49.100
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can blame that on their,</v>

340
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.340
<v Speaker 1>on their ability to be social and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional,</v>

341
00:16:52.341 --> 00:16:56.360
<v Speaker 1>which in many ways is a huge advantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you are all antisocial and</v>

342
00:16:56.361 --> 00:16:58.010
<v Speaker 1>unconventional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

343
00:16:58.011 --> 00:17:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean there'd be a good chunk of you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>jail and we certainly wouldn't be having</v>

344
00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:03.111
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:05.600
<v Speaker 1>delightful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful conversation that we're having.</v>

346
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.111
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

347
00:17:06.111 --> 00:17:10.520
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to underestimate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>utility of conventionality to too much</v>

348
00:17:10.521 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 1>of a degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

349
00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:17.000
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this funny story I read once,</v>

350
00:17:17.001 --> 00:17:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be,</v>

351
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:24.040
<v Speaker 1>whereas psychology class got together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and decided they'd play a trick on the</v>

352
00:17:24.041 --> 00:17:27.430
<v Speaker 1>professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the trick was that he would walk</v>

353
00:17:27.431 --> 00:17:28.500
<v Speaker 1>back and forth a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

354
00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.900
<v Speaker 1>and the trick was that they wouldn't pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>any attention to them at all if he was</v>

355
00:17:31.901 --> 00:17:33.280
<v Speaker 1>on the left side of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

356
00:17:33.281 --> 00:17:35.170
<v Speaker 1>they talk a bit and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look up.</v>

357
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.940
<v Speaker 1>And if he was on the right side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

358
00:17:36.941 --> 00:17:38.840
<v Speaker 1>then they'd really focus in and pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

359
00:17:38.841 --> 00:17:41.800
<v Speaker 1>And the story goes that by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

360
00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:44.710
<v Speaker 1>by several weeks of this little trick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had them like lecturing right</v>

361
00:17:44.711 --> 00:17:45.700
<v Speaker 1>beside the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

362
00:17:45.701 --> 00:17:48.880
<v Speaker 1>and he wouldn't move from that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason I'm telling you that</v>

363
00:17:48.881 --> 00:17:53.490
<v Speaker 1>is it's pretty obvious that people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>respond to the cues that a crowd is</v>

364
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 1>delivering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

365
00:17:54.631 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 1>when a good speaker does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

366
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.150
<v Speaker 1>So a good speaker does a variety of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and one is the never talks to</v>

367
00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:02.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the crowd per se.</v>

368
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you pick out specific individuals</v>

369
00:18:04.411 --> 00:18:07.980
<v Speaker 1>and talk to them and they're sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflective of the crowd and then you can</v>

370
00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:10.640
<v Speaker 1>tell if everybody's understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

371
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.580
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that a good speaker does</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pay attention to the damn responses</v>

372
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:17.490
<v Speaker 1>of the crowd because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

373
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.030
<v Speaker 1>if a lecture is really a dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the,</v>

374
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:26.090
<v Speaker 1>the audience is only emitting nonverbal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nonverbal elements of the</v>

375
00:18:26.701 --> 00:18:28.710
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those nonverbal elements,</v>

376
00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 1>those damn things are important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to stay in touch with the</v>

377
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:36.030
<v Speaker 1>nonverbal communications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Hitler,</v>

378
00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:37.920
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of a chaotic guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

379
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.620
<v Speaker 1>he's very angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's angry in part because he was a</v>

380
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:43.620
<v Speaker 1>frustrated art student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tried to get into art school like</v>

381
00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:47.880
<v Speaker 1>four times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really the person to blame for World</v>

382
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.300
<v Speaker 1>War II was the foreperson committee that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't let poor Hitler into the,</v>

383
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was the Viennese School of</v>
<v Speaker 1>art because he really wanted to go,</v>

384
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had some artistic talent.</v>

385
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.330
<v Speaker 1>He was a little on the conventional side</v>
<v Speaker 1>by all appearances.</v>

386
00:19:00.331 --> 00:19:03.150
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some of his sketches and you</v>

387
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:05.070
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't a complete piker and he kind</v>

388
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:08.070
<v Speaker 1>of felt maybe it would be okay for him</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go to university because he just been</v>

389
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:09.450
<v Speaker 1>through World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

390
00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:13.050
<v Speaker 1>And that wasn't much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a story about Hitler where he</v>

391
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:16.800
<v Speaker 1>was out on in the trenches and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>there with all his buddies and he</v>

392
00:19:16.801 --> 00:19:19.020
<v Speaker 1>wandered off to do whatever he wandered</v>
<v Speaker 1>off to do.</v>

393
00:19:19.021 --> 00:19:22.140
<v Speaker 1>And when he came back they were all dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a bomb had blended right in the</v>

394
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:23.490
<v Speaker 1>middle of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

395
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 1>you might think that would do the little</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to your psyche because after</v>

396
00:19:26.971 --> 00:19:28.830
<v Speaker 1>an experience like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're either going to think,</v>

397
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:30.990
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are pretty damn random and</v>

398
00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:32.160
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there's pretty,</v>

399
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:36.270
<v Speaker 1>there's something pretty damn special</v>
<v Speaker 1>about me because I wasn't killed by the</v>

400
00:19:36.271 --> 00:19:36.660
<v Speaker 1>bomb.</v>

401
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe God has saved me for a higher</v>

402
00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:39.900
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

403
00:19:39.901 --> 00:19:44.160
<v Speaker 1>you can be absolutely sure that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>went through an experience like that,</v>

404
00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:46.620
<v Speaker 1>that something like that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>rattling around in your mind.</v>

405
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.020
<v Speaker 1>And he won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won a medal for bravery,</v>

406
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he kinda,</v>

407
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.810
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after World War One,</v>

408
00:19:51.811 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 1>he kind of wandered around like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>men unemployed in sort of like a tramp,</v>

409
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:57.660
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't very happy about that.</v>

410
00:19:57.661 --> 00:19:58.770
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

411
00:19:58.771 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 1>no wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

412
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.280
<v Speaker 1>he didn't get into art school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he didn't really have a fully</v>

413
00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:07.070
<v Speaker 1>developed political theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

414
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was pretty good at speaking,</v>

415
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:11.340
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were lots of people who had</v>

416
00:20:11.341 --> 00:20:14.940
<v Speaker 1>come to s to hear him speak because</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were sort of trying to figure out</v>

417
00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:17.220
<v Speaker 1>what the hell to do about all the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 1>so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

419
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.340
<v Speaker 1>what did he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was hitting?</v>

420
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.040
<v Speaker 1>They're good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

421
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.200
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to switch to a slightly</v>

422
00:20:25.201 --> 00:20:27.060
<v Speaker 1>different story and then I'll get back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this one.</v>

423
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:29.700
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if you guys know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

424
00:20:29.701 --> 00:20:34.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daycare scandals that,</v>

425
00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.110
<v Speaker 1>that were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common in the 1980s.</v>

426
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:41.250
<v Speaker 1>So horribly common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually this infested many towns.</v>

427
00:20:41.251 --> 00:20:44.610
<v Speaker 1>And usually what would happen is</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who is a little on the paranoid</v>

428
00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:49.150
<v Speaker 1>side or maybe a lot on the paranoid side</v>
<v Speaker 1>was their children off to daycare.</v>

429
00:20:49.151 --> 00:20:50.680
<v Speaker 1>And that was a whole new thing in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>80s,</v>

430
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:51.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because women were,</v>

431
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving into the workforce like mad.</v>

432
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:56.230
<v Speaker 1>And so they were handing over there</v>
<v Speaker 1>often their infants,</v>

433
00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 1>kids below three say two total</v>
<v Speaker 1>strangers.</v>

434
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:01.450
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some of them that set up a fair bit</v>

435
00:21:01.451 --> 00:21:02.800
<v Speaker 1>of worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's still does.</v>

436
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:06.010
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that word got out of hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially among the people who are a</v>

437
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:10.090
<v Speaker 1>little on the little predisposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid schizophrenia and maybe even</v>

438
00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:11.980
<v Speaker 1>had had some previous episodes.</v>

439
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:12.970
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

440
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:17.260
<v Speaker 1>the kid would come home and the mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>would observe or not something kind of</v>

441
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:20.470
<v Speaker 1>peculiar about their behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she'd fantasize about maybe</v>

442
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:23.200
<v Speaker 1>what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when she started asking the</v>

443
00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:26.920
<v Speaker 1>child if the child had been touched in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any particular way and you know,</v>

444
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.350
<v Speaker 1>and she keeps this up for a good length</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

445
00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:33.120
<v Speaker 1>And then the child would start to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmares and then the child would tell</v>

446
00:21:33.121 --> 00:21:36.310
<v Speaker 1>the mother about what the nightmares</v>
<v Speaker 1>were and then that would freak her out.</v>

447
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:38.590
<v Speaker 1>And so she'd ask even deeper questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and soon,</v>

448
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her children were telling her that</v>

449
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.030
<v Speaker 1>horrible things were happening to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>at daycare.</v>

450
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.200
<v Speaker 1>And so then she'd go to the police and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't look into recycling</v>

451
00:21:46.201 --> 00:21:48.610
<v Speaker 1>patrick background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the police would go out and</v>

452
00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:50.500
<v Speaker 1>they'd start to interview other</v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

453
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.250
<v Speaker 1>And if they interviewed them properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the other children would start to</v>

454
00:21:54.251 --> 00:21:56.970
<v Speaker 1>produce all these stories as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the now,</v>

455
00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.630
<v Speaker 1>how did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

456
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.450
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is</v>

457
00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.780
<v Speaker 1>the police would ask leading questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

458
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.910
<v Speaker 1>did anyone touch you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

459
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.460
<v Speaker 1>of course I'm going to touch the cans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

460
00:22:11.461 --> 00:22:14.490
<v Speaker 1>people touch kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did anybody touch you there?</v>

461
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a question.</v>

462
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a piece of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The piece of information is if someone</v>

463
00:22:21.811 --> 00:22:25.980
<v Speaker 1>touched me there and adult would be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in that,</v>

464
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now at what's a child doing when he's</v>

465
00:22:28.861 --> 00:22:31.950
<v Speaker 1>answering and adults questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth child doesn't bloody well know</v>

466
00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:33.900
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do they know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like three.</v>

467
00:22:33.901 --> 00:22:36.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't hardly organize their story.</v>

468
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking to a kid and you want</v>

469
00:22:38.911 --> 00:22:41.700
<v Speaker 1>to give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them to give you an account of their</v>

470
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.310
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to really guide them through</v>

471
00:22:44.311 --> 00:22:47.670
<v Speaker 1>the Organization of their memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly what they're doing when</v>

472
00:22:47.671 --> 00:22:51.120
<v Speaker 1>you're doing that is they're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>you trying to figure out if they're</v>

473
00:22:51.121 --> 00:22:54.420
<v Speaker 1>telling you the right things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what they should be doing.</v>

474
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Because what they're trying to learn to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do is to tell people things in a way</v>

475
00:22:58.171 --> 00:23:00.570
<v Speaker 1>that they'll understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that makes the child very,</v>

476
00:23:00.571 --> 00:23:05.190
<v Speaker 1>very responsive to the nonverbal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>verbal cues of the adult.</v>

477
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.520
<v Speaker 1>You think about how fast those little</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats learn how to pick up language.</v>

478
00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:10.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really very fast and no one really</v>

479
00:23:10.921 --> 00:23:13.620
<v Speaker 1>teaches them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just paying attention like mad.</v>

480
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:18.030
<v Speaker 1>So you get a bunch of cops who were on</v>
<v Speaker 1>how like a half cocked adventure and</v>

481
00:23:18.031 --> 00:23:21.720
<v Speaker 1>they think there's some serial sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>pervert in their midst and they go</v>

482
00:23:21.721 --> 00:23:22.950
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

483
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.650
<v Speaker 1>1520 kids and they do do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

484
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.200
<v Speaker 1>do it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use little dolls and they do it a</v>

485
00:23:28.201 --> 00:23:32.040
<v Speaker 1>lot and they do it a lot and they do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot and sooner or later all the kids</v>

486
00:23:32.041 --> 00:23:36.270
<v Speaker 1>start having nightmares and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>start telling the cops there's all these</v>

487
00:23:36.271 --> 00:23:37.470
<v Speaker 1>terrible things happen.</v>

488
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Like they're taking into underground</v>
<v Speaker 1>caverns in there,</v>

489
00:23:39.721 --> 00:23:44.130
<v Speaker 1>strip naked and they're forced to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>leap frog over each other and like you</v>

490
00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:46.760
<v Speaker 1>just can't believe what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't believe it.</v>

491
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:49.550
<v Speaker 1>It's all documented in a book called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan's silence,</v>

492
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 1>which was written by a social worker and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lawyer.</v>

493
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 1>It's mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The longest prison sentence is in</v>

494
00:23:55.761 --> 00:24:00.761
<v Speaker 1>American history were handed out to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a series of middle aged women who are</v>

495
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:04.580
<v Speaker 1>taking care of little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the FBI even came up with a whole</v>

496
00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:09.440
<v Speaker 1>new criminal category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late onset female sexual offender.</v>

497
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't that category exists before?</v>

498
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.290
<v Speaker 1>It's simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no late onset,</v>

499
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 1>middle aged female sexual offenders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we didn't need the category.</v>

500
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.610
<v Speaker 1>But once all these accusations came up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well poof,</v>

501
00:24:22.611 --> 00:24:24.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to have some damn category for</v>

502
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:28.070
<v Speaker 1>these poor women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them were put in jail for 350</v>

503
00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:30.560
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems a bit excessive given that</v>

504
00:24:30.561 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 1>they're only going to last about 40 you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

505
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:35.630
<v Speaker 1>they'd get 12 consecutive life</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>

506
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:36.890
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

507
00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:41.891
<v Speaker 1>there was actually a situation where one</v>
<v Speaker 1>town went so far as to start digging</v>

508
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.420
<v Speaker 1>underneath the town to find these</v>
<v Speaker 1>underground satanic layers where all</v>

509
00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:50.300
<v Speaker 1>these weird ritual things were going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

510
00:24:50.301 --> 00:24:55.301
<v Speaker 1>and along with this was not one shred of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Collab of concrete evidence,</v>

511
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the eventual conclusions and this</v>

512
00:24:58.971 --> 00:25:02.540
<v Speaker 1>affected thousands of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eventual conclusions was while</v>

513
00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:04.550
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there actually isn't anybody who's,</v>

514
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:05.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saint,</v>

515
00:25:05.721 --> 00:25:07.330
<v Speaker 1>technically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

516
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.400
<v Speaker 1>torturing children in daycare centers</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

517
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.770
<v Speaker 1>now anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I telling you this?</v>

518
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

519
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.650
<v Speaker 1>what the children were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about how the hell did the</v>

520
00:25:24.651 --> 00:25:27.590
<v Speaker 1>children come up with these weird ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

521
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:28.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

522
00:25:28.551 --> 00:25:32.660
<v Speaker 1>we should note the children are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid and they can also dream up the</v>

523
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:34.580
<v Speaker 1>most horrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

524
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have an imagination that's</v>

525
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:40.490
<v Speaker 1>capable of extending itself out into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>

526
00:25:40.491 --> 00:25:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Now everyone knows that because all you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do is remember when you were a</v>

527
00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:44.450
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

528
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.300
<v Speaker 1>when you were hiding under the covers</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there were horrible things in</v>

529
00:25:47.301 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 1>your dark room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

530
00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.430
<v Speaker 1>you can populate the darkness with</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters with no problem.</v>

531
00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:54.770
<v Speaker 1>And you should be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are monsters in the</v>

532
00:25:54.771 --> 00:25:56.870
<v Speaker 1>darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though your parents might tell you</v>

533
00:25:56.871 --> 00:25:59.500
<v Speaker 1>there aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there might not be any door</v>

534
00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.540
<v Speaker 1>monsters in that particular piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness.</v>

535
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's a perfectly reasonable thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell your children.</v>

536
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.550
<v Speaker 1>But in the darkness as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

537
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:08.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look the hell out.</v>

538
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.670
<v Speaker 1>So the children aren't stupid now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the PA,</v>

539
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adults start to question them and</v>

540
00:26:15.081 --> 00:26:18.410
<v Speaker 1>the kids or the back of their brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little imaginative part is thinking,</v>

541
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.810
<v Speaker 1>what do these people want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do these people want?</v>

542
00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.360
<v Speaker 1>What do these people want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they'll throw him out a little</v>

543
00:26:23.361 --> 00:26:26.360
<v Speaker 1>bit of information and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adults will perk up.</v>

544
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.640
<v Speaker 1>They'll focus right on that piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

545
00:26:28.641 --> 00:26:33.641
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's a cop who really hates</v>
<v Speaker 1>childs satanist abductors,</v>

546
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:34.431
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

547
00:26:34.431 --> 00:26:39.230
<v Speaker 1>it's perfectly reasonable stance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when the child offers any</v>

548
00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:42.620
<v Speaker 1>information about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the existence of such a thing,</v>

549
00:26:42.621 --> 00:26:45.210
<v Speaker 1>while the cop will perk up and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>child thinks,</v>

550
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:45.781
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>

551
00:26:45.781 --> 00:26:47.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sort of what's going on,</v>

552
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:49.950
<v Speaker 1>it seems to have something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't think this consciously,</v>

553
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their imagination is working.</v>

554
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.130
<v Speaker 1>How do I model the reality that's being</v>
<v Speaker 1>presented to me?</v>

555
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's when the dream start to kick</v>
<v Speaker 1>in too.</v>

556
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by</v>

557
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:09.020
<v Speaker 1>speaking in the appropriate way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get all sorts of things churned</v>

558
00:27:10.201 --> 00:27:13.590
<v Speaker 1>up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the unconscious minds of your</v>

559
00:27:13.591 --> 00:27:14.424
<v Speaker 1>listeners.</v>

560
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:23.500
<v Speaker 1>And by watching them as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can extract out there unconscious</v>

561
00:27:24.561 --> 00:27:25.730
<v Speaker 1>desires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone,</v>

562
00:27:25.731 --> 00:27:30.731
<v Speaker 1>now I'm speaking to you all and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all irritated because your life has been</v>

563
00:27:31.491 --> 00:27:35.720
<v Speaker 1>really awful for 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm saying this and I'm saying that</v>

564
00:27:35.721 --> 00:27:38.330
<v Speaker 1>and I'm saying this and I'm saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

565
00:27:38.331 --> 00:27:40.550
<v Speaker 1>and then I say something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I say something,</v>

566
00:27:40.551 --> 00:27:41.384
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

567
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:43.980
<v Speaker 1>initially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

568
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:49.390
<v Speaker 1>dismissive of Jews and you're all mad</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's two or three people who go,</v>

569
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I think,</v>

570
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to hold.</v>

571
00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.500
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of an interesting response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

572
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lay out a couple more ideas and some</v>

573
00:27:58.341 --> 00:28:00.020
<v Speaker 1>of them don't get any response and</v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

574
00:28:00.021 --> 00:28:01.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people perk right up and,</v>

575
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:05.870
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not stupid and I'm trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bloody attention of the crowd.</v>

576
00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:11.620
<v Speaker 1>And so if I do that 50 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd's going to tell me an awful</v>

577
00:28:13.041 --> 00:28:15.950
<v Speaker 1>lot about what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if I'm willing to follow</v>

578
00:28:15.951 --> 00:28:17.990
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can do that easily because,</v>

579
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.600
<v Speaker 1>especially if I can start to work the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd a little bit,</v>

580
00:28:20.601 --> 00:28:23.510
<v Speaker 1>because I can capitalize on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional,</v>

581
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:27.200
<v Speaker 1>on their emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalize on their emotions and the</v>

582
00:28:27.201 --> 00:28:30.140
<v Speaker 1>display of that emulsion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can learn to play that.</v>

583
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.960
<v Speaker 1>And then that turns into a positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback loop.</v>

584
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.010
<v Speaker 1>And so Hitler's informing the audience</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the audiences informing Hitler,</v>

585
00:28:37.011 --> 00:28:40.880
<v Speaker 1>and that's why you'll believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler embodied the shadow of the German</v>

586
00:28:40.881 --> 00:28:41.714
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

587
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:47.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

588
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:53.870
<v Speaker 1>So that's another reason why you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be careful what you say and why you say</v>

589
00:28:53.871 --> 00:28:55.760
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

590
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.370
<v Speaker 1>why you're looking for attention and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those things,</v>

591
00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.610
<v Speaker 1>and actually what's motivating you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually what's motivating the people</v>

592
00:29:01.611 --> 00:29:05.060
<v Speaker 1>who are listening to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because God only knows where it might go</v>

593
00:29:05.061 --> 00:29:06.560
<v Speaker 1>if you're not careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

594
00:29:06.561 --> 00:29:08.840
<v Speaker 1>actually we do know where it goes if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not careful.</v>

595
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:11.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's not pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

596
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.150
<v Speaker 1>And to think that we've learned anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that,</v>

597
00:29:14.151 --> 00:29:15.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

598
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.500
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't learned a damn thing from it.</v>

599
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:22.670
<v Speaker 1>So because we don't want to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>it now,</v>

600
00:29:22.671 --> 00:29:24.620
<v Speaker 1>these guys were all concerned with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>

601
00:29:24.621 --> 00:29:26.030
<v Speaker 1>They're highly concerned with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

602
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Vince Wanger and boss had both been</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by Freud and bite you.</v>

603
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.240
<v Speaker 1>You can see in the bottom right hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>corner there,</v>

604
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:37.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a boss with you and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's been swinger on the left and</v>

605
00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:38.840
<v Speaker 1>boss at the top there.</v>

606
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.830
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

607
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:43.660
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty thoughtful looking guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were pretty damn smart and they</v>

608
00:29:43.661 --> 00:29:47.860
<v Speaker 1>were quite philosophically oriented and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had both studied heidegger and they</v>

609
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:52.420
<v Speaker 1>both studied Husserl who were German</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers on heidegger actually got</v>

610
00:29:52.421 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 1>tangled right up into the Nazi movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

611
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.740
<v Speaker 1>his philosophy has been cast under a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cloud of suspicion,</v>

612
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 1>perhaps a well deserved cloud of</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicion as a consequence of his</v>

613
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:07.990
<v Speaker 1>cooperation with the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't only stupid people who got</v>

614
00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:10.480
<v Speaker 1>tangled up in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty much everybody who got</v>

615
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:12.610
<v Speaker 1>tangled up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then one of the things you might be</v>

616
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.650
<v Speaker 1>might think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is we're thinking about,</v>

617
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.550
<v Speaker 1>is that if you were there for any one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

618
00:30:18.551 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a 90% chance that you would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>got tangled up in it.</v>

619
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:22.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have been the person who</v>

620
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:25.300
<v Speaker 1>rescued the Gypsies is like forget that.</v>

621
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you think that you know you're a</v>

622
00:30:27.941 --> 00:30:30.760
<v Speaker 1>heroic far beyond the average and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be very,</v>

623
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:34.270
<v Speaker 1>very careful about assuming that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could assume instead that you would have</v>

624
00:30:34.271 --> 00:30:37.840
<v Speaker 1>been swept along with the crowd just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone else because everyone else</v>

625
00:30:37.841 --> 00:30:42.400
<v Speaker 1>was all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now part of what these guys were trying</v>

626
00:30:42.401 --> 00:30:45.880
<v Speaker 1>to figure out is in some sense there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were two things.</v>

627
00:30:45.881 --> 00:30:48.790
<v Speaker 1>There was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the function and structure of belief</v>

628
00:30:48.791 --> 00:30:53.791
<v Speaker 1>systems and then the nature of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>which transcends a belief system.</v>

629
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know what transcends a belief</v>

630
00:30:57.521 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 1>system is what you don't know if you use</v>
<v Speaker 1>that belief system,</v>

631
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there are things outside of your</v>

632
00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:05.500
<v Speaker 1>belief system and they have a nature as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

633
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:09.370
<v Speaker 1>And you usually run into those sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things when you make a mistake and</v>

634
00:31:09.371 --> 00:31:12.880
<v Speaker 1>things don't happen the way you expect</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to or want them to or desire them</v>

635
00:31:12.881 --> 00:31:13.540
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

636
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other problem they're</v>

637
00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:17.620
<v Speaker 1>trying to solve in some senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

638
00:31:17.621 --> 00:31:22.621
<v Speaker 1>what's the appropriate mode of behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an individual in relationship to</v>

639
00:31:23.471 --> 00:31:26.950
<v Speaker 1>belief systems and to the world that</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcends the belief systems?</v>

640
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.500
<v Speaker 1>And the reason they were interested not</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because they thought,</v>

641
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would be a good event.</v>

642
00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Good idea of our belief systems didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get so damn pathological.</v>

643
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Because if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

644
00:31:36.431 --> 00:31:41.230
<v Speaker 1>6 million people end up in ovens or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent and 120 million people end up</v>

645
00:31:41.231 --> 00:31:43.080
<v Speaker 1>dead in battlefields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

646
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:46.720
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't count the stallon massacres</v>
<v Speaker 1>or mile who were,</v>

647
00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made Hitler in some sense look like an</v>

648
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:51.010
<v Speaker 1>absolute amateur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

649
00:31:51.011 --> 00:31:56.011
<v Speaker 1>Stalin starved 6 million people to death</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Ukraine in the 1930s and he was just</v>

650
00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:57.670
<v Speaker 1>warming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

651
00:31:57.671 --> 00:31:59.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you have heard of the</v>

652
00:31:59.561 --> 00:32:00.394
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine famine?</v>

653
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.090
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have you haven't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

654
00:32:04.091 --> 00:32:05.470
<v Speaker 1>well think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

655
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 1>how many of you knew Mao killed 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people?</v>

656
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:10.480
<v Speaker 1>How many of you didn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

657
00:32:10.481 --> 00:32:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Well you might think about why you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that.</v>

658
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:14.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know about the Damn Nazis,</v>

659
00:32:14.681 --> 00:32:17.680
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know about the horrors</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the communists perpetrated.</v>

660
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.190
<v Speaker 1>It's worth thinking about why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the communists,</v>

661
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.330
<v Speaker 1>especially the Maoist man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people were brutal.</v>

662
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.100
<v Speaker 1>So it's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like of all the things we could possibly</v>

663
00:32:30.101 --> 00:32:34.090
<v Speaker 1>learn psychologically from the 20th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century and is what these characters in</v>

664
00:32:34.091 --> 00:32:35.980
<v Speaker 1>the 50s were concentrating on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

665
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.270
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things can go powerfully sideways.</v>

666
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.660
<v Speaker 1>It was quite a shock to everyone because</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

667
00:32:41.661 --> 00:32:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was pretty thrilled that the</v>

668
00:32:44.071 --> 00:32:46.550
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the 19th century that</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

669
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:49.100
<v Speaker 1>classical religion beliefs had crumbled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

670
00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 1>the Marxist said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the damn religions were only there</v>

671
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:55.490
<v Speaker 1>to oppress the poor anyways and to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>the priesthood in the aristocracy in</v>

672
00:32:55.491 --> 00:32:56.470
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

673
00:32:56.471 --> 00:32:58.310
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you learn plenty of that in</v>

674
00:32:58.311 --> 00:32:59.630
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your classes,</v>

675
00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:00.770
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

676
00:33:00.771 --> 00:33:04.130
<v Speaker 1>it's power economics related thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's typical of,</v>

677
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.980
<v Speaker 1>of of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

678
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.553
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

679
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Intellectually manipulative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Left wing thinkers.</v>

680
00:33:12.411 --> 00:33:14.630
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's basically the</v>
<v Speaker 1>routine.</v>

681
00:33:14.631 --> 00:33:16.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they reduce everything to a single damn</v>

682
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:18.770
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually economics or power.</v>

683
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Then they explain everything from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

684
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:25.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's so boneheaded it should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be illegal anyways.</v>

685
00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:30.603
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

686
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.320
<v Speaker 1>The Marxists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're happy that religion had collapsed</v>

687
00:33:33.321 --> 00:33:35.090
<v Speaker 1>because they thought that that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminate an,</v>

688
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.360
<v Speaker 1>an entire strata of oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that it's not like the</v>

689
00:33:38.361 --> 00:33:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Catholic church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

690
00:33:39.741 --> 00:33:41.870
<v Speaker 1>was free of corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

691
00:33:41.871 --> 00:33:44.990
<v Speaker 1>it was in many ways it corrupt</v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise and you could read it as</v>

692
00:33:44.991 --> 00:33:47.000
<v Speaker 1>solely a corrupt enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

693
00:33:47.001 --> 00:33:48.620
<v Speaker 1>to hell with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good that it's gone.</v>

694
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:50.023
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

695
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:54.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Friday and it's basically thought</v>

696
00:33:54.171 --> 00:33:56.000
<v Speaker 1>the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so did most intellectuals,</v>

697
00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought that religion was nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a,</v>

698
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:04.090
<v Speaker 1>than a childish delusion that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>identified with because they were afraid</v>

699
00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:06.770
<v Speaker 1>of dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

700
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a defense against death,</v>

701
00:34:08.811 --> 00:34:09.920
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

702
00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:12.230
<v Speaker 1>the Marxist argument and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Floridian and argument,</v>

703
00:34:12.231 --> 00:34:14.150
<v Speaker 1>those are bloody powerful arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

704
00:34:14.151 --> 00:34:15.710
<v Speaker 1>cause you can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll do,</v>

705
00:34:15.711 --> 00:34:18.500
<v Speaker 1>people use their religious belief as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense against things.</v>

706
00:34:18.501 --> 00:34:21.440
<v Speaker 1>They're too terrified to confront.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously,</v>

707
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does the Church press people?</v>

708
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:24.411
<v Speaker 1>Did it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

709
00:34:24.411 --> 00:34:25.400
<v Speaker 1>press people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it,</v>

710
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:26.680
<v Speaker 1>engage in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

711
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.570
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies with people in power across</v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries.</v>

712
00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:31.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

713
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:33.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

714
00:34:33.141 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you make of that?</v>

715
00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly you make of it that all sorts of</v>

716
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.550
<v Speaker 1>structures do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like structures do that and you</v>

717
00:34:40.551 --> 00:34:43.160
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just damn one structure and</v>

718
00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:44.570
<v Speaker 1>thanked the others are gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

719
00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:46.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like the right wingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always owned about big</v>

720
00:34:46.761 --> 00:34:48.150
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how terrible that isn't.</v>

721
00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Left wingers are always on about how big</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations are terrible.</v>

722
00:34:51.621 --> 00:34:53.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well bank is terrible.</v>

723
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.830
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if it's government or</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations because things tend to tilt</v>

724
00:34:57.831 --> 00:35:02.210
<v Speaker 1>towards corruption across time and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has to be taken into account.</v>

725
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:03.703
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

726
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.970
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the Friday comes and the</v>

727
00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.830
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals in the Marxists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all pretty happy when the</v>

728
00:35:08.831 --> 00:35:13.270
<v Speaker 1>religious dream started to come apart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they believe that the new edifice is</v>

729
00:35:13.271 --> 00:35:17.200
<v Speaker 1>that they were going to construct</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascist and communist would be so much</v>

730
00:35:17.201 --> 00:35:19.450
<v Speaker 1>better than what they replaced that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

731
00:35:19.451 --> 00:35:23.000
<v Speaker 1>everybody would be drowning in utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

732
00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:28.630
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of too bad that isn't how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned out.</v>

733
00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.740
<v Speaker 1>But it's certainly not how it turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

734
00:35:31.741 --> 00:35:32.910
<v Speaker 1>How it turned out was,</v>

735
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:34.583
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

736
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when you something down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even</v>

737
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.390
<v Speaker 2>if you think it's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up constructing something on its</v>

738
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:46.710
<v Speaker 2>ruins that makes the previous terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like the work of rank amateurs.</v>

739
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.320
<v Speaker 2>And that's certainly what happened in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century.</v>

740
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what you say about the</v>

741
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Catholic Church and its basic barbarism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you know they were</v>

742
00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:57.360
<v Speaker 2>involved in the witch hunt in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>ages.</v>

743
00:35:57.361 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were amateurs compared to the</v>

744
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:02.490
<v Speaker 2>fascists and the communists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

745
00:36:02.491 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 2>they were counting their victims in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tens of thousands,</v>

746
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.880
<v Speaker 2>not the hundreds of millions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

747
00:36:08.881 --> 00:36:12.810
<v Speaker 2>things didn't go so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so by the 1950s especially because</v>

748
00:36:12.811 --> 00:36:16.290
<v Speaker 2>of the Cold War started the day the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second World War ended,</v>

749
00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:18.570
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it ended with the atomic bomb in</v>

750
00:36:18.571 --> 00:36:22.000
<v Speaker 2>Japan and the Russians had the damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>atomic bomb like you know,</v>

751
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.640
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>

752
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:28.850
<v Speaker 2>And both the Russians and the Americans</v>
<v Speaker 2>had the hydrogen bomb by the early 1950s</v>

753
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.150
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can tell me how many of you know</v>

754
00:36:33.151 --> 00:36:35.430
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that a hydrogen bomb uses an</v>

755
00:36:35.431 --> 00:36:37.110
<v Speaker 2>atom bomb for it's trigger?</v>

756
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the hydrogen bombs,</v>

757
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.300
<v Speaker 1>the atom bomb stands in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hydrogen bomb.</v>

758
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Like the ignition cap on a shelf stands</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to the gunpowder.</v>

759
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.520
<v Speaker 1>The atomic blast just gets the explosion</v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

760
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:56.040
<v Speaker 1>So hydrogen bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like way,</v>

761
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.760
<v Speaker 1>way more explosive than atomic bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

762
00:36:59.761 --> 00:37:02.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the middle of the 1950s we'd pretty</v>

763
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:06.300
<v Speaker 1>much put herself in a position where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were building some mighty big</v>

764
00:37:06.301 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 1>bumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

765
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:11.040
<v Speaker 1>really unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievably big bombs,</v>

766
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>400 times as big as the ones that wiped</v>

767
00:37:14.071 --> 00:37:15.990
<v Speaker 1>out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ashima like huge,</v>

768
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:18.840
<v Speaker 1>huge bumps and they're getting pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn good at it.</v>

769
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:21.540
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the mid 1950s it was like</v>

770
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:26.400
<v Speaker 1>we developed enough firepower on both</v>
<v Speaker 1>sides of the Atlantic,</v>

771
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:29.280
<v Speaker 1>along with the missiles necessary to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliver them,</v>

772
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:32.130
<v Speaker 1>which the Nazis had basically invented</v>
<v Speaker 1>in World War II.</v>

773
00:37:32.131 --> 00:37:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all Nazi scientists who invented</v>

774
00:37:34.201 --> 00:37:37.770
<v Speaker 1>rockets and they were all taken by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans after the Second World War to</v>

775
00:37:37.771 --> 00:37:39.990
<v Speaker 1>work on the American space program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

776
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.190
<v Speaker 1>And so by the 1950s we had the missiles</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deliver the damn things too.</v>

777
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:47.520
<v Speaker 1>So not only were the psychologists who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were thinking about things sort of</v>

778
00:37:47.521 --> 00:37:51.000
<v Speaker 1>shorted out about what happened in World</v>
<v Speaker 1>War II for good reason.</v>

779
00:37:51.001 --> 00:37:54.420
<v Speaker 1>And then of course all the stalinists</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrors were starting to be revealed at</v>

780
00:37:54.421 --> 00:37:56.790
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it took western intellectuals</v>

781
00:37:56.791 --> 00:37:59.790
<v Speaker 1>like 30 years before they gave them any</v>
<v Speaker 1>credence at all.</v>

782
00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Think John Paul Sartre was still a</v>
<v Speaker 1>member of the communist party up until</v>

783
00:38:03.661 --> 00:38:07.410
<v Speaker 1>1970 it was very common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly among French intellectuals.</v>

784
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the news was getting out,</v>

785
00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.690
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful observers,</v>

786
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:15.180
<v Speaker 1>like George Orwell had pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out by the,</v>

787
00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.740
<v Speaker 1>by the late thirties that not all was</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the paradise of Stellan.</v>

788
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:23.780
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people didn't thought he was a right</v>

789
00:38:23.781 --> 00:38:25.160
<v Speaker 1>winger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't listen to a much,</v>

790
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:26.630
<v Speaker 1>even though he was a left winger.</v>

791
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:30.043
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

792
00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:34.090
<v Speaker 1>So are these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these existential phenomenologists</v>

793
00:38:34.091 --> 00:38:36.850
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a big problem here.</v>

794
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:41.650
<v Speaker 1>The belief systems are seriously going</v>
<v Speaker 1>sideways and there's some indication,</v>

795
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some individual responsibility</v>

796
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've some indeterminant nature.</v>

797
00:38:46.721 --> 00:38:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Like if you live in a country where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's turned into a fascist</v>

798
00:38:49.991 --> 00:38:52.300
<v Speaker 1>murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like is that your fault?</v>

799
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:53.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

800
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:56.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious that an individual</v>

801
00:38:56.541 --> 00:38:59.750
<v Speaker 1>should be held responsible for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions of an entire country.</v>

802
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:02.320
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country's made up of individuals.</v>

803
00:39:02.321 --> 00:39:05.210
<v Speaker 1>So that's a very difficult problem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve.</v>

804
00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the tenants of Western law is</v>

805
00:39:07.791 --> 00:39:11.240
<v Speaker 1>that you don't hold an individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the actions of the</v>

806
00:39:11.241 --> 00:39:14.450
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if he or she happens to be a member</v>

807
00:39:14.451 --> 00:39:18.520
<v Speaker 1>willingly or unwillingly of that group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't ignore the fact that all</v>

808
00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.650
<v Speaker 1>these things were made up of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you also can't ignore the fact</v>

809
00:39:21.651 --> 00:39:25.910
<v Speaker 1>that it was individuals who were doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible things that were being done</v>

810
00:39:25.911 --> 00:39:26.631
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

811
00:39:26.631 --> 00:39:29.870
<v Speaker 1>So in Auschwitz for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the little tricks that the guards</v>

812
00:39:29.871 --> 00:39:31.400
<v Speaker 1>used to do was to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

813
00:39:31.401 --> 00:39:34.250
<v Speaker 1>they bring the Jews off the freight</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>

814
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:37.220
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them had died in the freight</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars cause they are packed in there like</v>

815
00:39:37.221 --> 00:39:37.880
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

816
00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.670
<v Speaker 1>So lots of them would suffocate or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>old ones would die.</v>

817
00:39:40.671 --> 00:39:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Or the little kids would die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was okay.</v>

818
00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then on along the outside of the</v>

819
00:39:45.381 --> 00:39:47.090
<v Speaker 1>freight cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it was winter,</v>

820
00:39:47.091 --> 00:39:49.520
<v Speaker 1>well it's like 20 below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the ones on the outside would</v>

821
00:39:49.521 --> 00:39:50.870
<v Speaker 1>freeze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know where you were going to get</v>

822
00:39:50.871 --> 00:39:53.810
<v Speaker 1>rid of them anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was just convenient mostly.</v>

823
00:39:53.811 --> 00:39:58.130
<v Speaker 1>So then you'd take them to Auschwitz and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd all spill out speaking different</v>

824
00:39:58.131 --> 00:40:00.200
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>torn up from their family,</v>

825
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as miserable as people can possibly be.</v>

826
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.800
<v Speaker 1>And then one trick was to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

827
00:40:06.801 --> 00:40:11.330
<v Speaker 1>someone who is not quite dead enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up a sack of a wet,</v>

828
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.990
<v Speaker 1>a sack of wet salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's 100 pounds and carry it from</v>

829
00:40:14.991 --> 00:40:18.140
<v Speaker 1>one side of the compound to the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then back,</v>

830
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one side and then back.</v>

831
00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:21.680
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be thinking about</v>

832
00:40:21.681 --> 00:40:24.110
<v Speaker 1>these campuses like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a football field.</v>

833
00:40:24.111 --> 00:40:27.140
<v Speaker 1>These bloody things were cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were big.</v>

834
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.830
<v Speaker 1>They held tens of thousands of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's some guard.</v>

835
00:40:30.831 --> 00:40:35.000
<v Speaker 1>He thinks that's pretty good joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just a few people that are</v>

836
00:40:35.001 --> 00:40:36.740
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we found out from the Stanford</v>

837
00:40:36.741 --> 00:40:39.590
<v Speaker 1>prison experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which every psychologist likes to think</v>

838
00:40:39.591 --> 00:40:41.060
<v Speaker 1>of as immoral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

839
00:40:41.061 --> 00:40:45.530
<v Speaker 1>because we actually discovered something</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it that if you gave ordinary people</v>

840
00:40:45.531 --> 00:40:48.620
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to be fascist barbarians</v>
<v Speaker 1>in six days,</v>

841
00:40:48.621 --> 00:40:51.950
<v Speaker 1>30% of them would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what we learned from that</v>

842
00:40:51.951 --> 00:40:56.300
<v Speaker 1>is that social psychologist shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>run the Stanford prison experiment.</v>

843
00:40:56.510 --> 00:41:01.510
<v Speaker 1>That's not the right conclusion to draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of these phenomenologists are</v>

844
00:41:02.151 --> 00:41:05.240
<v Speaker 1>all where it all concerned about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the hell should we do</v>

845
00:41:05.241 --> 00:41:07.910
<v Speaker 1>about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're starting to think about how</v>

846
00:41:07.911 --> 00:41:10.880
<v Speaker 1>belief systems are constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

847
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:18.080
<v Speaker 1>the first proposition that they make is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we should treat the reality that</v>

848
00:41:18.081 --> 00:41:22.550
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with as psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should treat human experiences that</v>

849
00:41:22.551 --> 00:41:25.910
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the reality for you from a</v>

850
00:41:25.911 --> 00:41:28.940
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological perspective is</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you experienced,</v>

851
00:41:28.941 --> 00:41:31.160
<v Speaker 1>they assume everything you experienced</v>
<v Speaker 1>is real.</v>

852
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:34.550
<v Speaker 1>And they also assume that you can't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>more real than that.</v>

853
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 1>And so your consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is,</v>

854
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:40.340
<v Speaker 1>is real and your dreams are real and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your emotions are real and your pain is</v>

855
00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:42.860
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really useful thing to think</v>

856
00:41:42.861 --> 00:41:45.890
<v Speaker 1>if you want to make sure that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to hurt people.</v>

857
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to think that maybe</v>

858
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:51.490
<v Speaker 1>think pain should be treated as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental reality instead of as an ff</v>

859
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:55.520
<v Speaker 1>phenomena of some material substrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's their first perspective.</v>

860
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.700
<v Speaker 1>And they took that from heidegger</v>
<v Speaker 1>because heidegger thought that western</v>

861
00:41:58.701 --> 00:42:02.150
<v Speaker 1>philosophy had gone off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got off on the wrong track,</v>

862
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>3000 years ago because we didn't really</v>

863
00:42:05.721 --> 00:42:09.020
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on being itself as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental mystery.</v>

864
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.600
<v Speaker 1>And so the fundamental mystery is why</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hail?</v>

865
00:42:11.601 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since there is something</v>

866
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.890
<v Speaker 1>experiential being what are its</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental elements?</v>

867
00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:20.900
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the phenomenological</v>
<v Speaker 1>stats.</v>

868
00:42:20.901 --> 00:42:22.130
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely,</v>

869
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:26.150
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same as a scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach because it starts with a</v>

870
00:42:26.151 --> 00:42:27.850
<v Speaker 1>different presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

871
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:32.890
<v Speaker 1>the scientific presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking is that things are the</v>

872
00:42:33.231 --> 00:42:37.190
<v Speaker 1>objectively real elements of things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most real elements.</v>

873
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.750
<v Speaker 1>And there's no sense complaining about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because it's an approach that works</v>

874
00:42:41.751 --> 00:42:45.440
<v Speaker 1>tremendously well for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many things including making hydrogen</v>

875
00:42:45.441 --> 00:42:49.160
<v Speaker 1>bombs for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also reasonable to think that,</v>

876
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:52.730
<v Speaker 1>well it might not be the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might not be the whole truth and</v>

877
00:42:52.731 --> 00:42:56.030
<v Speaker 1>nothing but the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you could also suspect that</v>

878
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:59.900
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we can manufacture</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen bombs also might indicate that</v>

879
00:42:59.901 --> 00:43:04.220
<v Speaker 1>there's something trifle off with our</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental belief systems scientific</v>

880
00:43:04.221 --> 00:43:05.180
<v Speaker 1>though they may be.</v>

881
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:07.590
<v Speaker 1>And that was certainly something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned Heidegger,</v>

882
00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.650
<v Speaker 1>even though he got all tangled up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis.</v>

883
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:14.750
<v Speaker 1>So the phenomenologists were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take apart experience as such and they</v>

884
00:43:14.751 --> 00:43:17.960
<v Speaker 1>made some some hypotheses and then some</v>
<v Speaker 1>observation.</v>

885
00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:22.130
<v Speaker 1>So the first is that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that your experience like</v>

886
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:27.131
<v Speaker 1>experience itself is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you just because dreams are real and</v>

887
00:43:28.551 --> 00:43:29.870
<v Speaker 1>pain is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean,</v>

888
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:33.920
<v Speaker 1>and like objects that we can all</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive our real doesn't mean you</v>

889
00:43:33.921 --> 00:43:35.720
<v Speaker 1>should put them all in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

890
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Like my dreams are not in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>category of reality as this table</v>

891
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.600
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have access to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams and you have access to the table.</v>

892
00:43:44.601 --> 00:43:47.990
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that my dreams and</v>
<v Speaker 1>my pains and my emotions aren't real.</v>

893
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:50.330
<v Speaker 1>They're real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first now.</v>

894
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Or You should know that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a proposition.</v>

895
00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:00.280
<v Speaker 1>What they're saying is let's act as if</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true and then worked from those</v>

896
00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:03.890
<v Speaker 1>premises and see what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see where we can get with it.</v>

897
00:44:03.891 --> 00:44:05.990
<v Speaker 1>And that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfectly reasonable thing to</v>

898
00:44:05.991 --> 00:44:08.660
<v Speaker 1>do because at the bottom of a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also have,</v>

899
00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.560
<v Speaker 1>you always have to put an assumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise your theory would be</v>

900
00:44:12.561 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 1>100% right and would cover everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't.</v>

901
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.560
<v Speaker 1>So you have to throw an assumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in there at the bottom and</v>

902
00:44:18.561 --> 00:44:18.981
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

903
00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:20.870
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not questioning that.</v>

904
00:44:20.871 --> 00:44:23.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the starting point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

905
00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:26.000
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do that because you're</v>

906
00:44:26.001 --> 00:44:27.650
<v Speaker 1>ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a full theory.</v>

907
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:33.120
<v Speaker 1>So they don't like the idea that mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be reduced to matter.</v>

908
00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:36.390
<v Speaker 1>They're not playing that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not playing the game,</v>

909
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:39.840
<v Speaker 1>that the subject is only up a phenomenal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the object is real.</v>

910
00:44:39.841 --> 00:44:42.690
<v Speaker 1>They're not playing that game either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because,</v>

911
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.240
<v Speaker 1>as boss says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a subject,</v>

912
00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:49.950
<v Speaker 1>nothing at all would exist to confront</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects and to imagine them as such.</v>

913
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.740
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This implies that every object,</v>

914
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:56.460
<v Speaker 1>everything objective is merely</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectively in being merely objectivize</v>

915
00:44:56.461 --> 00:44:59.670
<v Speaker 1>by the subject is the most subjective</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing possible.</v>

916
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a radical claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

917
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.880
<v Speaker 1>but here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's something to think about it.</v>

918
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:09.660
<v Speaker 1>When I look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coke can,</v>

919
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:11.183
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

920
00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.610
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive the object,</v>

921
00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:18.140
<v Speaker 1>and then I make inferences about its use</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I evaluate it and then I use</v>

922
00:45:18.141 --> 00:45:18.681
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

923
00:45:18.681 --> 00:45:21.800
<v Speaker 1>that is not actually what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

924
00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.980
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious at all that what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive our objects.</v>

925
00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:26.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you think about it,</v>

926
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:29.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people weren't perceiving scientific</v>

927
00:45:29.871 --> 00:45:34.871
<v Speaker 1>objects until like 1,514 50 so there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>no objective object before that.</v>

928
00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:44.020
<v Speaker 1>So obviously whatever we were perceiving</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not precisely that because we would</v>

929
00:45:44.911 --> 00:45:48.560
<v Speaker 1>have been scientists right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Kelly claimed that people were</v>

930
00:45:48.561 --> 00:45:51.410
<v Speaker 1>natural scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that we're always investigating</v>

931
00:45:51.411 --> 00:45:53.720
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis and trying to disprove them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>

932
00:45:53.721 --> 00:45:56.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's an interesting theory and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right in a sense.</v>

933
00:45:56.571 --> 00:46:00.260
<v Speaker 1>But fundamentally it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are not natural scientists were</v>

934
00:46:00.261 --> 00:46:03.290
<v Speaker 1>natural engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we look at the world,</v>

935
00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.750
<v Speaker 1>we don't see objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in further use,</v>

936
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:08.450
<v Speaker 1>what we actually see is the use.</v>

937
00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.490
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I look at that,</v>

938
00:46:10.491 --> 00:46:14.120
<v Speaker 1>coke can buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my visual system activates my motor</v>

939
00:46:14.121 --> 00:46:17.210
<v Speaker 1>cortex directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can do that without me seeing the dam</v>

940
00:46:17.211 --> 00:46:20.860
<v Speaker 1>can consciously to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are people with blind</v>

941
00:46:20.861 --> 00:46:22.490
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told you about those people,</v>

942
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:25.280
<v Speaker 1>they say they can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you asked them which hand do you</v>

943
00:46:25.281 --> 00:46:27.110
<v Speaker 1>have held up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can tell you.</v>

944
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:31.850
<v Speaker 1>So they might not be able to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they can map patterns from their</v>

945
00:46:31.851 --> 00:46:34.310
<v Speaker 1>visual system onto their motor output,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

946
00:46:34.311 --> 00:46:36.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically what Piaget said we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

947
00:46:36.351 --> 00:46:39.680
<v Speaker 1>When we deal with the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're embodied creatures,</v>

948
00:46:39.681 --> 00:46:41.960
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what we see when we look around</v>

949
00:46:41.961 --> 00:46:45.110
<v Speaker 1>aren't objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're things we can use and things</v>

950
00:46:45.111 --> 00:46:47.270
<v Speaker 1>that get in our way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

951
00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:51.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's the theory that was derived</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally from Jj Gibson who wrote a</v>

952
00:46:51.351 --> 00:46:55.100
<v Speaker 1>great book on that called the visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach to ecological ecological</v>

953
00:46:55.101 --> 00:47:00.080
<v Speaker 1>approach to visual perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his science is a brand of pragmatism</v>

954
00:47:00.081 --> 00:47:02.660
<v Speaker 1>and the pragmatists basically claim that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

955
00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.770
<v Speaker 1>things including theories and</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions have a limited range of</v>

956
00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:11.510
<v Speaker 1>truth and the truth that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the limited range of truth is</v>

957
00:47:11.511 --> 00:47:15.110
<v Speaker 1>determined by the match between your</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions and outcomes.</v>

958
00:47:15.111 --> 00:47:18.290
<v Speaker 1>So I think this is a coke can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what it is?</v>

959
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:20.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's good enough for me if I want to</v>

960
00:47:20.691 --> 00:47:22.190
<v Speaker 1>drink a bit of coke out of it.</v>

961
00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.430
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

962
00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.600
<v Speaker 1>if you go into communist China and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start advertising these things,</v>

963
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.430
<v Speaker 1>then what are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause this thing tells a story,</v>

964
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the story like?</v>

965
00:47:38.891 --> 00:47:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you need Coca Cola?</v>

966
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a bit of Frippery,</v>

967
00:47:43.481 --> 00:47:44.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit of,</v>

968
00:47:44.231 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not unnecessary luxury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even very good for you,</v>

969
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of fuzzy and it's sweet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get to buy it.</v>

970
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.220
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because no matter how stupid you are and</v>

971
00:47:54.221 --> 00:47:57.490
<v Speaker 1>your nutrition choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as our society goes,</v>

972
00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:02.380
<v Speaker 1>you have the right to poison yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever way you think best fits you.</v>

973
00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.610
<v Speaker 1>And so when you send this little coke</v>
<v Speaker 1>can off to communist China,</v>

974
00:48:06.611 --> 00:48:09.910
<v Speaker 1>this thing screams stupid individuality</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over.</v>

975
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.760
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows how it undermines the</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

976
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.020
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't,</v>

977
00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.030
<v Speaker 1>if you're not thinking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not thinking.</v>

978
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Think about what happens when we export</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>

979
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:20.350
<v Speaker 1>What does the car say?</v>

980
00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:23.150
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

981
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:26.100
<v Speaker 1>you can go wherever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you want.</v>

982
00:48:26.101 --> 00:48:29.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to tell anybody at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can do it in a really dangerous</v>

983
00:48:29.371 --> 00:48:33.000
<v Speaker 1>highspeed manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want a political</v>

984
00:48:33.001 --> 00:48:35.790
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrap it up in metal and ship that thing</v>

985
00:48:35.791 --> 00:48:36.780
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody goes,</v>

986
00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.000
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked to have one of those.</v>

987
00:48:39.001 --> 00:48:42.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communism disappears with that.</v>

988
00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:48.290
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that says individuality</v>
<v Speaker 1>and capitalism like a personal</v>

989
00:48:48.571 --> 00:48:50.100
<v Speaker 1>automobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

990
00:48:50.101 --> 00:48:53.700
<v Speaker 1>you even get to pollute the atmosphere</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ruin the planet with the damn thing.</v>

991
00:48:53.701 --> 00:48:56.040
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have to drive to the corner store</v>

992
00:48:56.041 --> 00:48:58.980
<v Speaker 1>and pick up your damn coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like to hell with the atmosphere.</v>

993
00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:05.880
<v Speaker 1>So don't be thinking that the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that appear in front of you are merely</v>

994
00:49:05.881 --> 00:49:08.310
<v Speaker 1>objects because they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

995
00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I started thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

996
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:14.640
<v Speaker 1>when I was thinking about people going</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to Graceland to look at Elvis</v>

997
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Guitar.</v>

998
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.370
<v Speaker 2>You think</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly</v>

999
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.080
<v Speaker 1>is it that makes a good tart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elvis has guitar,</v>

1000
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly the guitar</v>

1001
00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:27.830
<v Speaker 1>cause it's just sitting there like any</v>
<v Speaker 1>old guitar,</v>

1002
00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:29.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you could even think about it.</v>

1003
00:49:29.481 --> 00:49:32.480
<v Speaker 1>You could take that and guitar out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could put another guitar in that look</v>

1004
00:49:32.481 --> 00:49:34.370
<v Speaker 1>just like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would still be all of us as</v>

1005
00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:36.860
<v Speaker 1>guitar cause no one would know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

1006
00:49:36.861 --> 00:49:39.530
<v Speaker 1>well then that's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elvis has guitar.</v>

1007
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:44.480
<v Speaker 1>But that's a funny thing because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would only think that if you thought</v>

1008
00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:47.630
<v Speaker 1>that Elvis is guitar was the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was made out of material that was</v>

1009
00:49:47.631 --> 00:49:50.990
<v Speaker 1>sitting right in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that isn't what it is.</v>

1010
00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the only one's tiny little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1011
00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:57.830
<v Speaker 1>That bloody thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a part of an incredibly layered</v>

1012
00:49:57.831 --> 00:49:58.820
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1013
00:49:59.090 --> 00:49:59.923
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1014
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.490
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1015
00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:04.880
<v Speaker 1>the people who want to go look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at it in some sense</v>

1016
00:50:04.881 --> 00:50:07.100
<v Speaker 1>because of the magic that's emanating</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>

1017
00:50:07.101 --> 00:50:09.380
<v Speaker 1>But the magic is actually real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1018
00:50:09.381 --> 00:50:14.180
<v Speaker 1>the magic is the effect of that guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say on the entire culture.</v>

1019
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:16.820
<v Speaker 1>And those effects are the damn guitar</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1020
00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.760
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird because when you go look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Elvis Guitar,</v>

1021
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.910
<v Speaker 1>you don't have looking at the guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at the magic.</v>

1022
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:26.060
<v Speaker 1>And weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the magic is actually real.</v>

1023
00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 1>While can't think that way</v>

1024
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're a materialist because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that the thing is the material,</v>

1025
00:50:31.041 --> 00:50:31.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1026
00:50:31.881 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you another story.</v>

1027
00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 1>So when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Europeans came to the South</v>

1028
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Pacific islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the South Pacific islanders,</v>

1029
00:50:40.761 --> 00:50:43.800
<v Speaker 1>because there weren't that many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have a very high,</v>

1030
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:45.560
<v Speaker 1>highly technical society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1031
00:50:45.561 --> 00:50:50.561
<v Speaker 1>And so like if you were like Joe</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dominant guy in a Pacific island</v>

1032
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:53.150
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you might be able to have a</v>

1033
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:55.960
<v Speaker 1>stone ax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a wellmade stone ax because go out</v>

1034
00:50:55.961 --> 00:50:58.220
<v Speaker 1>and make a stone ax and see how long</v>
<v Speaker 1>that takes you.</v>

1035
00:50:58.221 --> 00:51:02.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a bit of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're a high status guy,</v>

1036
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:05.300
<v Speaker 1>if you've really worked your whole life</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be at the top of your Damn pyramid,</v>

1037
00:51:05.301 --> 00:51:07.430
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you get had two axes,</v>

1038
00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:08.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a red letter day.</v>

1039
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:11.420
<v Speaker 1>You've got two axes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1040
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.390
<v Speaker 1>which is more than any other animal has</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a lot.</v>

1041
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's not trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the damn missionaries come in</v>

1042
00:51:17.561 --> 00:51:20.270
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they set up shop and what do they</v>

1043
00:51:20.271 --> 00:51:23.300
<v Speaker 1>bring?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steel access.</v>

1044
00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's kind of a downer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1045
00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:30.140
<v Speaker 1>you've worked your whole damn life to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get these stone axes and that makes you</v>

1046
00:51:30.141 --> 00:51:34.040
<v Speaker 1>like head tribesmen and then you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kid wanders down to the local</v>

1047
00:51:34.041 --> 00:51:37.100
<v Speaker 1>missionaries and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh we got an extra steel ax here.</v>

1048
00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you take that back home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1049
00:51:39.321 --> 00:51:43.370
<v Speaker 1>it's so shocking because not only did</v>
<v Speaker 1>the missionaries have this thing that is</v>

1050
00:51:43.371 --> 00:51:47.450
<v Speaker 1>so much better than a steel ax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a jet plane compared to a,</v>

1051
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.250
<v Speaker 1>to a wheeled cart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're really,</v>

1052
00:51:51.251 --> 00:51:53.830
<v Speaker 1>really different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the missionaries,</v>

1053
00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:57.220
<v Speaker 1>they don't even notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the horrible thing about it.</v>

1054
00:51:57.221 --> 00:51:59.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like the giveaway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that hasn't virtually</v>

1055
00:51:59.651 --> 00:52:01.240
<v Speaker 1>infinite value and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1056
00:52:01.241 --> 00:52:02.021
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got,</v>

1057
00:52:02.021 --> 00:52:03.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple dozen of those sitting in the</v>

1058
00:52:03.341 --> 00:52:06.220
<v Speaker 1>store room and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just willing to hand them out.</v>

1059
00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:09.760
<v Speaker 1>It was a little demoralizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a little demoralizing for the</v>

1060
00:52:09.761 --> 00:52:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Pacific islanders and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why was it an ax that the missionaries</v>

1061
00:52:14.381 --> 00:52:15.214
<v Speaker 1>gave away?</v>

1062
00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:20.260
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd think that if you are a Westerner</v>

1063
00:52:20.261 --> 00:52:21.730
<v Speaker 1>and you had a bunch of access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1064
00:52:21.731 --> 00:52:22.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an ax.</v>

1065
00:52:22.631 --> 00:52:23.201
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1066
00:52:23.201 --> 00:52:25.480
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more than an ax,</v>

1067
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.090
<v Speaker 1>a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weapon to bring down a whole</v>

1068
00:52:28.091 --> 00:52:33.091
<v Speaker 1>culture accidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that the</v>

1069
00:52:37.431 --> 00:52:38.840
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists claimed,</v>

1070
00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:43.480
<v Speaker 1>this is a cool claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know they claimed this.</v>

1071
00:52:43.481 --> 00:52:46.180
<v Speaker 1>It took me quite a long time to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>this out because I thought I'd figured</v>

1072
00:52:46.181 --> 00:52:48.580
<v Speaker 1>this out on my own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out that's very difficult</v>

1073
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.910
<v Speaker 1>to figure out anything on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1074
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.210
<v Speaker 1>when I was doing my investigations into</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the brain works from a</v>

1075
00:52:55.211 --> 00:52:58.630
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not was informed a lot by Jeffrey Gray,</v>

1076
00:52:58.631 --> 00:53:03.340
<v Speaker 1>who we're going to talk about later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I noticed was that you</v>

1077
00:53:03.341 --> 00:53:06.310
<v Speaker 1>don't actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't actually see things when you</v>

1078
00:53:06.311 --> 00:53:08.620
<v Speaker 1>first see something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1079
00:53:08.621 --> 00:53:10.900
<v Speaker 1>when you first see something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even see it.</v>

1080
00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:15.460
<v Speaker 1>You react to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You rock too with your body.</v>

1081
00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:17.970
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

1082
00:53:17.971 --> 00:53:19.960
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a partner and you have a</v>

1083
00:53:19.961 --> 00:53:22.780
<v Speaker 1>trusting relationship and then you find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out that they're,</v>

1084
00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:24.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell you or you figure out from</v>

1085
00:53:24.551 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 1>their phone or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're having an affair and you look at</v>

1086
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:29.990
<v Speaker 1>them and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1087
00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:30.883
<v Speaker 1>what do you see?</v>

1088
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.310
<v Speaker 1>And you think you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1089
00:53:32.311 --> 00:53:33.480
<v Speaker 1>you see the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1090
00:53:33.481 --> 00:53:34.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

1091
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:39.200
<v Speaker 1>You do not see the person that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you see is a huge pit that you're</v>

1092
00:53:39.931 --> 00:53:42.390
<v Speaker 1>going to fall into and you don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>know you see it,</v>

1093
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:46.650
<v Speaker 1>but your body knows that's your blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure goes through the roof and your</v>

1094
00:53:46.651 --> 00:53:50.940
<v Speaker 1>heart starts to pound and you sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is your body</v>

1095
00:53:50.941 --> 00:53:54.810
<v Speaker 1>sees what you can't see and what it sees</v>
<v Speaker 1>as something it's seriously does not</v>

1096
00:53:54.811 --> 00:53:59.811
<v Speaker 1>understand it does not understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sees the territory behind the map,</v>

1097
00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:01.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when I look at you,</v>

1098
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.160
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really what I'm looking at is my</v>

1099
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:08.220
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because you're a polite and well</v>

1100
00:54:08.221 --> 00:54:10.890
<v Speaker 1>behaved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gracious enough to act in</v>

1101
00:54:10.891 --> 00:54:14.340
<v Speaker 1>accordance with those presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't even really have to look at</v>

1102
00:54:14.341 --> 00:54:14.730
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1103
00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:18.540
<v Speaker 1>And thank you very much for that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to look at people</v>

1104
00:54:18.541 --> 00:54:22.200
<v Speaker 1>because they're horrifying and profound</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures.</v>

1105
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.370
<v Speaker 1>And so everybody walks around behaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't terrify the hell out of each</v>

1106
00:54:26.371 --> 00:54:29.580
<v Speaker 1>other all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when someone betrays you,</v>

1107
00:54:29.581 --> 00:54:31.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions gone.</v>

1108
00:54:31.531 --> 00:54:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's there?</v>

1109
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows and that's what your body</v>

1110
00:54:37.261 --> 00:54:39.120
<v Speaker 1>reacts to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why the</v>

1111
00:54:39.121 --> 00:54:43.260
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists said we react to</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning first.</v>

1112
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:47.550
<v Speaker 1>We don't react to the object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time to see the damn</v>

1113
00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:49.170
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1114
00:54:49.171 --> 00:54:51.660
<v Speaker 1>let's say that your person has betrayed</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1115
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Now you think you knew who they were and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you thought you knew who you were.</v>

1116
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

1117
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:59.850
<v Speaker 1>You're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know who they are.</v>

1118
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:03.210
<v Speaker 1>And because you're such a moron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you don't know who you are.</v>

1119
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:06.300
<v Speaker 1>And it means you can't trust any of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>memories with that person.</v>

1120
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:09.540
<v Speaker 1>And maybe none of your memories in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationships at all.</v>

1121
00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Plus what about the future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1122
00:55:12.631 --> 00:55:14.670
<v Speaker 1>so when you look at the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you see?</v>

1123
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:16.740
<v Speaker 1>You see all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like chaos,</v>

1124
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.330
<v Speaker 1>whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you see.</v>

1125
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:21.990
<v Speaker 1>And that chaos is the meaning behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>your presuppositions.</v>

1126
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:26.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's why the phenomenologists</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say meaning shines forth.</v>

1127
00:55:26.821 --> 00:55:28.800
<v Speaker 1>That's famous thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shines forth.</v>

1128
00:55:28.801 --> 00:55:30.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's the primary thing we</v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter.</v>

1129
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:34.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what's really weird?</v>

1130
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.920
<v Speaker 1>That's how your damn brain is organized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's weird.</v>

1131
00:55:37.921 --> 00:55:40.140
<v Speaker 1>A because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think about it.</v>

1132
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:43.920
<v Speaker 1>How do you define reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1133
00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:47.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say most of you define</v>

1134
00:55:47.821 --> 00:55:52.821
<v Speaker 1>reality like you're Isaac Newton or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe like your democritus who was the</v>

1135
00:55:52.921 --> 00:55:57.690
<v Speaker 1>first person who hypothesized Adams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in the Newtonian world,</v>

1136
00:55:57.810 --> 00:55:59.640
<v Speaker 1>it's like billiard ball world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1137
00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Everything is made out of little</v>
<v Speaker 1>billiard balls and they bang together in</v>

1138
00:56:03.631 --> 00:56:07.110
<v Speaker 1>a causal way and you can predict the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of their banging together.</v>

1139
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And if you extend it enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can conjure up an entirely</v>

1140
00:56:10.381 --> 00:56:14.250
<v Speaker 1>deterministic world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A happens causes b because it's see</v>

1141
00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:18.540
<v Speaker 1>always the same way and everything runs</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a giant clock.</v>

1142
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:22.230
<v Speaker 1>That's Newton's model and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a clock model because you</v>

1143
00:56:22.231 --> 00:56:23.230
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back at that time,</v>

1144
00:56:23.231 --> 00:56:23.981
<v Speaker 1>clocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1145
00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:25.780
<v Speaker 1>those things were pretty damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive.</v>

1146
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Clocks got the whole industrial</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution underway.</v>

1147
00:56:28.721 --> 00:56:31.240
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medieval cities would put an awful lot</v>

1148
00:56:31.241 --> 00:56:34.330
<v Speaker 1>of time and work into their clocks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought those damn things were</v>

1149
00:56:34.331 --> 00:56:35.620
<v Speaker 1>really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1150
00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:38.140
<v Speaker 1>they could keep track of where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planets were moving.</v>

1151
00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:40.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A clock.</v>

1152
00:56:40.331 --> 00:56:43.000
<v Speaker 1>And then if you want to think about an</v>
<v Speaker 1>invention that changed the world,</v>

1153
00:56:43.001 --> 00:56:47.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like the clock's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we can measure time in the same way.</v>

1154
00:56:47.591 --> 00:56:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Everyone can measure time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal.</v>

1155
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that the universe is like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>clock,</v>

1156
00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:55.780
<v Speaker 1>given that the clock can predict the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

1157
00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty damn powerful idea.</v>

1158
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:00.700
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that it's wrong because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1159
00:57:00.701 --> 00:57:03.310
<v Speaker 1>causalities a mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one really understands it.</v>

1160
00:57:03.311 --> 00:57:07.210
<v Speaker 1>And there are levels of analysis that</v>
<v Speaker 1>which causality just in the way we</v>

1161
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:09.760
<v Speaker 1>experience it doesn't seem to imply it</v>
<v Speaker 1>apply at all.</v>

1162
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:12.760
<v Speaker 1>You go down to the subatomic level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probabilistic.</v>

1163
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:16.510
<v Speaker 1>You can't predict single events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't believe that you can predict</v>

1164
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:19.240
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can predict parts of the future in</v>

1165
00:57:19.241 --> 00:57:21.520
<v Speaker 1>an extremely limited way for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>

1166
00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:25.780
<v Speaker 1>for some span of time that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't even predict how long that</v>

1167
00:57:25.781 --> 00:57:28.000
<v Speaker 1>span of time is going to last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1168
00:57:28.001 --> 00:57:32.500
<v Speaker 1>And some things seem to be more stable</v>
<v Speaker 1>across more situations and more times</v>

1169
00:57:32.501 --> 00:57:34.540
<v Speaker 1>than others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still,</v>

1170
00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.900
<v Speaker 1>there's instability everywhere and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it predicting things a very</v>

1171
00:57:37.901 --> 00:57:40.390
<v Speaker 1>difficult thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1172
00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:43.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one idea about reality.</v>

1173
00:57:43.751 --> 00:57:45.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have,</v>

1174
00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:50.380
<v Speaker 1>and that's the reality that you've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated to have the idea of reality.</v>

1175
00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.900
<v Speaker 1>You've been educated to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though we know it's wrong,</v>

1176
00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:57.220
<v Speaker 1>like Einstein blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that world in the early 19 hundreds</v>

1177
00:57:57.221 --> 00:57:59.710
<v Speaker 1>along with the various people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein dependable,</v>

1178
00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.660
<v Speaker 1>that's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong.</v>

1179
00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:05.230
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all sorts of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely complicated problems like how</v>

1180
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:07.810
<v Speaker 1>to model positive feedback loops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1181
00:58:07.811 --> 00:58:10.360
<v Speaker 1>that sort of gets you into chaos theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really,</v>

1182
00:58:10.361 --> 00:58:12.460
<v Speaker 1>really hard to model positive feedback</v>
<v Speaker 1>loops.</v>

1183
00:58:12.461 --> 00:58:16.090
<v Speaker 1>And they can go wild in 50 different</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways and you can't really predict them</v>

1184
00:58:16.091 --> 00:58:19.450
<v Speaker 1>because they depend on initial</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions and so on and so forth.</v>

1185
00:58:19.451 --> 00:58:22.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the deterministic world,</v>

1186
00:58:22.781 --> 00:58:23.321
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1187
00:58:23.321 --> 00:58:25.630
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the reason we have to</v>

1188
00:58:25.631 --> 00:58:28.840
<v Speaker 1>have freewill is because we can't act</v>
<v Speaker 1>deterministically.</v>

1189
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:31.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deterministic system is only going to</v>

1190
00:58:31.391 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 1>work in a system that stays the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1191
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:37.390
<v Speaker 1>so you can wind up a little clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1192
00:58:37.391 --> 00:58:39.820
<v Speaker 1>one of those little clockwork toys and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll walk.</v>

1193
00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:42.160
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put a cliff in front of it,</v>

1194
00:58:42.161 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 1>just walks off the cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in cliffs are appearing in front of</v>

1195
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:48.760
<v Speaker 1>us randomly all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can't even see how a deterministic</v>

1196
00:58:48.761 --> 00:58:52.480
<v Speaker 1>system could possibly work to guide us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would assume that our knowledge,</v>

1197
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:56.680
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge that we derive from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past is sufficiently accurate to</v>

1198
00:58:56.681 --> 00:58:59.110
<v Speaker 1>causally guide us into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1199
00:58:59.111 --> 00:59:00.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>

1200
00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.300
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't that maybe that's why we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

1201
00:59:04.301 --> 00:59:06.190
<v Speaker 1>No one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a good theory.</v>

1202
00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:07.240
<v Speaker 1>If there's a y</v>

1203
00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:10.590
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an alternative.</v>

1204
00:59:10.591 --> 00:59:12.900
<v Speaker 1>The alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a Darwinian alternative.</v>

1205
00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:14.370
<v Speaker 1>So here's the alternative.</v>

1206
00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:20.240
<v Speaker 1>The world's a complex and dynamic place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's full of weird things.</v>

1207
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Musically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made up of patterns.</v>

1208
00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:27.110
<v Speaker 1>It's made up a patterns and patterns of</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns and patterns and patterns of</v>

1209
00:59:27.111 --> 00:59:28.790
<v Speaker 1>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it is.</v>

1210
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:33.530
<v Speaker 1>And they shift and dance around and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you throw something that's alive into</v>

1211
00:59:33.531 --> 00:59:35.010
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1212
00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:39.500
<v Speaker 1>it's programmed by DNA and the damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing has to keep up with the patterns</v>

1213
00:59:39.501 --> 00:59:41.870
<v Speaker 1>and they're changing all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are kind of stable,</v>

1214
00:59:41.871 --> 00:59:46.280
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty damn fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you throw the DNA in there and</v>

1215
00:59:46.281 --> 00:59:51.281
<v Speaker 1>it goes and produces a million variants</v>
<v Speaker 1>of whatever it's going to produce.</v>

1216
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.750
<v Speaker 1>And most of them are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're a mosquito,</v>

1217
00:59:53.751 --> 00:59:55.760
<v Speaker 1>you lay a million lay eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1218
00:59:55.761 --> 01:00:00.761
<v Speaker 1>so that's a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>bets about how the future will causally</v>

1219
01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>unfold and the bed is the future's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to unfold.</v>

1220
01:00:05.281 --> 01:00:08.310
<v Speaker 1>So this egg can turn into a mosquito.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>

1221
01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>well how often is the mosquito that lays</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eggs wrong?</v>

1222
01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it lays a million eggs in its</v>

1223
01:00:15.601 --> 01:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many eggs mosquitoes</v>

1224
01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:18.960
<v Speaker 1>late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they lay a lot.</v>

1225
01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>All of those eggs are going to die</v>
<v Speaker 1>except one</v>

1226
01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:27.350
<v Speaker 1>if the mosquitoes lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know that because we're knee</v>

1227
01:00:27.351 --> 01:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>deep and mosquitoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1228
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:30.470
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't the case,</v>

1229
01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.960
<v Speaker 1>then there just be mosquitoes everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there aren't.</v>

1230
01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Thank God there's enough of the damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1231
01:00:34.821 --> 01:00:38.000
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basically what's the bet?</v>

1232
01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:43.090
<v Speaker 1>The bet is mosquito matches environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer wrong except once in a million.</v>

1233
01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:46.790
<v Speaker 1>So how do you overcome that million</v>
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes,</v>

1234
01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:48.830
<v Speaker 1>million eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it'll do the trick.</v>

1235
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>And so look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so interesting.</v>

1236
01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.310
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it means the fundamental</v>

1237
01:00:52.311 --> 01:00:57.311
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis that the mosquito structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>matches the structure of reality is</v>

1238
01:00:57.321 --> 01:01:02.321
<v Speaker 1>wrong at a one in a million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong at a 999,999 level of error.</v>

1239
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>You might just think that's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely wrong.</v>

1240
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:10.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really wrong,</v>

1241
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>but it keeps the damn mosquitoes going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1242
01:01:12.951 --> 01:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>so then this propagates across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1243
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.350
<v Speaker 1>and what really propagates across time</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a massive wave of death.</v>

1244
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Virtually everything fails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>99.9% of the species that ever lived are</v>

1245
01:01:26.481 --> 01:01:27.800
<v Speaker 1>extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>

1246
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're doing a fairly good job of</v>

1247
01:01:29.391 --> 01:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>making sure that a good chunk of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that exist now we're going to go</v>

1248
01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:33.740
<v Speaker 1>extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1249
01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.430
<v Speaker 1>So failure and death is the norm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen to all of you.</v>

1250
01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the underlying structure of reality</v>

1251
01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>is mutable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it is,</v>

1252
01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:54.130
<v Speaker 1>and the only way that you can adapt to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is by generating variance and having</v>

1253
01:01:54.131 --> 01:01:57.850
<v Speaker 1>most of them perish except for the ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>that manage more or less by chance to</v>

1254
01:01:57.851 --> 01:02:00.070
<v Speaker 1>keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you define real?</v>

1255
01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:02.980
<v Speaker 1>And a darwinist would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this would a pragmatist would say</v>

1256
01:02:02.981 --> 01:02:03.814
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

1257
01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>you embody real to the best degree that</v>
<v Speaker 1>real can be attained.</v>

1258
01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:15.760
<v Speaker 1>And it's not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your reel is only good enough for about</v>

1259
01:02:15.761 --> 01:02:18.280
<v Speaker 1>80 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what else they would say is</v>

1260
01:02:18.281 --> 01:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>that's as real as gets the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whatever reality is,</v>

1261
01:02:22.261 --> 01:02:27.261
<v Speaker 1>it's so damn complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This multilayered pattern array that you</v>

1262
01:02:29.281 --> 01:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>can't even model it without using death</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>

1263
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the mechanism.</v>

1264
01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if he dual use death,</v>

1265
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>it's almost all death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even for the parts that aren't</v>

1266
01:02:40.951 --> 01:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hardly any of it,</v>

1267
01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.100
<v Speaker 1>your damn solution isn't that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1268
01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>you're going to wear out in 80 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1269
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>you got 3 billion years of trying behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1270
01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the best you can do 80 damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1271
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you're a parrot,</v>

1272
01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:58.390
<v Speaker 1>you can get a 150 and apparently there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody mortal jellyfish,</v>

1273
01:02:58.410 --> 01:03:01.710
<v Speaker 1>which fingers would be the damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>jellyfish that would be a mortal.</v>

1274
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.260
<v Speaker 1>So real might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1275
01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:06.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different way about</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about real.</v>

1276
01:03:06.541 --> 01:03:07.081
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1277
01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said life is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truth serves life,</v>

1278
01:03:09.811 --> 01:03:11.880
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a Darwinian id.</v>

1279
01:03:11.881 --> 01:03:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Even though he didn't take it from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwin.</v>

1280
01:03:13.411 --> 01:03:18.411
<v Speaker 1>It's like there isn't anything more true</v>
<v Speaker 1>than what evolution reveals as the model</v>

1281
01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:22.830
<v Speaker 1>for reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's as true as it gets for us.</v>

1282
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:27.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a Newtonian reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a multilevel pattern,</v>

1283
01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:31.500
<v Speaker 1>chaotic reality that we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep up with.</v>

1284
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that might mean is that,</v>

1285
01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:37.653
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1286
01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:42.470
<v Speaker 1>the implications for action that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>derived from that phenomena</v>

1287
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>might be more indicative of what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then an objective analysis,</v>

1288
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:54.510
<v Speaker 1>because your truth is the degree to</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you,</v>

1289
01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:59.530
<v Speaker 1>you embody truth in so far as it can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>determined within a Darwinian framework</v>

1290
01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>is entirely measured by your success in</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in propagating.</v>

1291
01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:07.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't anything under that.</v>

1292
01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there is,</v>

1293
01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a Darwinian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1294
01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>And I think Darwin's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all things considered and Newton is</v>

1295
01:04:14.891 --> 01:04:17.380
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus we also know that Newton is wrong.</v>

1296
01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Now the whole Darwinian thing is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated than we thought because you,</v>

1297
01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:21.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've run,</v>

1298
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>do you know what epigenetics are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you know about that?</v>

1299
01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty good.</v>

1300
01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>So your biological education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like demolishes your historical</v>

1301
01:04:31.211 --> 01:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people don't know what</v>

1302
01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>epigenetics is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

1303
01:04:35.081 --> 01:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just relatively new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

1304
01:04:37.151 --> 01:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that your parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience can alter their genetic</v>

1305
01:04:41.321 --> 01:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>structure in such a way that it alters</v>
<v Speaker 1>your genetic structure.</v>

1306
01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1307
01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:48.820
<v Speaker 1>that's something we didn't expect that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

1308
01:04:48.821 --> 01:04:50.800
<v Speaker 1>And nobody knows what the final,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1309
01:04:50.801 --> 01:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it looks like there's more to the</v>

1310
01:04:54.161 --> 01:04:59.161
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary story than mere random</v>
<v Speaker 1>production and natural selection.</v>

1311
01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:02.500
<v Speaker 1>There's more to it than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how much.</v>

1312
01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.270
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>

1313
01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>when the phenomenologists say we react</v>
<v Speaker 1>to meaning first,</v>

1314
01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>that kind of opens a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1315
01:05:10.571 --> 01:05:11.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

1316
01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>is the meaning real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that opens is another question,</v>

1317
01:05:14.231 --> 01:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>which is what do you mean by real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that opens another question is</v>

1318
01:05:19.091 --> 01:05:19.741
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1319
01:05:19.741 --> 01:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>is it Newton real or is it Darwin real</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1320
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Newton's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That leaves Darwin</v>

1321
01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.790
<v Speaker 1>and Darwin Real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about as real as it gets.</v>

1322
01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:33.460
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be as real as it gets.</v>

1323
01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:36.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a partial entity is trying to model a</v>

1324
01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:40.360
<v Speaker 1>complex totality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they're ever going to be able to do</v>

1325
01:05:40.361 --> 01:05:44.410
<v Speaker 1>is embody a partial representation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and it's not going to be that good,</v>

1326
01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:46.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be as good as they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

1327
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's as true as it can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the phenomenologists,</v>

1328
01:05:52.451 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this weird idea we perceive</v>

1329
01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:55.204
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1330
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:57.640
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how your brain is set up.</v>

1331
01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:01.060
<v Speaker 1>You first perceive meaning and then with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of work,</v>

1332
01:06:01.061 --> 01:06:04.810
<v Speaker 1>you turn that into an object perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ God only knows how much</v>

1333
01:06:04.811 --> 01:06:06.910
<v Speaker 1>exploration you have to do before you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1334
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:10.630
<v Speaker 1>You know how long you think it takes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>child to handle?</v>

1335
01:06:10.631 --> 01:06:14.680
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a soother before it builds up an</v>

1336
01:06:14.681 --> 01:06:17.410
<v Speaker 1>accurate representation of the soother.</v>

1337
01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:19.900
<v Speaker 1>You know it's going to be chewing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing like mad.</v>

1338
01:06:19.901 --> 01:06:21.760
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be taking a note and</v>
<v Speaker 1>checking it out,</v>

1339
01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:26.050
<v Speaker 1>turning it around and banging it against</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and it has to do all of that</v>

1340
01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:31.090
<v Speaker 1>including the tac kyle interaction and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experimentation with the thing</v>

1341
01:06:31.091 --> 01:06:33.850
<v Speaker 1>across situations to establish say</v>
<v Speaker 1>object permanence.</v>

1342
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.880
<v Speaker 1>It has to do all that before it can see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing.</v>

1343
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:43.230
<v Speaker 1>You know like early Iei in early ai</v>
<v Speaker 1>researchers who were basically under the</v>

1344
01:06:44.081 --> 01:06:49.081
<v Speaker 1>influence of behaviorists who basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>said the object is given and so they</v>

1345
01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:51.430
<v Speaker 1>could treat the brain like it didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even exist.</v>

1346
01:06:51.431 --> 01:06:54.100
<v Speaker 1>You know the objects just there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just see the world.</v>

1347
01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like that turned out to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously wrong.</v>

1348
01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.110
<v Speaker 1>It's damn difficult to get a computer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the world.</v>

1349
01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out you have to put the bloody</v>

1350
01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:04.570
<v Speaker 1>things inside bodies before they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>even do it because you really can't</v>

1351
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:09.630
<v Speaker 1>perceive the world without a body</v>
<v Speaker 1>because perception is for bodily action</v>

1352
01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:14.170
<v Speaker 1>and without the framework within which</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause really what you're doing and this</v>

1353
01:07:14.171 --> 01:07:17.080
<v Speaker 1>is a Ph Yeti and idea to this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern,</v>

1354
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:19.140
<v Speaker 1>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm,</v>

1355
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:23.110
<v Speaker 1>the pattern exists at multiple levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including say the advertising level and</v>

1356
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.660
<v Speaker 1>your memories of coke and all the bloody</v>
<v Speaker 1>jingles,</v>

1357
01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:26.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>

1358
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:29.230
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I look at that,</v>

1359
01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I map it's pattern onto my retina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pattern is a pattern because</v>

1360
01:07:33.191 --> 01:07:34.810
<v Speaker 1>it's extending across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1361
01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:37.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just dissipating.</v>

1362
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:39.400
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's staying there across time.</v>

1363
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I map that onto my retina and the retina</v>
<v Speaker 1>matches it onto my hand.</v>

1364
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the coke can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually the coke can is all of</v>

1365
01:07:47.321 --> 01:07:48.154
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1366
01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:55.250
<v Speaker 1>And you might say that's not what it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's made of aluminum.</v>

1367
01:07:55.251 --> 01:07:55.881
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1368
01:07:55.881 --> 01:08:00.881
<v Speaker 1>yeah it's made out of aluminum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's only one part of what it is.</v>

1369
01:08:00.981 --> 01:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's not necessarily even the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important part cause it could be made</v>

1370
01:08:03.801 --> 01:08:05.960
<v Speaker 1>out of plastic and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell difference would that</v>

1371
01:08:05.961 --> 01:08:07.220
<v Speaker 1>make?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1372
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:11.450
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's pretty damn weird when you start</v>

1373
01:08:11.451 --> 01:08:14.990
<v Speaker 1>to think about it because people make</v>
<v Speaker 1>the claim that meaning is EPA.</v>

1374
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:18.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no real meaning of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe is this dead thing.</v>

1375
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:20.810
<v Speaker 1>And if we all went to extinguished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1376
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:25.930
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow they're just be a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless marbles rotating in space.</v>

1377
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even that's not true because God only</v>

1378
01:08:29.391 --> 01:08:31.640
<v Speaker 1>knows what's out there if there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to perceive it.</v>

1379
01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physicists tell us it's more like a</v>

1380
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:37.850
<v Speaker 1>vast potential fluctuating quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>

1381
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.920
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it doesn't even turn into</v>

1382
01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:42.470
<v Speaker 1>stars and planets until there's someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at it.</v>

1383
01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.230
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think that's ridiculous.</v>

1384
01:08:45.231 --> 01:08:48.290
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about it for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that there's really something</v>

1385
01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:49.400
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1386
01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:52.820
<v Speaker 1>because you are the thing that specifies</v>
<v Speaker 1>the level of analysis,</v>

1387
01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:54.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1388
01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:57.350
<v Speaker 1>the way you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see the atoms,</v>

1389
01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:00.470
<v Speaker 1>you don't see the subatomic particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see the little rocks.</v>

1390
01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:04.100
<v Speaker 1>You see planet sized things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look out into space and you</v>

1391
01:09:04.101 --> 01:09:06.050
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it at a particular slice of</v>

1392
01:09:06.051 --> 01:09:07.490
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of,</v>

1393
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:11.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe your refresh rate is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 60 hertz.</v>

1394
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:16.750
<v Speaker 1>So what you see is the universe sliced</v>
<v Speaker 1>into 60 hertz slices and you think</v>

1395
01:09:17.331 --> 01:09:18.470
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1396
01:09:18.471 --> 01:09:19.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1397
01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:23.870
<v Speaker 1>So was all the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including its huge expanse of time from</v>

1398
01:09:23.871 --> 01:09:24.770
<v Speaker 1>beginning to end.</v>

1399
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't see any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

1400
01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.130
<v Speaker 1>So what's there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things at the same time and</v>

1401
01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:34.970
<v Speaker 1>what does all that add up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The physicists seem to be telling us</v>

1402
01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:39.410
<v Speaker 1>that adds up to a pool of quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential that isn't realized until</v>

1403
01:09:39.411 --> 01:09:41.960
<v Speaker 1>there's something that conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's conscious that interacts with it.</v>

1404
01:09:42.230 --> 01:09:43.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

1405
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got your meaning shining</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth like mad.</v>

1406
01:09:48.761 --> 01:09:51.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>children are so attractive is because</v>

1407
01:09:52.190 --> 01:09:54.680
<v Speaker 1>for them the meaning is just shining at</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1408
01:09:54.681 --> 01:09:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Like Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're always wandering</v>

1409
01:09:56.721 --> 01:09:57.770
<v Speaker 1>around like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1410
01:09:57.771 --> 01:10:01.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's really fun to watch kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they give you a taste of that</v>

1411
01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:02.361
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1412
01:10:02.361 --> 01:10:05.030
<v Speaker 1>because kids have to pay you so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't throw them out the window because</v>

1413
01:10:05.031 --> 01:10:06.110
<v Speaker 1>they're very annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1414
01:10:06.111 --> 01:10:08.330
<v Speaker 1>They're always crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're completely useless.</v>

1415
01:10:08.331 --> 01:10:10.160
<v Speaker 1>They just lay there and they don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

1416
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:11.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they wake you up at three in the</v>

1417
01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:12.890
<v Speaker 1>morning and annoy you.</v>

1418
01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.330
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1419
01:10:14.331 --> 01:10:17.720
<v Speaker 1>because you're selfish and mean you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>some something in return and so they</v>

1420
01:10:17.721 --> 01:10:19.880
<v Speaker 1>smile at you and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do other things.</v>

1421
01:10:19.881 --> 01:10:20.750
<v Speaker 1>They're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1422
01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:21.471
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1423
01:10:21.471 --> 01:10:24.860
<v Speaker 1>really comical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are a blast to watch and play</v>

1424
01:10:24.861 --> 01:10:26.900
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things they really do is</v>

1425
01:10:26.901 --> 01:10:30.140
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they remove the blinders from you while</v>

1426
01:10:30.141 --> 01:10:31.340
<v Speaker 1>you're around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

1427
01:10:31.341 --> 01:10:34.610
<v Speaker 1>you go out and like a little forest with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a two and a half year olds,</v>

1428
01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.760
<v Speaker 1>very annoying cause the bloody things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just wander around randomly,</v>

1429
01:10:37.761 --> 01:10:40.400
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got no goal directed,</v>

1430
01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:43.730
<v Speaker 1>nothing goal directed is going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the two and a half year old.</v>

1431
01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:47.270
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of cool because it frees</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind from your goal directed</v>

1432
01:10:47.271 --> 01:10:50.750
<v Speaker 1>narrowness and you can watch the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old look at all these things that</v>

1433
01:10:50.751 --> 01:10:53.480
<v Speaker 1>you haven't looked at for 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you already looked at them once</v>

1434
01:10:53.481 --> 01:10:56.300
<v Speaker 1>and now you just have to see your memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>

1435
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:58.250
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really is cool.</v>

1436
01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll bring you something and they'll</v>

1437
01:10:59.661 --> 01:11:01.190
<v Speaker 1>tell you what's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1438
01:11:01.191 --> 01:11:04.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a shiny piece of aluminum of</v>
<v Speaker 1>gum wrapper,</v>

1439
01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:07.970
<v Speaker 1>what you think it's a gum wrapper</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you see when you</v>

1440
01:11:07.971 --> 01:11:09.980
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you've already built up gum</v>

1441
01:11:09.981 --> 01:11:12.470
<v Speaker 1>wrapper representation and you just lay</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on that.</v>

1442
01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>That isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kid sees,</v>

1443
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:16.260
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what they're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1444
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:19.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe how the light reflects off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aluminum prismatic Lee and how it</v>

1445
01:11:19.891 --> 01:11:23.610
<v Speaker 1>glitters and how cool it is that it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be folded up and how light it is.</v>

1446
01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:26.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're looking at it like this and</v>

1447
01:11:26.311 --> 01:11:28.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because their cortex isn't</v>

1448
01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:31.800
<v Speaker 1>very well developed and they haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>built the inhibitory structures that</v>

1449
01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:35.340
<v Speaker 1>stopped them from seeing meaning shining</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

1450
01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>

1451
01:11:36.481 --> 01:11:37.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any evidence for that?</v>

1452
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:40.410
<v Speaker 1>And there actually is quite a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence for that.</v>

1453
01:11:40.411 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1454
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:48.210
<v Speaker 1>one piece of evidence is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a cats brain off out and you just</v>

1455
01:11:48.211 --> 01:11:50.490
<v Speaker 1>leave it with the hypothalamus and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinal cord,</v>

1456
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:53.700
<v Speaker 1>it's hyper exploratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It runs around like everything's</v>

1457
01:11:53.701 --> 01:11:56.070
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty weird behavior for a thing</v>

1458
01:11:56.071 --> 01:11:57.840
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have a brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1459
01:11:57.841 --> 01:12:00.390
<v Speaker 1>you kind of think that once you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a brain,</v>

1460
01:12:00.391 --> 01:12:04.170
<v Speaker 1>nothing would be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how much of your brain you</v>

1461
01:12:04.171 --> 01:12:06.210
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are people who've experienced</v>

1462
01:12:06.211 --> 01:12:07.044
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1463
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:12.080
<v Speaker 1>there was a famous case of a conductor</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had a very serious brain injury and</v>

1464
01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:17.160
<v Speaker 1>it basically blew out his hippocampus so</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't put any more information</v>

1465
01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:19.410
<v Speaker 1>from short term attention to longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>storage.</v>

1466
01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:21.900
<v Speaker 1>And he wrote these articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1467
01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:26.960
<v Speaker 1>these massive page long journals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multipage long journals and only,</v>

1468
01:12:27.121 --> 01:12:30.270
<v Speaker 1>right is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that is if I'm seeing everything for</v>

1469
01:12:30.271 --> 01:12:33.180
<v Speaker 1>the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as if I'm seeing everything for the</v>

1470
01:12:33.181 --> 01:12:34.014
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>

1471
01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.210
<v Speaker 1>It's as if I'm seeing everything for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>

1472
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:38.850
<v Speaker 1>And he was wandering around in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant state of awe,</v>

1473
01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:40.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his wife would come to visit him.</v>

1474
01:12:40.681 --> 01:12:42.720
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't remember any of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had happened to him.</v>

1475
01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And he'd just be blown out of the water</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see her,</v>

1476
01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:47.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he didn't see his memories and</v>

1477
01:12:47.851 --> 01:12:49.710
<v Speaker 1>he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like I'm seeing you for the</v>

1478
01:12:49.711 --> 01:12:50.880
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1479
01:12:50.881 --> 01:12:53.370
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was seeing her for the first time</v>

1480
01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:56.280
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the access to the inhibitory structures</v>

1481
01:12:56.281 --> 01:12:58.200
<v Speaker 1>that were directing his attention were</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

1482
01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:00.720
<v Speaker 1>He was an interesting case too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because now,</v>

1483
01:13:00.721 --> 01:13:02.760
<v Speaker 1>and then he'd sit down to play the</v>
<v Speaker 1>piano,</v>

1484
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:05.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'd have an epileptic seizure and</v>

1485
01:13:05.401 --> 01:13:08.520
<v Speaker 1>then he could play the piano and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could play just like he used to play,</v>

1486
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:11.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was like he had to switch brain</v>

1487
01:13:11.131 --> 01:13:13.560
<v Speaker 1>modes and the mechanism for switching</v>
<v Speaker 1>was damaged.</v>

1488
01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.500
<v Speaker 1>So we'd have to have a little seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he could lay out these,</v>

1489
01:13:16.501 --> 01:13:21.480
<v Speaker 1>like Beethoven Sonata is like a mad dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end he'd have a little</v>

1490
01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:24.630
<v Speaker 1>seizure and he'd come back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as if I'm seeing everything for the</v>

1491
01:13:24.631 --> 01:13:26.160
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1492
01:13:26.161 --> 01:13:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs proved so attractive</v>

1493
01:13:29.521 --> 01:13:33.030
<v Speaker 1>to people in the 60s and improved</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive to people since the bloody</v>

1494
01:13:33.031 --> 01:13:36.390
<v Speaker 1>beginning of time is because in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that's what they do.</v>

1495
01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:39.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a memory representations.</v>

1496
01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:42.750
<v Speaker 1>They're gone and what are you seeing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows,</v>

1497
01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:46.350
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't what you expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's what's there.</v>

1498
01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not too.</v>

1499
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:54.663
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1500
01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:03.520
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to sum this up a little</v>

1501
01:14:03.521 --> 01:14:08.521
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think drives to extreme</v>

1502
01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:15.520
<v Speaker 1>forms of pathology now that might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>your pathology,</v>

1503
01:14:15.521 --> 01:14:17.290
<v Speaker 1>your misery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your suffering and all that,</v>

1504
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.530
<v Speaker 1>or it might be your social</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology,</v>

1505
01:14:20.531 --> 01:14:23.230
<v Speaker 1>which is your murderous desire to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exterminate.</v>

1506
01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's a phenomenological theory.</v>

1507
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:35.390
<v Speaker 1>The terror management theory is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to build these structures in your</v>

1508
01:14:35.391 --> 01:14:37.910
<v Speaker 1>head to get yourself away from death</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

1509
01:14:37.911 --> 01:14:39.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so really what the terror management</v>

1510
01:14:39.771 --> 01:14:42.440
<v Speaker 1>people are saying is the blinder you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>

1511
01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the pause disillusion</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think too.</v>

1512
01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists,</v>

1513
01:14:47.241 --> 01:14:48.890
<v Speaker 1>they were going at this from another</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

1514
01:14:48.891 --> 01:14:53.030
<v Speaker 1>They were saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning that constantly reveals</v>

1515
01:14:53.031 --> 01:14:56.690
<v Speaker 1>itself is nourishing and revitalizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's so powerful,</v>

1516
01:14:56.691 --> 01:15:00.770
<v Speaker 1>it can just blow you apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a dangerous thing to be messing</v>

1517
01:15:00.771 --> 01:15:04.230
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the burning Bush and you,</v>

1518
01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:07.370
<v Speaker 1>you have to build this structure in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to be able to cope with that</v>

1519
01:15:07.371 --> 01:15:09.980
<v Speaker 1>because you have to minimize it to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can handle.</v>

1520
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:12.470
<v Speaker 1>But you need to build a structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

1521
01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:16.160
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and carefully so that the meaning that</v>

1522
01:15:16.161 --> 01:15:21.161
<v Speaker 1>reveals itself can be shaped by you into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world conceptual and practical.</v>

1523
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:26.120
<v Speaker 1>That allows the remaining meaning to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shine through in a way that you find</v>

1524
01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.240
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently revitalizing so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't become corrupt enough to become</v>

1525
01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:37.061
<v Speaker 1>genocidal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a good theory and that's what</v>

1526
01:15:37.461 --> 01:15:40.340
<v Speaker 1>what the phenomenologists were on about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the reason why the</v>

1527
01:15:40.341 --> 01:15:43.520
<v Speaker 1>existentialists and the phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say,</v>

1528
01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:49.540
<v Speaker 1>don't deceive yourself about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself to you.</v>

1529
01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Don't use language instrumentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1530
01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Because if you do that and twist up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that you're using to</v>

1531
01:15:59.901 --> 01:16:03.500
<v Speaker 1>interpret the world through the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>will twist up on you.</v>

1532
01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:06.200
<v Speaker 1>And all live will be revealed is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder.</v>

1533
01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:10.970
<v Speaker 1>And if horror is all that's always being</v>
<v Speaker 1>revealed to you,</v>

1534
01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:14.540
<v Speaker 1>you will not stay good.</v>

1535
01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:16.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1536
01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Cause you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under that sort of pressure,</v>

1537
01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:23.930
<v Speaker 1>you'll get bitter and resentful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything will fall apart around you</v>

1538
01:16:24.301 --> 01:16:29.301
<v Speaker 1>because you're not actually modeling the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality in a way that the positive</v>

1539
01:16:29.311 --> 01:16:32.760
<v Speaker 1>meaning can shine through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll fail and you'll become</v>

1540
01:16:32.761 --> 01:16:36.570
<v Speaker 1>resentful and you'll become bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll be looking for someone</v>

1541
01:16:36.571 --> 01:16:40.200
<v Speaker 1>to hurt and you'll have plenty of</v>
<v Speaker 1>justification for it.</v>

1542
01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:44.670
<v Speaker 1>So and worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is union contribution to this</v>

1543
01:16:44.671 --> 01:16:47.760
<v Speaker 1>whole idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This won't happen all at once.</v>

1544
01:16:48.090 --> 01:16:52.920
<v Speaker 1>It'll happen as a consequence of 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro decisions that you hardly even</v>

1545
01:16:52.921 --> 01:16:57.921
<v Speaker 1>notice where you can be truthful about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something or not in this tiny way that</v>

1546
01:16:58.201 --> 01:17:02.160
<v Speaker 1>hardly even seems to matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that the consequence of iterating</v>

1547
01:17:02.161 --> 01:17:06.480
<v Speaker 1>that across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say 300,000 decisions is that you can</v>

1548
01:17:06.481 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>build yourself into the sort of monster</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would never want to see in the</v>

1549
01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:12.230
<v Speaker 1>mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that</v>

1550
01:17:12.231 --> 01:17:15.710
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists would also tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something you said as well,</v>

1551
01:17:15.711 --> 01:17:19.400
<v Speaker 1>is that is the sort of monster that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably are.</v>

1552
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:24.740
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to deal with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to start taking things</v>

1553
01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:26.750
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things,</v>

1554
01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.740
<v Speaker 1>there's two things you have to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously and one is the meaning that</v>

1555
01:17:30.741 --> 01:17:34.580
<v Speaker 1>reveals itself to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other is the stance of truth</v>

1556
01:17:34.581 --> 01:17:39.140
<v Speaker 1>towards which you were pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stance of truth that you adopt while</v>

1557
01:17:39.141 --> 01:17:43.580
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with that meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the final consequence of that would</v>

1558
01:17:43.581 --> 01:17:47.240
<v Speaker 1>be your health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the health of your family and your</v>

1559
01:17:47.241 --> 01:17:50.960
<v Speaker 1>society and the health of the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>society at large.</v>

1560
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Pivots on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It pivots on that.</v>

1561
01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:59.180
<v Speaker 1>And that the way the world moves is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sum total of all the decisions that are</v>

1562
01:17:59.181 --> 01:18:02.720
<v Speaker 1>all of us are making all those little</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro decisions and those bloody things</v>

1563
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:07.670
<v Speaker 1>echo like ripples in a pond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you do some little crooked</v>

1564
01:18:07.671 --> 01:18:09.620
<v Speaker 1>thing that you know you shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

1565
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:12.680
<v Speaker 1>you're actually warping the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of reality.</v>

1566
01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:16.730
<v Speaker 1>And what's really interesting about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is now we know what happens when you do</v>

1567
01:18:16.731 --> 01:18:20.300
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that we end up with the</v>

1568
01:18:20.301 --> 01:18:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Nazis and the communists in the hydrogen</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs,</v>

1569
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:27.620
<v Speaker 1>and we haven't escaped from that yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully we will,</v>

1570
01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.320
<v Speaker 1>but we won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people don't learn what the 20th</v>

1571
01:18:30.321 --> 01:18:31.490
<v Speaker 1>century had to teach them,</v>

1572
01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:36.693
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>

1573
01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
