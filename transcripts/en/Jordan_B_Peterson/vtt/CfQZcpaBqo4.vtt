1
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.313
Yeah.

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.740
<v 1>Chari everyone
a little more light on the situation.</v>

3
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:11.220
You're welcome to the march Q and a.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.070
Glad to see you all here.
Thanks for tuning in.
So,
um,

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.740
let's see if we can get somewhere reasonable today.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.490
I guess I could update you a little bit if you'd be interested.

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.150
Tell you what has been going on.
Um,

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.420
my wife Tammy and I came back from Australia,

9
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.160
New Zealand at the end of February.
We had a really good tour there.

10
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.740
I would say about a dozen places,

11
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.920
maybe 15 a hard to keep track because we went to a number of places more than

12
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:47.670
once,
large crowds.
So some of the bigger venues,

13
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:50.190
Melbourne for example,
is 5,500 people.

14
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:54.720
So I think that was the biggest audience that I'd spoken to independently of
the,

15
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.290
um,
discussions with Sam Harris.

16
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.240
So that was very interesting to see that crowds of that magnitude would show up,

17
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.500
got speak at the Sydney Opera House,
which was extremely exciting.
You know,

18
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.260
it's such an iconic buildings.
So that was a real honor.

19
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.080
It's been like that for lots of the theaters that I've been in.
You know,

20
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:16.500
these old iconic buildings at so many people have performed in,

21
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.490
it's quite a privilege to be able to get backstage and take a look.
Um,

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.700
we enjoyed Australia and New Zealand lot.
Uh,

23
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.670
the company take dainty that hosted it,
um,
hosted the tour,

24
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:32.010
did an outstanding job and uh,

25
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.710
the press even was reasonably welcoming.

26
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:37.350
I would say at least in Australia and New Zealand.

27
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:42.310
It was a bit of a different story.
They seem to be more polarized there,
um,

28
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.330
as recent events have clearly indicated.

29
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.770
So since I've been back,
uh,

30
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.390
well I haven't been particularly productive.

31
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:55.260
I've mostly been sleeping as it turns out,

32
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.130
so I guess I've worn out after a year of touring.
But,
um,

33
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.450
I'm hard at work on my next book,

34
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.840
a tentatively entitled Beyond Order or beyond mere order.

35
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.430
12 more rules for life.

36
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.990
I'm up to chapter nine and I would say I'm pretty stuck on it at the moment
time.

37
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.820
I'm having a hard time slogging through it.
Brain isn't as sharp as it could be,

38
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:22.800
an have to be sharped at it.
So anyways,
um,
set up some new offices.

39
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.830
This is this week to get my team together for the online education project.

40
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.250
So that's exciting.
There's boats,
five of us that we'll be working together,
um,

41
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.130
in some offices with a company called Postmedia who I'm also working with,

42
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.340
uh,
writing a journal,
um,

43
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.650
newspaper articles.
So,
uh,

44
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.970
that's exciting and we're hoping for good things from the online education

45
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.790
program.
Um,
no timelines or anything like that.
Still.

46
00:02:56.791 --> 00:03:00.610
It's a complicated system.
I've been working as on the Patriot on replacement.

47
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:05.200
That's looking really good.
I would say I met with the developer this week.
Um,

48
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.450
we're hoping,
well,

49
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:10.810
we're hoping to have some of it functional by April 1st and there'll be a little

50
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:15.340
bit more information about that available at,
on April 1st.

51
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.630
Um,

52
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.100
I have a talk in New York on April 17th at the beacon theater.

53
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.930
I think it's sold out.

54
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.620
I have a talk on April 19th at the Sony Center in Toronto with Slava Boise's

55
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.840
Jack,
who's probably the world's most famous Marxist philosopher.

56
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:39.841
And so that should be interesting and challenging and hopefully productive.

57
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.350
And then for those of you who might be watching from the UK or from somewhere

58
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.240
reasonably accessible to the UK,

59
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.350
I'm doing a 12 rules for life lecture tour show,

60
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.420
May 8th in London,

61
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.340
which is the same time that the paperback version of 12 rules for life is coming

62
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:05.330
up.
So that's basically that for updates.
Um,

63
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.480
I guess bad,
maybe there's a bit more.
I've,
um,

64
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.370
videotaped a number of my lectures in Australia,

65
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.250
which is the first time I've done that professionally videotaped them.

66
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.600
I think I taped six.

67
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.960
And so we'll be releasing them in some form yet to be determined maybe on the

68
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:29.710
new platform in the relatively new future.
And I have about 50 of them,

69
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.540
55 of them audio taped and transcribed.

70
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:36.490
And so I've put together the transcriptions,

71
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:41.491
it's about a million words and I'm hoping that there's possibly books I can

72
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:43.960
derive from that,
but if there's not folks,

73
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:48.080
there's certainly podcasts and that sort of thing.
So,
and I have a lot of,
um,

74
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.010
interviews coming up as well.

75
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.590
So that's what's happening on this end of the universe.

76
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.880
So,
um,
let's take some questions and see how that goes.

77
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.770
So I don't know why this question is so popular,
but,

78
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.250
and it's completely ridiculous,
but,
um,
that's okay.

79
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.410
Steven shutters who obviously hasn't got anything better to do,
uh,

80
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.080
wants to know what is my favorite soup.

81
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.080
And apparently 333 people are also interested in that particular topic.

82
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:28.471
And I would say it's actually irrelevant unfortunately because I don't eat soup.

83
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.190
Um,

84
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.190
I'm on this crazy all meat diet that some of you know about and that doesn't go

85
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:38.210
along very well with soup.
Um,

86
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.850
but if I had to pick a soup that I ate at one point,

87
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.690
my favorite soup was a clam chowder that I used to make with corn.

88
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.680
And uh,
it was a dish I was particularly proud of.

89
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:52.540
I was actually not a bad cook.

90
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:56.620
I spent a lot of time cooking in restaurants and really enjoyed it and miss it.

91
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:59.690
Lot the diversity you know,
of,
of cuisine.

92
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.170
And so it would have to be clam chowder.

93
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.760
So now you know,

94
00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:08.570
what the most important thing about me that you could possibly know.

95
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.190
When will you be starting back up your Bible series?
Well that's a good question.

96
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.600
Um,
and uh,
it looks like it will be the fall.

97
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.840
Now what's happening in October is that I'm going to Cambridge University in the

98
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:32.321
UK for two months and I'm going to be a visiting fellow there at the divinity

99
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:37.580
school and that should give me an opportunity to talk to religious experts of

100
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:40.190
all types for a couple of months as well as students.

101
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.670
And the plan at the moment is to do that at the same time that I start recording

102
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.220
the lectures on exodus.
So,
um,

103
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.850
I figured I could kill two birds with one stone that way I could start the

104
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:56.930
biblical lectures again,

105
00:06:56.931 --> 00:07:01.931
which I'm really looking forward to and also update my biblical knowledge

106
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:07.370
substantially as well as having the opportunity to spend some time in Cambridge,

107
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.110
which I think would be really exciting.

108
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.750
I was there a little bit this summer and it's,
you know,

109
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.570
an absolutely beautiful university and it's quite a thrill for someone who's

110
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.940
academically minded to be,
to be there period.

111
00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:22.430
But also to be invited there to,

112
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.920
to sit in and participate for a couple of months.

113
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.450
And so anyways,

114
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.480
maybe I can get 10 or so lectures out in that period of time.

115
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:38.000
Let's say if I did one a week,
I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to do it.

116
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:41.270
If I'm going to rent a public theater like I did in Toronto,

117
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.620
I think that's probably the plan.
But anyways,
uh,

118
00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:50.270
assume October,
November,
that's the,
that's the plan at the moment.

119
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:55.250
What I'm trying to concentrate on right now is finishing my new book,

120
00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.440
which has a relatively a sudden or you know,
relatively,

121
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.610
it has a due date that's in the relatively recent future.

122
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.830
And so I like to stay on top of those things.

123
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.670
It's easy to get behind when you're writing a book and to rush it and to do it

124
00:08:10.671 --> 00:08:14.570
badly.
And so I'm trying to make sure that I've got my priorities straight.

125
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.700
So anyways,

126
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:20.240
that's the situation with the biblical series.

127
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.800
I'm really looking forward to it.

128
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:26.300
I think one of the most worthwhile things I've done in my academic career was

129
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:29.780
that series on genesis and I learned a tremendous amount.

130
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:33.110
And so I'm assuming the same thing will happen with the exodus stories,

131
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.550
which I know better.
Uh,

132
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.660
so that should be slightly easier on me from a rate of learning perspective and

133
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.080
hopefully they'll be able to go deeper because they are really remarkable

134
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:49.000
stories.
So I've also been struck by the,
um,

135
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.790
you know,
the reception to those biblical stories.

136
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:57.791
I've received a subsystem surprising number for example,

137
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.650
of a surprising number for example,

138
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:04.530
of letters from Islamic viewers who've been watching them.

139
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.960
And the letters have been very positive.
And so that's,

140
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:13.090
that's made me think very hard about the overall potential effect of delineating

141
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:15.540
the meaning of all these old stories.

142
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.840
I think that to the degree that we want to preserve the understructure of our

143
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:26.001
culture and I regard that as grounded in Judeo Christian tradition very,

144
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:30.360
very firmly as well as other traditions.
Obviously,
uh,

145
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.660
uh,
the Greco Roman tradition probably foremost among them.
Um,

146
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.420
the stories have to be brought to life again and I don't think there's any more

147
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:44.370
effective way of demonstrating their utility than to make them come alive.
Um,

148
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.760
mirror what mere profession of belief and value isn't sufficient.

149
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.470
One thing we make guys might be interested in to it.

150
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.480
This is a video or a audio,
I think.

151
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:03.150
I don't know if I videotape this one or just audio recorded it.

152
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.730
I did a lecture in Australia on this question about belief in God and why I'm

153
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.410
not very happy about the question and I'm unwilling in some sense to answer it.

154
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:18.411
So I did an to our snow 70 minute lecture on how that question,

155
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.600
why that question is problematic for me and what can be done about it,

156
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.390
what,
what the proper answer is to it.
I think.

157
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.410
So hopefully you'll find something interesting in that when it's finally

158
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:32.244
released.

159
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.593
<v 2>MMM.</v>

160
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.990
<v 1>I do not attend church.</v>

161
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.900
How can I teach my children the biblical stories in a productive way without the

162
00:10:44.901 --> 00:10:49.100
dogma or literal,
literal interpretation of organized religion?

163
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.093
<v 2>Well,</v>

164
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.630
<v 1>that's an unbelievably complicated problem and I actually don't know the answer</v>

165
00:10:57.631 --> 00:10:58.880
to it.
Um,

166
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.970
I'm not sure that I did a particularly good job of teaching my children the

167
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:07.080
biblical stories in a productive way without the dogma or literal interpretation

168
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:09.480
of organized religion.
Um,

169
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:14.160
I think that you could start by just reading them the stories.
You know,

170
00:11:14.161 --> 00:11:15.840
there are decent,

171
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.990
plain English translations of the biblical stories and you might find that just

172
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.380
reading the stories to them,
at least they're familiar with them that way.

173
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.120
And you have to pick and choose obviously because they're not going to be too

174
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:32.730
thrilled by sifting through endless genealogies.

175
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.170
But there are also biblical translations available that,

176
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.233
<v 2>okay,</v>

177
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.780
<v 1>put the stories out in prose form and do a pretty good job of editing out the</v>

178
00:11:43.781 --> 00:11:46.690
genealogical material and the other things that might not be.

179
00:11:46.691 --> 00:11:51.691
So what might not capture the imagination of children particularly well,

180
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.170
I think of any better way of doing it than just reading the stories to them and

181
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.420
perhaps to the degree that it's possible to discuss them and see if that works.

182
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.150
Maybe it'll work.
Maybe it won't.

183
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.150
I mean I didn't take my kids to church,
you know,
um,

184
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:13.390
having stopped attending really when I was 13 and I have my reasons for not

185
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:16.210
attending.
Maybe they're good and maybe they're not.

186
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.460
I very back and forth with that.
Um,

187
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.460
one of the downsides of that was that they didn't develop the same familiarity

188
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:27.220
with the stories that I had developed when I was a kid.

189
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:31.720
Cause I did go to church fairly regularly until I was 13.
And it's,

190
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.540
it's definitely a loss.
Um,

191
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.210
my cynicism about church organization cynicism,

192
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.000
I don't know what it is exactly.

193
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:51.710
Well,
I knew my children's education on the biblical front any good.
So,
um,

194
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.970
I'm still at sixes and sevens,

195
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:57.430
let's say about that and about exactly what to do about it.

196
00:12:57.431 --> 00:12:58.750
But you could try reading them,

197
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.820
reading the stories to them and see how that goes.

198
00:13:00.821 --> 00:13:03.220
And there our children's versions available as well.
You know,

199
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:06.220
and I suspect if you look carefully on Amazon,

200
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.820
you could find ones that were well reviewed.

201
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.350
And so that might be another way of approaching it.

202
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.090
What question are you asked?
Way to sell them.

203
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.100
Oh,
well that's pretty easy.
But at least if,

204
00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:30.130
if the question is what question am I asked by journalists way to sell them and

205
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.670
the answer to that would be a dark to Peterson,

206
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.560
what the hell is going on?

207
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:45.580
And what I mean by that is why are so many people coming to your lectures,

208
00:13:46.011 --> 00:13:48.980
let's say.
And why did your book strikes such a chord?

209
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.130
I think the first one is the most important one.
You know,

210
00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:57.131
generally what happens with with journalists is that they're very cynical about

211
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.920
what is happening at my lectures and also who's attending.

212
00:14:03.921 --> 00:14:06.440
And it's really very

213
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.960
pejorative,
demeaning,

214
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.600
thoughtless prejudiced

215
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.420
and I would say cruel all at once because the first assumption is that,

216
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:25.931
you know,

217
00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:30.931
I'm talking primarily to angry white young man and there certainly isn't a lot

218
00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:36.400
of evidence for that.

219
00:14:36.401 --> 00:14:41.401
I would say the average age of the people in my audiences thirties and that's

220
00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:46.060
not exactly young.
And then I would say,

221
00:14:46.061 --> 00:14:51.061
well it's at least 30% women and that's been increasing as the book has sold.

222
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.940
And you know,
the reason it was men primarily to begin with,

223
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.640
I think is because,
well,

224
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.470
there are many men starving for an encouraging voice.

225
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.560
And also the fact that Youtube,

226
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.030
which is where I picked up my primary audience to begin with,
skews about 80,

227
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:14.810
20 male to female in terms of its viewership,
which friend,

228
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.720
it doesn't have anything to do with me,
right?
That's just a,

229
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.030
what do you call that?

230
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:24.140
That's a baseline phenomena that has to be taken into phenomenon that has to be

231
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:26.330
taken into account before you make any,

232
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.640
before you draw any conclusions about the nature of someone's audience.

233
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.490
But the presumption is,
is that,
you know,

234
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:39.491
I'm speaking politically and in an [inaudible] way to the people who show up to

235
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:43.880
my,
uh,
to my lectures,
into my talks.

236
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:46.130
And I've just not true,

237
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.670
the lectures aren't political except peripherally.

238
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:51.830
I mean now,

239
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:56.831
and then throw a critical comment or two out about the manner in which this

240
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.330
strange alliance of postmodernism and,
uh,

241
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.050
neo Marxism has been dominating the university.

242
00:16:06.051 --> 00:16:10.460
But I think that's perfectly reasonable thing to point out.
Apart from that,

243
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.120
the lecture is almost all concentrate on psychological self improvement and it

244
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:21.590
seems almost impossible for the media to be not cynical about that.

245
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.083
You know,

246
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:27.290
I think it's partly because almost everything that that classic media covers has

247
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:28.370
to be politicized.

248
00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:33.371
And I was on a show for example called Q and a and Australian show,

249
00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:37.520
which was their biggest political show,
smart loan one in the UK,

250
00:16:37.521 --> 00:16:40.340
which is also quite big,
which I was also on a while back.

251
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:45.340
And every issue immediately becomes discussed among polarized political lights.

252
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:52.310
It's as if our discourse has degenerated to the point where the only possible

253
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:57.730
response to a question about anything important has to be idiot logical,

254
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:00.500
so left or right.
And it has to be political.

255
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.980
And so I think part of the problem is perhaps that the phenomenon that

256
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.160
constitutes the attendance at my lectures doesn't fit the standard news media

257
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:15.884
narrative,

258
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:20.570
which is driven by journalists I think,

259
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:25.571
who had political ambitions fundamentally or still have political ambitions of

260
00:17:25.731 --> 00:17:30.620
one sort or another and who tend to view world only through a political lens.

261
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.240
But for me,

262
00:17:32.241 --> 00:17:37.241
the experience of my lectures is actually an unbelievably positive one.

263
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.000
And,
and not particularly stressful.

264
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:46.001
Like it's nowhere near as stressful as almost any interview I have with almost

265
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:49.620
any journalist.
Um,
because again,

266
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:54.180
things get politicized very rapidly.
What happens in the lectures is that,

267
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:59.010
you know,
3000 people show up and they're happy to be there.

268
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:04.010
And so it's a very welcoming atmosphere and I get to talk to them for 70 minutes

269
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:08.130
about some psychological problem.

270
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.610
I would say often associated with one of the chapters in my book,

271
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:13.530
like what it means to,

272
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.540
what a human competence hierarchy might look like.

273
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:21.720
Say if I was talking about chapter one,

274
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.270
because we do organize hierarchies.

275
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.230
Human beings naturally organized hierarchies like other animals do.

276
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:32.580
But we tend to organize hierarchies to achieve valuable goals,
you know,

277
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:38.170
failure bubble in that they're goals that people assume would be usefully

278
00:18:38.641 --> 00:18:43.560
achieved to decrease the some amount of suffering in the world or maybe to bring

279
00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:48.120
happiness to people are a bit of luxury or something.
Generally something,
uh,

280
00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:52.260
of at least limited use and often far more than limited.
You know,

281
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:57.180
and I talked to people about the fact that the best way to make progress and

282
00:18:57.181 --> 00:18:59.790
human hierarchy has nothing to do with power,

283
00:18:59.791 --> 00:19:04.791
but everything to do with reciprocity and responsibility.

284
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.330
I just read this or watch this really cool ted talk.

285
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.280
I think it was a ted talk by friends to Wall F,
r a n s,
t,

286
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.260
e,
w a,
l,

287
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.300
and he's studied political behavior in chimpanzees.
So I wish I had the,

288
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.960
um,
the URL for it.

289
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:26.940
Maybe somebody can post that if they would.

290
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.240
But one of the things that do all pointed out was that the most empathic

291
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.980
chimpanzees in a chimpanzee troop are actually the dominant,

292
00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:39.420
the most dominant males.

293
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.570
They're the ones who do the most comforting and the most care,

294
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.470
like the females are more empathic than the males on average.

295
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.080
But across all of the chimpanzees,

296
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.340
the most dominant males are the ones that show the most empathic responses.

297
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.080
And that's part of the walls.

298
00:19:55.290 --> 00:20:00.290
And he's not the only animal ethologists someone who studies the natural

299
00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:04.740
behavior of animals.
He's not the only person to point this sort of thing out,

300
00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:05.011
you know,

301
00:20:05.011 --> 00:20:10.011
is that the ability to move forward in a hierarchy is dependent on far more than

302
00:20:11.851 --> 00:20:13.020
power and aggression.

303
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.970
And it's dependent on reciprocity and friendship,
but also,

304
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.300
especially in the case of human beings on skill.

305
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:27.020
Because hopefully when we organize our hierarchies and we're attempting to solve

306
00:20:27.271 --> 00:20:31.500
complex problems by setting up a hierarchy that allows for competition and

307
00:20:31.501 --> 00:20:36.420
cooperation that the hierarchy organizes itself so that the most competent

308
00:20:36.421 --> 00:20:41.340
people rise to the top.
And I actually think that generally speaking,
that's true.

309
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.750
I mean the selection process isn't perfect and it's marked by,
um,

310
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:51.340
you could say the proclivity to select people for reasons other than their

311
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:55.030
fundamental competence and that might be their attractiveness or their

312
00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:59.650
extroversion or their height or their charisma,

313
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.620
their self confidence.
Um,

314
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.580
it might be their race or their gender or their sexuality too in situations

315
00:21:06.581 --> 00:21:08.380
where true prejudice plays role.

316
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:13.030
But that only happens when the hierarchies of become corrupt because obviously

317
00:21:13.031 --> 00:21:14.620
it's in everyone's best interests.

318
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:19.090
If we're trying to solve complex problems that the most competent people are the

319
00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:23.980
ones that have the opportunity to rise to the top and I actually think we do a

320
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:26.080
damn good job of that in the west,

321
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:30.130
which is why almost everything that we do in the West works,

322
00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.180
why everything is reliable and why the power is always on and why our electronic

323
00:21:34.181 --> 00:21:38.100
technology works and why our society in general works.

324
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.330
You can be cynical about that if you want,

325
00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:45.331
but I don't know what you would compare the functionality of our societies too

326
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:50.080
because things are way better than they were 150 years ago.

327
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.430
They're getting better very,

328
00:21:51.431 --> 00:21:56.431
very rapidly as western ideas of production and private property and an honesty

329
00:21:57.701 --> 00:22:00.400
and integrity,
I would say as well spread around the world.

330
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.300
Especially now that the more radical socialist ideas that were pushed by people

331
00:22:04.301 --> 00:22:04.810
like the,

332
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:09.810
the Soviets have have declined at least to some degree since the collapse of the

333
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.440
Soviet Union.
Well anyways,

334
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.250
this is the sort of thing that's discussed at the talks,
you know,

335
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:18.920
or that that's rule one and you know rural too.

336
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.240
I talk to people about,
um,
taking care of themselves.

337
00:22:22.241 --> 00:22:26.740
Like there's someone who they have responsibility for and that's not a political

338
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:28.630
issue too.
It's,
it's a,

339
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.720
it's an injunction to assuming that you have a certain intrinsic value,

340
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.310
you know,
and that it's necessary for that value to manifest itself,

341
00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.430
for you to push yourself against the world,

342
00:22:42.431 --> 00:22:47.431
to challenge yourself because otherwise what you're capable of won't manifest

343
00:22:48.521 --> 00:22:50.920
itself.
It,
it has to be developed.

344
00:22:50.921 --> 00:22:53.950
It has to be called forth by necessity,
right?

345
00:22:53.951 --> 00:22:57.520
You have to pick a hard problem and try to solve it and push yourself against it

346
00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.720
in order for,

347
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.650
and you have to try to do that truthfully and responsibly in order for what it

348
00:23:02.651 --> 00:23:07.651
is that you're intrinsically capable of and composed of to come to the

349
00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:09.184
forefront.

350
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.450
And that seems like a very positive thing as far as I'm concerned,

351
00:23:13.451 --> 00:23:18.280
to encourage people to be responsible for themselves and for other people.

352
00:23:18.281 --> 00:23:19.630
And also to point out that,

353
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:25.350
that you have a moral responsibility to do so for yourself just as you do for

354
00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:26.614
others.

355
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:31.830
And I think that that message has been very helpful to people.

356
00:23:33.071 --> 00:23:37.570
At least that's what they've told me the eye.
And it's predicated,

357
00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.580
the rule is predicated on the old Judeo Christian idea,

358
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.800
the oldest idea in some sense that you know,

359
00:23:44.801 --> 00:23:48.950
that there's a relationship between logos,

360
00:23:48.951 --> 00:23:53.750
which is truthful speech and communication and bringing things into being from

361
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.800
chaotic potential.
That's the idea that's put forward in genesis.

362
00:23:57.801 --> 00:24:02.450
And also the idea that men and women alike are made in the image of God,

363
00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:04.670
which suggests that like,
God,

364
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:09.680
we have the capability of affecting potential,

365
00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:13.610
affecting the possible future and turning it into the actual present.

366
00:24:13.611 --> 00:24:18.530
And that we do that at least in part as a consequence of our ethical choices.

367
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.670
You know?
And then I'll give you one more example.
In rural 10,

368
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:27.350
which is be precise in your speech,
I point out that,
uh,
tremendous,

369
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:32.060
uh,
that the aims that you have in your life,
the ethical aims,

370
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.530
and those are the aims that direct your actions also direct your perceptions

371
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.080
that this is true at a neurophysiological level.

372
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.320
And that much of the way that the world manifests itself to you is a consequence

373
00:24:44.781 --> 00:24:47.810
of the structure of your ethics.

374
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.130
So it's your ethical structure that's instantiated neurophysiologically that

375
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:56.780
serves as an intermediary between the world of phenomena,

376
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:01.640
let's say.
Um,
objective phenomena and your perception of that.

377
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.760
And you see the world through an ethical lens.

378
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:09.530
And one of the things that that suggests,
and I outlined this in rural six,

379
00:25:09.531 --> 00:25:14.210
is that if the world looks to you like a dismal and terrible place,
um,

380
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:17.900
and you're nihilistic and depressed and hopeless and all of that,
I mean,

381
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.840
there can be physiological reasons for that.
You might be ill,

382
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.090
but if it's a psychological issue,

383
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.650
it's certainly possible that at least part of the reason that everything appears

384
00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:31.970
to you in that light is because your ethical structure is not well formulated.

385
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:37.070
It's incoherent,
it's nihilistic.
It isn't predicated on the idea,
for example,

386
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:40.280
that people have,
um,
some,

387
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.640
some spark of divine virtue and that everyone is valuable in that,

388
00:25:47.181 --> 00:25:47.541
right?

389
00:25:47.541 --> 00:25:52.541
And that we all have the possibility to make a genuine contribution to the world

390
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.240
or at least to stop it from degenerating any more than it has to into a kind of

391
00:25:58.491 --> 00:26:02.870
hell.
So anyways,
that's a very long answer to that question.

392
00:26:02.871 --> 00:26:05.060
But it is.
See,

393
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.110
it's so interesting to me that the journalists who interview me have no

394
00:26:09.111 --> 00:26:13.410
curiosity about why it is that,
um,

395
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.090
so many people are coming to watch my lectures.
They,

396
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.770
it's like the curiosity has been boiled out of them in some sense because it

397
00:26:21.771 --> 00:26:23.420
certainly makes me curious.
I've,

398
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.380
every time I go on stage and there's 3,500 people there,

399
00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.640
I'm curious about why they're there.

400
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:35.360
And so we have a discussion about all these things that I've been talking about.

401
00:26:35.361 --> 00:26:39.680
And I can tell you too that the one thing that really brings the host dead

402
00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:43.200
silence,
which is very much worth paying attention to,

403
00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:45.660
is the discussion.

404
00:26:45.661 --> 00:26:49.500
Anytime I have a discussion about the relationship between responsibility and

405
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:50.550
meaning,
you know,

406
00:26:50.551 --> 00:26:55.470
because one of the fundamental thesis of 12 rules for life and also have maps of

407
00:26:55.471 --> 00:27:00.471
meaning is that because life is essentially tragic and it's fundamental essence,

408
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.650
you need a sustaining meaning that's deep and profound and deep and profound

409
00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:10.110
enough to get you through bad times.

410
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.320
Because there will be very bad times in your life.

411
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:18.060
There'll be death and there'll be illness and there'll be disappointment of,

412
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.060
of all sorts.
And,

413
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.030
and there'll be just that standard difficulties of life in the world to contend

414
00:27:24.031 --> 00:27:24.301
with.

415
00:27:24.301 --> 00:27:29.301
And you really must have something that's profound and powerful to set up

416
00:27:31.231 --> 00:27:31.891
against that.

417
00:27:31.891 --> 00:27:36.891
And I think that your voluntary adoption of the struggle to improve being is the

418
00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:43.650
proper,
uh,
antidote to that.

419
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:48.420
And that the best way to do that is to live responsibly.
And truthfully,

420
00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:54.300
I truly believe that.
And I think that people know this,
you know,

421
00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:58.380
because when I talked to my audiences about exactly this,
about who they admire,

422
00:27:58.381 --> 00:28:01.170
for example,
you know,
it's like,
well,

423
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.040
you don't admire people who lie and cheat and to see if you don't teach your

424
00:28:05.041 --> 00:28:08.760
children to do that,
you admire people who keep their word,

425
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:11.280
who are honest and reliable and you want them around,

426
00:28:11.281 --> 00:28:12.630
especially in times of trouble.

427
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:17.630
And you want people who are capable of being responsible for themselves and to

428
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:21.600
take care of themselves properly as if they matter as a moral duty.

429
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:27.050
And then you also want people who have extended themselves past that so that

430
00:28:27.571 --> 00:28:31.770
they can take care of their family and regard that as a noble and appropriate

431
00:28:31.771 --> 00:28:35.790
enterprise and who are reliable for their children and for their husbands and

432
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:36.510
wives.

433
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:41.190
And then you want people who are capable of extending themselves even beyond

434
00:28:41.191 --> 00:28:44.610
that and taking care of the community.
And when I talk about that,

435
00:28:44.611 --> 00:28:48.570
and that's meaning three to find the meaning in your life.
If you're,

436
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.800
if you're looking for it,

437
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.370
it's not in happiness and it's not an impulsive pleasure,

438
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:58.230
not none of that works for any length of time.
And it tends to kick back hard.

439
00:28:58.231 --> 00:29:03.231
And it's certainly not something that's going to get you through rough times.

440
00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:09.050
It's the ability to pick up a heavy load of responsibility and to move forward

441
00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:09.331
with it.

442
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:14.331
And what's so interesting is that every time I talk about this with my

443
00:29:14.341 --> 00:29:18.480
audiences,
they're reduced to complete silence.

444
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.040
And there's,
I think there's something that's,
you know,

445
00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:27.420
I've noticed that in 150 different cities now and it's something you really have

446
00:29:27.421 --> 00:29:29.940
to take seriously when you see it happening over and over.

447
00:29:29.941 --> 00:29:34.740
And I do believe that a huge part of the reason that people are coming to watch

448
00:29:34.741 --> 00:29:37.500
my lectures and to buy my book,

449
00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.940
the lectures of course have more direct impact on me then the book sale.

450
00:29:42.941 --> 00:29:46.120
So though the book sales now have approached 3 million copies,

451
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:51.121
which is quite something in hardcover round the world and they're not translated

452
00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:54.550
into all the languages they're going to be translated into.

453
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:58.150
That's I think 50 languages is what they're slated for now.

454
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.620
But the lectures have more impact on me because I get to see the audience and

455
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:05.750
then to talk to people afterwards,
you know,
and they tell me the same thing.

456
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:11.130
Many people who come up to me in the meet and greets because people can come and

457
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:14.770
talk to me after the,
after the lecture.

458
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:17.290
There's special tickets arranged for that.
Um,

459
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:22.150
that's handled by a particular company and they tell me,
you know,

460
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:26.020
they've been trying to develop a vision for their life and to act more

461
00:30:26.021 --> 00:30:30.760
responsibility and to speak more truthfully and to take more responsibility.

462
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.140
Maybe I already said that.

463
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:36.100
And that the changes in their lives have been overwhelming as a consequence.

464
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:41.101
Merely trying to just speak the truth or not lie has had a huge effect on many

465
00:30:41.651 --> 00:30:45.550
of the people that I've talked to him.
And it's not a simple thing to do,

466
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:46.330
you know?
And,

467
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:50.230
and it's a risky thing because the consequences of speaking the truth and the

468
00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:52.660
short term,
especially if you're not very practiced at it,

469
00:30:52.661 --> 00:30:55.660
can be quite devastating,
which is of course white people don't do it,

470
00:30:56.170 --> 00:31:01.170
but the medium to longterm consequences are extremely beneficial.

471
00:31:01.211 --> 00:31:04.030
And it's what sets the world straight.
And so

472
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.870
what question are you asked?
Way Too seldom.

473
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.230
Well,
Dr. Peterson,

474
00:31:12.231 --> 00:31:15.170
don't you think that it's interesting that so many people are coming to your

475
00:31:15.171 --> 00:31:20.171
lectures that are fundamentally psychological and philosophical in nature and

476
00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:23.570
apparently doing so because they're really trying hard to get their lives

477
00:31:23.571 --> 00:31:28.220
together.
It's like,
yeah,
I think that's really interesting.

478
00:31:28.221 --> 00:31:31.640
And it's a question that's really worth pursuing.

479
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.390
It's the only question that's worth pursuing as far as I'm concerned,

480
00:31:35.391 --> 00:31:40.010
because it's a real mystery that there's such a demand for this.
I can't,

481
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:43.130
I can't fathom it.
I think it's,

482
00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:48.140
it's been a source of tremendous optimism to me that people have that

483
00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:55.060
burning desire for a more profound dialogue.

484
00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:58.940
And you know,
it's not necessarily the people that you expect to.

485
00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.130
So the journalists,
you know,

486
00:32:01.131 --> 00:32:05.430
they're very cynical about my hypothetically angry audience for example.

487
00:32:05.431 --> 00:32:06.264
And you know,

488
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:11.360
I've spoken now to I think 350,000 people,
right?

489
00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.990
350,000 people in 150 cities.

490
00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:20.140
And we haven't had one episode of misbehavior from anybody in the audience

491
00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:26.290
except for one person who stood up in some city and had a few,

492
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:30.660
you know,
rebellious things to say,
but they will,

493
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.840
that person wasn't a partisan of mine by any stretch of the imagination.
The,

494
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:39.350
um,
lectures have been very,

495
00:32:39.351 --> 00:32:42.410
very peaceful and they're very,
very positive.

496
00:32:42.411 --> 00:32:46.910
And that's part of the reason why I've been able to travel around so regularly

497
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:50.180
over the last year with my wife and do 150 lectures.
You know,

498
00:32:50.181 --> 00:32:55.181
cause it's quite well demanding all that traveling and all that thinking because

499
00:32:56.691 --> 00:32:59.990
each of the lectures is different,
at least to the degree that I can make it.

500
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:04.991
But there are so positive and it's so exciting at a fundamental level to see

501
00:33:07.791 --> 00:33:12.791
people want to engage in serious dialogue of that sort.

502
00:33:13.551 --> 00:33:15.740
That it's unbelievably,
um,

503
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.510
sustaining,

504
00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:24.130
let's call it that it makes up for the energy use.

505
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.620
Uh,
Australia tired me out.
Um,
I,

506
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.440
I think I maybe did do a bit too much traveling around and you know,

507
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:36.700
there were some other issues in my family that had to be dealt with in January

508
00:33:36.701 --> 00:33:40.000
and March that were quite serious.
And so that was another issue that,

509
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:44.170
that was draining,
let's say.
But I'll tell you,

510
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.980
both my wife and I and Dave Ruben too,
and my tour manager,

511
00:33:47.981 --> 00:33:52.060
John O'connell,
who's been a really good guy,
you know,

512
00:33:52.061 --> 00:33:56.920
we've all found this entire experience,
extraordinarily positive.

513
00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.690
And the same thing happens with the people who are arranging the tours.

514
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.090
It's their experiences is the same.
So

515
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:13.790
how to balance between making peace in speaking the truth in intimate relations.

516
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.700
What if truth hurts the other or two sides conflict.

517
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.140
While you can be absolutely certain that that's going to happen.
I mean,

518
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.130
look,
the first thing,
that's a really good question that's from Vincent.

519
00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:29.790
It's a really good question.
It's a really difficult question.

520
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.030
The first thing you have to decide is,

521
00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:40.320
this goes back to what I was discussing about 10 minutes ago about what your

522
00:34:40.321 --> 00:34:42.840
aims are.
You know,
your whole,

523
00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:48.060
the whole way you perceive the world is dependent on what you're on,

524
00:34:48.061 --> 00:34:49.860
the aim of your ethical structure.

525
00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.360
And so that ethical structure is,
is,
uh,
it's a,

526
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:59.400
it's a hierarchy with something at the top that's of crucial importance.

527
00:34:59.401 --> 00:35:04.230
And Carl Jung would say that whatever's at the top of your ethical hierarchy

528
00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:08.220
function psychologically as if it's God for you,

529
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.430
it's because it's the highest of all possible values.

530
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:16.850
And you could think of God in that sense as a personality that perhaps a

531
00:35:17.881 --> 00:35:21.870
personality that you're trying to mimic because the value structure actually

532
00:35:21.871 --> 00:35:26.730
constitutes a personality that you're trying to act out or mimic.

533
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.830
And so the highest element in that personality structure would be the most

534
00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:36.510
valuable portion of that personality.
You might say,

535
00:35:36.511 --> 00:35:40.980
well what you want,
what do you want?
If you could have what you wanted,

536
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.190
if you could knock in the door,
would open so to speak.

537
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.610
And if you could ask and you would receive,
what would you want?

538
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.320
And that means what would you give,
what would you give?

539
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.150
What would you be willing to give up?
Important things for?

540
00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:01.650
How would you prioritize?
Which is the same as giving up important things.

541
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:07.190
And it's not easy to come to terms with what you want because you might be angry

542
00:36:07.261 --> 00:36:11.160
and resentful and bitter and you might have your reasons for that.

543
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:16.020
And and that might contaminate your ethical structure,
let's say,

544
00:36:16.021 --> 00:36:20.370
and make it so that there's large parts of you that would be the shadow part

545
00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:24.930
from the union perspective,
who's actually that are actually after conflict.

546
00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:25.764
And,

547
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:30.800
and harm and cruelty and suffering out of spite and revenge and the probability

548
00:36:32.881 --> 00:36:37.350
that part of you is like that is unbelievably high because it's very hard to be

549
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.640
pure of spirit,

550
00:36:38.641 --> 00:36:42.360
let's say given how much suffering and malevolence there is in the world and how

551
00:36:42.361 --> 00:36:47.130
much we're exposed to that.
So it's very easy to take the low road.

552
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.180
If you,
if you are married,
let's say,

553
00:36:51.181 --> 00:36:55.290
or you have a close relationship with someone and you want that relationship to

554
00:36:55.291 --> 00:36:58.350
be good,
then the first thing that you have to figure out is,

555
00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:03.030
well what do you mean by good?
You know,

556
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.030
so and I would say,
well good would be

557
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.180
loving,
let's say.

558
00:37:09.181 --> 00:37:14.181
And what that would mean is that each of you would be trying to take care of the

559
00:37:14.311 --> 00:37:19.311
other and yourself as if you're of equal import and that that important is high.

560
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.330
And so I think that once you're married to someone,
for example,

561
00:37:24.331 --> 00:37:26.940
or once you have children and then maybe this,

562
00:37:26.941 --> 00:37:31.860
the same thing applies to your immediate family,
your parents and your siblings.

563
00:37:31.861 --> 00:37:35.580
Is that probably somewhat less so for them,

564
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.760
although still significantly.

565
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:44.240
Then you have to treat your spouse and your children as if they are yourself.

566
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:50.640
And I know that's an old idea.
It's not often explained well but

567
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:57.300
you you on that also assumes that what you want for yourself,

568
00:37:57.301 --> 00:38:00.600
it's something approximating what would be best for you and you'd have to figure

569
00:38:00.601 --> 00:38:03.250
that out as well.
And I dunno,

570
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:08.270
it seems to me that well you want like the people that you're with and so you

571
00:38:09.031 --> 00:38:13.920
have to treat them well and you want them to love you and to love them.

572
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:19.110
I would say at least to this same degree that you'd want that from a pet.

573
00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:19.951
You know,

574
00:38:19.951 --> 00:38:23.520
it's very nice to come home if you have a dog or another animal that loves you

575
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:27.420
to have something there that's really on your side that's happy to see you.

576
00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:30.960
It's one of the wonderful things that can happen while in a marriage,

577
00:38:30.961 --> 00:38:35.010
but also when you have children,
so you want to like the people you're around,

578
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:40.060
you want to love them,
you want to support them when they're having a hard time.

579
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:43.030
And vice versa.
So you want to make your,

580
00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.000
the vessel in which your families ensconced,

581
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:53.700
watertight and,
and capable of withstanding storms.

582
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.930
You want to discipline yourself so that you're not doing things that you're

583
00:38:57.931 --> 00:39:00.510
ashamed of.
You want to tell the truth.

584
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.680
You want to work responsibly and be a good provider,

585
00:39:04.681 --> 00:39:08.400
whether you're female or male in whatever capacity you can manage.

586
00:39:08.401 --> 00:39:12.000
And I would say that also goes for children to the degree that they're capable

587
00:39:12.001 --> 00:39:14.220
of contributing to the family environment.

588
00:39:14.221 --> 00:39:19.200
And you have to think that all through you want to embed your family in a

589
00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:22.470
healthy social life too,
and in a healthy community life.

590
00:39:22.471 --> 00:39:27.471
But that all has to be conscious and thought through before you can start

591
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:33.250
telling the truth.
Nope.

592
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:38.530
How to balance between making peace in speaking truth in intimate relationships.

593
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.800
What if truth hurts the other or two sides?
Conflict.
Okay.

594
00:39:41.801 --> 00:39:44.950
So the first thing you have to do is with the person that you're communicating

595
00:39:44.951 --> 00:39:49.240
with,
you both have to figure out,
well what it is that,
what are you aiming at?

596
00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:53.110
You know,
I think it's in rule nine,

597
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:57.220
which is assume that the person you're listening to knows something that you

598
00:39:57.221 --> 00:40:02.200
don't.
That I outlined a number of different conversational types,
you know,

599
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:07.060
and there's the conversational type that's designed to mutually amuse and it can

600
00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:10.910
be lots of fun.
And there's the conversational type that's uh,

601
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.320
designed to win.
That's where I have a point of view.

602
00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:18.010
And you have a point of view and,
and we engage in a power dispute,

603
00:40:18.011 --> 00:40:23.011
especially essentially a dominance dispute where the goal is for one of the

604
00:40:23.351 --> 00:40:25.930
positions to come out on top and win.

605
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:31.560
And then there's another conversation where the goal is to explore a problem and

606
00:40:33.341 --> 00:40:38.341
to come to a joint to jointly further the understanding of that problem.

607
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.840
And I would say that that's how you balance making peace in speaking the truth

608
00:40:46.061 --> 00:40:48.910
in intimate relationships is that,
you know,

609
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.940
the first thing you have to do is while you have to have a conversation about

610
00:40:54.131 --> 00:40:56.230
just exactly what the problem is.

611
00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:01.570
And that might take a long time and a lot of listening because when people are

612
00:41:01.571 --> 00:41:02.800
upset about something,

613
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:07.780
they don't always know what it is that they're upset about and what they're

614
00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:11.170
upset about might be associated with a hundred other things that they're upset

615
00:41:11.171 --> 00:41:12.640
about that they've not dealt with.

616
00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.640
And some of those can be directly Germane to the issue at hand,

617
00:41:15.641 --> 00:41:20.641
but some of them can be a consequence of old family trouble or old trauma,

618
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:24.490
to use a very overused word,

619
00:41:24.491 --> 00:41:27.590
but trouble in the past that hasn't been dealt with properly.
And it,

620
00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.460
it all amalgamates into a complex,

621
00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:35.461
that's the psychoanalytic idea that consists of all the problems that the person

622
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:40.610
is dealing with that haven't been resolved.
And then any new problem gets,

623
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:42.763
it gets,

624
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:47.270
it's poorly separated from that entire complex of problems.

625
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:49.520
And so when the person is upset,

626
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:54.680
then all the things they're upset about can sort of manifest themselves in,
in,

627
00:41:54.681 --> 00:41:59.390
uh,
incoherent and chaotic manner.
And that's really hard.

628
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:02.000
And so if someone's upset about something,

629
00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.920
do you or the other person might take a tremendous amount of listening before

630
00:42:06.921 --> 00:42:09.680
you can even get to what the problem is?

631
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.580
And often during that process of listening,

632
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:17.930
there's a lot of mutual recrimination and accusations as each person tries to

633
00:42:17.931 --> 00:42:18.471
work it out.

634
00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:22.850
Because if you're annoyed at someone and maybe all the other things that are

635
00:42:22.851 --> 00:42:25.940
wrong with your life are in the background driving the annoyance,

636
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:27.020
but you don't really know it,

637
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.320
you're going to accuse them of all sorts of misbehavior.

638
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:33.920
Some of it now with some justification,
no doubt,

639
00:42:33.921 --> 00:42:37.970
and all sorts of inadequacies.
It's not a good way of communicating,

640
00:42:37.971 --> 00:42:42.230
but it happens a lot.
And then that person has to defend themselves like mad,

641
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:46.760
just so that they can not be the target of all that vitriol.

642
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:49.550
It's stored up for such a tremendous length of time.

643
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:55.040
So anyways,
you have to listen to each other a lot.
It's like,
okay,

644
00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:00.440
what's the problem?
And then a rule there might be,
well,

645
00:43:00.441 --> 00:43:04.700
what's the minimum problem?
It's like,
while our relationship is no good,

646
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:08.070
it's like that's a nonstarter for a discussion man.
Um,

647
00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.320
cause he can't fix your whole relationship.

648
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.960
You have to be more precise.

649
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:19.280
You have to think and maybe your partner has to help you figure out what it is

650
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:24.281
that you're upset about right now that could be rectified.

651
00:43:24.861 --> 00:43:29.861
I mean maybe you made a nice dinner or even a dinner that wasn't so nice and you

652
00:43:31.481 --> 00:43:34.970
got treated casually and with a certain amount of contempt.

653
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:36.650
Well everyone was eating it.
You know,

654
00:43:36.651 --> 00:43:40.910
they came in and grabbed the food scattered to the four ends of the house and

655
00:43:40.911 --> 00:43:44.870
ate it and didn't bring their dishes back and didn't say thank you.
And you know,

656
00:43:44.871 --> 00:43:49.610
you're very irritated about that and you have your reasons and you know,

657
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.260
the way you might respond to that as well.

658
00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:55.280
This relationship isn't working but it's not precise enough.
You think,

659
00:43:55.281 --> 00:43:58.760
well I have this specific problem.

660
00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.070
I'm trying to make it a specific problem.

661
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:06.200
Then I'm trying to come up with a specific solution that might make this

662
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.100
relationship,
this part of the relationship work better.

663
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:12.770
And so look,

664
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.900
you have to aim at peace and you have to aim at love and responsibility and

665
00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:19.370
mutual support.

666
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.800
You have to want that for the people that are important to you in your life.

667
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:29.840
And then you can start to talk to them because you're going to listen in the

668
00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:34.290
proper way.
You're going to listen in a way that's aiming at that higher good,

669
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:39.320
which is mutual peace amongst the members of the community.

670
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:45.000
It's something that I learned for example from John Piaget,

671
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:49.710
he called that in equilibrated state and calibrated state is like a game that

672
00:44:49.711 --> 00:44:53.940
everyone wants to play.
And so if you set your household up properly,

673
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:59.120
then it's a game that everybody is participating in voluntarily and that's going

674
00:44:59.121 --> 00:45:03.450
to be predicated on the desire for peace and the willingness to speak truth and

675
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:05.280
the ability to take responsibility.

676
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.430
So that has to be part of your higher order moral aim.

677
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.760
And then when you're having a difficult discussion with someone,

678
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:18.050
that discussion is going to be effected by that higher order moral aim.

679
00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:24.060
It's not going to be contaminated to the same degree by your desire to inflict

680
00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:27.080
pain and attain victory and you know,

681
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:31.960
crush your opponent and punish them for their previous sins and,
um,

682
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.510
indicate your disappointment,
things they've done over the years and all of that.

683
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:41.880
And so you can tell if you've got it balanced.
By the way,

684
00:45:41.881 --> 00:45:45.390
Vincent,
if the conversation continues,

685
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:50.460
you know,
when,
when we used to sit down for family meetings,

686
00:45:50.461 --> 00:45:54.180
which happen on a bimonthly basis,
something like that,

687
00:45:54.181 --> 00:45:59.181
once every two months when we returned to d divide up economic and practical

688
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.010
duties amongst my wife and I and the kids,

689
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.700
we had some rules and the rules were,
well,
you know,

690
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.880
there's a certain number of things that have to be done in the house to keep it

691
00:46:11.881 --> 00:46:16.440
running in a manner that anyone with any sense would want it to run.

692
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:20.970
And there are certain responsibilities that everyone has to undertake to

693
00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:22.770
facilitate that.

694
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:28.110
And there's difficult discussions that have to be had about who's going to do

695
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:30.510
what.
And so here's the rules.

696
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.140
We have to make a list of what needs to be done.

697
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:39.170
We have to agree on that and then we have to each accept the responsibilities

698
00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:43.500
that go along with that in some sort of order.

699
00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:48.240
Maybe you choose one and then I choose one and then someone else chooses one.

700
00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:53.241
Assuming that everybody's mature enough and capable of doing the jobs that they

701
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:59.420
pick and that you have to negotiate until you come to the best solution that can

702
00:47:01.651 --> 00:47:04.680
be negotiated,
which isn't necessarily a perfect solution,

703
00:47:04.681 --> 00:47:06.510
but it might be the best one that can be done.

704
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:09.810
And then you have to stick with it until the next negotiation.

705
00:47:09.811 --> 00:47:13.080
And if you get upset during the negotiations,

706
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.250
which you likely will,
because these are difficult topics,

707
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:20.880
how to divide up responsibilities in the house and people get mad because they

708
00:47:20.881 --> 00:47:23.880
feel they've been taken advantage of or aren't being listened to.

709
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.270
One of the rules was while you can leave the discussion,

710
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:31.570
but only until you calm down and then you have to come back because these things

711
00:47:31.571 --> 00:47:34.270
have to be pushed through.

712
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.440
They have to be negotiated through because the alternative is well important

713
00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:43.441
things don't get done or people do them resentfully because they're sort of

714
00:47:43.841 --> 00:47:48.580
forced by their own orderliness or their old conscientiousness or or,

715
00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:50.110
<v 0>okay,</v>

716
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:54.130
<v 1>but we know by force,
psychological or otherwise on the part of other people,</v>

717
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:56.170
these things have to be negotiated through.

718
00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.970
You can tell if you've got the balance between making peace in speaking the

719
00:48:00.971 --> 00:48:01.690
truth,
right?

720
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:06.430
If the conversation continues and it can be emotional and will be and can be

721
00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:09.460
difficult because important things have to be dealt with,

722
00:48:09.461 --> 00:48:14.461
but as long as the people are still in the conversation and communicating,

723
00:48:14.711 --> 00:48:16.900
then you,
then you've got the balance right.

724
00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.820
You know when you might have to take a break,

725
00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:22.480
maybe you have to hold off till the next day.
Um,

726
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.550
maybe sometimes when you're negotiating something that's difficult and you have

727
00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:31.930
to offer the other person the opportunity to sleep on their decision to,

728
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.930
which I think is often a very good idea.

729
00:48:34.931 --> 00:48:37.000
If you have to make an important decision in your life,

730
00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:41.320
it's very useful to tell the person that you're negotiating with it.
Look,

731
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:43.150
I'm interested in this and it seems good,

732
00:48:43.151 --> 00:48:48.120
but I'm not gonna agree until I sleep on it.
It gives your,
well,

733
00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:51.970
lots of things happen when you sleep.
You organize your brain when you sleep,

734
00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:57.210
at least to the degree that you can organize it and you can often be more solid

735
00:48:58.271 --> 00:49:02.470
or more doubtful about a decision if you sleep on it.
So,

736
00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.490
so that's good.
That's a good question.
Vincent.

737
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:15.760
Dan says,
I have many friends but feel lonely from outside.

738
00:49:15.761 --> 00:49:19.570
I'm mister popular yet every single friendship feel shallow.

739
00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.020
How to transition to fewer closer friends?

740
00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:28.260
Well it's hard to say Dan Cause I don't know the specifics of your situation and

741
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:33.270
you sound like an extroverted person and extroverted people liked to be in the

742
00:49:33.701 --> 00:49:38.701
center of a large group of people and you know they like parties and they'd

743
00:49:39.001 --> 00:49:43.780
liked to tell jokes and they're energized by social interactions and so they can

744
00:49:43.781 --> 00:49:48.781
have a fairly large group of friends that where their attention is spread across

745
00:49:50.741 --> 00:49:54.070
many people now.
And you know,

746
00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:57.840
that can perhaps be a con or,

747
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:02.080
or one of the consequences of that can be this feeling that you have,

748
00:50:02.081 --> 00:50:05.650
that the friendships are shallow cause there's not much to them.

749
00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:08.320
The first question might be,
well,
you know,

750
00:50:08.321 --> 00:50:13.321
do you have an intimate relationship because a fair bit of depth of

751
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:21.390
human interaction comes as a consequence of long term committed relationships,

752
00:50:21.391 --> 00:50:24.720
right?
With your wife or your husband or your parents or your siblings or your

753
00:50:24.721 --> 00:50:25.554
children.

754
00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:30.770
And so I would say that the true depth in relationship is generally to be found

755
00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:34.280
within family.
That doesn't mean that trends are an important.

756
00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:39.680
And the next issue is,
well,
are there things that you're doing with your friends?

757
00:50:39.681 --> 00:50:44.681
Are there activities that you're undertaking with your friends that are more

758
00:50:45.441 --> 00:50:50.390
significant than mere casual amusement,
you know,
or is it,

759
00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:55.010
is it just casual amusement?
Because if it is,
you know,
the bar scene or,

760
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:59.810
or that kind of,
um,
party life,

761
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:04.840
let's say the friendships aren't going to be very deep because they're not,

762
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:10.820
they're predicated on shallow activities.

763
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:16.210
And so it may be that you need to find some activities that you feel are

764
00:51:17.961 --> 00:51:22.160
profound on your own and find people that you can share them with.

765
00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:27.460
Cause a fair bit of friendship is in fact the engagement in shared activity.

766
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.640
And so the more profound the activity at least in principle,

767
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:35.510
then perhaps the more profound the friendship.
Um,

768
00:51:35.511 --> 00:51:40.511
certainly the people whose friendships I would regard as most crucial to me are

769
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.640
people with whom I'm involved in

770
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.180
complex and difficult

771
00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:54.680
in endeavors as well as friendships.

772
00:51:54.681 --> 00:51:59.681
There are things that we are doing together that we both regardless of crucial

773
00:52:00.021 --> 00:52:04.910
importance and I think that's necessary because I think that a fair bit of

774
00:52:04.911 --> 00:52:08.630
friendship apart from,
you know,
the part that's amusement and fun,

775
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:13.631
which is important is a consequence of the profundity of shared activities.

776
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:16.400
And so you might want to ask yourself,
you know,

777
00:52:16.401 --> 00:52:20.420
are you doing anything with anyone that you regard as important?

778
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.990
And,
and then the other thing I would ask is,
well,
you know,

779
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:28.940
do you have an assortment of intimate relationships?
Do you have a partner,

780
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:34.280
a wife or a husband?
Do you have children?
I don't know how old you are because,

781
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:39.950
and are you spending enough time attending to your parents and your siblings to

782
00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:46.220
keep those relationships alive with holidays and with visits and that sort of

783
00:52:46.221 --> 00:52:47.054
thing.

784
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:53.240
That's where you find the relationships that generally speaking are deep and

785
00:52:53.241 --> 00:52:57.290
meaningful and lasting even though they're often the ones that are also the most

786
00:52:57.291 --> 00:52:58.124
problematic.

787
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:06.230
Disney has taken a direction towards promoting SJW agendas.
Yes.

788
00:53:06.231 --> 00:53:07.640
Well you can say that again,

789
00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:12.230
this has been reflected despite backlash in the marvel and star wars movies.

790
00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:15.200
Thoughts?
My sense is that self limiting,

791
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.620
I mean I know that one of the things that I know some people in the comics

792
00:53:18.621 --> 00:53:22.570
industry,
Comic Book Industry and I know that,
um,

793
00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:28.180
the superhero types that have been put forward to manifest a diversity agenda

794
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.030
have generally been colossal failures.

795
00:53:33.031 --> 00:53:37.800
And that tends to be the case at the box office as well.
And so,
look,

796
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:41.730
here's something that I think is universally true.

797
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:47.550
As soon as you subvert art.
And I would regard movies as art.

798
00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:52.560
Um,
there are a form of literature and they can be a very profound form of

799
00:53:52.561 --> 00:53:55.950
literature.
But even if they're not,
even if they're,
you know,
like an,

800
00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:59.610
an a well paced and well-written action thriller.

801
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:03.060
If the story,

802
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:08.610
which is the art in the movie part of the art in the movie,

803
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.000
If the story is subverted to a political agenda,

804
00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:17.210
then it's going to be punished for that at the box office because no one except

805
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:20.850
for the odd acolyte is going to be the least bit happy with that.

806
00:54:20.851 --> 00:54:23.850
And even they're not,
they'll,
they'll mouth their approval,

807
00:54:23.851 --> 00:54:27.090
but they won't go watch the movies because they just hear what they,

808
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.160
they already know.
There's no mystery.

809
00:54:29.161 --> 00:54:33.060
There's no investigation in a good story.

810
00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:37.290
The storytellers should be trying to figure out the story as he or she writes

811
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:41.490
and the audience should be participating in that process.
The,

812
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:46.940
the moral of the story should be stamped on the story right from the beginning

813
00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:50.340
because what you have then is not art.

814
00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:56.420
You have propaganda and when people are out to see a movie or to watch something

815
00:54:57.541 --> 00:55:00.960
on television that,
that has an artistic,
uh,

816
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.350
uh,
fundamental artistic nature,

817
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:09.760
if it's subverted to propaganda,
then it's going to fail.
And,

818
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:14.250
and thank God for that.
So,
um,
that's,

819
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.460
I think it's self defeating.
We'll see.

820
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.950
There's nothing that beats a good story.
You know,
there's,

821
00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:26.190
there's no propaganda that can compete with a good story.
So,
uh,

822
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:30.770
I think it'll burn itself out.

823
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:36.510
Oh,
here's a simple one.

824
00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:41.410
What is a soul to you?

825
00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.020
That's a hard question.

826
00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:10.210
I would say
like theologically

827
00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:15.730
a soul is that aspect of the human,

828
00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:20.380
that aspect of human being that's akin to divinity,

829
00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:22.090
that's made in the image of God.

830
00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:27.840
And so,
and I think that that's a very,

831
00:56:27.841 --> 00:56:32.640
very important concept.
I don't think a society can survive.

832
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:36.150
I don't think that you can survive a relationship with yourself.

833
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.050
I don't think you can have a relationship with another person.

834
00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:45.560
And I don't think a society can organize itself in a productive and sustainable

835
00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:51.350
and peaceful manner without that idea as the core idea.

836
00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:57.890
And so the core idea is that there's something of irreducible value that

837
00:56:59.281 --> 00:57:04.281
characterizes each human being and that it's of the highest value,

838
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:10.770
which is what makes it say a kin to God or a kin to divinity.

839
00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:14.610
And so that's the soul.

840
00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:21.130
And then the question is maybe how does that manifest itself in the world?

841
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:24.730
So what are it's what are its hallmarks?

842
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:30.760
And I would say that that's very tightly associated with what modern people

843
00:57:30.761 --> 00:57:32.560
describe as consciousness.

844
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:38.050
And there's more to it than consciousness because it's also character.

845
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.920
But I would say character is a manifestation of consciousness.

846
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:46.180
What consciousness does,
as far as I can tell,

847
00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:51.280
is confront unformed potential.

848
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.700
This is partly why I think it's improper.

849
00:57:54.701 --> 00:57:57.250
I'm writing a fair bit about this right now in my new book,

850
00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:02.680
why it's improper to think of people as deterministic.
You're deterministic.

851
00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:06.400
Once you've established a habit and you've practiced something for a very long

852
00:58:06.401 --> 00:58:07.360
period of time,

853
00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:13.030
you become more deterministic and your actions because you're expert at reacting

854
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:17.650
and there's neurological neurophysiological circuits that are laid down to

855
00:58:17.651 --> 00:58:22.000
facilitate your action under those conditions and to run with some degree of

856
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:25.990
automative city.
But most of the time,
much of the time,

857
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:29.650
what you confront is the changing future,

858
00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:34.480
a future of potential.
Right?
And it's,
it's like a,

859
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:39.520
it's like a place of multiple pathways and your consciousness.

860
00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:44.730
Is that part of you that confronts those multiple pathways and decides which one

861
00:58:46.451 --> 00:58:50.380
to walk down and it does.

862
00:58:50.381 --> 00:58:52.540
So according to its ethic.

863
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:57.880
We talked earlier about the fact that you need a value hierarchy.

864
00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:02.950
It's inevitable that you have a value hierarchy and that you look at the world

865
00:59:02.951 --> 00:59:06.760
through it and that it should be well structured and that there should be

866
00:59:06.761 --> 00:59:09.310
something of divine importance at the top.

867
00:59:09.311 --> 00:59:13.660
I would say what should occupy the top position is the realization,

868
00:59:13.661 --> 00:59:14.351
for example,

869
00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:19.351
that each person is of divine value and that the most appropriate way of

870
00:59:19.631 --> 00:59:24.631
interacting with potential is by embodying and speaking the truth.

871
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:31.120
That's not a bad way of briefly conceptualizing what might be at the highest

872
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:37.340
pinnacle of the value structure.
I would say that's what the logos is and so

873
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:41.720
the soul is a,

874
00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:47.740
the soul is what manifests itself in the choice between different pathways in

875
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:53.120
the choice between different ways of transforming the potential of the future

876
00:59:53.121 --> 00:59:54.980
into the actuality of the present.

877
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:58.820
And it does that by making ethical decisions,

878
00:59:58.821 --> 01:00:01.850
by choosing between good and evil at each choice point,

879
01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:07.330
and to the degree that it chooses good than it takes the raw potential of the

880
01:00:08.331 --> 01:00:13.331
future and it transforms it into the being of the present that is good.

881
01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:18.560
And to the degree that it does that in a manner that's evil and contaminated by

882
01:00:18.561 --> 01:00:20.900
malevolence and hatred and vengefulness,

883
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:26.110
then it takes a pathway that corrupts the world and makes things worse.

884
01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.510
And it's the soul that's doing that.

885
01:00:29.511 --> 01:00:31.880
And it's the soul that's responsible for that.

886
01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:37.330
And it's also that active part of the soul that shaping the deeper soul in some

887
01:00:38.661 --> 01:00:39.111
sense,

888
01:00:39.111 --> 01:00:43.340
which would be something like the cumulative consequences of all those choices.

889
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:48.430
Something akin to what people more classically have referred to as character.

890
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:50.833
Now,

891
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:55.610
I don't know what to say really about the metaphysics of the soul,

892
01:00:55.970 --> 01:01:00.970
except that it's very mysterious that we have this capacity for consciousness,

893
01:01:02.391 --> 01:01:06.230
which is completely,
um,
I would say

894
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.010
beyond our current understanding,

895
01:01:10.011 --> 01:01:15.011
we have no good reductionist accounts of consciousness except those put forward

896
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:20.750
to deny the very existence of something like consciousness and free will.

897
01:01:20.751 --> 01:01:24.290
And the problem I have with those arguments is that while the first thing is

898
01:01:24.291 --> 01:01:28.370
that you don't look deterministic until you've built habits sets,

899
01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.650
and that's a consequence of consciousness because consciousness builds habits

900
01:01:32.651 --> 01:01:33.260
sets.

901
01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:37.820
And the second is that it doesn't seem to be possible to organize a relationship

902
01:01:37.821 --> 01:01:42.821
with yourself or an intimate partner or a family or a community without the

903
01:01:43.941 --> 01:01:48.941
concept of the divine value of the individual and the capacity of that divine

904
01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.410
spark,
let's say,
to manifest itself in freewill.

905
01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:58.070
I don't see how societies can organize themselves without those principles.

906
01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.790
And to me that indicates that there's something about them that's profoundly

907
01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:03.230
true.
Now,
you know,

908
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:08.690
we all have our definitions of what constitutes sufficient proof for truth,

909
01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:11.540
but I think that's powerful.
Those are,

910
01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.840
those are two powerful arguments so that it's hard to say what the sole means

911
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:22.230
because you know,
say beyond the content,

912
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:24.720
beyond the confines of a single human being,

913
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:30.300
we do have this sense that the sore can expand itself into something that's

914
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:35.580
greater than well greater than it has been.
It has this capacity for growth.

915
01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:41.180
And we do have the sense that the soul can expand itself to the point where it's

916
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:45.300
enlightened,
for lack of a better word,

917
01:02:45.301 --> 01:02:50.301
that it's working as efficiently as possible to transform everything that's

918
01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:56.460
unnecessarily painful and malevolent about the world in two.

919
01:02:56.461 --> 01:02:59.310
What's positive and good and,
and,

920
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:03.150
and that it does that as a consequence of confronting the world with courage and

921
01:03:03.151 --> 01:03:05.400
truth.
And I think that's right.

922
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.830
And I do think that that means that the soul participates in something eternal,

923
01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:16.220
which is the attempt of being itself to transform what's unnecessarily painful

924
01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:23.070
and malevolent into what's good and that human beings actually do participate in

925
01:03:23.071 --> 01:03:23.281
that.

926
01:03:23.281 --> 01:03:28.281
And then that's part of the reason that our ancient tradition insists that were

927
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.960
made in the image of God.

928
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.920
And I think that it's a mistake to underestimate the importance of that because

929
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:43.100
I don't think that you can live life a life of sufficient profundity to protect

930
01:03:44.851 --> 01:03:49.851
yourself from being corrupted by suffering and malevolence without adopting a

931
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:56.100
responsibility that's commensurate with that set of ideas.

932
01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.080
I think that you either,

933
01:03:59.400 --> 01:03:59.940
<v 2>okay,</v>

934
01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.700
<v 1>Orient Yourself upward,
you know,</v>

935
01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:07.701
took a star above the horizon and try desperately to improve the structure of

936
01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:13.971
being or you work at counter purposes to it and make things worse.

937
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.470
I don't think there's a middle ground.

938
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:20.010
In fact to the degree there is a middle ground,

939
01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.330
it tilts towards the negative because people who try to occupy the middle
ground,

940
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:26.820
um,
try to

941
01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.990
generally try to accrue the benefit,

942
01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.320
let's say without adopting any of the risk.

943
01:04:34.321 --> 01:04:39.030
And that's not acceptable,
not helpful.

944
01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:43.230
So
that's a soul to me.

945
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:49.260
And I guess I would say one more thing about that is sold is also the center of

946
01:04:49.261 --> 01:04:50.094
the world,

947
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:55.350
which is a frightening proposition and not one that's easily comprehensible.

948
01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:58.680
Solzhenitsyn's work in the gulag.

949
01:04:58.681 --> 01:05:01.440
Archipelago is particularly enlightening in this regard

950
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:05.940
because he insisted that it was a pre

951
01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.890
preconception of our Judeo Christian heritage,

952
01:05:11.891 --> 01:05:14.440
that each person was the center of the cosmos.

953
01:05:14.441 --> 01:05:18.850
And you can think of that as a center of consciousness,
right?

954
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:24.310
Center from which being itself is not only reflected but also generated.

955
01:05:24.311 --> 01:05:29.030
And it was Solzhenitsyn's belief and Dostoyevsky's as well.

956
01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:33.250
And I think you would have been in accordance with this and Nietzsche as well

957
01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:34.721
for that matter,

958
01:05:34.721 --> 01:05:39.721
that in some manner that we don't fathom because we don't understand the

959
01:05:40.991 --> 01:05:42.640
structure of the world very well.

960
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:48.270
The outcome of the world is dependent on our choices and an equally on all of

961
01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:53.710
our choices and I don't understand.

962
01:05:53.711 --> 01:05:56.820
I know that I know that to be true are feel that to be true.

963
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:59.010
It's,

964
01:05:59.010 --> 01:06:04.010
it's part of the doctrine that each person is of intrinsic and equal worth.

965
01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:10.390
The part of that doctrine is that each person is has intrinsic and equal

966
01:06:10.391 --> 01:06:15.391
responsibility and that we're each capable of generating a fair bit of hell

967
01:06:15.791 --> 01:06:17.470
around us and for other people,

968
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.680
but also capable of generating a tremendous amount of good and that the fate of

969
01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:28.771
the world as it careens through eternity is actually a consequence of the

970
01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.110
ethical decisions of each of us.
It's a terrifying idea.

971
01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:39.670
It's no wonder that people flee from it into hedonism,
let's say,

972
01:06:39.671 --> 01:06:44.671
and and ideology because it's very frightening possibility that the choices that

973
01:06:47.981 --> 01:06:52.981
you make day to day or failed to make have this profound and lasting effect on

974
01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:59.320
the structure of reality.
But I don't really see any way out of that conclusion.

975
01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:01.053
So

976
01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:07.040
what are some practical ways to organize people interested in reinforcing

977
01:07:07.041 --> 01:07:11.900
Western values and culture without attracting extremists?
Well,

978
01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.000
that's a good question.
Um,

979
01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:18.050
reading group might not be a bad idea.
You know,

980
01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:23.110
there's lots of ways of picker classic of the Western Canon Pick Dante's inferno

981
01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:29.800
or paradise lost something difficult or maybe not or try to try something that's

982
01:07:30.051 --> 01:07:34.400
more straight forward.
I mean,
niches beyond good and evil is a difficult book,

983
01:07:34.401 --> 01:07:37.400
but it's easier than those.
The two I just mentioned.

984
01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:42.910
Start a discussion group.
Um,
start a book group that's,

985
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:45.110
that's a possibility.
Um,

986
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:51.150
live out your values properly and see how that works.
Um,

987
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:56.090
you know,
if you're organizing a,
if you have your own organization,

988
01:07:56.091 --> 01:07:58.250
your own business,
your own family for that matter,

989
01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:02.570
you try to organize it along the principles that you describe.

990
01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:06.580
Try to organize it for truth and,

991
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:11.960
and along try to organize it so that it's predicated on truth and courage and

992
01:08:13.521 --> 01:08:18.521
responsibility and the reduction of unnecessary suffering and the elimination of

993
01:08:20.391 --> 01:08:25.391
malevolence like seriously do that and see what happens to your organization.

994
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:30.170
I mean I've seen people now go into large scale organizations that were

995
01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:35.171
collapsing quite badly under the weight of accumulated sins of omission,

996
01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:37.844
let's say.

997
01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:42.970
So lies of failure to attend and to listen to everyone in the organization.

998
01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.180
These are large scale organizations to listen to everyone in the organization to

999
01:08:50.181 --> 01:08:52.430
say,
look,
I'm here to find out what the problems are.

1000
01:08:52.431 --> 01:08:56.450
You can actually tell me like a real high alpha male,
like,
you know,

1001
01:08:57.110 --> 01:09:00.710
real empathy.
You can tell me what the problems are.

1002
01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.230
I want to know what the problems are and I don't want any,

1003
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.180
I don't want it sugarcoated.

1004
01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.030
And the reason I don't want it sugarcoated this cause I want to know what the

1005
01:09:08.031 --> 01:09:08.661
problems are.

1006
01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:13.160
And the reason that I want to know is because I think that if we face them we

1007
01:09:13.161 --> 01:09:15.800
can fix them and that that would be better for everyone.

1008
01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:21.400
And then to start to gather information about what it is in the institution

1009
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.950
that's corrupt and functioning improperly and to start to set it right.

1010
01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.330
And that works.

1011
01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:33.890
And like the evidence for this I think is solid that it works.

1012
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:38.630
There's good evidence that,
um,
that was a good book,

1013
01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:39.201
for example,

1014
01:09:39.201 --> 01:09:43.310
called the wealth and poverty of nations written by a Harvard Emeritus professor

1015
01:09:43.311 --> 01:09:45.380
whose name escapes me momentarily,

1016
01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:50.381
but he talked about the unbelievably high economic value of interpersonal trust,

1017
01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.580
which I think is the most fundamental natural resource.
Um,

1018
01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:02.740
and we know too that one of the best predictors of longterm success in complex

1019
01:10:02.961 --> 01:10:06.290
organizations isn't agreeableness or compassion,

1020
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:09.140
which is the only virtue that seems to matter at the moment,

1021
01:10:09.141 --> 01:10:13.790
even though it's status is a virtue,
is highly debatable in my estimation,

1022
01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:18.380
because compassion has to be temp tempered with judgment,

1023
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:21.250
otherwise it's devouring.
Um,

1024
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:25.250
but conscientiousness is an excellent predictor of longterm success for

1025
01:10:25.251 --> 01:10:25.911
individuals.

1026
01:10:25.911 --> 01:10:30.911
And conscientious people are truthful and reliable and industrious and orderly.

1027
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.190
You know,
that that can be a problem because it,

1028
01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:36.290
it can lead to a kind of rigidity.

1029
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:38.930
So it's not the only virtue that's necessary,

1030
01:10:38.931 --> 01:10:43.931
but it does seem to be the case that honesty is a productive policy.

1031
01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.490
And I would also say that if you look around the world,

1032
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:54.800
the cultures that are the most corrupt are the cultures that are the most poor.

1033
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:56.120
And you could say,
well,

1034
01:10:56.121 --> 01:10:58.670
the reason that they're corrupt just because they're poor,

1035
01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:03.140
but I don't believe that because then you'd have to also agree that if you're

1036
01:11:03.141 --> 01:11:06.710
poor,
you're corrupt.
And I don't think that's true.

1037
01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.400
I think the corruption drives the poverty.
Now.

1038
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:14.940
There's no doubt somewhat of a feedback loop there.
But,

1039
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:20.360
um,
you get rid of corruption,
you get rid of poverty.
That's my sense.
And,

1040
01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:24.030
and like,
like I said,
you could make the opposite argument if you want.
Well,

1041
01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:26.790
poverty causes corruption while really,
so,

1042
01:11:26.791 --> 01:11:31.350
so your claim is that the poor are more corrupt because they're poor.

1043
01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:36.560
That's your fundamental claim and that the poverty is driving the corruption.

1044
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:40.890
And I'm afraid,
I don't believe that.
I don't think that the poor,

1045
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:45.240
there may be more corrupt people who are poor,

1046
01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:49.680
but that's because they're corrupt.
If you take poor people as a group,

1047
01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:51.930
people who are relatively deprived materially,

1048
01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:55.620
I don't believe that there's any evidence that they are more corrupt than people

1049
01:11:55.621 --> 01:11:58.350
who are,
uh,
more materially,

1050
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:04.990
what would you call satiated.
So,
um,

1051
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:11.230
practical ways to organize people interested in reinforcing Western values and

1052
01:12:11.231 --> 01:12:14.740
cultures.
I don't think you have to attract extremists.

1053
01:12:14.741 --> 01:12:19.300
I think that if you reinforce western values and culture,
you,

1054
01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:23.290
you,
you turn away the extremists.
I mean,

1055
01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:28.710
what sort of extremist is going to believe in personal responsibility and

1056
01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:35.290
individual culpability?
Those aren't extremist ideas there.

1057
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:39.940
They're anti extremist ideas you can't group together around the notion of

1058
01:12:39.941 --> 01:12:42.250
ultimate personal responsibility.

1059
01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:48.480
So I think to the degree that you are reinforcing genuine western values and

1060
01:12:49.721 --> 01:12:54.400
culture,
you,
you eliminate the extremists.

1061
01:12:54.401 --> 01:12:58.300
Look,
you can look at the historical record,

1062
01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:02.500
you know,
if I remember correctly,

1063
01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.420
and I believe this to be the case,

1064
01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:08.590
no two democracies have yet gone to war.

1065
01:13:08.890 --> 01:13:12.400
No To modern democracies have yet gone to war with one another.

1066
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:14.891
You know,

1067
01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:19.570
and the relationship between modern democracy and high standard of living,

1068
01:13:19.690 --> 01:13:22.920
high equality of opportunity and,

1069
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:26.500
and genuine improvements across the decades.

1070
01:13:26.501 --> 01:13:30.730
I would say is extraordinarily high.
And so I would say intrinsically,

1071
01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:36.610
if you're promoting western values,
the most fundamental values,

1072
01:13:36.611 --> 01:13:41.611
especially the doctrine of the sanctity of the individual and the associated

1073
01:13:42.911 --> 01:13:45.100
responsibilities that go along with that,

1074
01:13:45.101 --> 01:13:49.270
that that just drives the extremists away.

1075
01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.400
That's my sense of it.

1076
01:13:56.750 --> 01:14:01.750
Friendless how to find friends as traditional woman attacked by friends.

1077
01:14:01.881 --> 01:14:06.881
I loved by saying I'm not a feminist and judged saying I want kids feeling hurt

1078
01:14:07.491 --> 01:14:12.100
and confused.
Well,
that's too bad.

1079
01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:15.640
Really.
I'm,
I'm very sorry to hear that because

1080
01:14:17.770 --> 01:14:22.180
the idea that you would be judged for saying you're wanting that you want kids

1081
01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:26.230
is it's a kind of radical insanity as far as I'm concerned.

1082
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:31.500
The first thing I would suspect is that you're probably rather young,

1083
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:35.650
I could be wrong about this,
but you know,

1084
01:14:35.651 --> 01:14:40.651
we do everything we can to delude 19 2021 year old women into thinking that

1085
01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:47.890
there's something inappropriately patriarchal,
patriarchal,

1086
01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:52.480
and subordinate about wanting children.

1087
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:57.810
And so many young women are firmly convinced that the last thing they want is to

1088
01:14:58.991 --> 01:15:03.970
have children and they're not disabused of that foolish notion by their,

1089
01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:08.380
by their,
by people who should be mentoring them properly.

1090
01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:13.540
Because the truth of the matter is the vast majority of women start to realize

1091
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:17.410
in their late twenties and early thirties that there isn't anything more

1092
01:15:17.411 --> 01:15:20.770
important to them then having a family.

1093
01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:22.750
And that's how it should be.

1094
01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:26.440
That doesn't mean that their careers aren't important or that career isn't

1095
01:15:26.441 --> 01:15:30.970
important.
It means that family is more important than if you look at,

1096
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.170
I think it was the Pew Research Foundation that recently conducted a poll

1097
01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:40.530
looking at what Americans felt brought the most meaning to their life and what

1098
01:15:40.811 --> 01:15:41.800
was most important.

1099
01:15:41.801 --> 01:15:46.801
And I believe it was 76% of respondents indicated that it was family and family

1100
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.980
is more important than career.
And you know,

1101
01:15:53.981 --> 01:15:57.550
I say that someone who's the very,

1102
01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.153
um,

1103
01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:04.600
gratifying and meaningful career.

1104
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.850
I've done many things.
You know,

1105
01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:11.851
I've been a professor and a clinical psychologist and an author and many and a

1106
01:16:13.031 --> 01:16:15.250
businessman and I,
I've,

1107
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:20.490
I've been involved in an extraordinary number of high quality career level

1108
01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:25.420
pursuits as well as jobs.

1109
01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:30.850
And I found a fair share of my fair share of gratification in those cause I like

1110
01:16:30.851 --> 01:16:32.500
to work.
I'm an industrious person,

1111
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:37.300
but it's certainly the case that for me,
um,

1112
01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:42.930
my marriage and my kids have been of paramount importance and that that actually

1113
01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:50.970
becomes more true as I get older and hopefully wiser.

1114
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:56.710
And so the first thing you need to do is stop feeling guilty about it.

1115
01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:01.390
Like you're in the right,
you want to have kids more power to you.

1116
01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.340
And if people are telling you that,
you know,

1117
01:17:03.341 --> 01:17:06.580
you shouldn't bring kids into a planet like this or that you know,

1118
01:17:06.581 --> 01:17:09.160
you're adding to the carbon footprint of the world,

1119
01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:14.440
you can invite them politely to step to themselves off and allow some space for

1120
01:17:14.481 --> 01:17:16.820
some new life if they're that concerned about it.

1121
01:17:16.821 --> 01:17:21.821
It's cruel to speak to women in that manner as far as I'm concerned,

1122
01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:27.580
to leap to the conclusion that adding an additional soul to the world is going

1123
01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:32.180
to be somehow harmful when the possibility is very high.

1124
01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:35.600
That if you have a child and you raise them carefully,

1125
01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.640
that they're going to have a net positive impact on the world and that that

1126
01:17:40.670 --> 01:17:43.310
impact could be incalculably large.

1127
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.400
And so there's no,

1128
01:17:47.150 --> 01:17:52.150
there's no excuse whatsoever except a kind of vicious self,

1129
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:57.510
righteous malevolence that would drive people and maybe jealousy that would

1130
01:17:58.191 --> 01:18:03.191
drive people to insult and belittle a woman who wants to have children.

1131
01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.141
And you know,

1132
01:18:06.141 --> 01:18:11.120
the other thing you have to realize is that it's not like you're alone.
You know,

1133
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:14.780
every single one of your ancestors is going back.

1134
01:18:14.781 --> 01:18:19.110
Three and a half billion years have children.
And that's the thing.

1135
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:22.360
Wait needs to be in way it should be.

1136
01:18:22.361 --> 01:18:26.320
And it's a source of extraordinarily deep meaning in life.
Now,

1137
01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:27.820
if you're going to have children,

1138
01:18:28.210 --> 01:18:31.720
then you have the responsibility to do it responsibly,
you know,

1139
01:18:31.721 --> 01:18:34.900
and to make it a priority and to treat it as if it's important.

1140
01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:40.090
But you need to find some new friends,

1141
01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.133
I would say,

1142
01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:45.700
because these friends aren't your friends if they're

1143
01:18:47.770 --> 01:18:52.770
belittling your admirable desire to do what everyone who's participated in the

1144
01:18:57.461 --> 01:19:01.150
process of continuing life has done since the beginning of time.

1145
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:06.990
And anyone who's anti-child is confused

1146
01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:11.410
so deeply that they will,

1147
01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:16.920
that that confusion will definitely cause themselves a tremendous amount of

1148
01:19:17.321 --> 01:19:21.130
trouble in their own lives.
And the only thing that you can hope for,

1149
01:19:22.450 --> 01:19:27.450
for people who are that confused is that they sort it out and decide what's

1150
01:19:29.021 --> 01:19:34.021
important before they're too old to make the right decision.

1151
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:39.760
And the right decision is almost inevitably having children.

1152
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:42.670
You know,
I've met people who haven't,

1153
01:19:43.690 --> 01:19:45.730
and I would say

1154
01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:50.920
it's not easy for them to fill the void in their life.

1155
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:55.210
And these are often people who've had high powered careers and it'd be very

1156
01:19:55.211 --> 01:19:59.260
successful and admirable people in many regards.
But I'll tell you,

1157
01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.440
as you get older,
um,

1158
01:20:02.530 --> 01:20:07.530
that space that your family should occupy becomes more and more difficult to

1159
01:20:08.281 --> 01:20:09.790
fail.
Um,

1160
01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:14.310
you need as a person who's getting older,

1161
01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:16.470
well,
first of all,
as a younger person,

1162
01:20:16.471 --> 01:20:21.471
you need that spark of life and responsibility that having a small child brings

1163
01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:25.440
to you.
If you require that it matures you.

1164
01:20:25.441 --> 01:20:29.160
Because as soon as you have a child,
then you're no longer in the more,

1165
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:31.020
most important thing in the world.

1166
01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:36.021
And you're still sadly immature if you're the most important thing in the world.

1167
01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:40.500
And it's very difficult to get over that without having a child.

1168
01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.470
And then you need that life and responsibility that the child provides,
um,

1169
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:49.470
to bring out the best in you to,
to,

1170
01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:54.650
to grow you up and to make you awake and aware like you might be on behalf of

1171
01:20:56.791 --> 01:21:00.840
someone who's fragile and needs your support and development.

1172
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:04.170
And then as you get older,
well,

1173
01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:09.350
you need to see life continue to manifest itself in the possibility of youth and

1174
01:21:12.721 --> 01:21:16.230
the adventure that young people go on when they start a family.

1175
01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:19.720
You need to see that continuity and it,

1176
01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.660
it helps ground you in,

1177
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:26.870
in the world and gives you hope for not only for your future but for the,

1178
01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:31.860
for the future itself.
And so,

1179
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:36.960
and then with regards to saying that you're not a feminist,

1180
01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:41.830
I guess probably what I would recommend there is just stop saying that all it

1181
01:21:41.831 --> 01:21:45.270
sounds to me like is that it gets you in trouble.
I mean,

1182
01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:47.580
I think what you mean,

1183
01:21:47.581 --> 01:21:52.581
given the way that you wrote your question is that because you have some

1184
01:21:52.921 --> 01:21:55.260
traditional ideas about family,

1185
01:21:55.710 --> 01:22:00.330
it's difficult for you to reconcile that with the rhetoric of modern feminism.

1186
01:22:00.331 --> 01:22:03.540
And that's perfectly understandable because one,

1187
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:08.870
the one group that modern feminists seem to be particularly antipathetic towards

1188
01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.170
his mothers,

1189
01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:13.920
which is really quite remarkable achievement given that they're supposed to be

1190
01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:16.530
on the side of women.
But I would say

1191
01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:19.550
if you want kids,

1192
01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:25.180
you talk to people who are positively inclined to your motivation and ambition

1193
01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:33.040
and you don't discuss it with people who are inclined to put you down and

1194
01:22:33.771 --> 01:22:37.520
denigrate that because they're deceiving themselves.

1195
01:22:37.730 --> 01:22:41.150
They're acting cruelly and they're doing no one any favors.

1196
01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.880
Least of all themselves and certainly not you.

1197
01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:49.360
So you carefully find people who are willing to support you in your desire and

1198
01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:54.380
more power to you as far as I'm concerned.

1199
01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.850
So it's a very courageous thing to bring a child into the world,
you know,

1200
01:22:59.150 --> 01:23:04.150
and then it's a very responsible thing to do it properly and you can't grow up,

1201
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:06.550
do,

1202
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:11.550
you won't grow up and take your place in the world properly until you do that.

1203
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:16.310
And
you know,

1204
01:23:16.311 --> 01:23:21.311
it's certainly possible to that the people that are attacking you are even

1205
01:23:22.311 --> 01:23:25.460
unwilling to come to terms with their own internal desires.

1206
01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:26.810
That would be my guess.

1207
01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:31.820
They're denying something that's they regard as inappropriate board subordinate

1208
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:35.490
as I said for,
for uh,

1209
01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:40.760
ideological reasons that to have a child is to damage the world.

1210
01:23:40.761 --> 01:23:42.350
That would be one part of it.

1211
01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:47.120
Or to subordinate yourself to the oppressive patriarchy.

1212
01:23:47.121 --> 01:23:48.260
That would be another part of it.

1213
01:23:48.261 --> 01:23:53.261
And that no alert and we'll woman would dare to have that as an ambition.

1214
01:23:53.631 --> 01:23:58.400
But that's so shallow and so superficial,
all of that.

1215
01:23:58.401 --> 01:24:00.800
And so self damaging,
you know,

1216
01:24:00.801 --> 01:24:05.801
because there isn't that many things that you have to do in life that will

1217
01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:11.320
sustain you in life in a necessary manner and having a family is definitely one

1218
01:24:13.911 --> 01:24:17.840
of those.
It's maybe half of your life.
It might be more than that,

1219
01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.130
but it's definitely at least half your life.
He figured intimate relationship,

1220
01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.540
that's a big part of your life,

1221
01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:28.370
your career in the useful things and productive things that you do outside.

1222
01:24:28.371 --> 01:24:31.280
That's another part,
but fundamentally,

1223
01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.820
fundamentally it's family.

1224
01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:42.933
<v 0>Okay,</v>

1225
01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:49.360
<v 1>Paula,
how do I stop emotional eating?</v>

1226
01:24:50.110 --> 01:24:53.980
I am prone to addictive behavior,
makes me feel in control.

1227
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:57.670
I would appreciate your thoughts on this.
Look,
Paul,

1228
01:24:57.730 --> 01:25:02.730
the first thing that I would suggest is that you probably eat because it makes

1229
01:25:03.011 --> 01:25:05.800
you feel better.
I mean physically,

1230
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:10.000
so lots of times I've had clients,

1231
01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:12.850
this has happened endless numbers of times.

1232
01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:17.940
I've seen it where people are extremely anxious and nervous and they eat

1233
01:25:18.341 --> 01:25:22.540
something and they feel way better and the reason they feel better is because

1234
01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:26.110
while they've either not beating,
eating enough or they're eating wrong,

1235
01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:29.080
now I constantly recommend it to my clients.

1236
01:25:29.081 --> 01:25:32.500
If they were arguing with their spouses.
Uh,

1237
01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:35.890
and this is something I could generally recommend everyone that's out there.
If,

1238
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:40.180
if the two of you are involved in a particularly stupid argument,

1239
01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:44.650
then um,
break and have something to eat,

1240
01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:50.100
have some cheese,
have some,
have something that's protein and fat heavy,
um,

1241
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:55.360
like a snack and wait 10 minutes and then talk again and see you.

1242
01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:59.410
You might find that you're endlessly more reasonable.

1243
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:04.220
And so I would also say generally speaking,
Paula,

1244
01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:10.700
you should eat a fat and protein heavy breakfast and a lot of it probably more

1245
01:26:10.701 --> 01:26:15.590
than you want,
probably more than you would feel comfortable with.

1246
01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:21.650
It's the most important meal of the day and it's possible that you're

1247
01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:26.780
dysregulated psychophysiologic Lee so that if you get stressed,

1248
01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:30.980
your body over produces insulin and takes all the blood sugar out of your,

1249
01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:36.210
out of your blood system and that makes you anxious and,

1250
01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.770
and irritable and makes it difficult for you to think.

1251
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.070
And then if you eat something,
and it could be something sweet,

1252
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:46.700
although I wouldn't recommend that because it's a bad medium to longterm

1253
01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:51.050
solution.
If you eat something,
you probably feel way better,

1254
01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.150
like literally not psychologically.

1255
01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.960
So the trick there is to eat a big breakfast and then not allow yourself to get

1256
01:26:59.571 --> 01:27:03.830
hungry during the day,
you know?
Um,
so eat three meals,

1257
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:08.090
make them a decent size and if you need to carry a snack or something like that,

1258
01:27:08.091 --> 01:27:12.830
nuts are really useful,
can be really useful if you can tolerate them

1259
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:18.780
or something like beef Jerky,
which I think is actually better.
Um,

1260
01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:22.610
so try that,

1261
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:27.230
try eating a big breakfast and then try not letting yourself get hungry and see

1262
01:27:27.231 --> 01:27:30.440
if that so called emotional eating decreases.

1263
01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:35.560
Now what you could do along with that is see to what degree you can decrease

1264
01:27:37.551 --> 01:27:42.551
your intake of carbohydrates and sugar because that may be causing you a lot of

1265
01:27:42.951 --> 01:27:43.430
trouble.

1266
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:48.430
And I would say if you are inclined to eat emotionally,

1267
01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:54.140
don't eat carbohydrates and sugar because it'll fix it temporarily,

1268
01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.370
but it'll make it worse like an hour later.
So,

1269
01:27:59.090 --> 01:27:59.923
um,

1270
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:05.210
assume a problem with eating habit before you're assuming a psychological

1271
01:28:05.211 --> 01:28:06.830
problem.
So

1272
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:20.660
I'm a silicon valley founder and find that whatever happens here happens

1273
01:28:20.661 --> 01:28:25.190
elsewhere fast.
What can we do and you do to stop identity politics here?

1274
01:28:27.050 --> 01:28:31.280
Well,
don't play the identity politics game,

1275
01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:37.370
no diversity initiatives,
no inclusivity initiatives,

1276
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:40.880
no equity initiatives,
no quota,

1277
01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:44.240
no discussion of systemic racism,

1278
01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:49.780
none of the tropes that are associated with a politically with the radical

1279
01:28:50.511 --> 01:28:54.560
political left because to the degree that you let any of that into your

1280
01:28:54.561 --> 01:28:55.341
organization,

1281
01:28:55.341 --> 01:29:00.341
you let it all in and so hire on the basis of competence using objective tests

1282
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:05.910
and let the cards fall where they are going to.

1283
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:11.280
And don't be afraid to tell people that that's what you're doing.

1284
01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:16.380
Wash your HR department carefully and make sure that they're not pushing

1285
01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:19.680
diversity,
inclusivity and equity initiatives,

1286
01:29:19.681 --> 01:29:22.620
that they're not requiring people to take.

1287
01:29:22.621 --> 01:29:27.420
Implicit Association tests that hypothetically revealed their unconscious bias,

1288
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:32.130
that they're not doing seminars on systemic racism and prejudice and then

1289
01:29:32.131 --> 01:29:35.940
they're not making the assumption that unequal outcomes,

1290
01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:40.260
let's say in terms of hiring in the stem fields or in terms of employment in the

1291
01:29:40.261 --> 01:29:43.410
stem fields,
which by the way are radically over estimated if you,

1292
01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:48.720
unless you gerrymander what constitutes the definition of a stem discipline?

1293
01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:50.160
You just have to,

1294
01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:55.110
you have to not participate in any of that and you have to make it known to your

1295
01:29:55.111 --> 01:29:58.140
peers,
which who would be others?
Silicon valley founders,

1296
01:29:58.141 --> 01:30:00.990
I would presume that you're not doing any of that.

1297
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.960
And so that's the,

1298
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:09.590
that's the best advice that I have is don't start playing the game and really

1299
01:30:10.681 --> 01:30:15.681
keep an eye on your HR people because that's their new pathway to unearned power

1300
01:30:17.701 --> 01:30:21.750
and influence and not have an appropriate sort.

1301
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:24.840
So you know,

1302
01:30:24.841 --> 01:30:28.110
you might think as well what your values are.

1303
01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:32.970
I don't mean in a mission statement sort of way because I tend to think that

1304
01:30:32.971 --> 01:30:33.804
that's often

1305
01:30:35.610 --> 01:30:39.540
casual to the point of virtue signaling.
But you know,

1306
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:45.000
you need to think through what sort of organization that you want to have and

1307
01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:50.060
what the principles are going to be and make those clear as an alternative story

1308
01:30:50.371 --> 01:30:54.390
to the diversity,
inclusivity and equity rhetoric.

1309
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:57.630
So that's what I would recommend.

1310
01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:21.133
Dan.

1311
01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:26.240
I habitually procrastinate on important tasks,

1312
01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:30.230
CV writing for example,
for months on end,
waiting for the right time.

1313
01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:34.270
It is severely holding me back.
How do avoid this?
Well,

1314
01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:38.810
like covered that in chapter four and 12 rules for life.
So you could read that,

1315
01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.530
that would help it's call,

1316
01:31:40.531 --> 01:31:45.530
compare yourself to who you were yesterday instead of who someone else's today.

1317
01:31:46.730 --> 01:31:51.440
Um,
look,
if you're procrastinating on your CV writing,

1318
01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:56.900
then you're biting off more than you can chew.

1319
01:31:56.901 --> 01:32:01.840
And I would say to some degree,
it's a,
and I don't mean this in a pejorative way,

1320
01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.840
it's a reflection of a lack of humility.

1321
01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:10.680
You think you're capable of taking on larger tasks than you actually are.

1322
01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:13.270
And the proof of that is in what you said,

1323
01:32:13.271 --> 01:32:16.480
do you take on these large tasks and then you don't complete them.

1324
01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:20.980
So obviously you're not capable of taking on the large tasks and completing
them.

1325
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.650
So with regards to CV writing,

1326
01:32:24.170 --> 01:32:28.990
you have to sit down and negotiate with yourself.
You have to ask yourself like,

1327
01:32:29.050 --> 01:32:30.190
seriously,
okay,

1328
01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:35.490
I need to do something about this CV.
Um,

1329
01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:38.470
I need to at least start it.

1330
01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:41.470
Cause obviously you're not going to finish it unless you start it.

1331
01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:44.290
And then you have to ask yourself,

1332
01:32:44.291 --> 01:32:48.820
like you're asking someone that you don't know and that you can't negotiate with

1333
01:32:48.821 --> 01:32:52.390
very well what you might be willing to do.
Like,

1334
01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:56.380
so if you come to see a behavior therapist and,
and the problem was,

1335
01:32:56.381 --> 01:33:00.190
well I can't get started on my CV,
the therapist might say,

1336
01:33:00.191 --> 01:33:03.100
well why don't you just bring your CV next week and we'll take a look at it.

1337
01:33:03.101 --> 01:33:05.680
Just,
just,
uh,
you know,

1338
01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.280
bring it in rough form,
don't,

1339
01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:12.480
all you have to do is download downloading on disk or email it and then the

1340
01:33:12.481 --> 01:33:14.130
person may or may not do that.

1341
01:33:14.131 --> 01:33:16.910
And if they don't do it well then you have to find out,
Huh.

1342
01:33:17.730 --> 01:33:19.110
Then you may have to say,
okay,

1343
01:33:19.111 --> 01:33:24.060
well I noticed you didn't email me your CV to me this week.
So how about this?

1344
01:33:24.061 --> 01:33:29.061
How about we make an appointment by phone tomorrow at 10 30 and all phone you or

1345
01:33:31.321 --> 01:33:36.321
you phoned me and you'll be on your computer and you'll go through your files

1346
01:33:37.051 --> 01:33:41.850
with me and then you'll email me the CV.
Do you think you can do that?

1347
01:33:42.630 --> 01:33:45.360
And then usually people will manage that,

1348
01:33:45.361 --> 01:33:48.540
but maybe they come back to next week and they haven't even done that.

1349
01:33:48.541 --> 01:33:52.110
And so then you say,
well look,
why don't next week,

1350
01:33:52.111 --> 01:33:57.111
why don't you bring your computer or your disc and we'll go through it together

1351
01:33:57.661 --> 01:34:02.550
and find your CV and bring it up on screen and just take a look at it.

1352
01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:03.301
You know,

1353
01:34:03.301 --> 01:34:07.740
because actually a CV is quite a daunting thing to work on because it's your

1354
01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.010
whole past and your whole future.
And so it's a pretty big dragon.

1355
01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:15.960
The trick is to find a piece of the

1356
01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:22.540
solution that you would be willing to engage in that you would actually do.

1357
01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:25.610
And so,
you know,

1358
01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:30.940
I might also recommend to one of my clients that all they do is go onto their

1359
01:34:31.221 --> 01:34:36.221
computer and find out which folder their CV is in and open it.

1360
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:42.170
Just open the file or sorry,
open the folder.
And then if they,

1361
01:34:42.230 --> 01:34:46.730
that'd be one day's work has just go open the folder and then maybe the next day

1362
01:34:46.731 --> 01:34:50.630
as well,
drag the file onto your desktop so it's there.

1363
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:54.290
And then maybe the next day's job to be just open it,

1364
01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:59.120
just open it and just like glanced at the first page and then close it.

1365
01:34:59.850 --> 01:35:02.150
And I know this seems ridiculous because you'd think,
well,

1366
01:35:02.151 --> 01:35:05.780
I'm an adult and I should be able to do more than that.
And maybe you can,

1367
01:35:05.781 --> 01:35:10.220
but sounds like you can't.
So you have to start where you can start.

1368
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:13.970
And I also recommend to my clients that once they make themselves a deal about

1369
01:35:13.971 --> 01:35:17.900
what they're going to do,
they stick to it.
So if the deal is,
well,

1370
01:35:17.901 --> 01:35:22.901
I'm just going to drag the file with my CV in it onto my desktop,

1371
01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.440
and that's Today's task,
I'm not going to open and start working on it.

1372
01:35:27.441 --> 01:35:29.240
Because once you make a deal with yourself,

1373
01:35:29.241 --> 01:35:32.990
especially with regards to something you're afraid of and you're avoiding,

1374
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:38.350
if you push yourself farther than what you've negotiated with yourself,

1375
01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:39.500
honestly,

1376
01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:43.580
then you'll find that you won't get back to the work because you don't trust

1377
01:35:43.581 --> 01:35:47.570
your negotiating abilities anymore.
You don't trust yourself.

1378
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:52.220
So if the deal is you drag the file onto the desktop and that's today's job.

1379
01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:55.370
And that's a lot better because it's more than you've done for two months.

1380
01:35:55.371 --> 01:35:58.400
Then you give yourself a pat on the back and you say,
look,
good enough man.

1381
01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:03.640
Like it's no big active heroism that I can go out and shout about in the street,

1382
01:36:05.241 --> 01:36:08.450
but I'm farther ahead than I was and then,

1383
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:13.490
well then maybe the next day's task as well.
Read it,

1384
01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:17.060
just read it.
Just familiarize yourself with it again,

1385
01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:21.590
close it good enough.
Then you can think that night,
well where are the holes?

1386
01:36:21.591 --> 01:36:26.000
What needs to be updated?
Then the next thing might be to do to say,
well,

1387
01:36:26.001 --> 01:36:30.920
here's a list of 20 things that might need to be done with this CV and you know,

1388
01:36:30.921 --> 01:36:32.450
they don't all have to be that accurate,

1389
01:36:32.451 --> 01:36:35.600
but you might have some sense of what it needs,
what needs to be updated,

1390
01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:40.100
where the holes are and you know where it ends and what you'd have to do to get

1391
01:36:40.101 --> 01:36:44.540
the information necessary to update it and that that's a good time to talk to

1392
01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:45.560
someone else about it too.

1393
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:49.880
And then you can rank order those 20 things in terms of the probability that

1394
01:36:49.881 --> 01:36:53.730
you'll do them at the same way.
Break them down into small sub tasks and,

1395
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:58.430
and maybe you can only work on it for 10 minutes a day cause it stresses you out

1396
01:36:58.431 --> 01:37:02.690
so badly.
God only knows what's hiding behind your fear of your CV.
You know,

1397
01:37:02.691 --> 01:37:05.270
you might be embarrassed about your past accomplishments.

1398
01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:10.250
You might be unwilling to do the work because your CV hasn't been updated for a

1399
01:37:10.251 --> 01:37:11.210
long period of time.

1400
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:16.390
There might be holes in your CV that you don't know how to account for you.

1401
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:21.380
Reading your CV might make you realize that you're in the wrong job.

1402
01:37:21.381 --> 01:37:25.370
That might bring up the specter of having to look for new employment.
Um,

1403
01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:30.650
you know,
a CV is a real monster because it's a record of your life and uh,

1404
01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:35.090
and a guide to your future ambitions.
So if you happen to be afraid of it,
well,

1405
01:37:35.150 --> 01:37:38.720
you should take it seriously.
It's not just a piece of paper,
it's a real dragon.

1406
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:43.130
And so then you face it to the degree that you can face it.

1407
01:37:43.131 --> 01:37:47.120
And you break it down to steps,
you break it down,

1408
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:51.800
you break down the steps that are necessary until they're so small that even

1409
01:37:51.801 --> 01:37:55.800
someone as avoidant as you is likely to make progress,

1410
01:37:56.490 --> 01:38:01.490
and then you find your natural speed of advancement and perhaps over a month you

1411
01:38:02.461 --> 01:38:06.570
can put your CV together and then congratulations to you because it's a hard

1412
01:38:06.571 --> 01:38:08.040
thing.
And you know,

1413
01:38:08.041 --> 01:38:12.330
you'll find too that a law or the lot of fears are associated with that.
Like,

1414
01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.810
oh no,
now I'm going to,
if I finish this,
I'm going to have to send it out.

1415
01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:18.810
And if I'm going to send it out,
I'm going to have to look for another job.

1416
01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:21.120
And if I'm going to look for another job,
I'm going to have to move.

1417
01:38:21.121 --> 01:38:23.520
And who knows what that'll do to my relationship.

1418
01:38:23.521 --> 01:38:27.450
And who knows if anybody wants to hire me and God only knows if I'll be

1419
01:38:27.451 --> 01:38:29.130
successful in my new career.

1420
01:38:29.131 --> 01:38:34.131
And so there can be a tremendous number of subordinate fears associated with

1421
01:38:35.551 --> 01:38:39.030
something as simple as,
oh,
I need to update my CV,

1422
01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:42.630
which is a really easy thing to say,
but a very difficult thing to do.

1423
01:38:42.631 --> 01:38:46.200
So I would say have a little bit of compassion for yourself,

1424
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:51.350
like not enough so that it stops you from moving forward or gives you an excuse,

1425
01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:57.260
but do decompose the problem into small elements that you can handle and be

1426
01:39:00.211 --> 01:39:05.211
humble enough not to be too irritated at yourself when you find out just how

1427
01:39:06.010 --> 01:39:11.010
small those pieces have to be in order for you to successfully mastered them.

1428
01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:22.460
And I think that's where I'm going to stop guys.
I'm,

1429
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:26.510
I'm out of intelligent things to say,
I would say,

1430
01:39:26.511 --> 01:39:28.500
and starting to get somewhat tired.

1431
01:39:28.700 --> 01:39:33.500
There's a lot of extremely sophisticated and complicated questions here that I'd

1432
01:39:33.501 --> 01:39:37.430
like to continue answering,
but,
um,

1433
01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:43.480
not today.
And so thank you very much for tuning in.

1434
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:47.710
Um,
if you're in London,
UK,

1435
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:51.580
you might think about coming to my talk at the Apollo on May 8th,

1436
01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:55.750
I'm going to be at Oxford,
um,
around then too.

1437
01:39:56.290 --> 01:40:00.610
And I don't know if I'll be giving a talk then that's still in negotiation,

1438
01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:03.850
but I'll definitely be at the Apollo.
As I said,

1439
01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:07.990
my paperback is coming out in the UK in early May,

1440
01:40:08.530 --> 01:40:10.270
so that's exciting.

1441
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:15.720
I'm signing a bunch of front pages for the paperback.
Um,

1442
01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:20.200
we're still planning a European tour in September.

1443
01:40:20.770 --> 01:40:25.760
That'll be announced relatively soon if we can get all the details straight.
Um,

1444
01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.830
and I'll see those of you who are coming to see me in New York,

1445
01:40:29.831 --> 01:40:31.810
I'll see you in April.

1446
01:40:31.811 --> 01:40:36.811
And also at this level is GG debate in Toronto on the 19th.

1447
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:42.340
And so thank you very much for your continued support and for tuning into the Q

1448
01:40:42.341 --> 01:40:42.760
and.
A.

1449
01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:47.760
And it was a pleasure to answer your questions and have the opportunity to talk

1450
01:40:48.791 --> 01:40:53.791
about serious issues in it in a careful and thoughtful

1451
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:58.360
<v 0>manner with all of you.
So good night.</v>
