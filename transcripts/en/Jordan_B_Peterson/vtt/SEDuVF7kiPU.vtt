1
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.353
<v Speaker 1>Yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some of you may have heard about the </v>

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Google memo that has been circulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>virally around the Internet for the last</v>

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.943
<v Speaker 1>couple of days that was written by James</v>
<v Speaker 1>Demore who was fired for it last night </v>

4
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.403
<v Speaker 1>and a colleague of his reached out to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put us together and so I'm going to </v>

5
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:28.821
<v Speaker 1>talk to James today about exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and why and perhaps what should</v>

6
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>be done about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll.</v>

7
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The interview I had with him,</v>

8
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>which finished at about 3:00 on Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>August eighth.</v>

9
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Follows immediately after this </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction.</v>

10
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Hi everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking today with James Demore and</v>

11
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>an unidentified google employee who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wishes to remain anonymous.</v>

12
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.953
<v Speaker 1>Reasons that I think are obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And James last week put his hand in a </v>

13
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:06.774
<v Speaker 1>blender by circulating an internal memo </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would say has become somewhat </v>

14
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>infamous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So James,</v>

15
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:14.064
<v Speaker 1>let's start with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start with a bit of discussion </v>

16
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>about you tell us who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about your background and about what you</v>

17
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 1>were doing at Google.</v>

18
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.920
<v Speaker 2>So I was actually just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

20
00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:27.754
<v Speaker 2>I really interested in science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and stuff and then I really </v>

21
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 2>liked puzzles and that's how I got into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Google.</v>

22
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Actually I did one of their coding </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitions,</v>

23
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 2>they just recruited me out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I Google,</v>

24
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I was mostly working on search and image</v>
<v Speaker 2>and video searches.</v>

25
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.713
<v Speaker 1>So what's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell us about your educational </v>

26
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:50.614
<v Speaker 1>background a bit.</v>

27
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:53.514
<v Speaker 2>So I just did a random science and math </v>
<v Speaker 2>and undergrad and I ended up with a </v>

29
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:00.564
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really know what I was gonna </v>

30
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.273
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started doing research at Mit and </v>

31
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:10.401
<v Speaker 2>then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to a systems biology at Harvard.</v>

32
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I initially wanted to work with Martin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nowak.</v>

33
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.070
<v Speaker 2>He's really great in evolution and Game </v>
<v Speaker 2>Theory.</v>

34
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I started working on other things.</v>

35
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>So tell us a bit of road systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology.</v>

36
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that exactly?</v>

37
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>What kind of research were you doing?</v>

38
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.683
<v Speaker 2>So systems biology has many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>meanings but it's generally just </v>

40
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.003
<v Speaker 2>mathematical biology and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess seeing biological systems as a </v>

41
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:44.500
<v Speaker 2>whole rather than just individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>molecules.</v>

42
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.600
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked looking at populations and so my</v>

43
00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:50.770
<v Speaker 2>interest in evolution.</v>

44
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>So why did that make you a viable </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate at Google?</v>

45
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.373
<v Speaker 1>It's eight.</v>

46
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.513
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they just saw a smart guy that </v>

47
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.003
<v Speaker 2>could code.</v>

48
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Now you've been there three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that correct?</v>

49
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>But also as an intern before that?</v>

50
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So about four years total.</v>

51
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.453
<v Speaker 1>And so how would you say you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>performed as an employee and Google and </v>

52
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>people being happy with you or have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>been here?</v>

53
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

54
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.600
<v Speaker 2>I got promoted twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My last review was a,</v>

55
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 2>the highest possible to per which is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>top two percentile.</v>

56
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 2>So it definitely wasn't based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance if they fire me.</v>

57
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Have you enjoyed working at Google as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a good experience?</v>

58
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Google.</v>

59
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 2>That's horrible part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've always been the biggest Google</v>

60
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 2>fanboy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all like I've never had an iphone.</v>

61
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.573
<v Speaker 2>I've always tried to convince my friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use android and all of these </v>

62
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:54.320
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

63
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is just puts a sour taste in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mouth.</v>

64
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

65
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>so you've got a good educational </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

66
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>You were interested in things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google would be interested in.</v>

67
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.713
<v Speaker 1>Your good coder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've worked with him for a number of </v>

68
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:07.624
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done an excellent job and you're </v>

69
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 1>pretty pro google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the background.</v>

70
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now last week you wrote a memo which has</v>

71
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>attracted a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and in that memo you,</v>

72
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>you made a number of claims and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>claims were,</v>

73
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>and please correct me if I've got this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not summarizing this property,</v>

74
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.433
<v Speaker 1>you were attempting to describe reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>why there might be a lack of gender </v>

75
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:37.550
<v Speaker 1>parody might exist within Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

76
00:04:37.551 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 1>and with an NGO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering or broadly,</v>

77
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:42.540
<v Speaker 1>but also in occupations more broadly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

78
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.883
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you laid out a very elaborated document </v>

79
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 1>and I reviewed it and as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

80
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.990
<v Speaker 1>your opinions are well supported by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant psychological science.</v>

81
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think what I'll do in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of this video when I link it</v>

82
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>is putting the references so then people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can decide for themselves.</v>

83
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to put up a webpage about gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in general,</v>

84
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 1>but I'll try to hit the highlights for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular document.</v>

85
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>So why did you do this?</v>

86
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so about a month and a half ago I went </v>

87
00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:19.814
<v Speaker 2>to one of our diversity summits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of it on recorded and super secret </v>

88
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 2>and they told me a lot of things that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought just were not right.</v>

89
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.673
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean unrecorded and super </v>

90
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:34.104
<v Speaker 1>secret?</v>

91
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.633
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were telling us about a lot </v>

92
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:37.824
<v Speaker 2>of these potentially illegal practices </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they've been doing to try to </v>

93
00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:45.030
<v Speaker 2>increase diversity and</v>

94
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.980
<v Speaker 1>what kinds of practices?</v>

95
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.463
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well basically treating people </v>

96
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.000
<v Speaker 2>differently based on what their race or </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender are.</v>

97
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

98
00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

99
00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.163
<v Speaker 1>I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was ultra secret and unrecorded </v>

100
00:06:00.901 --> 00:06:01.734
<v Speaker 1>and in what manner?</v>

101
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

102
00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:06.160
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most meetings I Google,</v>

103
00:06:06.161 --> 00:06:06.994
<v Speaker 2>I recorded anyone at Google watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to be really open about </v>

104
00:06:10.331 --> 00:06:11.164
<v Speaker 2>everything except for this now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want any paper trail for any </v>

105
00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:16.450
<v Speaker 2>of these things.</v>

106
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

107
00:06:17.371 --> 00:06:18.204
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

108
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Because I think it's illegal and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>as some of the internal polls showed,</v>

109
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.513
<v Speaker 2>there were a large percent of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that agreed with me on the document and </v>

110
00:06:29.971 --> 00:06:30.804
<v Speaker 2>so if everyone got to see this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they would really bring up some </v>

111
00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:38.214
<v Speaker 2>criticism,</v>

112
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:39.723
<v Speaker 1>a large number of people in Google and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very large number of well-informed </v>

113
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.333
<v Speaker 1>biological scientists we might also add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was quite struck by your document </v>

114
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.120
<v Speaker 1>given that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

115
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.093
<v Speaker 1>it would have been at a decent document </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a well informed psychologists </v>

116
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.410
<v Speaker 1>research psychologist to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

117
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>But it was somewhat of an outsider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got the,</v>

118
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>you got the highlights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Accurate as far as I'm concerned.</v>

119
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

120
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:04.304
<v Speaker 1>So you went to this diversity meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you weren't happy with the sorts of </v>

121
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:10.920
<v Speaker 1>things that you were being told and with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the practices are,</v>

122
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 1>is that both correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 1>And what we're being told.</v>

124
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

125
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.113
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of ways in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>they pressure people to increase the </v>

126
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:25.424
<v Speaker 2>diversity of their team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now there's no way to do that </v>

127
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 2>besides actually choosing someone based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on their race or gender.</v>

128
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:33.164
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

129
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely.</v>

130
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.073
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am more women or underrepresented </v>

131
00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:44.010
<v Speaker 2>racial minorities.</v>

132
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 3>Can I jump in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

133
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

134
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.970
<v Speaker 3>I would hesitate to say that that's 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent true.</v>

135
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.410
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the organization that I'm in,</v>

136
00:07:56.411 --> 00:08:01.090
<v Speaker 3>I have not personally seen anything that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would deem crossed the line,</v>

137
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I personally believe that there are a </v>

138
00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:07.960
<v Speaker 3>good amount of synergies to be found if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can combine,</v>

139
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.183
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly different ideologies into a </v>

140
00:08:11.831 --> 00:08:12.664
<v Speaker 3>room and that is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thesis that some groups are working </v>

141
00:08:16.241 --> 00:08:17.260
<v Speaker 3>towards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

142
00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:18.094
<v Speaker 3>obviously there's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>distribution of how people follow the </v>

143
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 3>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

144
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.670
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unfortunate to hear that it's,</v>

145
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be that some people fall to the</v>

146
00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:33.640
<v Speaker 3>wrong side of that distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that certainly wouldn't,</v>

147
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.140
<v Speaker 3>it would not apply to everybody.</v>

148
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.523
<v Speaker 1>Certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly also distressing to hear </v>

149
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.563
<v Speaker 1>that there is acceptance of the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that diversity can be mapped onto race </v>

150
00:08:44.371 --> 00:08:45.204
<v Speaker 1>and gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to performance </v>

151
00:08:46.801 --> 00:08:49.200
<v Speaker 1>because there's no evidence for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

152
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.071
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

153
00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:54.990
<v Speaker 1>so you went to this meeting and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to write this document and um,</v>

154
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 1>how long had you been working on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>before he released it?</v>

155
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was doing it throughout my free </v>

156
00:09:03.021 --> 00:09:04.190
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

157
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.013
<v Speaker 2>and I just wanted to clarify my thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this and I really just want it to be </v>

158
00:09:08.841 --> 00:09:10.660
<v Speaker 2>proven wrong because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

159
00:09:10.661 --> 00:09:11.494
<v Speaker 2>if what I was saying was right then </v>
<v Speaker 2>something bad is happening and so about </v>

160
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.690
<v Speaker 2>a month ago I submitted it to feed back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that program and you know,</v>

161
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.260
<v Speaker 2>I saw that people looked at it but no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one actually said anything.</v>

162
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.400
<v Speaker 1>And what did you submit?</v>

163
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:28.603
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I basically said what I said in </v>

164
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the document and then I linked to the</v>

165
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 2>document itself and so I actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>published this about a month ago</v>

166
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.613
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

167
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.493
<v Speaker 2>it was only after it got viral and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>we to the news that Google started </v>

168
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:46.284
<v Speaker 2>carrying,</v>

169
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.300
<v Speaker 1>how did it go viral and how was it </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaked?</v>

170
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

171
00:09:53.661 --> 00:09:57.800
<v Speaker 2>there is a group at Google called </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptics and so I was like,</v>

172
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.903
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they'll be able to prove me wrong </v>

173
00:10:00.561 --> 00:10:02.690
<v Speaker 2>in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're skeptical about things,</v>

174
00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:05.240
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't naive I guess,</v>

175
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.810
<v Speaker 2>and so I sent them a message like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

176
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.673
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Google in some sort of echo chamber </v>

177
00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:14.540
<v Speaker 2>or I'm crying and echo chamber</v>

178
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.293
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

179
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.830
<v Speaker 2>and then it just exploded after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

180
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 2>our internal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

181
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.790
<v Speaker 2>It was just spread throughout all </v>
<v Speaker 2>google.</v>

182
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Do you and do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it the,</v>

183
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.970
<v Speaker 1>was it the skeptic's group that started </v>
<v Speaker 1>to spread it around?</v>

184
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then</v>

185
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.480
<v Speaker 2>there were a lot of upper management </v>
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

186
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:39.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically called it out and started </v>

187
00:10:41.571 --> 00:10:45.050
<v Speaker 2>saying how harmful it is and how is </v>
<v Speaker 2>unacceptable.</v>

188
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.950
<v Speaker 2>This sort of viewpoint is not allowed at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google.</v>

189
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of viewpoint?</v>

190
00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:51.184
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the idea that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between men and women that </v>

191
00:10:53.801 --> 00:10:56.210
<v Speaker 1>actually might play a role in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

192
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.170
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

193
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.060
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

194
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.480
<v Speaker 1>in the corporate world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an opinion that's not acceptable.</v>

195
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems a,</v>

196
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.013
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understandably it is just these issues </v>

197
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:09.794
<v Speaker 1>are tricky morally and politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thing that was disturbing to me </v>

198
00:11:14.001 --> 00:11:17.900
<v Speaker 1>about watching the response to you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as far as I can tell,</v>

199
00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:19.880
<v Speaker 1>there isn't anything that you said in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that paper.</v>

200
00:11:19.881 --> 00:11:20.714
<v Speaker 1>First of all that is in fact biased in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner that should open you up to </v>

201
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:25.124
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of charges that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>opened up against you or that violates </v>

202
00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:30.860
<v Speaker 1>the scientific literature as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently stands.</v>

203
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.950
<v Speaker 1>So both of those are rather distressing.</v>

204
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of misrepresentation </v>

205
00:11:38.661 --> 00:11:42.050
<v Speaker 2>by upper management just to silence me I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

206
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

207
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.023
<v Speaker 1>You think like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it the Google couldn't have </v>

208
00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:47.374
<v Speaker 1>actually you think that Google couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have come out and have an intelligent </v>

209
00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:52.660
<v Speaker 1>discussion about this instead of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all,</v>

210
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 1>releasing like Danny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read Danielle Brown's response to you,</v>

211
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling.</v>

212
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 1>It was formed and the following and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fired you,</v>

213
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be like really bad pr </v>
<v Speaker 1>move,</v>

214
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly doesn't actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with the issues at hand.</v>

215
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're basically saying something like,</v>

216
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the rationale for firing you?</v>

217
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what was the excuse that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>given?</v>

218
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.490
<v Speaker 2>So the official case was that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>perpetuating gender stereotypes</v>

219
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.350
<v Speaker 1>that you were perpetuating gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes?</v>

220
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And did they say anything else about </v>

221
00:12:25.141 --> 00:12:27.540
<v Speaker 1>your performance or about anything else </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'd done?</v>

222
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

223
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.600
<v Speaker 2>that was the only reason.</v>

224
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.760
<v Speaker 1>And who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

225
00:12:32.761 --> 00:12:34.470
<v Speaker 1>who fired you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically?</v>

226
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.293
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was my hr representative and my </v>

227
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:40.653
<v Speaker 2>director.</v>

228
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you end,</v>

229
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.343
<v Speaker 1>do you have any idea on who's ordered </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were acting or if this was </v>

230
00:12:47.431 --> 00:12:50.030
<v Speaker 1>something that they conjured up </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves or.</v>

231
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.673
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I probably went from higher up </v>

232
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.380
<v Speaker 2>than that because I missed a huge pr </v>
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>

233
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.570
<v Speaker 2>So they would need approval from higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>ups.</v>

234
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the CEO,</v>

235
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.940
<v Speaker 1>the CEO actually made some comments </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the issue today,</v>

236
00:13:07.941 --> 00:13:10.310
<v Speaker 1>which I'll probably cut into this video </v>
<v Speaker 1>as we,</v>

237
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.340
<v Speaker 1>as I edited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

238
00:13:13.341 --> 00:13:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

239
00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:18.110
<v Speaker 1>So the first question is how are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>

240
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.053
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I there's a lot of messages that I'm </v>

241
00:13:23.731 --> 00:13:28.410
<v Speaker 2>trying to sort through and just trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out what I should do now,</v>

242
00:13:28.411 --> 00:13:29.244
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

243
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.953
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been given some interesting job </v>

244
00:13:32.221 --> 00:13:33.710
<v Speaker 1>offers as far as I know.</v>

245
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten a surprising amount as part.</v>

246
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

247
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

248
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:40.640
<v Speaker 1>I suspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

249
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm virtually certain that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority viewpoint.</v>

250
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.020
<v Speaker 1>It's just the people who hold the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative perspective,</v>

251
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:50.400
<v Speaker 1>which are the radical social </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructionist types,</v>

252
00:13:50.401 --> 00:13:53.260
<v Speaker 1>who insists that everything is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of socialization.</v>

253
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.750
<v Speaker 1>There are a little bit more organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>

254
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:56.584
<v Speaker 1>but they're clearly wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientifically they're wrong factually </v>

255
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.140
<v Speaker 1>the wrong ethically for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

256
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:03.663
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably have more support than you </v>

257
00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:07.600
<v Speaker 1>think and it'll be very interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see how that turns out.</v>

258
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.383
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you think about having </v>

259
00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:12.274
<v Speaker 1>written this mean now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life is going to be turned upside </v>

260
00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:17.150
<v Speaker 1>down and for quite a while I suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

261
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.660
<v Speaker 1>so you put yourself out on the line </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this,</v>

262
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.120
<v Speaker 1>so what do you think about that?</v>

263
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.780
<v Speaker 2>It definitely sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least I was proven right know</v>

264
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.140
<v Speaker 1>when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by proven right?</v>

265
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the whole</v>

266
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:43.790
<v Speaker 2>culture just tries to silence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed a dissenting view</v>

267
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:50.810
<v Speaker 2>and then we really need some more </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective way of looking at these.</v>

268
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:53.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I felt the same way with the </v>

269
00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.750
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto decided to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.590
<v Speaker 1>an attempt to shut me down after I need </v>
<v Speaker 1>my videos.</v>

271
00:15:00.591 --> 00:15:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that just proves my point because I</v>

272
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.313
<v Speaker 1>mean I made the videos saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't like the climate that's </v>

273
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:07.154
<v Speaker 1>developing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's making it very difficult to have </v>

274
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:09.584
<v Speaker 1>conversations about certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your example is even more egregious </v>

275
00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:14.084
<v Speaker 1>I think because at least objected to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of legislation that in principle </v>

276
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:22.760
<v Speaker 1>would have been a benefit to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable group,</v>

277
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.103
<v Speaker 1>but say the transgender group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it is of any benefit to </v>

278
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:28.130
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could make a case that it was,</v>

279
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.593
<v Speaker 1>but you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you did as far as I can tell is </v>

280
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.173
<v Speaker 1>review the modern personality literature</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the literature on individual </v>

281
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>differences relating to men and women </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other groups.</v>

282
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:42.470
<v Speaker 1>And there's actually not very much your </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion in your piece at all.</v>

283
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:43.963
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that it is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to actually have a discussion </v>

284
00:15:48.951 --> 00:15:49.784
<v Speaker 1>about the scientific literature on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues without putting yourself at risk </v>

285
00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:54.254
<v Speaker 1>and that's a hell of a thing for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineer because being engineers and </v>

286
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.873
<v Speaker 1>rely on the facts as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I like about </v>

287
00:16:03.111 --> 00:16:06.650
<v Speaker 1>engineers is that they tend to stick </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly closely to the facts that they're</v>

288
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 1>not a very political group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

289
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:12.080
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're much more practical.</v>

290
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they can expect a </v>
<v Speaker 1>silence.</v>

291
00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:23.660
<v Speaker 1>So many engineers then intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and just</v>

292
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:24.990
<v Speaker 4>deny science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like</v>

293
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.580
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

294
00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Well the question too is what are your </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters within Google going to do?</v>

295
00:16:30.211 --> 00:16:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say you're a great warning man,</v>

296
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.870
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you showed what happened,</v>

297
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.970
<v Speaker 1>you showed exactly what happens if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have enough,</v>

298
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:49.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you'd call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity and courage I suppose,</v>

299
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.550
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mostly curiosity to lay out what you</v>

300
00:16:53.551 --> 00:16:57.870
<v Speaker 1>think for discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You opened this conversation.</v>

301
00:16:57.871 --> 00:17:02.580
<v Speaker 1>You said that you weren't jumping up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and insisting you were right.</v>

302
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:03.443
<v Speaker 1>You were trying to lay out what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood from doing a fair bit of </v>

303
00:17:05.971 --> 00:17:09.540
<v Speaker 1>reading and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make the case that the,</v>

304
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:10.763
<v Speaker 1>these facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the facts about the differences between </v>

305
00:17:12.901 --> 00:17:13.734
<v Speaker 1>men and women and employment choice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>payment and all that aren't being </v>

306
00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:18.480
<v Speaker 1>discussed and they're not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed.</v>

307
00:17:18.481 --> 00:17:19.314
<v Speaker 1>I mean we know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll put this citation down in the </v>

308
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.540
<v Speaker 1>description,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been very difficult for the Swedes,</v>

309
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.383
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to flatten out the gender distribution </v>

310
00:17:29.701 --> 00:17:30.534
<v Speaker 1>for engineers in Sweden and in and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the Scandinavian countries in </v>

311
00:17:33.841 --> 00:17:34.674
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite their advanced social </v>

312
00:17:37.111 --> 00:17:38.280
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it.</v>

313
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.920
<v Speaker 1>And they also can get male nurses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

314
00:17:40.921 --> 00:17:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's four out of five nurses in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia,</v>

315
00:17:44.041 --> 00:17:44.874
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are female and the reverse number are </v>

316
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:49.643
<v Speaker 1>our engineers are male and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be associated with this </v>

317
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.530
<v Speaker 1>quite well founded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

318
00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.033
<v Speaker 1>scientific observation that women tilt </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards interest in people and men tilt </v>

319
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:04.194
<v Speaker 1>towards interest in things and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with testosterone </v>

320
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:10.890
<v Speaker 1>exposure in utero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is science.</v>

321
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.773
<v Speaker 1>Anybody beating an ideological trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of the people I would say </v>

322
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:16.614
<v Speaker 1>that most of the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>publishing this would have been even </v>

323
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:21.300
<v Speaker 1>happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did turned out the other way,</v>

324
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:22.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the findings actually run contrary to </v>

325
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:25.644
<v Speaker 1>their biases because academia is </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally full of people whose biases </v>

326
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:29.874
<v Speaker 1>are less and now and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific findings emerged to dispute </v>

327
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.413
<v Speaker 1>on India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logical proposition not certainly the </v>

328
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:43.260
<v Speaker 1>case with role of biology versus society</v>
<v Speaker 1>in establishing gender differences.</v>

329
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:44.094
<v Speaker 1>So the science is very credible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it's completely beyond </v>

330
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:48.174
<v Speaker 1>dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the point either because </v>

331
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:51.594
<v Speaker 1>your survey was actually pretty decent </v>
<v Speaker 1>survey of the current state of affairs </v>

332
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:57.600
<v Speaker 1>with regards to individual differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean it's right.</v>

333
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

334
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:01.680
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your,</v>

335
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.633
<v Speaker 1>what are your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does your family think about all </v>

336
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.433
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

337
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely support me,</v>

338
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 2>but they don't really know what I should</v>
<v Speaker 2>do from here.</v>

339
00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:12.504
<v Speaker 2>They don't want me to just go to a ton </v>
<v Speaker 2>of news corporations and do all these </v>

340
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:17.904
<v Speaker 2>interviews and stuff and because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just want to twist whatever I say </v>

341
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.133
<v Speaker 2>towards their agenda to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really clear what I should be </v>

342
00:19:25.201 --> 00:19:26.034
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

343
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:26.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

344
00:19:26.751 --> 00:19:29.120
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly no shortage of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that want to talk to you.</v>

345
00:19:29.121 --> 00:19:29.954
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been contacted by four or five </v>

346
00:19:31.251 --> 00:19:33.980
<v Speaker 1>journalists who would like to speak with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

347
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.670
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about that afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can let you know who they are,</v>

348
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.620
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

349
00:19:39.621 --> 00:19:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Well you've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a conundrum on your hands.</v>

350
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:45.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

351
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.870
<v Speaker 1>you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a very straightforward person and</v>

352
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:55.810
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously not grinding any acts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least not in any order is waiting.</v>

353
00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.820
<v Speaker 1>So my suspicions are that talking to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right people could be substantial use to</v>

354
00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:01.934
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess it also depends on what it </v>

355
00:20:03.711 --> 00:20:04.544
<v Speaker 1>is that you want me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something we can talk about </v>

356
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.270
<v Speaker 1>now you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

357
00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.443
<v Speaker 1>you've rattled up the cages have a fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of people and a fairly large </v>

358
00:20:13.931 --> 00:20:14.764
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly enough just on the heels </v>

359
00:20:16.991 --> 00:20:17.824
<v Speaker 1>of Google and youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the announcement about the new free </v>

360
00:20:19.421 --> 00:20:21.940
<v Speaker 1>speech restrictions on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube,</v>

361
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.833
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their incorporation of Ngo who's </v>

362
00:20:24.311 --> 00:20:25.144
<v Speaker 1>into that sensor set process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's been quite a week for Google I </v>

363
00:20:28.241 --> 00:20:32.080
<v Speaker 1>would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've opened up this can of worms,</v>

364
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:33.933
<v Speaker 1>what is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine if you're looking six months </v>

365
00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:37.863
<v Speaker 1>down the road and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things happened that were good </v>

366
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.103
<v Speaker 1>because of what you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you would like to have </v>

367
00:20:43.691 --> 00:20:44.524
<v Speaker 1>happen</v>

368
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:50.590
<v Speaker 2>at the very least I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I do still care about google.</v>

369
00:20:50.591 --> 00:20:51.424
<v Speaker 2>I want some conversation to be had and </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the ideologues to not just have </v>

370
00:20:57.671 --> 00:21:01.270
<v Speaker 2>their way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

371
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:06.271
<v Speaker 2>I still don't have a clear vision on how</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly this will happen.</v>

372
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.183
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how this can spread farther than just </v>

373
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:11.134
<v Speaker 2>google</v>

374
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.330
<v Speaker 1>well farther than just google.</v>

375
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

376
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

377
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would say my experiences with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the premise is that the first thing that</v>

378
00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:27.531
<v Speaker 1>happens that will happen is that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>get jumped on by people who call you the</v>

379
00:21:28.651 --> 00:21:29.484
<v Speaker 1>sorts of epithets that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate if you were a bad guy and </v>

380
00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you should just shut up and go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

381
00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.043
<v Speaker 1>That's already happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think you're going to get through </v>

382
00:21:38.941 --> 00:21:41.460
<v Speaker 1>that real quick because I went through </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

383
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:42.643
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your writings which are not as screened </v>

384
00:21:44.671 --> 00:21:47.470
<v Speaker 1>by the way on are certainly not anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity street.</v>

385
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.713
<v Speaker 1>I went to the writing center and I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see anything there that identifies you </v>

386
00:21:51.871 --> 00:21:52.704
<v Speaker 1>as the sort of person that can be easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>and permanently tarred with a hateful </v>

387
00:21:56.611 --> 00:21:58.070
<v Speaker 1>epithets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

388
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.530
<v Speaker 1>it's logical for the public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

389
00:22:01.531 --> 00:22:05.640
<v Speaker 1>including the media to jump on someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you when they blow a whistle.</v>

390
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:06.503
<v Speaker 1>Because the first thing that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>presume if someone's causing trouble is </v>

391
00:22:10.201 --> 00:22:11.034
<v Speaker 1>that there's something wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to sort of beat them </v>

392
00:22:14.191 --> 00:22:15.024
<v Speaker 1>awhile with the idea that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with them to see what </v>

393
00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:18.474
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the first thing is you have to </v>

394
00:22:20.311 --> 00:22:21.144
<v Speaker 1>withstand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there don't seem to be any smoking </v>

395
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.930
<v Speaker 1>pistols into your background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

396
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.063
<v Speaker 1>you were in an ideal Google employee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that protects you a lot and you </v>

397
00:22:30.211 --> 00:22:31.044
<v Speaker 1>don't have a history of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of any sort of trouble making and you </v>

398
00:22:33.781 --> 00:22:37.380
<v Speaker 1>have a solid educational background and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're clearly a reasonable person.</v>

399
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:42.420
<v Speaker 1>And so the first thing is just to steel </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to get through that.</v>

400
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.513
<v Speaker 1>And then what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you do talk to media </v>

401
00:22:47.431 --> 00:22:48.264
<v Speaker 1>organizations and especially if you talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them the way that you're talking to </v>

402
00:22:51.181 --> 00:22:52.014
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is extraordinarily calm and </v>

403
00:22:53.041 --> 00:22:53.874
<v Speaker 1>composed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to reveal yourself </v>

404
00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:01.010
<v Speaker 1>even more as a reasonable person and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>press overall will start to shift behind</v>

405
00:23:02.761 --> 00:23:03.594
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is one </v>

406
00:23:05.161 --> 00:23:09.060
<v Speaker 1>thing you got to remember about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>press is that when push comes to shove,</v>

407
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.670
<v Speaker 1>they're actually rather in favor of free</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech</v>

408
00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.210
<v Speaker 1>giving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without it they would be dead.</v>

409
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.143
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you have to worry </v>

410
00:23:21.511 --> 00:23:26.511
<v Speaker 1>about being exploited and twisted by </v>
<v Speaker 1>media sources.</v>

411
00:23:26.761 --> 00:23:31.761
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that it might be to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your advantage to talk to people,</v>

412
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can figure out who those people are,</v>

413
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.993
<v Speaker 1>but you're just not the kind of person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be easily transformed into a </v>

414
00:23:41.551 --> 00:23:42.384
<v Speaker 1>villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more that you can demonstrate </v>

415
00:23:44.311 --> 00:23:45.770
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better might be,</v>

416
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the cause that you're engaged in,</v>

417
00:23:48.981 --> 00:23:53.981
<v Speaker 1>but also for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

418
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 1>So like how are you feeling about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally?</v>

419
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.950
<v Speaker 1>You must be in a bit of a state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shock.</v>

420
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a stressful week for sure.</v>

421
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not feeling too negative about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

422
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't fully hit me,</v>

423
00:24:16.501 --> 00:24:17.334
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

424
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it will because God only knows </v>

425
00:24:19.581 --> 00:24:21.500
<v Speaker 1>what's gonna happen to you over the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>few weeks.</v>

426
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a real rollercoaster.</v>

427
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider is that it's possible that this</v>

428
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.370
<v Speaker 1>will turn out extraordinarily positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

429
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.733
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna be it's gonna be a rough </v>

430
00:24:33.681 --> 00:24:34.514
<v Speaker 1>ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

431
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.990
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that you are accurate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your observations,</v>

432
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:39.853
<v Speaker 1>then you know it's not that easy to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy for the opponents of </v>

433
00:24:43.911 --> 00:24:44.744
<v Speaker 1>truth to have a battle with truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to have a battle that you </v>

434
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.990
<v Speaker 1>tended to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can I just go over some of the things</v>

435
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:58.220
<v Speaker 1>that you sent so that we can discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to take a look here.</v>

436
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:04.240
<v Speaker 1>So you started with a pretty good solid </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>

437
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:05.594
<v Speaker 1>I would say Google's political bias has </v>
<v Speaker 1>equated the freedom from offense with </v>

438
00:25:08.931 --> 00:25:09.764
<v Speaker 1>psychological safety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but shaming into silence is the </v>

439
00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:13.880
<v Speaker 1>antithesis of psychological safety.</v>

440
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.003
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems even more relevant now in </v>

441
00:25:16.121 --> 00:25:16.954
<v Speaker 1>your situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The science is created ideological echo </v>

442
00:25:19.941 --> 00:25:23.090
<v Speaker 1>chamber where some ideas are too sacred </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be honestly discuss.</v>

443
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can check that one off too,</v>

444
00:25:25.611 --> 00:25:26.444
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly seems to indicate that was </v>

445
00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:29.504
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lack of discussion discussion </v>

446
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:31.933
<v Speaker 1>fosters the most extreme and </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarians elements of this </v>

447
00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:35.990
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the extreme,</v>

448
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.530
<v Speaker 1>the extreme is all disparities in </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation or do new oppression.</v>

449
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:40.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

450
00:25:40.761 --> 00:25:43.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a univariate hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

451
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:46.810
<v Speaker 1>very simple minded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the authoritarian element,</v>

452
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.653
<v Speaker 1>you defined as the idea we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminate correct for this </v>

453
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:52.490
<v Speaker 1>oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

454
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.623
<v Speaker 1>And then you make a claim just </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in distributions of traits </v>

455
00:25:56.211 --> 00:25:57.044
<v Speaker 1>between men and women May in part </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain why we don't have 50 percent </v>

456
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:06.230
<v Speaker 1>representation of women in tech and </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership discrimination to reach equal</v>

457
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:09.620
<v Speaker 1>representation is unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Divisive and bad for business.</v>

458
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.573
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's your thesis and then you go </v>

459
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.243
<v Speaker 1>along and try to justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you do is talk about </v>

460
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:18.854
<v Speaker 1>left wing versus right wing biases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I should point out that you don't </v>

461
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:26.000
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on the left biases or on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right biases.</v>

462
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:30.260
<v Speaker 1>You're completely even handed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to laying out the pros and cons.</v>

463
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.700
<v Speaker 1>So the lack of compassion for the week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disparities are due to injustices.</v>

464
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Humans are inherently cooperative </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes,</v>

465
00:26:37.611 --> 00:26:40.970
<v Speaker 1>good slash unstable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open an idealistic,</v>

466
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.253
<v Speaker 1>fair enough man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dead on with regards to the </v>

467
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:44.874
<v Speaker 1>relevant psychological literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are we seeing that political </v>

468
00:26:47.491 --> 00:26:48.324
<v Speaker 1>correctness is motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness and that liberalism is </v>

469
00:26:51.331 --> 00:26:55.740
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally predicted by openness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right biases.</v>

470
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Respect for authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disparities are natural.</v>

471
00:26:58.201 --> 00:27:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Adjust humans are inherently </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive.</v>

472
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

473
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.410
<v Speaker 1>stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be high conscientiousness,</v>

474
00:27:04.411 --> 00:27:05.244
<v Speaker 1>low openness and they're closed rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than open and pragmatic rather than </v>

475
00:27:08.431 --> 00:27:09.420
<v Speaker 1>idealist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

476
00:27:09.421 --> 00:27:10.254
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think any reasonable person </v>

477
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:11.964
<v Speaker 1>could read that column and say that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were coming down hard on the side of </v>

478
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:17.100
<v Speaker 1>either part of the political spectrum.</v>

479
00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.870
<v Speaker 3>Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I jump in with a question?</v>

480
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:22.723
<v Speaker 3>It appears from my interactions with </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people that they are projecting </v>

481
00:27:28.881 --> 00:27:33.881
<v Speaker 3>words that were not written onto the </v>
<v Speaker 3>paper and would you be able to elaborate</v>

482
00:27:34.701 --> 00:27:35.534
<v Speaker 3>on the schemas that people develop and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how they classify information in their </v>

483
00:27:40.521 --> 00:27:44.780
<v Speaker 3>minds because this is very much how </v>
<v Speaker 3>stereotypes form I would think,</v>

484
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.943
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is by kind of just grouping a bunch of </v>

485
00:27:47.211 --> 00:27:48.044
<v Speaker 3>disparate but semi related people or </v>
<v Speaker 3>things together and then projecting an </v>

486
00:27:52.371 --> 00:27:54.980
<v Speaker 3>idea that may or may not pertain to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

487
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

488
00:27:55.521 --> 00:27:58.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a low resolution thought issue.</v>

489
00:27:58.401 --> 00:27:58.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

490
00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.700
<v Speaker 1>what's happened to James is that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

491
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:02.543
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

492
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.610
<v Speaker 1>he put up his hand and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>

493
00:28:04.611 --> 00:28:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with the diversity </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>

494
00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.230
<v Speaker 1>And he was immediately declassified </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially as a misogynist and bigot.</v>

495
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:15.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's the simplest thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

496
00:28:15.261 --> 00:28:16.094
<v Speaker 1>Because misogynists and bigots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll hold viewpoints that are anti </v>

497
00:28:21.021 --> 00:28:21.854
<v Speaker 1>female and racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a lot easier just to paint </v>

498
00:28:25.971 --> 00:28:26.804
<v Speaker 1>someone with a broad brush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're violating the </v>

499
00:28:29.331 --> 00:28:32.960
<v Speaker 1>tenants of your implicit temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

500
00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Then it is to dive into the details were</v>
<v Speaker 1>real thought occurs.</v>

501
00:28:38.961 --> 00:28:39.794
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the sins that James </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed was that he actually dared to </v>

502
00:28:44.091 --> 00:28:44.924
<v Speaker 1>make this about details rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>about vague hand waving ideology that's </v>

503
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.390
<v Speaker 1>very annoying to people who don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think because in order to analyze his</v>

504
00:28:53.391 --> 00:28:55.130
<v Speaker 1>claims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to go through,</v>

505
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:59.370
<v Speaker 1>well let's say 20 or 30 scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>papers and actually understand what they</v>

506
00:28:59.371 --> 00:29:00.204
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

507
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.093
<v Speaker 1>And that's very annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're pursuing a given </v>

508
00:29:03.351 --> 00:29:04.820
<v Speaker 1>agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

509
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.343
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you say neither side is 100 </v>

510
00:29:07.881 --> 00:29:08.714
<v Speaker 1>percent correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And both viewpoints are necessary for a </v>

511
00:29:11.181 --> 00:29:13.790
<v Speaker 1>functioning society or in this case </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

512
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think the data is solid there </v>

513
00:29:16.191 --> 00:29:17.024
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean our research has indicated that </v>

514
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:19.483
<v Speaker 1>open people who are primarily liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>start companies and the more closed </v>

515
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.590
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conservatives,</v>

516
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.540
<v Speaker 1>the traditionalist are good at running </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

517
00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:27.613
<v Speaker 1>They're better at being managers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrators that's associated with </v>

518
00:29:30.771 --> 00:29:33.230
<v Speaker 1>high conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got it right there.</v>

519
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.433
<v Speaker 1>A company too far to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe too slow to react over a higher </v>

520
00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.813
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical and uninteresting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accompany too far to the left will </v>

521
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.103
<v Speaker 1>overdressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversify its interests already trusts </v>

522
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.040
<v Speaker 1>it's employees and competitors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>change perhaps to rapidly.</v>

523
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:50.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

524
00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:51.491
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

525
00:29:51.491 --> 00:29:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Nicely balanced as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only facts and reasons can shed light on</v>

526
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:55.894
<v Speaker 1>these biases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to diversity and </v>

527
00:29:57.281 --> 00:29:58.114
<v Speaker 1>inclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google's left bias is created a </v>

528
00:29:59.351 --> 00:30:03.250
<v Speaker 1>politically correct monoculture that </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintains its hold by shaming descenders</v>

529
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:04.090
<v Speaker 1>into silence.</v>

530
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that certainly seems to be the case this</v>

531
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:09.223
<v Speaker 1>time as removes any checks against </v>
<v Speaker 1>encroaching extremist and authoritarian </v>

532
00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:13.720
<v Speaker 1>policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

533
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.633
<v Speaker 1>Like Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're regularly told that implicit </v>

534
00:30:17.021 --> 00:30:17.854
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and explicit biases are </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding women back in tech and </v>

535
00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

536
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:25.150
<v Speaker 1>men and women experienced bias in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace differently.</v>

537
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.023
<v Speaker 1>We should be cognizant of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's far from the whole story on </v>

538
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:29.980
<v Speaker 1>average men and women biologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

539
00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:30.814
<v Speaker 1>In many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These aren't just socially constructed </v>

540
00:30:32.591 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 1>because they're universal across </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>

541
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Clear biological causes links to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prenatal testosterone.</v>

542
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Biological males castrate them at birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and raised.</v>

543
00:30:40.891 --> 00:30:43.660
<v Speaker 1>His females often still identify and act</v>
<v Speaker 1>like males.</v>

544
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.673
<v Speaker 1>The underlying traits are highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>heritable and they're exactly what we </v>

545
00:30:46.751 --> 00:30:49.330
<v Speaker 1>would predict from an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology perspective.</v>

546
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.433
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that all men differ from </v>

547
00:30:51.701 --> 00:30:54.730
<v Speaker 1>women in the following ways or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these differences are just,</v>

548
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.773
<v Speaker 1>and then you put it into nice chart </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicating that the amount of overlap </v>

549
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.610
<v Speaker 1>between men and women per trade is </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater than the amount of difference.</v>

550
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you state that directly.</v>

551
00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.570
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's perfect.</v>

552
00:31:07.571 --> 00:31:08.404
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good way of defending your</v>
<v Speaker 1>thesis and also of not overstating the </v>

553
00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:13.624
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you do a nice job of of also </v>

554
00:31:16.661 --> 00:31:17.494
<v Speaker 1>graphically indicating what happens if </v>
<v Speaker 1>the distribution is ignored and people </v>

555
00:31:20.681 --> 00:31:24.280
<v Speaker 1>are just treated as if they're a unit </v>
<v Speaker 1>polar representatives of a given group,</v>

556
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:25.863
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of what the what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are predicating the push for </v>

557
00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:32.140
<v Speaker 1>diversity on gender and race are </v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming.</v>

558
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is.</v>

559
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:34.683
<v Speaker 1>Which is really so funny because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really a biologically essentialist </v>

560
00:31:37.331 --> 00:31:38.440
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much,</v>

561
00:31:38.441 --> 00:31:41.920
<v Speaker 1>much greater than than than the argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're making,</v>

562
00:31:41.921 --> 00:31:42.754
<v Speaker 1>which is that men and women and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of different races are so </v>

563
00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:52.351
<v Speaker 1>different that in order for a full </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity of viewpoint to be achieved,</v>

564
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.670
<v Speaker 1>you have to pull in people by race and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender which which,</v>

565
00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.513
<v Speaker 1>which implicitly states that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences are so great that the </v>

566
00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:02.110
<v Speaker 1>distributions don't overlap.</v>

567
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:08.850
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't make them more racist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>misogynist statement than that and it's,</v>

568
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.943
<v Speaker 1>and it's also technically wrong because </v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women are more alike than they </v>

569
00:32:12.611 --> 00:32:13.444
<v Speaker 1>are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you summed up all the </v>

570
00:32:14.921 --> 00:32:15.754
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could absolutely differentiate </v>

571
00:32:17.231 --> 00:32:18.330
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

572
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:19.283
<v Speaker 1>in all likelihood you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of those differences are </v>

573
00:32:21.101 --> 00:32:23.880
<v Speaker 1>clinically irrelevant to the workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

574
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Then you go through the personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference literature and you're.</v>

575
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.673
<v Speaker 1>You're exactly right on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that the CEO took you to task for </v>

576
00:32:33.011 --> 00:32:35.350
<v Speaker 1>using the word neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

577
00:32:35.351 --> 00:32:36.184
<v Speaker 1>that is the technical term in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality literature and there are </v>

578
00:32:38.291 --> 00:32:40.730
<v Speaker 1>historical reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a better word,</v>

579
00:32:40.731 --> 00:32:44.420
<v Speaker 1>might be negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's clearly the case that women are</v>

580
00:32:44.421 --> 00:32:48.950
<v Speaker 1>higher in negative emotion than men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means that they are on average,</v>

581
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:53.350
<v Speaker 1>less tolerant of uncertainty and stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They suffer more psychologically for for</v>

582
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.810
<v Speaker 1>the equivalent levels of uncertainty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>

583
00:32:56.811 --> 00:33:01.220
<v Speaker 1>and that is also why cross culturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>women have more depressive disorders and</v>

584
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:02.054
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorders and the research on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is rock solid rock solid men have </v>

585
00:33:06.441 --> 00:33:07.550
<v Speaker 1>their own problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

586
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:08.383
<v Speaker 1>They're more likely to be antisocial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're much more likely to be in </v>

587
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.213
<v Speaker 1>prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more likely to have learning </v>

588
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:13.214
<v Speaker 1>disabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's stating that there are </v>

589
00:33:16.011 --> 00:33:18.830
<v Speaker 1>differences in the rates of certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of psychopathology.</v>

590
00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:22.490
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't put any either gender into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position of relative inferiority.</v>

591
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.303
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you quote research that </v>

592
00:33:28.191 --> 00:33:29.024
<v Speaker 1>suggests that greater nation level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender equality leads to psychological </v>

593
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:32.924
<v Speaker 1>dissimilarity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissimilarity and men and women's </v>

594
00:33:34.641 --> 00:33:36.470
<v Speaker 1>personality traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

595
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.780
<v Speaker 1>That's what the Scandinavian studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate.</v>

596
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.450
<v Speaker 1>There's been a number of them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very large studies,</v>

597
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.480
<v Speaker 1>so you've got that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

598
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:47.650
<v Speaker 1>What does what the researchers </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated was that as Ka Ka,</v>

599
00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Ka,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as</v>

600
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:53.203
<v Speaker 1>countries move to flatten out the socio </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic playing field and remove </v>

601
00:33:57.261 --> 00:33:58.094
<v Speaker 1>discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the differences between men and women </v>

602
00:34:00.231 --> 00:34:01.064
<v Speaker 1>are many of the differences between men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women maximize instead of minimize </v>

603
00:34:03.841 --> 00:34:04.674
<v Speaker 1>it and in Scandinavia you really see </v>
<v Speaker 1>maximization of the difference in men </v>

604
00:34:09.111 --> 00:34:11.900
<v Speaker 1>and women with regards to interest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>people versus interest in.</v>

605
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A major,</v>

606
00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:17.060
<v Speaker 1>major issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men's higher drive for status.</v>

607
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:17.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we know that women are hyper </v>

608
00:34:19.541 --> 00:34:22.910
<v Speaker 1>agamous and that they choose men on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis of their socioeconomic status,</v>

609
00:34:22.911 --> 00:34:23.744
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well documented cross culturally and </v>

610
00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:25.964
<v Speaker 1>also just rational because women have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make themselves dependent when they are </v>

611
00:34:32.121 --> 00:34:32.954
<v Speaker 1>pregnant and when they have infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that makes perfect sense for them to </v>

612
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:37.760
<v Speaker 1>seek out the most competent person they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can manage,</v>

613
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.133
<v Speaker 1>the most common and generous person they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can manage in order to help them bear </v>

614
00:34:42.411 --> 00:34:43.880
<v Speaker 1>the burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

615
00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:45.223
<v Speaker 1>so not no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no dispute there at least know you're </v>

616
00:34:50.091 --> 00:34:50.924
<v Speaker 1>not</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverting from the central tenants of </v>

617
00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:59.150
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary psychology and biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will disseminate those findings,</v>

618
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.930
<v Speaker 1>but you're not conjuring this out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thin air.</v>

619
00:35:02.931 --> 00:35:05.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a nice in scientific literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind you,</v>

620
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.510
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

621
00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:13.650
<v Speaker 1>it's also very interesting to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the US labor stats on gender differences</v>

622
00:35:14.841 --> 00:35:16.040
<v Speaker 1>in occupations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

623
00:35:16.041 --> 00:35:20.270
<v Speaker 1>because it's so funny to watch the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical feminists only go after the high</v>

624
00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:21.440
<v Speaker 1>status occupations.</v>

625
00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like 100 percent of brick layers </v>
<v Speaker 1>are net.</v>

626
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:28.790
<v Speaker 1>We don't hear that being being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaint about.</v>

627
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.400
<v Speaker 1>And of course men occupied most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside jobs,</v>

628
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:34.550
<v Speaker 1>they move more and they will do more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dangerous jobs as well.</v>

629
00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

630
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:37.483
<v Speaker 1>so these are all factors that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are relevant but completely undiscussed </v>

631
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:43.403
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell by this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological types that have been going </v>

632
00:35:45.961 --> 00:35:49.410
<v Speaker 1>after you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women are on average,</v>

633
00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:51.000
<v Speaker 1>more cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

634
00:35:51.001 --> 00:35:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Especially with members of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingroup.</v>

635
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Whether they're more cooperative with </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of their outgroup is a different</v>

636
00:35:57.001 --> 00:35:57.631
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

637
00:35:57.631 --> 00:35:58.464
<v Speaker 1>Because agreeable people are in group </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented and very hard on outgroup </v>

638
00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 1>members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is partly why the pc types</v>

639
00:36:04.831 --> 00:36:09.090
<v Speaker 1>are so hard on their enemies because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard the nest predators,</v>

640
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:12.240
<v Speaker 1>predators on infants essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

641
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Women on average are more prone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

642
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

643
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.330
<v Speaker 1>A women on average look for more work </v>
<v Speaker 1>life balance.</v>

644
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:22.523
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the literature on that </v>

645
00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:25.360
<v Speaker 1>is tight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

646
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly the case that law </v>
<v Speaker 1>firms,</v>

647
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:29.934
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a hell of a time keeping their </v>

648
00:36:31.591 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Speaker 1>women in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in partnership positions because most of</v>

649
00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:37.380
<v Speaker 1>them don't want to work the 60 hour work</v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

650
00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:38.214
<v Speaker 1>60 to 80 hour work weeks that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary to performance at that </v>

651
00:36:41.461 --> 00:36:42.510
<v Speaker 1>extremely high level.</v>

652
00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.573
<v Speaker 3>So Dr Peterson for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for anybody who might be new listening </v>

653
00:36:47.711 --> 00:36:48.544
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned that a lot of women might </v>

654
00:36:50.771 --> 00:36:55.750
<v Speaker 3>not be</v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in working 60 to 80 hour work</v>

655
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.593
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it would make sense to </v>

656
00:36:57.401 --> 00:36:59.550
<v Speaker 3>expand upon that just a little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

657
00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.393
<v Speaker 3>I know you talked through hyper to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've also mentioned the thing </v>

658
00:37:03.161 --> 00:37:07.240
<v Speaker 3>about why would anybody want to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what your gender is.</v>

659
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.243
<v Speaker 1>We got to get the mystery right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mystery isn't why there are a bunch </v>

660
00:37:12.661 --> 00:37:13.494
<v Speaker 1>of people who are low status because </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everyone's low status </v>

661
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.210
<v Speaker 1>comparatively speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

662
00:37:18.211 --> 00:37:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Men and women alike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a small minority of people who were</v>

663
00:37:22.141 --> 00:37:22.974
<v Speaker 1>high status on any dimension and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be hyper successful and they </v>

664
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:27.534
<v Speaker 1>tend to be men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see this in scientific </v>

665
00:37:29.761 --> 00:37:30.750
<v Speaker 1>publishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

666
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:35.751
<v Speaker 1>So the median professor male publishes </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as the median professor,</v>

667
00:37:36.391 --> 00:37:38.730
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the vast majority of the,</v>

668
00:37:38.731 --> 00:37:43.560
<v Speaker 1>of the high publishing people are males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be because there are a</v>

669
00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:46.060
<v Speaker 1>small percentage of males who are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>static,</v>

670
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:48.330
<v Speaker 1>very focused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very energetic,</v>

671
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.630
<v Speaker 1>and very much prone to put their career </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

672
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:57.080
<v Speaker 1>And part of the theory for why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that some men are that,</v>

673
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:59.610
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

674
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:00.623
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

675
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.613
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary and sexual tradeoff for men</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to high status is much </v>

676
00:38:05.101 --> 00:38:05.934
<v Speaker 1>higher than it is for women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's good documentation and I can </v>

677
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:09.234
<v Speaker 1>find these references to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number of sexual partners or </v>

678
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:14.124
<v Speaker 1>opportunities that a man has in previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>year as tightly associated with the </v>

679
00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.073
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the number of partners or </v>

680
00:38:21.061 --> 00:38:21.894
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for partnering that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman has is negatively correlated with </v>

681
00:38:24.691 --> 00:38:25.524
<v Speaker 1>your status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might be partly because high </v>

682
00:38:27.661 --> 00:38:32.661
<v Speaker 1>status women who are looking for either </v>
<v Speaker 1>even higher status men priced themselves</v>

683
00:38:32.701 --> 00:38:36.700
<v Speaker 1>out of the mating market and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually pretty good of that as well.</v>

684
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're fine,</v>

685
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:40.750
<v Speaker 1>you're fine with all of that.</v>

686
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.193
<v Speaker 1>The harm of Google was biases to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more equal gender and race </v>

687
00:38:48.311 --> 00:38:49.144
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google has created several </v>

688
00:38:50.291 --> 00:38:51.124
<v Speaker 1>discriminatory practices programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentoring in classes only for people </v>

689
00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:55.234
<v Speaker 1>with a certain gender or race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high priority queue and special </v>

690
00:38:57.731 --> 00:39:00.560
<v Speaker 1>treatment for diversity candidates </v>
<v Speaker 1>hiring practice,</v>

691
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.653
<v Speaker 1>which can effectively lower the bar for </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity candidates by decreasing the </v>

692
00:39:04.601 --> 00:39:05.780
<v Speaker 1>false negative rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

693
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.730
<v Speaker 1>that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either have standards early,</v>

694
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:09.603
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that if the standards </v>

695
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:12.873
<v Speaker 1>producing inequitable outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what happens is people criticize </v>

696
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:16.324
<v Speaker 1>the standards and that would be fine if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the standards board no relationship </v>

697
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.980
<v Speaker 1>to the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>

698
00:39:22.981 --> 00:39:23.814
<v Speaker 1>is that if you have your hiring </v>
<v Speaker 1>practices set up halfway intelligently </v>

699
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:27.521
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

700
00:39:27.521 --> 00:39:28.354
<v Speaker 1>and it's never perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually hiring for attributes </v>

701
00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 1>that would make a job defectiveness much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely.</v>

702
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:36.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did you come across all this </v>

703
00:39:38.681 --> 00:39:39.514
<v Speaker 1>information?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A part of it was through that diversity </v>

704
00:39:42.761 --> 00:39:43.594
<v Speaker 1>summit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just looking through all the stuff </v>

705
00:39:46.981 --> 00:39:50.250
<v Speaker 1>that we have online or in through our </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal sites.</v>

706
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can do in a certain bit of </v>

707
00:39:52.861 --> 00:39:54.990
<v Speaker 1>literature review.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

708
00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

709
00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.153
<v Speaker 1>These practices are based on false </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions generated by our biases and </v>

710
00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.860
<v Speaker 1>can actually increase race and gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>tensions.</v>

711
00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

712
00:40:05.491 --> 00:40:06.324
<v Speaker 1>the whole unconscious bias thing is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great example of that is like first of </v>

713
00:40:09.751 --> 00:40:10.584
<v Speaker 1>all those tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the implicit association tests are </v>

714
00:40:12.301 --> 00:40:17.301
<v Speaker 1>nowhere near reliable or valid enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so nowhere near the quality necessary to</v>

715
00:40:18.061 --> 00:40:22.020
<v Speaker 1>diagnose anyone as having a unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>bias.</v>

716
00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

717
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:30.150
<v Speaker 1>the data relating those so called </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious biases to actual behavior is</v>

718
00:40:30.151 --> 00:40:32.040
<v Speaker 1>weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third,</v>

719
00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:33.183
<v Speaker 1>there was no evidence whatsoever that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti unconscious bias training programs </v>

720
00:40:36.241 --> 00:40:40.320
<v Speaker 1>have any positive effect whatsoever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some that they have negative effect,</v>

721
00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:45.360
<v Speaker 1>partly because people don't like to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>called racists and marched off to forest</v>

722
00:40:45.361 --> 00:40:48.870
<v Speaker 1>reeducation training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so suggestions.</v>

723
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Demoralized diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

724
00:40:50.701 --> 00:40:51.534
<v Speaker 1>that would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And start to define it more </v>

725
00:40:53.191 --> 00:40:54.270
<v Speaker 1>appropriately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

726
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:56.203
<v Speaker 1>Just start having a real conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what proper hiring practices </v>

727
00:40:58.891 --> 00:40:59.724
<v Speaker 1>should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should be objective standards </v>

728
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:06.600
<v Speaker 1>universally applied without bias because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the best we can do that.</v>

729
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.480
<v Speaker 1>That's still going to introduce some non</v>
<v Speaker 1>equal outcomes,</v>

730
00:41:09.481 --> 00:41:11.940
<v Speaker 1>but of course hiring practices are </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to do that.</v>

731
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:13.463
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly designed to reward more </v>

732
00:41:14.821 --> 00:41:18.480
<v Speaker 1>intelligent people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is highly heritable.</v>

733
00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.740
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

734
00:41:22.741 --> 00:41:23.574
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we definitely set up hiring </v>

735
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.270
<v Speaker 1>practices to reward conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

736
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.653
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

737
00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.640
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

738
00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:34.430
<v Speaker 1>what about banks need to negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion?</v>

739
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.460
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that screening for </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>

740
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.483
<v Speaker 1>which is a reasonable thing to do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>high stress jobs unless you want to put </v>

741
00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:42.290
<v Speaker 1>the person in the position where they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to collapse,</v>

742
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.490
<v Speaker 1>to be miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any utility and not</v>

743
00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:48.443
<v Speaker 3>Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a question relating to that from </v>

744
00:41:51.391 --> 00:41:54.300
<v Speaker 3>an employment standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there an Optima,</v>

745
00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.473
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity to stress that you've seen </v>

746
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.620
<v Speaker 3>from the most economically productive </v>
<v Speaker 3>employees?</v>

747
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:02.543
<v Speaker 3>By that I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's a middle ground </v>

748
00:42:04.501 --> 00:42:09.150
<v Speaker 3>between people who are laid back versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are,</v>

749
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.063
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably overstimulated by external </v>

750
00:42:14.611 --> 00:42:17.550
<v Speaker 3>factors that make them self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these people,</v>

751
00:42:17.551 --> 00:42:21.930
<v Speaker 3>I think at least at the lower mid levels</v>
<v Speaker 3>of many companies actually have a little</v>

752
00:42:21.931 --> 00:42:22.764
<v Speaker 3>bit more anxiety that powers their </v>
<v Speaker 3>ascension through the dominance </v>

753
00:42:25.291 --> 00:42:26.124
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>

754
00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:27.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a tricky issue because you're </v>

755
00:42:28.721 --> 00:42:29.554
<v Speaker 1>probably the sort of negative emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be useful in motivating you </v>

756
00:42:34.291 --> 00:42:36.700
<v Speaker 1>is probably more associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

757
00:42:36.701 --> 00:42:37.534
<v Speaker 1>Then with neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism seems to be pretty tightly </v>

758
00:42:40.571 --> 00:42:43.240
<v Speaker 1>to anxiety and emotional pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>

759
00:42:43.241 --> 00:42:44.500
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grief.</v>

760
00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Those all sort of fit into those </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

761
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the negative emotion perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with conscientiousness</v>

762
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:52.903
<v Speaker 1>and industriousness in particular seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more something like self contempt </v>

763
00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:57.183
<v Speaker 1>and disgust and so conscientious people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are made uncomfortable by their lack of </v>

764
00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.593
<v Speaker 1>productive effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't seem to be associated </v>

765
00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:09.040
<v Speaker 1>with trait neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different thing.</v>

766
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:14.300
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly why it's so necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the psychometrics.</v>

767
00:43:14.301 --> 00:43:14.781
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

768
00:43:14.781 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And to get the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To get the measurement right.</v>

769
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:17.414
<v Speaker 1>So the best hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best hiring screeners are the big </v>

770
00:43:20.991 --> 00:43:21.824
<v Speaker 1>five personality tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking especially weighted </v>

771
00:43:25.401 --> 00:43:28.220
<v Speaker 1>towards conscientiousness and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex jobs in general.</v>

772
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:29.443
<v Speaker 1>Cognitive ability test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although there is some question about </v>

773
00:43:32.481 --> 00:43:35.090
<v Speaker 1>the legality of those in the current </v>
<v Speaker 1>political situation.</v>

774
00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:36.493
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>all alienating conservatives disposed </v>

775
00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:41.163
<v Speaker 1>noninclusive and generally bad business </v>
<v Speaker 1>because conservatives tend to be higher </v>

776
00:43:43.681 --> 00:43:44.514
<v Speaker 1>in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is required for much of the judge </v>

777
00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.540
<v Speaker 1>and maintenance work characteristic of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mature company.</v>

778
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

779
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:52.463
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

780
00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:58.050
<v Speaker 1>now here's what you suggest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Confront those biases.</v>

781
00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.180
<v Speaker 1>While you've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've seen how that went.</v>

782
00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.173
<v Speaker 1>I would start by breaking down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google is scores by political </v>

783
00:44:04.121 --> 00:44:07.750
<v Speaker 1>orientation and personality to give a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuller picture and do our how our biases</v>

784
00:44:07.751 --> 00:44:10.240
<v Speaker 1>are affecting our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fine idea.</v>

785
00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Stop restricting programs and classes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain genders or races.</v>

786
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:15.543
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously having open and honest </v>

787
00:44:18.011 --> 00:44:21.160
<v Speaker 1>discussion about the costs and benefits </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our diversity programs.</v>

788
00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.233
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's what we're trying to do </v>

789
00:44:23.261 --> 00:44:24.094
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Discriminating just to increase the </v>

790
00:44:26.261 --> 00:44:29.600
<v Speaker 1>representation of women in tech is </v>
<v Speaker 1>misguided and biased.</v>

791
00:44:29.601 --> 00:44:30.434
<v Speaker 1>Is mandating increases for women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation in homeless work related </v>

792
00:44:33.511 --> 00:44:36.120
<v Speaker 1>that violent as prisons and school </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropouts.</v>

793
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:37.283
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing and it's the same </v>

794
00:44:40.141 --> 00:44:42.690
<v Speaker 1>issue as the bricklayer issue as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what are you going to do?</v>

795
00:44:42.691 --> 00:44:43.524
<v Speaker 1>You're going to chase the nurses out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the women out of nursing and medicine </v>

796
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.273
<v Speaker 1>and psychology and social work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and university undergraduate </v>

797
00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:52.620
<v Speaker 1>programs where they're radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>overrepresented.</v>

798
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.680
<v Speaker 1>So what about Jews?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get rid of them too.</v>

799
00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:01.050
<v Speaker 1>They're overrepresented in most complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupations and Asians as well.</v>

800
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:02.933
<v Speaker 1>So are you only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're only going to do this in very </v>

801
00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:06.200
<v Speaker 1>limited circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>

802
00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Figure out some way to put a limit on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that or you seems very unlikely.</v>

803
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:14.270
<v Speaker 3>I almost wonder what the Adl is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

804
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.113
<v Speaker 3>we'll be thinking six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six months from now or 12 months from </v>

805
00:45:17.341 --> 00:45:20.370
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given the high number of,</v>

806
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in the United States,</v>

807
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:26.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm Ashkenazi Jews in leadership </v>
<v Speaker 3>positions at companies that are advocate</v>

808
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.293
<v Speaker 3>advocating for less of themselves are </v>
<v Speaker 3>less people who are in the bucket that </v>

809
00:45:29.941 --> 00:45:30.774
<v Speaker 3>they're in.</v>

810
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well as long as the discussion centers </v>

811
00:45:33.351 --> 00:45:36.920
<v Speaker 1>on the overrepresentation of white men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people seem to have no problem,</v>

812
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:39.350
<v Speaker 1>but you start to break that down a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

813
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:44.670
<v Speaker 1>And because a Jewish white men are </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly overrepresented as well,</v>

814
00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:46.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make an issue out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

815
00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.713
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the Asians are already having a </v>

816
00:45:50.811 --> 00:45:55.160
<v Speaker 1>harder time getting into universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's well documented.</v>

817
00:45:55.161 --> 00:45:57.260
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that's a terrible thing,</v>

818
00:45:57.261 --> 00:45:59.750
<v Speaker 1>partly because of the cost to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals involved,</v>

819
00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:00.613
<v Speaker 1>but also the cost to society because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that we're not taking the people </v>

820
00:46:03.831 --> 00:46:04.664
<v Speaker 1>who are most competent and allowing them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to expand their education to the </v>

821
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:09.103
<v Speaker 1>greatest degree possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because there aren't that smart </v>

822
00:46:11.931 --> 00:46:12.764
<v Speaker 1>competent people are actually rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>rare and it's just society's advantage </v>

823
00:46:15.621 --> 00:46:19.670
<v Speaker 1>to exploit the hell out of them and pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>them well for that.</v>

824
00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:23.480
<v Speaker 1>But it's not like they're of no benefit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone knows that when they try to</v>

825
00:46:23.481 --> 00:46:26.870
<v Speaker 1>hire someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Competent de emphasize empathy.</v>

826
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Empathy is a good</v>

827
00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:36.880
<v Speaker 1>ethic for small family units and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible ethic to run a company by.</v>

828
00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:40.640
<v Speaker 1>It looks like conscientiousness is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right ethic to run a company,</v>

829
00:46:40.641 --> 00:46:41.474
<v Speaker 1>but I think conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have good animal models for </v>

830
00:46:43.941 --> 00:46:44.774
<v Speaker 1>conscientious will say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think conscientiousness probably </v>

831
00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:51.680
<v Speaker 1>evolved so that human beings could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could operate in groups that were larger</v>

832
00:46:51.681 --> 00:46:53.800
<v Speaker 1>than just kingsize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

833
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.570
<v Speaker 1>because equity makes sense that a kitten</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

834
00:46:56.571 --> 00:46:57.404
<v Speaker 1>Every mother wants her children to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a good outcome in life and once </v>

835
00:47:00.831 --> 00:47:03.350
<v Speaker 1>resources distributed equally between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

836
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:06.380
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like it's something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a niche</v>

837
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:11.590
<v Speaker 1>micro prioritize intention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our focus on microaggressions,</v>

838
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.433
<v Speaker 1>etc. And other unintentional </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgressions increases our </v>

839
00:47:14.661 --> 00:47:17.060
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do A nice job of criticizing.</v>

840
00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Now I read derald wing sue's book on </v>
<v Speaker 1>microaggression.</v>

841
00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:21.373
<v Speaker 1>It's an appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's appalling load of tripe to put it </v>

842
00:47:24.081 --> 00:47:27.800
<v Speaker 1>bluntly and I believe scott lilienfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a very good psychologist,</v>

843
00:47:27.801 --> 00:47:32.801
<v Speaker 1>has recently published a shredding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>the construct validity of the concept of</v>

844
00:47:33.521 --> 00:47:34.354
<v Speaker 1>microaggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a nonviolent construct right </v>

845
00:47:36.731 --> 00:47:37.564
<v Speaker 1>from the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's purely ideological in nature and </v>

846
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:40.803
<v Speaker 1>it's also one of those constructs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows anyone who's offended to to </v>

847
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.230
<v Speaker 1>weaponize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're weaponized discourse around it.</v>

848
00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:51.760
<v Speaker 1>So reconsider making unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>training bias training.</v>

849
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Mandatory for promotion committees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

850
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:56.320
<v Speaker 1>That should be considered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be stopped.</v>

851
00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:01.440
<v Speaker 1>There's no scientific basis whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 1>for proceeding with that operation.</v>

852
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:04.650
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

853
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:05.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

854
00:48:05.641 --> 00:48:06.474
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty straightforward document </v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned and I've gone </v>

855
00:48:09.721 --> 00:48:10.554
<v Speaker 1>through it with a fairly fine tooth comb</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a behavioral scientist and I would </v>

856
00:48:14.101 --> 00:48:18.630
<v Speaker 1>like to state for the record that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that what you said in there,</v>

857
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:19.703
<v Speaker 1>if not accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was at least representative of the </v>

858
00:48:22.141 --> 00:48:24.240
<v Speaker 1>current state of art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mall,</v>

859
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.193
<v Speaker 1>well trained psychometrically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm informed psYchologists who are </v>

860
00:48:30.001 --> 00:48:32.310
<v Speaker 1>experts in the field of individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>

861
00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:37.850
<v Speaker 1>so congratulations</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay such a price for it.</v>

862
00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:42.003
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well thank you very much for the </v>

863
00:48:44.511 --> 00:48:46.330
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

864
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:49.220
<v Speaker 1>one other question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you agree to talk to me?</v>

865
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:51.103
<v Speaker 1>I am a huge fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I know that you went through similar </v>

866
00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.280
<v Speaker 1>things being any influence on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this you're going to pay on.</v>

867
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sorry.</v>

868
00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to say I was sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not actually really clean.</v>

869
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that you're going to be pay a</v>

870
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:11.363
<v Speaker 1>big price for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that the net consequences will be </v>

871
00:49:13.011 --> 00:49:15.310
<v Speaker 1>very positive and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

872
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I think you did an excellent job on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>document.</v>

873
00:49:18.261 --> 00:49:19.094
<v Speaker 1>I think you were very careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the fact that you're being </v>

874
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:26.630
<v Speaker 1>labeled with episodes and that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>fired is absolutely reprehensible.</v>

875
00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:28.483
<v Speaker 1>It's clear to me that you're just trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what the hell is going on </v>

876
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:36.980
<v Speaker 1>and that you know you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not any of the things that people</v>

877
00:49:36.981 --> 00:49:40.010
<v Speaker 1>would like to think you are so that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to bloody well.</v>

878
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Think about what it is that you said it </v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

879
00:49:41.961 --> 00:49:42.794
<v Speaker 1>so congratulations to you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous people are rare and you put </v>

880
00:49:46.401 --> 00:49:48.980
<v Speaker 1>yourself on the line and I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned that in the last year.</v>

881
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:53.900
<v Speaker 1>So I would say keep your head up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assume that this is gonna work out.</v>

882
00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't hide from the press because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the press is actually,</v>

883
00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:03.050
<v Speaker 1>you're the right person for the press to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be</v>

884
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:08.210
<v Speaker 1>something for you to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know you're well spoken,</v>

885
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:09.350
<v Speaker 1>you're quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

886
00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:11.870
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're convincing your rational.</v>

887
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously at least you come </v>

888
00:50:15.591 --> 00:50:17.960
<v Speaker 1>across as a decent guy very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

889
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:24.830
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason I would say there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason not to let people see who you are</v>

890
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:25.933
<v Speaker 1>because I think that would improve your </v>
<v Speaker 1>credibility and make your message even </v>

891
00:50:29.331 --> 00:50:31.190
<v Speaker 1>more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>

892
00:50:31.191 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 1>no doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

893
00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:35.240
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have every right to defend your privacy,</v>

894
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

895
00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.173
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that you have any </v>

896
00:50:40.011 --> 00:50:40.844
<v Speaker 1>reason to be afraid of depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say a couple of things when </v>

897
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:47.450
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to the press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't apologize.</v>

898
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell people what you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tell them that you're not going to</v>

899
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:58.230
<v Speaker 1>get a massage that's a technical error </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stick to your damn guns.</v>

900
00:50:59.090 --> 00:50:59.690
<v Speaker 1>You kNow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

901
00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as quIetly and forthright as you can.</v>

902
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.880
<v Speaker 1>And now you're going to come out on top </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this because you're,</v>

903
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:09.230
<v Speaker 1>you're on the side of the right as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerneD.</v>
