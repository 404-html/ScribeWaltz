1
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>So the grades will be posted on</v>
<v Speaker 1>blackboard as soon as they're ready and</v>

2
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>all open up the blackboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see.</v>

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so onto the next round of clinicians.</v>

4
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>We're going to focus mostly today on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Rogers.</v>

5
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start with some background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Rogers was a phenomenologist and so</v>

6
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>it's useful to know what that means</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you hear people use words all</v>

7
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>the time like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe not all the time,</v>

8
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.670
<v Speaker 1>probably not the grocery store usually</v>
<v Speaker 1>like phenomenology or existentialism,</v>

9
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism and structuralism and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

10
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's frequently the case that</v>

11
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that easy to figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about and sometimes</v>

12
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>that's because they don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>because it's actually quite difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a reasonable conceptual distinction</v>

14
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>between all those different modes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

15
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.120
<v Speaker 1>And phenomenology came out of philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and its earliest advocate was a guy</v>

16
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>named Edmund has several and it's most</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous proponent was probably heidegger</v>

17
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.870
<v Speaker 1>and a high degree.</v>

18
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Gotten lots of trouble because he ended</v>
<v Speaker 1>up supporting the Nazis at least to some</v>

19
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty good reason to get in</v>

20
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All things considered,</v>

21
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although,</v>

22
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:36.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people did that for 30 some years</v>

23
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so not that that's any excuse.</v>

24
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:44.481
<v Speaker 1>Obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to exactly get your head</v>

25
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 1>around what the phenomenologists are</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

26
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>I was reading about David chalmers this</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

27
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Chalmers,</v>

28
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:58.491
<v Speaker 1>but he's a philosopher who started the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tucson conventions on consciousness and</v>

29
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>chalmers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what I think about</v>

30
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:08.890
<v Speaker 1>gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very charismatic and he's got away</v>

31
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>with words and setting up those</v>
<v Speaker 1>convention center has done a great deal</v>

32
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>for the study of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

33
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I think that what he pointed</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to scientists was obvious.</v>

34
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.110
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 1>when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when psychology was primarily behaviors,</v>

36
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 1>which was back in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came as a big shock to psychologists</v>

37
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>when certain psychologist started to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about cognition.</v>

38
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>They called that the cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

39
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was obvious to everybody but</v>

40
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>psychologists at that point that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

41
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was perhaps the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation with philosophers if it's</v>

42
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 1>pretty obvious to everybody that</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness was a tough nut to crack,</v>

43
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
<v Speaker 1>but the philosophers kind of ignored it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chalmers brought it back into the</v>

44
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>academic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mainstream.</v>

45
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenologists are really all about</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

46
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.470
<v Speaker 1>They just accepted as a fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than trying to deny its existence</v>

47
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>because it can't be easily reduced to</v>
<v Speaker 1>its material.</v>

48
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Substrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chalmers big point was that he couldn't</v>

49
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>understand why evolution couldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced creatures exactly like us who</v>

50
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>have no conscious awareness that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>call them.</v>

51
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:27.361
<v Speaker 1>Zombies fundamentally said that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence of consciousness as an</v>

52
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 1>enduring mystery.</v>

53
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true.</v>

54
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't not sure that we've got anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of figuring out exactly what</v>

55
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite a lot of time and effort put</v>

56
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>into it and despite a lot of tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of work done on the brain.</v>

57
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.410
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists are.</v>

58
00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>They just took it as a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

59
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.340
<v Speaker 1>heidegger believe that western</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy had lost its way really since</v>

60
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:59.551
<v Speaker 1>the time of the Greeks and he thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>that phenomenal or that is primary field</v>

61
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:05.401
<v Speaker 1>of focus should be being itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not reality,</v>

62
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>but being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not easy to understand what he</v>

63
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>meant by it being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

64
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.110
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenal field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a phenomenal field somewhat</v>

65
00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:21.111
<v Speaker 1>captures it so</v>
<v Speaker 1>for height of your reality was what you</v>

66
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he sort of you sort of tip the</v>

67
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>tables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of presuming an objective world</v>

68
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>and then deriving the subjective from</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

69
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:34.711
<v Speaker 1>He presumed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entirety of your experiences were</v>

70
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:40.231
<v Speaker 1>real</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that included your emotions and your</v>

71
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:46.111
<v Speaker 1>felt motivational states and your dreams</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your fantasies and even your</v>

72
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 1>delusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

73
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:56.461
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>heidegger thought that all the elements</v>

74
00:04:56.771 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>of lived reality belonged in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

75
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.950
<v Speaker 1>So if you thought that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams and the reality that you've</v>

76
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 1>shared with other people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from one another,</v>

77
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 1>you'd be just as pathological to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologist as to anyone else.</v>

78
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.370
<v Speaker 1>But they were trying to get back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>central mystery of life.</v>

79
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Which is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is something rather than nothing,</v>

80
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:30.291
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the that we experienced it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the place where Roger Starts.</v>

81
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.160
<v Speaker 1>One of the presumptions of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Rogerian is,</v>

82
00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:46.161
<v Speaker 1>is that in order to help someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to put yourself in their shoes</v>

83
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.490
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to try to see the world from</v>

84
00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:54.290
<v Speaker 1>their perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means adopting</v>

85
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 1>the viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means adopting the reality that</v>

86
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:04.271
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can develop an empathic</v>

87
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>body focused understanding of the person</v>

88
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:09.570
<v Speaker 1>that you're talking to.</v>

89
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.100
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about Rogers for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a devout fundamentalist</v>

90
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Protestant and I think that's important</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know because a lot of his thinking</v>

91
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>has a very strong Protestant flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the reason I concentrate on such</v>

92
00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:35.790
<v Speaker 1>things and the philosophical background</v>
<v Speaker 1>at these things because you have to</v>

93
00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:39.180
<v Speaker 1>understand the axioms of the thinker</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're dealing with or you actually</v>

94
00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:43.440
<v Speaker 1>don't understand them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're assessing the axiomatic</v>

95
00:06:43.441 --> 00:06:47.070
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions of the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're usually outside the thinkers</v>

96
00:06:47.071 --> 00:06:48.510
<v Speaker 1>thought in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Because you're looking at axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get it unless you.</v>

98
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Unless you know the axiom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so Carl Rogers thought was deeply</v>

99
00:06:56.851 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>grounded in his protestantism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his,</v>

100
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.390
<v Speaker 1>his father in particular was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific farmer and applied the</v>

101
00:07:03.391 --> 00:07:05.670
<v Speaker 1>scientific method on the farm that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up in,</v>

102
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 1>and so rogers had a devout</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist background of the sort</v>

103
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.110
<v Speaker 1>that was more typical in the thirties</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the forties,</v>

104
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.410
<v Speaker 1>but he also had a powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the scientific method</v>

105
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.460
<v Speaker 1>and practical observations of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>utility.</v>

106
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.520
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

107
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.310
<v Speaker 1>His first academic training was that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Union theological seminary seminary in</v>

108
00:07:35.311 --> 00:07:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the mission of of that seminary was to</v>
<v Speaker 1>evangelize the world in their</v>

109
00:07:39.481 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I remember correctly,</v>

110
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:47.520
<v Speaker 1>it was when he was on a boat to China to</v>
<v Speaker 1>serve as a missionary that he first</v>

111
00:07:47.521 --> 00:07:50.550
<v Speaker 1>started to question the absolute reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his,</v>

112
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.490
<v Speaker 1>of his Protestant beliefs.</v>

113
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.900
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that he abandoned them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly.</v>

114
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he incorporated them into a approach to</v>

115
00:08:01.951 --> 00:08:06.951
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy that fulfilled all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>preconditions for this.</v>

116
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.870
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this striving towards a kind of</v>

117
00:08:12.871 --> 00:08:16.140
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal perfection that goes along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with protestantism.</v>

118
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>There's an idea that the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>realization of the most fundamental</v>

119
00:08:24.091 --> 00:08:29.091
<v Speaker 1>reality is to be had in direct and</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest communication between two people</v>

120
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.090
<v Speaker 1>and</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or more people.</v>

121
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a place where you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking about it</v>

122
00:08:41.011 --> 00:08:45.840
<v Speaker 1>symbolically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the living word emerges and Roger's</v>

123
00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:48.690
<v Speaker 1>thinking is deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply rooted in in that kind of</v>

124
00:08:48.691 --> 00:08:53.010
<v Speaker 1>conception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly that he believed that if</v>

125
00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 1>you could integrate yourself properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could put yourself together in</v>

126
00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:02.541
<v Speaker 1>some sense at every level of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd be able to exist and</v>

127
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>communicate in a way that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a eddie and flavor to this that</v>

128
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 1>was optimally beneficial to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also optimally beneficial to other</v>

129
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>people at the same time and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would emerge in your interactions</v>

130
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:19.881
<v Speaker 1>with each other in communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's something to think about.</v>

131
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 1>This is a way of approaching what Rogers</v>
<v Speaker 1>was up to.</v>

132
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how you use words.</v>

133
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could use words instrumentally,</v>

134
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.090
<v Speaker 1>but start with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you imagined that you want something</v>

135
00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:41.450
<v Speaker 1>from someone and then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

136
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.900
<v Speaker 1>how can I phrase my argument so that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get back from this person and</v>

137
00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:48.350
<v Speaker 1>then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

138
00:09:48.351 --> 00:09:51.790
<v Speaker 1>what sort of argument would appeal to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person and what buttons can I push</v>

139
00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:56.791
<v Speaker 1>and how can I get what I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're using words in an</v>

140
00:09:56.811 --> 00:09:59.930
<v Speaker 1>instrumental way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're using them as tools to obtain</v>

141
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.320
<v Speaker 1>what you desire from other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

142
00:10:03.321 --> 00:10:06.800
<v Speaker 1>I think if you do that completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a psychopath.</v>

143
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean that because a psychopath has no</v>
<v Speaker 1>room for you at all.</v>

144
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:19.780
<v Speaker 1>It's about him or her and you're there</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be used as an instrumental target.</v>

145
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that every time someone</v>

146
00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:26.600
<v Speaker 1>uses language instrumentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're acting like a psychopath,</v>

147
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.880
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the logical conclusion to that</v>

148
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.110
<v Speaker 1>form of language use.</v>

149
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you might think,</v>

150
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.863
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

151
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.330
<v Speaker 1>you can manage a little kids trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that to their parents,</v>

152
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Siblings will often collude.</v>

153
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:49.590
<v Speaker 1>We'll have a little conspiratorial</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about how to approach one</v>

154
00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:52.530
<v Speaker 1>parent or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually by isolating the parents.</v>

155
00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:57.531
<v Speaker 1>That's a good strategy and then they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase their requests so that they can</v>

156
00:10:57.661 --> 00:11:00.770
<v Speaker 1>extract out the desired benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

157
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.740
<v Speaker 1>I follow these pickup artists online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very interested in their use of</v>

158
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:10.980
<v Speaker 1>psychology and they are instrumental</v>
<v Speaker 1>light would users,</v>

159
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:13.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their trick is they're developing a</v>

160
00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:18.441
<v Speaker 1>whole little hope or of verbal tricks</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they use in attempts to seduce.</v>

161
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a very narrow focus and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>instrumental language.</v>

162
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.580
<v Speaker 1>It says if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personhood of the,</v>

163
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.540
<v Speaker 1>of the target is irrelevant</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

164
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fairly pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can become pathological,</v>

165
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:39.270
<v Speaker 1>very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>

166
00:11:39.271 --> 00:11:41.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you use language if you</v>

167
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:42.840
<v Speaker 1>weren't using instrumental?</v>

168
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a career and you have</v>

169
00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:47.460
<v Speaker 1>to be goal oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be aimed towards things.</v>

170
00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:49.770
<v Speaker 1>And so since you have to be goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented,</v>

171
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.730
<v Speaker 1>how can it be other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would use language instrumentally.</v>

172
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 1>One of the Rogerian position would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be that</v>

173
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.400
<v Speaker 1>you should try to become aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>totality of your subjective experience</v>

174
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 1>so that not only do you feel it in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied sense,</v>

175
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:17.910
<v Speaker 1>but that you represented at a that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented and the representation would</v>

176
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:23.440
<v Speaker 1>be mostly in terms of articulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't clear that Roger is considered</v>

177
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:25.270
<v Speaker 1>other forms of representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

178
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 1>for Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movement towards health is an</v>

179
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 1>integrative process and it gets very</v>
<v Speaker 1>body focused,</v>

180
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 1>but the outcome of that integrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>process which Rogers would say is the</v>

181
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:45.781
<v Speaker 1>ability to live the good life is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your language is no longer instrumental.</v>

182
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.790
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing instead is attempting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to state the truth as you see it because</v>

183
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:57.850
<v Speaker 1>of course your truth as a partial truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the basket you can do is,</v>

184
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think the best you can do is</v>

185
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:03.190
<v Speaker 1>not lie because you can't tell the truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're too damn stupid,</v>

186
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:04.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know enough to tell the truth,</v>

187
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 1>but you can certainly do your best to</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent what you know is clearly as</v>

188
00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:12.130
<v Speaker 1>you possibly can in your communication</v>
<v Speaker 1>with other people.</v>

189
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.640
<v Speaker 1>And so rogers believed that it was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral responsibility of the therapist to</v>

190
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:23.560
<v Speaker 1>do that personally and then that to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree that that was being done in the</v>

191
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:27.970
<v Speaker 1>therapy and the therapy</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and the therapeutic</v>

192
00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:31.750
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that in and of itself would be</v>

193
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:36.190
<v Speaker 1>healing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so basically Roger's theory is that</v>

194
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 1>honest communication heels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

195
00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's quite an interesting theory.</v>

196
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:46.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

197
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not completely unaligned from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's earlier claims,</v>

198
00:13:49.831 --> 00:13:50.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Freud</v>

199
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.510
<v Speaker 1>basically presumed that it was.</v>

200
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't put so much of a moral element</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

201
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.930
<v Speaker 1>He reviewed the person more as as being</v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped between titanic opposing forces,</v>

202
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:13.190
<v Speaker 1>the IED underneath and the superego on</v>
<v Speaker 1>top important illegals are crunched up</v>

203
00:14:13.191 --> 00:14:18.050
<v Speaker 1>in the middle and as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being pulled and product and crushed by</v>

204
00:14:18.051 --> 00:14:23.051
<v Speaker 1>those titanic forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology was likely to emerge and he</v>

205
00:14:23.421 --> 00:14:26.620
<v Speaker 1>talked about repression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for attendant,</v>

206
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:31.630
<v Speaker 1>if you repression as an unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>process for for Rogers,</v>

207
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:37.700
<v Speaker 1>the moral element of the therapeutic</v>
<v Speaker 1>process is much clearer,</v>

208
00:14:37.701 --> 00:14:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of the time when you listened</v>

209
00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:43.970
<v Speaker 1>to Rogers or you read what he had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

210
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.380
<v Speaker 1>the injunctions that he's laying out or</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral injunction now,</v>

211
00:14:48.381 --> 00:14:52.700
<v Speaker 1>it's quite interesting because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily of psychotherapy as a moral</v>

212
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:57.330
<v Speaker 1>endeavor and I really never thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it that way fully until I read.</v>

213
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 1>I was reading were on trust at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

214
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.080
<v Speaker 1>but you don't talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait out.</v>

215
00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:05.570
<v Speaker 1>The proposition in this book that most</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the problems,</v>

216
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.960
<v Speaker 1>many of the problems that people came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see a therapist about,</v>

217
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.110
<v Speaker 1>we're actually moral problem since they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were moral problems of various sorts.</v>

218
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Now sometimes the person was in trouble</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they had done something</v>

219
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:20.780
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously wrong.</v>

220
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 1>You had one client,</v>

221
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.830
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

222
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.960
<v Speaker 1>and he discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

223
00:15:31.961 --> 00:15:36.910
<v Speaker 1>that she had killed her children and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that when they were young.</v>

224
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.390
<v Speaker 1>She had them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She let them become exposed to</v>

225
00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.250
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>

226
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.780
<v Speaker 1>She didn't take the proper precautions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason she did that was because</v>

227
00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:50.560
<v Speaker 1>she wanted to marry someone and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't very interested in her children.</v>

228
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:56.080
<v Speaker 1>So you might consider that a moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem apparently.</v>

229
00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it was weighing on her</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>

230
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as might well now it's a strange thing</v>

231
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:07.210
<v Speaker 1>because in some sense what she did was</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn a blind eye to something she could</v>

232
00:16:07.211 --> 00:16:11.080
<v Speaker 1>have prevented it in legal terms that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>known as willful blindness,</v>

233
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.190
<v Speaker 1>but she knew whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

234
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.470
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of different levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>

235
00:16:17.471 --> 00:16:19.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can know something in your body,</v>

236
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.550
<v Speaker 1>you can know something in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

237
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.040
<v Speaker 1>You can know something in articulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

238
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the whole issue of knowing it's a</v>

239
00:16:27.131 --> 00:16:32.131
<v Speaker 1>very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rogers</v>

240
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.280
<v Speaker 1>definitely believed as far as I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

241
00:16:38.281 --> 00:16:43.281
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a moral dimension to life that</v>

242
00:16:43.921 --> 00:16:47.550
<v Speaker 1>it was identifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in some sense it was linear,</v>

243
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.690
<v Speaker 1>that it had an observable process which</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the continual integration of</v>

244
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.370
<v Speaker 1>experienced within the phenomenal field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ironing out of contradictions within</v>

245
00:16:56.371 --> 00:16:58.350
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenal field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>

246
00:16:58.351 --> 00:16:59.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you,</v>

247
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.430
<v Speaker 1>when you feel one way and you say</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>

248
00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:03.803
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all in,</v>

249
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.900
<v Speaker 1>you're all perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with that experience.</v>

250
00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:12.870
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my experience with people has been that,</v>

251
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.410
<v Speaker 1>and this is another issue with</v>
<v Speaker 1>instrumental use of language.</v>

252
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:16.951
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

253
00:17:16.951 --> 00:17:18.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you using your language for?</v>

254
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to get what you want,</v>

255
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.270
<v Speaker 1>but that can be consciously manipulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then maybe we'll say,</v>

256
00:17:24.271 --> 00:17:27.210
<v Speaker 1>well that's what the psychopath is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the psychopath is not only</v>

257
00:17:27.211 --> 00:17:30.480
<v Speaker 1>consciously manipulative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also unconsciously manipulative</v>

258
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.000
<v Speaker 1>because he's been practicing it for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>three decades,</v>

259
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.840
<v Speaker 1>so all the little machines in his head</v>
<v Speaker 1>header deceptive to and they run on</v>

260
00:17:36.841 --> 00:17:41.280
<v Speaker 1>automatic so he'll just lie just to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he can pull one over on you because</v>

261
00:17:41.281 --> 00:17:43.950
<v Speaker 1>that demonstrates that not only is he</v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter than you,</v>

262
00:17:43.951 --> 00:17:46.470
<v Speaker 1>but that you deserve to be victimized</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're such an idiot.</v>

263
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:51.070
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people use instrument language like</v>

264
00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:52.900
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only consciously to get what they</v>

265
00:17:52.901 --> 00:17:54.040
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

266
00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.610
<v Speaker 1>it's something that we definitely think</v>
<v Speaker 1>of is characteristic for example,</v>

267
00:17:57.611 --> 00:17:59.440
<v Speaker 1>of teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

268
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean there isn't a teen movie that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been made in the last 50 years.</v>

269
00:18:03.311 --> 00:18:07.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't claim that it doesn't deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative consequences of using</v>

270
00:18:07.271 --> 00:18:08.620
<v Speaker 1>instrumental language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

271
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Basically the team has put in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>position where they're being polled hold</v>

272
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.900
<v Speaker 1>by maybe various social forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different friendship groups or,</v>

273
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.943
<v Speaker 1>or there's a</v>

274
00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:20.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a</v>

275
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.600
<v Speaker 2>contractor</v>

276
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.440
<v Speaker 1>interrelationship between what their</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and their parents want or what</v>

277
00:18:26.441 --> 00:18:29.950
<v Speaker 1>their friends wanting their school wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what they want and their friends want</v>

278
00:18:29.951 --> 00:18:33.250
<v Speaker 1>or what the school wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of these things are pulling and</v>

279
00:18:33.251 --> 00:18:36.730
<v Speaker 1>pushing in different directions and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>directions are essentially in some,</v>

280
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.360
<v Speaker 1>in some sense the directions or moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're all about what to do.</v>

281
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.260
<v Speaker 1>And the plot of the movie is how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenager,</v>

282
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.800
<v Speaker 1>it's usually a Rogerian plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually about how the teenager</v>

283
00:18:47.801 --> 00:18:51.580
<v Speaker 1>comes to more to fuller self</v>
<v Speaker 1>realization,</v>

284
00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that they're able to,</v>

285
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:58.910
<v Speaker 1>that they're able to stave off the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temptations that are posed sometimes</v>

286
00:18:59.561 --> 00:19:04.120
<v Speaker 1>by the authorities so they don't become</v>
<v Speaker 1>too obedient and sometimes by their</v>

287
00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:08.530
<v Speaker 1>peers so that they don't become only a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection of peer pressure</v>

288
00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:13.740
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely peer pressure is up here if</v>

289
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.050
<v Speaker 2>your pressure is absolutely fab.</v>

290
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.790
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're using language to fit</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

291
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.140
<v Speaker 1>well that's also instrumental use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>language and for and for Rogers,</v>

292
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:30.360
<v Speaker 1>that would be one of the sources of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>

293
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very much worth taking this</v>

294
00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:36.234
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

295
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.143
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

296
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.160
<v Speaker 1>here's an example that I thought about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

297
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 1>What do you do if you're at work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone tells you to do something that</v>

298
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:48.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean that.</v>

299
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume you're disciplined,</v>

300
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that you're not just lazy and</v>

301
00:19:53.011 --> 00:19:54.690
<v Speaker 1>worthless and that's why you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

302
00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:56.700
<v Speaker 1>And you want to ask yourself that first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

303
00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe you're just being lazy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>worthless and you should pull yourself</v>

304
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:02.940
<v Speaker 1>together and do the thing you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

305
00:20:02.941 --> 00:20:05.730
<v Speaker 1>but failing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you're being asked to do</v>

306
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:10.560
<v Speaker 1>something that you're finding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're having a very difficult time to</v>

307
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:13.770
<v Speaker 1>get motivated to do so that'd be one</v>
<v Speaker 1>clue.</v>

308
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.270
<v Speaker 1>And that it's also making you uneasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're waking up in the middle of the</v>

309
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.360
<v Speaker 1>night and you're being anxious and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>running through your mind.</v>

310
00:20:20.361 --> 00:20:21.194
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

311
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:26.380
<v Speaker 2>what should you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

312
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:29.770
<v Speaker 2>it's your job.</v>

313
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Someone who's in the hierarchy above you</v>
<v Speaker 1>is telling you to do it.</v>

314
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

315
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

316
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.430
<v Speaker 1>why can't you just go ahead and do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

317
00:20:41.431 --> 00:20:42.091
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

318
00:20:42.091 --> 00:20:44.400
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's quasi criminal and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of getting caught,</v>

319
00:20:44.401 --> 00:20:45.720
<v Speaker 1>but let's forget about that for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

320
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's assume that the profitability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a low level moral</v>

321
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:53.530
<v Speaker 1>transgression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not precisely illegal and even so</v>

322
00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:55.780
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught is very low.</v>

323
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Why would it bother you and should you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that seriously?</v>

324
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Now Rogers would claim that the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would bother you is because it would</v>

325
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.740
<v Speaker 1>make the structure of yourself system</v>
<v Speaker 1>inconsistent.</v>

326
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.580
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine you're trying to organize a</v>

327
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:21.770
<v Speaker 1>group of people to do some tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

328
00:21:21.771 --> 00:21:25.660
<v Speaker 1>like maybe they're in a row and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fill in a hole in the road and so you</v>

329
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:29.320
<v Speaker 1>have to put people in a row and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't drugs down the line,</v>

330
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:31.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you got one person in there who's</v>

331
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.470
<v Speaker 1>trying to put rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rocks go the other way or dropping</v>

332
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:38.710
<v Speaker 1>them or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then obviously the entire structure</v>

333
00:21:38.711 --> 00:21:41.710
<v Speaker 1>is not going to function properly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because there's an internal</v>

334
00:21:41.711 --> 00:21:43.690
<v Speaker 1>inconsistency in 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

335
00:21:43.691 --> 00:21:46.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a fundamental presupposition of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

336
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.500
<v Speaker 1>of logic.</v>

337
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.330
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe the most fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle of communication that a thing</v>

338
00:21:52.331 --> 00:21:55.540
<v Speaker 1>can't be itself and something else at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

339
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.490
<v Speaker 1>That's the principle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>noncontradiction.</v>

340
00:21:57.491 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the hypothesis here would be that</v>

341
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:05.380
<v Speaker 1>you have to follow the principle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>noncontradiction with regards to the</v>

342
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:09.670
<v Speaker 1>organization of your own self and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>self would be,</v>

343
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Roger's thinks about that as an art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a differentiated field,</v>

344
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.480
<v Speaker 1>subfield of the phenomenal field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

345
00:22:16.481 --> 00:22:21.481
<v Speaker 1>So you're always experiencing things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what you experience is the EU at</v>

346
00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:24.760
<v Speaker 1>the center of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the self as far as Roger's is</v>

347
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:28.990
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the proposition would be you have to</v>

348
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:34.050
<v Speaker 1>organize the self in a non contradictory</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner or well,</v>

349
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.630
<v Speaker 1>or what well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you feel negative emotion.</v>

350
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Now he would think about that as anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

351
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The narrative around the test make it</v>

352
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.493
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

353
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Well that might work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

354
00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a very good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated question because what you're</v>

355
00:22:56.891 --> 00:22:57.611
<v Speaker 1>asking is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

356
00:22:57.611 --> 00:23:00.750
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't be rationalized effectively.</v>

357
00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Speaker 1>That's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

358
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:11.650
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a postmodern theory I would say</v>

359
00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:15.100
<v Speaker 1>in some sense because the postmodern</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to claim that there's nothing</v>

360
00:23:15.101 --> 00:23:17.140
<v Speaker 1>outside of the text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

361
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And then things in some sense are</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely malleable and that the</v>

362
00:23:20.981 --> 00:23:24.670
<v Speaker 1>malleability comes as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different narratives that you might</v>

363
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.870
<v Speaker 1>might weave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Rogers would point out that,</v>

364
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that you pointed out is</v>

365
00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:32.860
<v Speaker 1>that stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it is.</v>

366
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's all sorts of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are characteristics of your</v>

367
00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.630
<v Speaker 1>characteristic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your experience that have a non pecs,</v>

368
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.770
<v Speaker 1>like phenomenology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

369
00:23:42.771 --> 00:23:45.770
<v Speaker 1>like I think it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to claim that pain is,</v>

370
00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.950
<v Speaker 1>is textual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

371
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.160
<v Speaker 1>And we do know that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can manipulate the way an organism</v>

372
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 1>feels pain quite extensively.</v>

373
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you whack the dog on the nose with a</v>

374
00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:01.400
<v Speaker 1>newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time it goes to eat,</v>

375
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.340
<v Speaker 1>it will starve to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can teach it not to eat very</v>

376
00:24:04.341 --> 00:24:06.770
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you're doing is you're</v>

377
00:24:06.771 --> 00:24:10.630
<v Speaker 1>teaching the dog that hunger is</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishing and then it transforms Hungary</v>

378
00:24:10.631 --> 00:24:14.420
<v Speaker 1>into anxiety and then it won't heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I'm telling you that is</v>

379
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:16.910
<v Speaker 1>because even something as fundamental as</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

380
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.430
<v Speaker 1>which you might think about as I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic phenomena,</v>

381
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.090
<v Speaker 1>can be modulated by learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are limits to that.</v>

382
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.680
<v Speaker 1>They're evident limits to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

383
00:24:24.681 --> 00:24:29.681
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem with reading a</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative is that even if it's complex</v>

384
00:24:29.781 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 1>and sophisticated and so you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced yourself,</v>

385
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.760
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't necessarily mean that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions and perceptions undertaken as a</v>

386
00:24:37.761 --> 00:24:41.540
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that formulation are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be commensurate with the rest</v>

387
00:24:41.541 --> 00:24:42.590
<v Speaker 1>of your personality.</v>

388
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a big risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

389
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.600
<v Speaker 1>so and I think it is the risk that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people run when they tell themselves or</v>

390
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:53.930
<v Speaker 1>act out a deep falsa now because for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers,</v>

391
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.120
<v Speaker 1>you could also act out false hoods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

392
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.620
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosophers call that a</v>

393
00:24:57.621 --> 00:25:00.500
<v Speaker 1>performative contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you say one thing and do</v>

394
00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:02.090
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of lie,</v>

395
00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:04.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's an embodied line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers was,</v>

396
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.240
<v Speaker 1>he was a very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was very cognizant of embodiment as</v>

397
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a central human feature,</v>

398
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.240
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very concerned about the fact</v>

399
00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:18.500
<v Speaker 1>that the representational structures had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take into account the realities of</v>

400
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 1>the underlying biology and those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those would be felt states in a</v>

401
00:25:21.621 --> 00:25:24.720
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the Rogerian answers,</v>

402
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.700
<v Speaker 1>you can't get away with it that easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that'll do is it'll produce</v>

403
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:33.730
<v Speaker 1>contradictions as you move forward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those contradictions will will unsettle</v>

404
00:25:34.221 --> 00:25:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you either in a minor way or in a deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

405
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell by Rogers,</v>

406
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:46.420
<v Speaker 1>never really formalized a theory about</v>
<v Speaker 1>why something is deep and why something</v>

407
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.320
<v Speaker 1>was shallow in terms of it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>misrepresentation,</v>

408
00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:56.321
<v Speaker 1>but we've already talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about the hierarchical</v>

409
00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:58.430
<v Speaker 1>structure that I've showed you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times,</v>

410
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.870
<v Speaker 1>the idea there is that higher level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abstraction that you mess around</v>

411
00:26:02.871 --> 00:26:06.040
<v Speaker 1>with the more of your personality you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologize said,</v>

412
00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking this week too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that hierarchy,</v>

413
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:11.600
<v Speaker 1>you know the one I showed you many</v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

414
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:14.090
<v Speaker 1>I believe I have anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little aids in rows.</v>

415
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the structure of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious actually,</v>

416
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.950
<v Speaker 1>so and you'll miss about without at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>peril because you're programming your</v>

417
00:26:21.951 --> 00:26:26.540
<v Speaker 1>own perceptions and your actions and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rogerian presupposition,</v>

418
00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.750
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I'm talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions that underlied his</v>

419
00:26:29.751 --> 00:26:33.980
<v Speaker 1>thinking because the Rogerian approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>is based on a deep presupposition,</v>

420
00:26:33.981 --> 00:26:38.240
<v Speaker 1>which is that honest integration</v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

421
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

422
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.100
<v Speaker 1>perhaps not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

423
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the question that people have</v>

424
00:26:43.981 --> 00:26:45.900
<v Speaker 1>been debating since the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

425
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 1>but my experience as a therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>

426
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anyone get away with</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

427
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I think every time you do something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know isn't right,</v>

428
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.150
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get all up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sooner or later.</v>

429
00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Now you made me blinded yourself so</v>
<v Speaker 1>badly because of your ms apprehensions</v>

430
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:09.360
<v Speaker 1>and deceptions that you can't see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>causal connection between what you did</v>

431
00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:10.770
<v Speaker 1>and the punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

432
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:15.771
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it takes years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapeutic investigation to,</v>

433
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.680
<v Speaker 1>to lay out the causal narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>

434
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Why would anybody ever think they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>bend the structure of reality and get</v>

435
00:27:24.901 --> 00:27:25.860
<v Speaker 1>away with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

436
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.890
<v Speaker 1>to me it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know those plastic rulers,</v>

437
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:32.350
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can hold one of those in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of your nose and bended forward</v>

438
00:27:32.351 --> 00:27:34.080
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as you let go,</v>

439
00:27:34.081 --> 00:27:37.110
<v Speaker 1>it's going to hit you in the face and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

440
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:40.170
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to curse face faith</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've got hit in the face,</v>

441
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.850
<v Speaker 1>but you bent the down ruler.</v>

442
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Economic incentive as far as like you</v>

443
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:50.990
<v Speaker 2>need to survive in order to have a life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your view raped,</v>

444
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:55.990
<v Speaker 2>like having your economic needs as being</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher than dealing with this unsettled</v>

445
00:27:56.190 --> 00:28:00.130
<v Speaker 2>have been in the scenario because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like being at work and fulfilling the</v>

446
00:28:00.131 --> 00:28:04.750
<v Speaker 2>needs of the task has been assigned to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you by your superior than you still</v>

447
00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.220
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still get to survive so you can take</v>

448
00:28:06.221 --> 00:28:10.240
<v Speaker 2>easily to have a roof over your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just have to sort of deal with</v>

449
00:28:10.241 --> 00:28:12.210
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of this slight subtle.</v>

450
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

451
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say sometimes people are put</v>

452
00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:20.400
<v Speaker 1>into positions that unsettled them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what to do.</v>

453
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:22.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of,</v>

454
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:25.110
<v Speaker 1>they're screwed if they do this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're screwed if they do that and</v>

455
00:28:25.111 --> 00:28:28.620
<v Speaker 1>that's all they can see to do and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>get put in those situations all the</v>

456
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

457
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.000
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really going to talk about those</v>

458
00:28:33.001 --> 00:28:34.770
<v Speaker 1>except that people really suffer for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

459
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.253
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

460
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.960
<v Speaker 1>partly what Rogers is talking about is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of optimal organization,</v>

461
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's to be considered as the final</v>

462
00:28:48.321 --> 00:28:50.930
<v Speaker 1>goal in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you're working towards.</v>

463
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very difficult to live in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you,</v>

464
00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.440
<v Speaker 1>so that you never encountered</v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions as you move forward.</v>

465
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.860
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's precisely what does happen as you</v>

466
00:29:00.861 --> 00:29:05.861
<v Speaker 1>move forward and it's up to you on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly to Oregon to organize your response</v>

467
00:29:06.381 --> 00:29:10.100
<v Speaker 1>to those contradictions in a manner that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't destabilize the entire</v>

468
00:29:10.101 --> 00:29:11.570
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

469
00:29:11.571 --> 00:29:13.880
<v Speaker 1>the entire structure is a strange thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>because again,</v>

470
00:29:13.881 --> 00:29:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Rogers Rogers has gotten a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic.</v>

471
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly right.</v>

472
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.120
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated</v>

473
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:27.420
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy that Roger's describes his</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of the self.</v>

474
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.770
<v Speaker 1>This is something he doesn't discuss</v>
<v Speaker 1>that much.</v>

475
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:36.120
<v Speaker 1>The hierarchy that you make of yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>as not independent of the way that you</v>

476
00:29:36.121 --> 00:29:40.240
<v Speaker 1>fit into hierarchies in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really by hierarchically reorganizing</v>

477
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.570
<v Speaker 1>yourself the same time you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchically organizing the world.</v>

478
00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:47.020
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you destabilize yourself or</v>

479
00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:50.020
<v Speaker 1>if you come up with a sub optimal</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution,</v>

480
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a twist there that's going to,</v>

481
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 1>it's going to follow you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it may be the best that you've got.</v>

482
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

483
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that you can always solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>a problem in an optimal manner,</v>

484
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.810
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the movie Sophie's</v>

485
00:30:04.811 --> 00:30:07.180
<v Speaker 1>choice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that movie?</v>

486
00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:08.743
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

487
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Sophie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a movie about that,</v>

488
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.560
<v Speaker 1>about Germany during the Nazi period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had to choose which of her two</v>

489
00:30:17.561 --> 00:30:20.350
<v Speaker 1>children was going to be shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

490
00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:22.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty hard to come up with an</v>

491
00:30:22.391 --> 00:30:25.800
<v Speaker 1>optimal</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to that problem.</v>

492
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.733
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

493
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Roger's though didn't really think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actual problems in life constituted</v>

494
00:30:33.571 --> 00:30:36.690
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of more the existentialist.</v>

495
00:30:36.691 --> 00:30:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Although he had an existential twist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was thinking more that what</v>

496
00:30:40.681 --> 00:30:44.880
<v Speaker 1>constituted psychopathology per se</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of just plain ordinary suffering</v>

497
00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:50.400
<v Speaker 1>was the contradictions that arose</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people fail to use their</v>

498
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:56.660
<v Speaker 1>potential for articulation in a manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>that continually fostered their</v>

499
00:30:56.701 --> 00:30:58.110
<v Speaker 1>integration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he would say,</v>

500
00:30:58.111 --> 00:30:59.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that you were going to use</v>

501
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.310
<v Speaker 1>instrumental language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a term he used,</v>

502
00:31:02.311 --> 00:31:06.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good summary of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his philosophy that you were bringing</v>

503
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:09.930
<v Speaker 1>to bear on yourself unless and others</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

504
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Unnecessary pain and suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was psychopathological.</v>

505
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.640
<v Speaker 1>It's psychopathological because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary because in principle it</v>

506
00:31:17.641 --> 00:31:18.570
<v Speaker 1>could be avoided.</v>

507
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:20.763
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

508
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.870
<v Speaker 1>So that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea as well as the</v>

509
00:31:27.871 --> 00:31:32.280
<v Speaker 1>organizing principle that brings you</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this optimally functioning</v>

510
00:31:32.281 --> 00:31:37.281
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy is your commitment to truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to accurately represent what it is that</v>

511
00:31:38.101 --> 00:31:40.320
<v Speaker 1>you experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's again,</v>

512
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:44.610
<v Speaker 1>you know how Piaget talked about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental truth as a process rather</v>

513
00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:49.611
<v Speaker 1>than as a state or a fact it's the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Rogerian phenomenon phenomenology as</v>

514
00:31:50.101 --> 00:31:51.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could kind of understand that</v>

515
00:31:51.571 --> 00:31:54.150
<v Speaker 1>because of course therapists are dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people,</v>

516
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.540
<v Speaker 1>living people and life is a process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a state.</v>

517
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:02.900
<v Speaker 1>And so rogers was concentrating very</v>
<v Speaker 1>much on the process which he regarded as</v>

518
00:32:03.691 --> 00:32:06.660
<v Speaker 1>absolutely crucial and believe that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

519
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:10.830
<v Speaker 1>the process properly implemented would</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring about the best possible</v>

520
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:14.940
<v Speaker 1>organization and then we'll update that</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization as necessary to.</v>

521
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:19.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's a radical idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would also say that it's</v>

522
00:32:19.141 --> 00:32:24.030
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally rooted in his Protestant</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity because one of the tenants</v>

523
00:32:24.031 --> 00:32:28.140
<v Speaker 1>of Christianity is that the word orders</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

524
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:33.010
<v Speaker 1>And so that idea was lurking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of Roger's conceptual structure</v>

525
00:32:33.011 --> 00:32:36.200
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was intelligent enough to articulate</v>

526
00:32:36.201 --> 00:32:39.410
<v Speaker 1>it fully in a modern way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's still where it came from.</v>

527
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Now it's an older idea of Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

528
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.080
<v Speaker 1>now Roger is also believed some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in there.</v>

529
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.720
<v Speaker 1>And this is where I think he gets a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit optimistic,</v>

530
00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:55.310
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's no fool.</v>

531
00:32:55.311 --> 00:32:59.450
<v Speaker 1>So Rogers is one of those optimists you</v>
<v Speaker 1>really have to contend with.</v>

532
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Now he believed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is a classical</v>

533
00:33:04.101 --> 00:33:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Protestant belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is as well that what evil was was</v>

534
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.400
<v Speaker 1>basically the absence of good and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people had a strong in intrinsic impulse</v>

535
00:33:14.271 --> 00:33:18.650
<v Speaker 1>towards the good that you could help</v>
<v Speaker 1>them realize and the way you help them</v>

536
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:21.380
<v Speaker 1>realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was by setting the preconditions</v>

537
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:26.381
<v Speaker 1>for the emergence of that good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he believed that the preconditions</v>

538
00:33:26.721 --> 00:33:27.554
<v Speaker 1>were</v>

539
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.450
<v Speaker 1>the provision of a space for</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

540
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:41.920
<v Speaker 1>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no judgment in the sense of</v>

541
00:33:42.021 --> 00:33:47.021
<v Speaker 1>rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's the Rogerian theory with</v>

542
00:33:48.681 --> 00:33:53.681
<v Speaker 1>regards to therapeutic endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the first thing is,</v>

543
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.010
<v Speaker 1>and this seems critical and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers was right about this,</v>

544
00:33:58.011 --> 00:34:03.011
<v Speaker 1>that a client has to want to change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is.</v>

545
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.010
<v Speaker 1>This is a funny thing about therapy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because my observation has been that</v>

546
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not something you can impose on</v>
<v Speaker 1>people unless they've decided that</v>

547
00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:15.170
<v Speaker 1>things could be better and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>alterations in,</v>

548
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.290
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in something they're doing might make it</v>

549
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.540
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a nonstarter.</v>

550
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.620
<v Speaker 1>And so I've had clients who were court</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordered to attend therapy and that's</v>

551
00:34:24.621 --> 00:34:27.680
<v Speaker 1>just complete waste of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're more on the</v>

552
00:34:27.681 --> 00:34:30.470
<v Speaker 1>psychopathic end of things because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

553
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.110
<v Speaker 1>if they don't want to change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to learn.</v>

554
00:34:33.111 --> 00:34:38.000
<v Speaker 1>And this is actually another Rogerian</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle because Roger's had an</v>

555
00:34:38.001 --> 00:34:42.350
<v Speaker 1>educational philosophy as well and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational philosophy was students will</v>

556
00:34:42.351 --> 00:34:44.420
<v Speaker 1>not learn things that are not relevant</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

557
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:50.650
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the teachers duties was to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the material at hand relevant</v>

558
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:55.610
<v Speaker 1>because that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>help the students remember it.</v>

559
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.430
<v Speaker 1>Why remembered if it's not relevant to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I tried to do in my</v>

560
00:34:58.431 --> 00:35:01.490
<v Speaker 1>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to tell people when I'm lecturing,</v>

561
00:35:01.491 --> 00:35:04.490
<v Speaker 1>why they should know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fundamental answer always,</v>

562
00:35:04.491 --> 00:35:07.670
<v Speaker 1>if you push it down far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you know this,</v>

563
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.240
<v Speaker 1>your life will go better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so will the life of people around</v>

564
00:35:11.241 --> 00:35:13.120
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you should listen because then</v>

565
00:35:13.121 --> 00:35:16.940
<v Speaker 1>there's some things that are sharp and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointy that you will run into while</v>

566
00:35:16.941 --> 00:35:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you're wandering around in the fog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and,</v>

567
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.480
<v Speaker 1>and that's the fundamental issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

568
00:35:21.481 --> 00:35:26.150
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary to know these things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're dealing with someone who</v>

569
00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:29.060
<v Speaker 1>hasn't decided that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and that they have something to do</v>

570
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:30.950
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe they could change and that</v>

571
00:35:30.951 --> 00:35:32.120
<v Speaker 1>would make things better.</v>

572
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.570
<v Speaker 1>You're not going anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Rogers would also say that's</v>

573
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:41.250
<v Speaker 1>actually a precondition for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship period because he didn't</v>

574
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 1>really make much of a distinction</v>
<v Speaker 1>between a therapeutic relationship and a</v>

575
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.320
<v Speaker 1>genuine relationship because he thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genuine relationships with</v>

576
00:35:48.321 --> 00:35:53.321
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic and so one of the principles</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can extract from that is that</v>

577
00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:58.521
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one useful proposition is that,</v>

578
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty perfect,</v>

579
00:36:01.381 --> 00:36:03.870
<v Speaker 1>but you're probably not quite as perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you could be.</v>

580
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.850
<v Speaker 1>And so it's possible that your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how deeply flawed they are,</v>

581
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 1>might now and then have something to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you that would,</v>

582
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.150
<v Speaker 1>if you incorporated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would bring you to an even higher state</v>

583
00:36:15.151 --> 00:36:16.560
<v Speaker 1>of perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

584
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:20.430
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you have to listen and it's</v>

585
00:36:20.431 --> 00:36:23.340
<v Speaker 1>worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this again is a Rogerian</v>

586
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:27.150
<v Speaker 1>observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have to help them criticize</v>

587
00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:29.430
<v Speaker 1>you because maybe they're not very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

588
00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's something they're trying</v>

589
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:35.570
<v Speaker 1>to tell you and they're stumbling way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

590
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.990
<v Speaker 1>it's an actual thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't articulate it and so it</v>

591
00:36:38.991 --> 00:36:41.670
<v Speaker 1>would be easy for you just to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're trying to use</v>

592
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:44.910
<v Speaker 1>language instrumentally and to get away</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it just to,</v>

593
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:49.770
<v Speaker 1>while you could even make fun of the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're poorly articulating the problem,</v>

594
00:36:49.771 --> 00:36:52.590
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good one because then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can convince them not to do such</v>

595
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:55.500
<v Speaker 1>things in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you take the other stance,</v>

596
00:36:55.501 --> 00:36:57.210
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

597
00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I've got some things to learn and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got some things to learn and you've got</v>

598
00:37:00.421 --> 00:37:03.360
<v Speaker 1>some things to teach me and I've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things to teach you and God only</v>

599
00:37:03.361 --> 00:37:05.580
<v Speaker 1>knows when that's gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might happen.</v>

600
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:09.660
<v Speaker 1>So the object of the conversation is for</v>
<v Speaker 1>each person to help the other person</v>

601
00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:10.620
<v Speaker 1>make their point.</v>

602
00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.720
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot different than winning</v>

603
00:37:12.721 --> 00:37:14.730
<v Speaker 1>the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you one thing,</v>

604
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:19.800
<v Speaker 1>you will not win an argument with any</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate partner ever because you're not</v>

605
00:37:19.801 --> 00:37:23.430
<v Speaker 1>playing the game of the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're playing the game of iterated</v>

606
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:27.270
<v Speaker 1>arguments across time and so if you win</v>
<v Speaker 1>an argument,</v>

607
00:37:27.271 --> 00:37:32.100
<v Speaker 1>you just set up another one winning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>solving the problem or the same thing,</v>

608
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.030
<v Speaker 1>so from a Rogerian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>winning would be the maintenance of your</v>

609
00:37:36.031 --> 00:37:41.031
<v Speaker 1>current self structure at the cost of</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure to integrate some disintegrated</v>

610
00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:46.590
<v Speaker 1>element of the phenomenological realm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it'd be the unhappiness of your</v>

611
00:37:46.591 --> 00:37:48.330
<v Speaker 1>partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be one of them.</v>

612
00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Now you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you win the argument,</v>

613
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:54.570
<v Speaker 1>that's the rationalization issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally you don't have to change,</v>

614
00:37:54.571 --> 00:37:59.571
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is you do have to change</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the way you are is giving rise</v>

615
00:38:00.301 --> 00:38:03.240
<v Speaker 1>to this situation and that's not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to change unless you fix it.</v>

616
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.610
<v Speaker 1>So winning an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixing something,</v>

617
00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:08.130
<v Speaker 1>those are completely different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fixed the thing,</v>

618
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:13.220
<v Speaker 1>it goes away and often you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couples have to have conflict because</v>

619
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:16.710
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thinking.</v>

620
00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Thinking is a form of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that you,</v>

621
00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.110
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make it an interior form of war,</v>

622
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:25.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a without conflict</v>

623
00:38:25.141 --> 00:38:28.650
<v Speaker 1>because life is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Difficult and people differ from one</v>

624
00:38:28.651 --> 00:38:30.990
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have different value structures</v>

625
00:38:30.991 --> 00:38:34.980
<v Speaker 1>and so you can't just ignore that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to set up a dialogue because it's</v>

626
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:37.450
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily obvious who's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

627
00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Rogers believed that in the therapeutic</v>
<v Speaker 1>realm too.</v>

628
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:44.080
<v Speaker 1>So he thought if therapy as something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that emerged as a consequence of the</v>

629
00:38:44.081 --> 00:38:47.710
<v Speaker 1>adoption of certain axiomatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions and those were</v>

630
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:53.710
<v Speaker 1>things could be better than they are and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make them that way and that's</v>

631
00:38:53.711 --> 00:38:54.880
<v Speaker 1>also true for me.</v>

632
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.840
<v Speaker 1>And then the next presumption is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe we can figure out how to do</v>

633
00:38:58.841 --> 00:39:03.490
<v Speaker 1>that in a collaborative with</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborative communication.</v>

634
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:08.770
<v Speaker 1>So Rogers believed that the therapist</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just as transformed during the</v>

635
00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:11.260
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic process as the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

636
00:39:11.261 --> 00:39:16.120
<v Speaker 1>if that wasn't happening then whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>was happening wasn't the kind of healing</v>

637
00:39:16.121 --> 00:39:18.550
<v Speaker 1>therapy that Rogers would like to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

638
00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 1>And he also said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll read you something he said later,</v>

639
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:26.350
<v Speaker 1>but he also pointed out quite strongly</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's why people don't really like</v>

640
00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:27.370
<v Speaker 1>to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

641
00:39:27.371 --> 00:39:31.420
<v Speaker 1>like maybe there's some flaw in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell structure at some fundamental</v>

642
00:39:31.421 --> 00:39:34.420
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally axiomatic level,</v>

643
00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:36.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're narcissistic.</v>

644
00:39:36.011 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

645
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.500
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to tell you you're</v>

646
00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:43.720
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't want to find that out</v>

647
00:39:43.721 --> 00:39:47.920
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to blow a huge hole</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're gonna blow blow a huge hole</v>

648
00:39:47.921 --> 00:39:50.500
<v Speaker 1>in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Structure that's not very fun.</v>

649
00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.160
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>

650
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 1>that beats running into the obstacles</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will run into if you're</v>

651
00:39:57.911 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic repeatedly as you move</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward through life.</v>

652
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 1>So you can either live with your flaws</v>
<v Speaker 1>are correct.</v>

653
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>

654
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:08.303
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

655
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.100
<v Speaker 1>the pathway to correction is dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

656
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.773
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

657
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.030
<v Speaker 1>now the next part of the Rogerian</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic frappe yes,</v>

658
00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:18.450
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

659
00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:23.450
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between a genuine</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism genuinely giving her</v>

660
00:40:23.821 --> 00:40:26.510
<v Speaker 2>perspective or just arguing point?</v>

661
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

662
00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see if we can formulate that.</v>

663
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:36.760
<v Speaker 1>So the first difference might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

664
00:40:36.761 --> 00:40:38.680
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the outcome we're looking for?</v>

665
00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Like let's think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's think about that in the context of</v>

666
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:43.750
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an intimate relationship,</v>

667
00:40:43.751 --> 00:40:45.820
<v Speaker 1>a familial relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a wife,</v>

668
00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:47.480
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got some kids this one,</v>

669
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.720
<v Speaker 1>or what are your options?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>

670
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully better.</v>

671
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing we're so that we're</v>

672
00:40:56.871 --> 00:40:59.160
<v Speaker 1>trying to establish the domain of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

673
00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.890
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna we're going to try and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>things better.</v>

674
00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:02.390
<v Speaker 1>What would better look like?</v>

675
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:08.030
<v Speaker 2>You think</v>
<v Speaker 2>of any negative emotion?</v>

676
00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.013
<v Speaker 2>Feeling.</v>

677
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:10.871
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

678
00:41:10.871 --> 00:41:12.140
<v Speaker 1>So there's something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

679
00:41:12.141 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 1>So that's a rough area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Presupposition.</v>

680
00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Is that part of what you're doing when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making things better is to</v>

681
00:41:16.461 --> 00:41:20.770
<v Speaker 1>decrease the probability that negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion will arise short term or long</v>

682
00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:21.604
<v Speaker 1>term?</v>

683
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.140
<v Speaker 2>Short term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First.</v>

684
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.950
<v Speaker 2>That's what bothered me.</v>

685
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

686
00:41:28.291 --> 00:41:32.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's an interesting thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you have to experience a</v>

687
00:41:32.491 --> 00:41:35.750
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of short term pain in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to make long term progress.</v>

688
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.950
<v Speaker 2>If it's different from the pain that</v>
<v Speaker 2>initially got me thinking about it,</v>

689
00:41:39.951 --> 00:41:42.710
<v Speaker 2>that seems like an improvement</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially.</v>

690
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

691
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

692
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to address your question</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely from the admin perspective,</v>

693
00:41:52.221 --> 00:41:54.410
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay because it works for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers as well.</v>

694
00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:59.411
<v Speaker 1>It's just easier to explain</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom from unnecessary suffering</v>

695
00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:07.390
<v Speaker 1>in the short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medium and longterm across as many</v>

696
00:42:07.391 --> 00:42:09.370
<v Speaker 1>people as you can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manage.</v>

697
00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.190
<v Speaker 1>So we'll start with you and your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

698
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:15.640
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

699
00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what you have to talk about,</v>

700
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:23.710
<v Speaker 1>but you cannot have that conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you've got that framework right.</v>

701
00:42:23.711 --> 00:42:27.760
<v Speaker 1>So and it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tricky because in the midst of the</v>

702
00:42:27.761 --> 00:42:30.700
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be tremendous</v>

703
00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:35.730
<v Speaker 1>temptation to oppress and deceive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>humiliate and,</v>

704
00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:40.660
<v Speaker 1>and treat with contempt and hurt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>punish and threatened all of those</v>

705
00:42:40.661 --> 00:42:41.494
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

706
00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:45.950
<v Speaker 1>And that that's partly reactivity in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>short term and then it's not,</v>

707
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 1>that's not properly integrated into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>overarching hierarchical structure.</v>

708
00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:53.050
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to keep bringing yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to that.</v>

709
00:42:53.051 --> 00:42:55.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like why should you control your</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses?</v>

710
00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because their manifestation in the</v>

711
00:42:59.771 --> 00:43:01.720
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're spontaneous and impulsive</v>

712
00:43:01.721 --> 00:43:04.120
<v Speaker 1>manifestation in the present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

713
00:43:04.121 --> 00:43:09.121
<v Speaker 1>although that may be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may carry with it a feeling of</v>

714
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:15.460
<v Speaker 1>freedom and power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe destroying the very structure</v>

715
00:43:15.461 --> 00:43:19.090
<v Speaker 1>that's going to provide you with peace</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stability over the medium and long</v>

716
00:43:19.091 --> 00:43:20.920
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's again,</v>

717
00:43:20.921 --> 00:43:25.510
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea of contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if we're having a discussion,</v>

718
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:26.590
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say,</v>

719
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.280
<v Speaker 1>well we'll do this in a very local</v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion.</v>

720
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:31.183
<v Speaker 1>So like</v>

721
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.770
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're having a discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>about with your partner about who's</v>

722
00:43:40.771 --> 00:43:42.930
<v Speaker 1>going to cook dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

723
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:47.610
<v Speaker 1>So you think that's a simple discussions</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's not a simple discussion.</v>

724
00:43:47.611 --> 00:43:51.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's where the war between the genders</v>

725
00:43:51.781 --> 00:43:55.530
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the places and dissolve it.</v>

726
00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Weirdly not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually have to solve the war</v>

727
00:43:58.891 --> 00:44:01.350
<v Speaker 1>between the genders or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck with that.</v>

728
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:02.880
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right in your house.</v>

729
00:44:02.881 --> 00:44:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a snake in the garden.</v>

730
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:06.600
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

731
00:44:06.601 --> 00:44:08.910
<v Speaker 1>So then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's our aim for dinner?</v>

732
00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we want to have wretched,</v>

733
00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:15.840
<v Speaker 1>miserable rotten food served by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful person to a bunch of</v>

734
00:44:15.841 --> 00:44:19.200
<v Speaker 1>ungrateful rats who complained and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sniffle.</v>

735
00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

736
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:23.310
<v Speaker 1>let's assume we don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want that.</v>

737
00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:23.911
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

738
00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Well we've got no one we're not aiming</v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

739
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:27.700
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

740
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.510
<v Speaker 1>who's your cook dinner and when and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the rules by which we decide that.</v>

741
00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one because you can</v>

742
00:44:37.021 --> 00:44:38.250
<v Speaker 1>return to roles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

743
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people have roles.</v>

744
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:42.450
<v Speaker 1>So they don't have to have stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations like this,</v>

745
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:44.280
<v Speaker 1>but that time is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

746
00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:47.610
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do when there's no role?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

747
00:44:47.611 --> 00:44:52.440
<v Speaker 1>I could make you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could either do it physically</v>

748
00:44:52.441 --> 00:44:56.040
<v Speaker 1>by force or I could just intimidate you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I could make life miserable for you</v>

749
00:44:56.041 --> 00:45:00.270
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do it or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of ways of using power.</v>

750
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Problem with that is you're not worthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not without your own book.</v>

751
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:08.280
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for every step I take towards making</v>

752
00:45:08.281 --> 00:45:10.650
<v Speaker 1>you miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get your chance.</v>

753
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:15.480
<v Speaker 1>So probably we don't want to use force</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus that's not so good for the kids,</v>

754
00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as from a role model perspective and</v>

755
00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:20.220
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically would want things to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to them.</v>

756
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:25.550
<v Speaker 1>So tyranny looks like it's out and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want you to subjugate yourself</v>

757
00:45:26.131 --> 00:45:28.500
<v Speaker 1>because maybe like maybe you're very</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable.</v>

758
00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that because that's often a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem in communication between men and</v>

759
00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:34.830
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys more disagreeable then the</v>

760
00:45:34.831 --> 00:45:38.350
<v Speaker 1>woman is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if he like Jack Sock,</v>

761
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:41.820
<v Speaker 1>the level of conflict show back off</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she doesn't like conflict for</v>

762
00:45:41.821 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another way of winning.</v>

763
00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Except then the person who loses his all</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and you end up with,</v>

764
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>

765
00:45:51.001 --> 00:45:56.001
<v Speaker 1>miserable food fed to warning partners</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are complaining and struggling.</v>

766
00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

767
00:45:59.851 --> 00:46:04.110
<v Speaker 1>So then what you're left with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you've gotten negotiation.</v>

768
00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I might say,</v>

769
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.610
<v Speaker 1>well do we agree that we need to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner?</v>

770
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

771
00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.800
<v Speaker 1>we might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

772
00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:14.850
<v Speaker 1>well we can agree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often should we have it at home?</v>

773
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Well that's going to require a fair bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thought.</v>

774
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.010
<v Speaker 1>You want to go out now and then how</v>
<v Speaker 1>often?</v>

775
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:22.080
<v Speaker 1>How much is that going to cost?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to spend?</v>

776
00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Wherever you going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

777
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:25.920
<v Speaker 1>who pays?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

778
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.990
<v Speaker 1>So that's going to be like a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

779
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.950
<v Speaker 1>So let's say we figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like five days a week we're going</v>

780
00:46:30.951 --> 00:46:31.800
<v Speaker 1>to stay home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

781
00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:33.840
<v Speaker 1>who's going to occur?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

782
00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:36.900
<v Speaker 1>do you like cooking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I like cooking?</v>

783
00:46:36.901 --> 00:46:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Got something sorted out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be,</v>

784
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:44.300
<v Speaker 1>that's like a little discussion with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own physiology in some sense.</v>

785
00:46:45.331 --> 00:46:47.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your felt state while you're</v>

786
00:46:47.341 --> 00:46:49.590
<v Speaker 1>preparing the food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe he'll say,</v>

787
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it all cooked if,</v>

788
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.530
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's someone in the kitchen with</v>

789
00:46:55.531 --> 00:46:57.800
<v Speaker 1>me and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

790
00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:00.900
<v Speaker 1>someone else cleans up afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

791
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.120
<v Speaker 1>then it turns out that I don't mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking.</v>

792
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

793
00:47:05.011 --> 00:47:07.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not minding good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you really want to enjoy it?</v>

794
00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:09.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the preconditions?</v>

795
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Preconditions would have to be met for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to enjoy it while you want to think</v>

796
00:47:14.101 --> 00:47:16.440
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you can get the person either</v>

797
00:47:16.441 --> 00:47:20.430
<v Speaker 1>of you who the hell cares to enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's sort of self sustaining,</v>

798
00:47:20.431 --> 00:47:22.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put that into place and then the</v>

799
00:47:22.111 --> 00:47:25.230
<v Speaker 1>thing runs smoothly across multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>iterations.</v>

800
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:26.970
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

801
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:31.720
<v Speaker 1>what are the preconditions for us to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in a way that would be joyful that</v>

802
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:32.381
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

803
00:47:32.381 --> 00:47:34.120
<v Speaker 1>well that's a high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a high bar.</v>

804
00:47:34.121 --> 00:47:35.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

805
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.270
<v Speaker 1>one or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but should learn to cook because</v>

806
00:47:40.271 --> 00:47:43.840
<v Speaker 1>otherwise we're going to be eaten like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>can of Spaghetti or some other sort of</v>

807
00:47:43.841 --> 00:47:46.630
<v Speaker 1>horror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not very high quality.</v>

808
00:47:46.631 --> 00:47:49.630
<v Speaker 1>So that probably have to be solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the problem of how you</v>

809
00:47:49.631 --> 00:47:51.880
<v Speaker 1>react to the person when they cook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

810
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:53.560
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you just assume that that's their</v>

811
00:47:53.561 --> 00:47:55.900
<v Speaker 1>bloody responsibility and if they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>live up to it,</v>

812
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:59.230
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you notice what they're doing and</v>

813
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.900
<v Speaker 1>express some appreciation and gratitude</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

814
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:05.560
<v Speaker 1>and in a way that would increase the</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that would happen again,</v>

815
00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:08.650
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a better solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to negotiate about how</v>

816
00:48:08.651 --> 00:48:12.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do that exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even right down to the level of</v>

817
00:48:12.731 --> 00:48:15.410
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you're saying,</v>

818
00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're trying to serve a</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher order by doing that,</v>

819
00:48:18.761 --> 00:48:19.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

820
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:22.870
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to satisfy basic</v>

821
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.350
<v Speaker 1>organismal needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the provision of food.</v>

822
00:48:26.351 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 1>But food is complicated for human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we just don't.</v>

823
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:32.440
<v Speaker 1>You just don't put dog food in the bowl</v>
<v Speaker 1>and child down.</v>

824
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Even dogs won't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our dog won't eat less.</v>

825
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:39.050
<v Speaker 1>We're eating no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So human beings are extremely social</v>

826
00:48:39.051 --> 00:48:42.760
<v Speaker 1>leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to get that right and so.</v>

827
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.800
<v Speaker 1>But the conversation will only take</v>
<v Speaker 1>place in the proper manner if your</v>

828
00:48:47.801 --> 00:48:52.300
<v Speaker 1>orientation is proper in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the conversation and the</v>

829
00:48:52.301 --> 00:48:56.710
<v Speaker 1>orientation needs to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we make this better for both of</v>

830
00:48:56.711 --> 00:49:00.490
<v Speaker 1>us in the long run and for the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you and that you have to bow down</v>

831
00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:03.100
<v Speaker 1>before that in some sense as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest,</v>

832
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.280
<v Speaker 1>highest order principle that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>serving.</v>

833
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:09.940
<v Speaker 1>And then you can stumble around trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work that out and then you might say,</v>

834
00:49:09.941 --> 00:49:13.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cook three times a week and I cooked</v>

835
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.100
<v Speaker 1>twice and I'll take care of once.</v>

836
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:17.860
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course you have to get the whole</v>

837
00:49:17.861 --> 00:49:21.040
<v Speaker 1>grocery thing settled out and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole other bloody complicated</v>

838
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:22.960
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it needs to be done.</v>

839
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.340
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

840
00:49:24.341 --> 00:49:28.000
<v Speaker 1>let's run this for a couple of weeks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see how it goes,</v>

841
00:49:28.001 --> 00:49:30.820
<v Speaker 1>and then we can meet again and we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss what worked and what didn't.</v>

842
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.240
<v Speaker 1>And the goal is to make it better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it better,</v>

843
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.380
<v Speaker 1>make it better and make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then no one's trying to win.</v>

844
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by when I'm</v>

845
00:49:41.141 --> 00:49:44.260
<v Speaker 1>not trying to defeat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why will have to live with you?</v>

846
00:49:44.261 --> 00:49:45.940
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the first reason is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

847
00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it defeating you?</v>

848
00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Unless I want someone wandering around</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

849
00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't resentful and bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I do want that.</v>

850
00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:55.600
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that's a very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>place to start.</v>

851
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.330
<v Speaker 1>So when you have a client come in to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

852
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:03.460
<v Speaker 1>the rule is I can tell you the rules</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't used because they're Rogerian.</v>

853
00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will tell the person what I think</v>

854
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.760
<v Speaker 1>so I won't tell them that what I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>is right.</v>

855
00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:16.560
<v Speaker 1>But if they're doing something and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a reaction to that of some sort</v>

856
00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:20.550
<v Speaker 1>that'll usually express itself in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy or a thought and I'll just tell</v>

857
00:50:20.551 --> 00:50:22.620
<v Speaker 1>them what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

858
00:50:22.621 --> 00:50:27.621
<v Speaker 1>I tried to do it as gently as I possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>can because you can use the as a club,</v>

859
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:32.450
<v Speaker 1>but then that's not the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it needs to get the honest</v>

860
00:50:32.451 --> 00:50:34.880
<v Speaker 1>response of one person to what their</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

861
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:37.760
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen lots of people who've never</v>

862
00:50:37.761 --> 00:50:41.340
<v Speaker 1>got the honest response of any one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person ever in their whole life to what</v>

863
00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.690
<v Speaker 1>their life and so they have no idea what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like or what's annoying other</v>

864
00:50:44.691 --> 00:50:47.570
<v Speaker 1>people or how they should behave or any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those things.</v>

865
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:50.500
<v Speaker 1>So even though I'm not going to be right</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

866
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:55.930
<v Speaker 1>in that my reactions won't be precisely</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate representation of the average</v>

867
00:50:56.541 --> 00:50:59.690
<v Speaker 1>response of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically what you're trying to</v>

868
00:50:59.691 --> 00:51:00.524
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

869
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:02.780
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a lot better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had so far.</v>

870
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:06.530
<v Speaker 1>And then the other precondition is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try really hard to get</v>

871
00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:08.390
<v Speaker 1>yourself together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>

872
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.630
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about whatever that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means and I'm going to support you in</v>

873
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:13.820
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's our goal.</v>

874
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.980
<v Speaker 1>And that that's a variant of Rogerian</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconditional positive regard.</v>

875
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.860
<v Speaker 1>And his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his unconditional positive regard in</v>

876
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:25.010
<v Speaker 1>some sense was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the setup for the therapy.</v>

877
00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:29.720
<v Speaker 1>So the presupposition is your valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although maybe you're a little on the</v>

878
00:51:29.721 --> 00:51:31.670
<v Speaker 1>bent and twisted side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

879
00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could be straightened up into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's like deadly.</v>

880
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.070
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to start with that</v>

881
00:51:37.071 --> 00:51:39.890
<v Speaker 1>presupposition and we're going to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>along the way,</v>

882
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:41.540
<v Speaker 1>but that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're,</v>

883
00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:46.280
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're aimed at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the unconditional positive regard,</v>

884
00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.870
<v Speaker 1>it's like a human rights thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basis of the idea of human rights is</v>

885
00:51:50.871 --> 00:51:54.020
<v Speaker 1>that people are valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have some intrinsic value,</v>

886
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing,</v>

887
00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe it's pr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable to presuppose that from</v>

888
00:52:00.621 --> 00:52:05.000
<v Speaker 1>the Rogerian perspective is that what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable about you as you're being</v>

889
00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.320
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a conscious,</v>

890
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:11.400
<v Speaker 1>you're a locus of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as such you're a unique locus of the</v>

891
00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:11.930
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

892
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:15.350
<v Speaker 1>And as such you have something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute that no one else can</v>

893
00:52:15.351 --> 00:52:17.780
<v Speaker 1>contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that's valuable.</v>

894
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.410
<v Speaker 1>It's intrinsically valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the basic presupposition of the</v>

895
00:52:21.411 --> 00:52:22.700
<v Speaker 1>idea of human rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

896
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.150
<v Speaker 1>So if that's acted out in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic session,</v>

897
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:29.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's acted out in any relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's therapeutic.</v>

898
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a counter example.</v>

899
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're trying to smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to quit smoking.</v>

900
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:36.800
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to quit smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

901
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:38.390
<v Speaker 1>And your friends smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

902
00:52:38.391 --> 00:52:41.990
<v Speaker 1>So what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do they offer you a cigarette at</v>

903
00:52:41.991 --> 00:52:44.240
<v Speaker 1>every possible opportunity because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very common.</v>

904
00:52:44.241 --> 00:52:46.460
<v Speaker 1>People do that very commonly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

905
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're mad that maybe they're mad</v>

906
00:52:49.371 --> 00:52:52.160
<v Speaker 1>that they can put smoking or maybe if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you quit that they didn't,</v>

907
00:52:52.161 --> 00:52:55.610
<v Speaker 1>that would cast a bit them in a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow or maybe they're just being</v>

908
00:52:55.611 --> 00:52:58.190
<v Speaker 1>malevolent or maybe it's a game or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

909
00:52:58.191 --> 00:53:02.660
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that isn't is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best interest of the person who's</v>

910
00:53:02.661 --> 00:53:06.950
<v Speaker 1>trying to quit smoking or drinking or</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating or you know,</v>

911
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:11.240
<v Speaker 1>or behaving in any sort of dismal manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's self defeating across time.</v>

912
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:14.300
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

913
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I had a client just a while back and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about I'm an older sibling</v>

914
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.120
<v Speaker 1>and he used to make these models very</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated models.</v>

915
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:29.010
<v Speaker 1>He was quite young at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His sibling was like a decade and a half</v>

916
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:30.600
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was like 10 or something like</v>

917
00:53:30.601 --> 00:53:33.000
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make these really complex Martin's.</v>

918
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 1>He'd spend a couple of weeks building</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and then when the older sibling</v>

919
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.220
<v Speaker 1>came in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just smashed them up.</v>

920
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Like we'll see what kind of stress this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing can take.</v>

921
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:42.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

922
00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:45.540
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

923
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:49.890
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it's unconditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive regard with the aim of</v>

924
00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:52.470
<v Speaker 1>encouraging the person and bringing them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fruition.</v>

925
00:53:52.471 --> 00:53:56.160
<v Speaker 1>It's quite the opposite and it's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>instrumental use of action.</v>

926
00:53:56.161 --> 00:54:00.450
<v Speaker 1>It send the point is not to elevate me</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you or both of us.</v>

927
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:04.470
<v Speaker 1>The point is I'm going to be the monster</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top of the hierarchy.</v>

928
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.510
<v Speaker 1>If you're all crunched up in lying at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom,</v>

929
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.600
<v Speaker 1>that's just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very common set of</v>

930
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 1>motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might ask,</v>

931
00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:14.670
<v Speaker 1>well why isn't that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good question.</v>

932
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I think the right answer to that is as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long run game,</v>

933
00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:22.140
<v Speaker 1>it's counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one benefits.</v>

934
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:26.970
<v Speaker 1>So there's local benefits to you for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>short in the short term.</v>

935
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

936
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:36.930
<v Speaker 1>let me read you some things that Rogers</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote.</v>

937
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a good one.</v>

938
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:46.730
<v Speaker 1>This is because this is his statements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's some of his axiomatic</v>

939
00:54:49.641 --> 00:54:54.080
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what you need to cleave to.</v>

940
00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.080
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to engage in the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Virginia in therapy,</v>

941
00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:02.750
<v Speaker 1>you have to want to be independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's an interesting.</v>

942
00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can actually have a discussion</v>

943
00:55:04.761 --> 00:55:06.080
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

944
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought the eatable complex was</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal and what he meant by that.</v>

945
00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:21.560
<v Speaker 1>People just don't have this discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can give it a shot.</v>

946
00:55:21.561 --> 00:55:25.940
<v Speaker 1>We'll see how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he meant by that was that</v>

947
00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:29.663
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

948
00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:33.330
<v Speaker 1>that's struggling out of the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The primary family is very,</v>

949
00:55:33.331 --> 00:55:37.260
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example.</v>

950
00:55:37.261 --> 00:55:39.450
<v Speaker 1>So I had another client,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bright guy,</v>

951
00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:44.140
<v Speaker 1>second generation guy for Middle East</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

952
00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:48.390
<v Speaker 1>he was heading for a pretty good career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is a smart guy.</v>

953
00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd done a lot of work to get this</v>

954
00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:53.280
<v Speaker 1>career going is in that position that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was difficult to obtain.</v>

955
00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:58.020
<v Speaker 1>You had to move to a different city in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to pursue this career.</v>

956
00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:02.790
<v Speaker 1>And his parents were very upset that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was moving off the street they lived</v>

957
00:56:02.791 --> 00:56:04.440
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

958
00:56:04.441 --> 00:56:09.441
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Western perspective,</v>

959
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:13.860
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it gets tricky.</v>

960
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.810
<v Speaker 1>The proper thing to do on behalf of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

961
00:56:18.811 --> 00:56:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Would have been to support him in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts to be to establish himself</v>

962
00:56:22.471 --> 00:56:24.580
<v Speaker 1>independently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parent's perspective was,</v>

963
00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.730
<v Speaker 1>you're betraying the family by moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

964
00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it reasonable to presume that</v>

965
00:56:34.651 --> 00:56:36.960
<v Speaker 1>independence is an absolute value?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

966
00:56:36.961 --> 00:56:39.180
<v Speaker 1>we're having words about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

967
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.070
<v Speaker 1>The wars have been going on for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

968
00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:45.080
<v Speaker 1>For Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't value independence,</v>

969
00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.630
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't get going in this form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>

970
00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought that all cultures where</v>
<v Speaker 1>heatable to one degree or another and</v>

971
00:56:54.471 --> 00:56:56.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that wasn't true for northern</v>

972
00:56:56.451 --> 00:56:57.284
<v Speaker 1>Europeans</v>

973
00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.460
<v Speaker 1>and that was part of the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human Freud came to a crossroads.</v>

974
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:08.020
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about that.</v>

975
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>

976
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:14.410
<v Speaker 1>for Roger's only independence value</v>
<v Speaker 1>individually were suited for client</v>

977
00:57:14.411 --> 00:57:18.140
<v Speaker 1>center therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's more ECC.</v>

978
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.983
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

979
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you.</v>

980
00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:27.000
<v Speaker 2>You're not another definition of</v>
<v Speaker 2>independence.</v>

981
00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:30.440
<v Speaker 2>A</v>
<v Speaker 2>good point.</v>

982
00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you can be completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent with yourself and your</v>

983
00:57:33.231 --> 00:57:34.064
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

984
00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a very useful way of the</v>

985
00:57:37.641 --> 00:57:39.620
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very useful way of phrasing,</v>

986
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:44.650
<v Speaker 1>phrasing your question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very useful way of phrasing the</v>

987
00:57:45.561 --> 00:57:46.394
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

988
00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:47.890
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

989
00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Can you be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're honest,</v>

990
00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.870
<v Speaker 1>does that mean you're independent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

991
00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Might mean that because it means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at least say again from the road</v>

992
00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:59.860
<v Speaker 1>next to take it from the Rogerian</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

993
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:05.440
<v Speaker 1>If you're speaking for yourself now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be yourself in relationship</v>

994
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:07.750
<v Speaker 1>to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The integrate itself,</v>

995
00:58:07.751 --> 00:58:10.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the kind of instrumentals useless</v>

996
00:58:10.241 --> 00:58:12.100
<v Speaker 1>self that's wandering around causing</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

997
00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:16.060
<v Speaker 1>They're still your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your unique position that has to be</v>

998
00:58:16.061 --> 00:58:17.860
<v Speaker 1>contended with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

999
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:22.090
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that you're your own kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of bounded entity with its own destiny</v>

1000
00:58:22.091 --> 00:58:26.290
<v Speaker 1>and path and its own particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological structure</v>

1001
00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:28.293
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1002
00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:32.790
<v Speaker 1>it's possible that the way that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>define independence is that that</v>

1003
00:58:32.791 --> 00:58:35.670
<v Speaker 1>particular knee is properly integrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the collective,</v>

1004
00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:39.690
<v Speaker 1>so that's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good issue.</v>

1005
00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming a minimal natural,</v>

1006
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:47.360
<v Speaker 1>a minimal mutual willingness to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact and to receive communications,</v>

1007
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:51.420
<v Speaker 1>we may say that the greater the</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicated congruence of experience,</v>

1008
00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:54.150
<v Speaker 1>awareness and behavior on the part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>one individual,</v>

1009
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:58.560
<v Speaker 1>the more the ensuing relationship will</v>
<v Speaker 1>involve a tendency towards reciprocal</v>

1010
00:58:58.561 --> 00:59:02.490
<v Speaker 1>communication with the same qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mutually accurate understanding of the</v>

1011
00:59:02.491 --> 00:59:05.850
<v Speaker 1>communication's improved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological adjustment and functioning</v>

1012
00:59:05.851 --> 00:59:09.780
<v Speaker 1>in both parties and mutual satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The relationship pretty good.</v>

1013
00:59:09.781 --> 00:59:13.110
<v Speaker 1>I bought this so basically what he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying is that</v>

1014
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:19.780
<v Speaker 1>if we're communicating and I tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's actually going on with me the</v>

1015
00:59:19.781 --> 00:59:23.390
<v Speaker 1>best I possibly can and try to get rid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all of the motives that have nothing</v>

1016
00:59:23.391 --> 00:59:28.220
<v Speaker 1>to do with communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to work out quite</v>

1017
00:59:28.221 --> 00:59:31.500
<v Speaker 1>nicely in the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna work out for both of us and</v>

1018
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:34.340
<v Speaker 1>for the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

1019
00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.200
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting hypothesis.</v>

1020
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that people don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1021
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:44.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I showed you that Gottman,</v>

1022
00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you looked at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that length godman studies on marital</v>

1023
00:59:48.581 --> 00:59:49.480
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1024
00:59:49.481 --> 00:59:52.030
<v Speaker 1>But I thought that was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because I've seen people</v>

1025
00:59:52.031 --> 00:59:53.000
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of times,</v>

1026
00:59:53.001 --> 00:59:54.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on the surface,</v>

1027
00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:59.620
<v Speaker 1>everything's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well sometimes the tension is so</v>

1028
00:59:59.621 --> 01:00:02.270
<v Speaker 1>high you can hardly even stand to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room with the people you know,</v>

1029
01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:04.380
<v Speaker 1>because you can just add,</v>
<v Speaker 1>add,</v>

1030
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.340
<v Speaker 1>add,</v>
<v Speaker 1>add an embodied level,</v>

1031
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.960
<v Speaker 1>you're mirroring the distress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1032
01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.010
<v Speaker 1>we get a pit in your stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to breathe and you just know.</v>

1033
01:00:12.011 --> 01:00:14.470
<v Speaker 1>It's probably smell I think is what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trans is,</v>

1034
01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:17.320
<v Speaker 1>is what it's communicated by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1035
01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:21.430
<v Speaker 1>smell affects us and all sorts of ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand.</v>

1036
01:00:21.431 --> 01:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example,</v>

1037
01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.660
<v Speaker 1>women like the smell of tee shirts that</v>
<v Speaker 1>men wore,</v>

1038
01:00:25.661 --> 01:00:28.900
<v Speaker 1>if the men are symmetrical better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the men aren't symmetrical.</v>

1039
01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good example of how smell</v>
<v Speaker 1>affects you,</v>

1040
01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:34.480
<v Speaker 1>affects you in lots of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1041
01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what gartland observed was that</v>

1042
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>basically the couples weren't getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

1043
01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>We're just lying to each other all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1044
01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they were pretending that</v>

1045
01:00:47.051 --> 01:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>everything was all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when in fact nothing was already at all.</v>

1046
01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Their bodies were going haywire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a technical term,</v>

1047
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:56.770
<v Speaker 1>hayward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was way too stressful for them.</v>

1048
01:00:56.771 --> 01:00:57.820
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1049
01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:00.580
<v Speaker 1>why is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why shouldn't you be like that?</v>

1050
01:01:00.581 --> 01:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1051
01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:05.680
<v Speaker 1>one is if your stress responses are to</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevated,</v>

1052
01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:08.230
<v Speaker 1>we know what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the generalized stress response.</v>

1053
01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Your cortisol levels go up and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you age the fat,</v>

1054
01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:15.310
<v Speaker 1>so if you want to age fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good way of doing it.</v>

1055
01:01:15.311 --> 01:01:19.630
<v Speaker 1>But if that's not your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your goal is peace and harmony.</v>

1056
01:01:19.631 --> 01:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Then pretending that everything's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>right without communicating isn't going</v>

1057
01:01:24.371 --> 01:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the couples aren't saying things</v>

1058
01:01:27.221 --> 01:01:30.310
<v Speaker 1>like</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about the way we're</v>

1059
01:01:30.311 --> 01:01:32.350
<v Speaker 1>talking and it's making me extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous,</v>

1060
01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then actually trying to figure that</v>

1061
01:01:35.261 --> 01:01:35.981
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1062
01:01:35.981 --> 01:01:36.641
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1063
01:01:36.641 --> 01:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you're making me nervous because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you are,</v>

1064
01:01:39.161 --> 01:01:41.350
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm just a nervous type.</v>

1065
01:01:41.351 --> 01:01:43.810
<v Speaker 1>God only knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can sort this out or</v>

1066
01:01:43.811 --> 01:01:45.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm nervous about something else</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

1067
01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm nervous about women.</v>

1068
01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of digging to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1069
01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.960
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about that and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1070
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:57.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a reasonable proposition?</v>

1071
01:01:58.900 --> 01:01:59.733
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

1072
01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>you can try this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an excellent,</v>

1073
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to tell you how many</v>

1074
01:02:06.151 --> 01:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>specific psychological exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a really good one.</v>

1075
01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reel communicational curves and the</v>

1076
01:02:15.871 --> 01:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>evaluative tendency avoided when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>listened with understanding,</v>

1077
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:24.560
<v Speaker 1>so the evaluative rogers various is</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to understand with regards to</v>

1078
01:02:25.531 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between evaluation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconditional positive regard because he</v>

1079
01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>tends to speak as if the evaluation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

1080
01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>but really what he means is hierarchical</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevate evaluation,</v>

1081
01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>which is your worst that meet or I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than you,</v>

1082
01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>so like those things might even be true</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any given case,</v>

1083
01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>but they're not relevant to what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

1084
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to do something other than</v>

1085
01:02:45.991 --> 01:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when that creeps in,</v>

1086
01:02:47.551 --> 01:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I think about his dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maneuvering not happens all the time.</v>

1087
01:02:51.241 --> 01:02:52.460
<v Speaker 1>When people are talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1088
01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:54.990
<v Speaker 1>they're just maneuvering around in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>

1089
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:59.400
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the evaluative tendency.</v>

1090
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:02.340
<v Speaker 1>What does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means to see the expressed idea and</v>

1091
01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:06.450
<v Speaker 1>attitude from the other person's point</v>
<v Speaker 1>of view to sense how it feels to him to</v>

1092
01:03:06.451 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 1>achieve his frame of reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In regard to the thing he is talking</v>

1093
01:03:09.451 --> 01:03:14.100
<v Speaker 1>about stated so briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this may sound absurdly simple,</v>

1094
01:03:14.101 --> 01:03:17.070
<v Speaker 1>but it is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an approach which we have found</v>

1095
01:03:17.071 --> 01:03:19.320
<v Speaker 1>extremely potent in the field of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy.</v>

1096
01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:22.890
<v Speaker 1>It's the most effective agent we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>for altering the basic personality</v>

1097
01:03:22.891 --> 01:03:26.670
<v Speaker 1>structure of an individual and improving</v>
<v Speaker 1>his relationships and his communications</v>

1098
01:03:26.671 --> 01:03:29.520
<v Speaker 1>with others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a quite the statement.</v>

1099
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:33.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most effective agent we know for</v>

1100
01:03:33.181 --> 01:03:35.640
<v Speaker 1>altering the basic personality structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an individual.</v>

1101
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:40.200
<v Speaker 1>If I can listen to what he tells me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can understand how it seems to him,</v>

1102
01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.420
<v Speaker 1>if I can see it's personal meaning for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

1103
01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:46.140
<v Speaker 1>if I could sense the emotional flavor</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it has for him,</v>

1104
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:49.470
<v Speaker 1>then I will be releasing potent forces</v>
<v Speaker 1>of change in him.</v>

1105
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.400
<v Speaker 1>If I can really understand how he hates</v>
<v Speaker 1>his father or the university or</v>

1106
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:56.010
<v Speaker 1>economists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I could catch the flavor of this</v>

1107
01:03:56.011 --> 01:03:59.520
<v Speaker 1>sphere of insanity or his fear of atom</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs or of Russia,</v>

1108
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.720
<v Speaker 1>it will be of the greatest help to him</v>
<v Speaker 1>in altering those very hatreds and fears</v>

1109
01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:07.130
<v Speaker 1>and in establishing realistic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmonious relationships with the very</v>

1110
01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:11.040
<v Speaker 1>people and situations toward which he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has felt hatred and fear.</v>

1111
01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.430
<v Speaker 1>We know from our research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1112
01:04:14.431 --> 01:04:19.431
<v Speaker 1>Rogers was one of the first clinicians</v>
<v Speaker 1>who empirically evaluated the outcome of</v>

1113
01:04:19.591 --> 01:04:24.591
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy and so he actually more or</v>
<v Speaker 1>less established the idea that therapy</v>

1114
01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>outcomes should be measured</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically and in doing that,</v>

1115
01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:32.490
<v Speaker 1>he in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he set down one element of the standards</v>

1116
01:04:32.491 --> 01:04:36.390
<v Speaker 1>by which modern clinical psychologists</v>
<v Speaker 1>are actually trained in practice because</v>

1117
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:41.130
<v Speaker 1>the modern clinical psychologist is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist practitioner.</v>

1118
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.390
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that you should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained as a researcher and as a</v>

1119
01:04:45.391 --> 01:04:47.190
<v Speaker 1>practitioner and that's quite unique.</v>

1120
01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical doctors for example,</v>

1121
01:04:49.021 --> 01:04:51.720
<v Speaker 1>are not trained that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you could make a very strong</v>

1122
01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:56.130
<v Speaker 1>case that they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know from our research that such</v>

1123
01:04:56.131 --> 01:04:58.980
<v Speaker 1>empathic understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding with a person,</v>

1124
01:04:58.981 --> 01:05:01.140
<v Speaker 1>not about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such an effective approach that it</v>

1125
01:05:01.141 --> 01:05:03.210
<v Speaker 1>can bring about major changes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

1126
01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you may be feeling that you</v>

1127
01:05:07.021 --> 01:05:10.020
<v Speaker 1>listen well to people and that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen such results.</v>

1128
01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:15.120
<v Speaker 1>The chances are very great indeed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your listening has not been of the type</v>

1129
01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I have described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>

1130
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>I can suggest a little laboratory</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment which you could try to test</v>

1131
01:05:21.401 --> 01:05:25.270
<v Speaker 1>the quality of your understand the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>time you get into an argument with your</v>

1132
01:05:25.271 --> 01:05:28.720
<v Speaker 1>wife or your friend or with a small</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of friends.</v>

1133
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Just stop the discussion for a moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for an experiment institute this</v>

1134
01:05:33.551 --> 01:05:36.520
<v Speaker 1>rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each person can only speak up for</v>

1135
01:05:36.521 --> 01:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>himself once he has first restated the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and feelings of the previous</v>

1136
01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:46.171
<v Speaker 1>speaker accurately and to that speaker</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction.</v>

1137
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the annoying part,</v>

1138
01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're in an argument,</v>

1139
01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:55.530
<v Speaker 1>you're going to use all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetorical devices in order to win.</v>

1140
01:05:55.630 --> 01:06:00.040
<v Speaker 1>One of the most obvious of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetorical devices is that you make your</v>

1141
01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:03.790
<v Speaker 1>case and I only half listened because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm formulating what I'm going to say to</v>

1142
01:06:03.791 --> 01:06:07.480
<v Speaker 1>you next and then I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try.</v>

1143
01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I impose a bias in my processing of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument and so that what I addressed</v>

1144
01:06:13.301 --> 01:06:16.360
<v Speaker 1>when I talked to you is the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument that you'd make if you were</v>

1145
01:06:16.361 --> 01:06:19.840
<v Speaker 1>weak and stupid and contemptible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I go after that and that's</v>

1146
01:06:19.841 --> 01:06:21.460
<v Speaker 1>basically a straw man approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1147
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I take your eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take your position,</v>

1148
01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:28.000
<v Speaker 1>and I try to make it into this scrawny</v>
<v Speaker 1>little rowdiest thing I can possibly</v>

1149
01:06:28.001 --> 01:06:32.320
<v Speaker 1>manage illustrating that it needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubbed out and then I'd rub it out.</v>

1150
01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:36.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like the rigid approaches are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually exactly the officer by the way.</v>

1151
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.880
<v Speaker 1>It's the approach that Dostoyevsky he</v>
<v Speaker 1>took to his characters when he wrote his</v>

1152
01:06:39.881 --> 01:06:44.200
<v Speaker 1>great novels and it's also the approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all great novelists take to their</v>

1153
01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:46.450
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're a great novelist,</v>

1154
01:06:46.451 --> 01:06:48.880
<v Speaker 1>you've put yourself inside the hand of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the murderer.</v>

1155
01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dostoevsky was created that.</v>

1156
01:06:51.521 --> 01:06:53.590
<v Speaker 1>So in crime and punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1157
01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:58.950
<v Speaker 1>the main character going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cough is a lawsuit and he's all</v>

1158
01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:03.340
<v Speaker 1>obsessed because he's lost his faith in</v>
<v Speaker 1>God and he's got all these weird ideas</v>

1159
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.480
<v Speaker 1>that emerged in Europe at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 hundreds that if there's no god,</v>

1160
01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:10.150
<v Speaker 1>everything is permitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's thinking,</v>

1161
01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my moral just because I'm a coward,</v>

1162
01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:14.910
<v Speaker 1>which was a Nietzschean proposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually meets.</v>

1163
01:07:14.911 --> 01:07:19.030
<v Speaker 1>You said most morality is cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say that morality was</v>

1164
01:07:19.031 --> 01:07:20.140
<v Speaker 1>cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1165
01:07:20.141 --> 01:07:22.090
<v Speaker 1>most of the time when people are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardly,</v>

1166
01:07:22.091 --> 01:07:24.460
<v Speaker 1>they pretend that's moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely right.</v>

1167
01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's wrestling with this idea that</v>

1168
01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:32.980
<v Speaker 1>morality is just cowardice and that once</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental beliefs have disappeared.</v>

1169
01:07:32.981 --> 01:07:35.650
<v Speaker 1>You can do anything you want and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only thing that's there to stop you is</v>

1170
01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:38.440
<v Speaker 1>your own fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's rattling around in the back of</v>

1171
01:07:38.441 --> 01:07:38.951
<v Speaker 1>his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1172
01:07:38.951 --> 01:07:41.890
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's more or less starving to death and</v>

1173
01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:46.330
<v Speaker 1>his sister is going to essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitute herself to raise enough money</v>

1174
01:07:46.331 --> 01:07:49.480
<v Speaker 1>so that he can stay in law school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not exactly that she's going to</v>

1175
01:07:49.481 --> 01:07:52.840
<v Speaker 1>go off and marry this guy that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't love who's quite rich and she's</v>

1176
01:07:52.841 --> 01:07:54.550
<v Speaker 1>going to do that to keep him in law</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1177
01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1178
01:07:58.061 --> 01:08:01.450
<v Speaker 1>he's not very happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he's living in this horrible</v>

1179
01:08:01.451 --> 01:08:05.780
<v Speaker 1>flop house and the woman who runs it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky,</v>

1180
01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:09.910
<v Speaker 1>sets this up quite nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the sort of person that if she was</v>

1181
01:08:09.911 --> 01:08:12.730
<v Speaker 1>run over by a horse cart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone would be pleased.</v>

1182
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 1>She's grasping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admitted and miserly and horrible and</v>

1183
01:08:16.041 --> 01:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>mean and malevolent and cruel and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

1184
01:08:19.221 --> 01:08:22.820
<v Speaker 1>And then to make it even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has this nice who isn't very bright</v>

1185
01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:26.660
<v Speaker 1>that she basically treats as a slave and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tortures in orders around all the time.</v>

1186
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:29.420
<v Speaker 1>And then she has all these people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were living in her building,</v>

1187
01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:32.420
<v Speaker 1>which she doesn't take care of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just grasping money out of him all</v>

1188
01:08:32.421 --> 01:08:33.860
<v Speaker 1>the time and she doesn't do anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>with money.</v>

1189
01:08:33.861 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 1>She just puts it in a little chest and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she lives like a on bread crumbs and</v>

1190
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:40.060
<v Speaker 1>dust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1191
01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:43.340
<v Speaker 1>So Dostoyevsky's very careful to set</v>
<v Speaker 1>this situation.</v>

1192
01:08:43.341 --> 01:08:43.911
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1193
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:47.240
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there such a thing as right or wrong?</v>

1194
01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russ Golden,</v>

1195
01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:50.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these pretty puzzled about that.</v>

1196
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Plus he's hungry and he's drinking too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much and you know,</v>

1197
01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.370
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't eat broccoli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why he's hungry.</v>

1198
01:08:55.460 --> 01:09:00.460
<v Speaker 1>So his head is a little on the adult</v>
<v Speaker 1>side and then he's got this terrible</v>

1199
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:02.960
<v Speaker 1>moral conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's this horrible woman</v>

1200
01:09:02.961 --> 01:09:06.680
<v Speaker 1>and she's torturing her niece and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>her sister is gonna go into a loveless</v>

1201
01:09:06.681 --> 01:09:09.110
<v Speaker 1>marriage and he can't stay at law</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1202
01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:11.090
<v Speaker 1>And so we rationalize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

1203
01:09:11.091 --> 01:09:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a solution,</v>

1204
01:09:12.411 --> 01:09:14.630
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just get rid of that old woman.</v>

1205
01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:17.720
<v Speaker 1>No one's gonna miss her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'll be doing the world a favor by</v>

1206
01:09:17.721 --> 01:09:22.280
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of her and then I'll take</v>
<v Speaker 1>your money and then my sister doesn't</v>

1207
01:09:22.281 --> 01:09:24.880
<v Speaker 1>have to become a prostitute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

1208
01:09:24.881 --> 01:09:27.200
<v Speaker 1>and I get to go to school and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a good guy.</v>

1209
01:09:27.201 --> 01:09:29.060
<v Speaker 1>And so poof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

1210
01:09:29.061 --> 01:09:32.720
<v Speaker 1>And if there's no ultimate right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and I'm sad,</v>

1211
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:34.610
<v Speaker 1>it's an instrumental argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1212
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he kills her.</v>

1213
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to read a book if you want</v>

1214
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:42.283
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the story.</v>

1215
01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffice it to say that things do not go</v>

1216
01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:51.700
<v Speaker 1>exactly as he predicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing he figures out is</v>

1217
01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:54.310
<v Speaker 1>that the person you are before you hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone with it,</v>

1218
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.640
<v Speaker 1>someone with an ax and the person you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are immediately after you hit someone</v>

1219
01:09:58.641 --> 01:10:02.720
<v Speaker 1>with an apps are not the same persons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1220
01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:07.780
<v Speaker 1>he assumes constancy of identity across</v>
<v Speaker 1>every experience that turns out to be</v>

1221
01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:10.820
<v Speaker 1>seriously wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Dostoevsky man,</v>

1222
01:10:10.821 --> 01:10:13.220
<v Speaker 1>and he does such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to terrifying book.</v>

1223
01:10:13.221 --> 01:10:15.260
<v Speaker 1>It's the most psychologically accurate</v>
<v Speaker 1>book I ever read,</v>

1224
01:10:15.261 --> 01:10:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason I'm telling you about it</v>

1225
01:10:17.931 --> 01:10:21.030
<v Speaker 1>is this is what made Dostoevsky so</v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous.</v>

1226
01:10:21.031 --> 01:10:24.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he generated up a murderer who is</v>

1227
01:10:24.441 --> 01:10:29.441
<v Speaker 1>basically him as a young man and he gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid every reason to murder ever.</v>

1228
01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.750
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone he could think of.</v>

1229
01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:36.530
<v Speaker 1>He tried to make the case for murder as</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong as he could possibly make it.</v>

1230
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:38.780
<v Speaker 1>So he wasn't generate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not some,</v>

1231
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:42.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two dimensional bad guy.</v>

1232
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.880
<v Speaker 1>And then he has the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has the argument.</v>

1233
01:10:45.881 --> 01:10:47.260
<v Speaker 1>And so that's so brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1234
01:10:47.261 --> 01:10:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Because if I really want to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion with you and I want to get</v>

1235
01:10:50.631 --> 01:10:55.631
<v Speaker 1>somewhere wherever somewhere might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to help you make your argument as</v>

1236
01:10:55.761 --> 01:10:59.960
<v Speaker 1>strong as you can on the off chance that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have something to say that I don't</v>

1237
01:10:59.961 --> 01:11:04.961
<v Speaker 1>know and maybe you'll do the same to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then then we can have the discussion</v>

1238
01:11:06.051 --> 01:11:09.660
<v Speaker 1>and we can get the things solved and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe it won't be around to plague</v>

1239
01:11:09.661 --> 01:11:11.690
<v Speaker 1>us anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1240
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 1>people don't do that in relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1241
01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:17.640
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they do is maintain fragile piece.</v>

1242
01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:20.160
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think that probably works</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

1243
01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>if you're bounded by roles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was a union on observation,</v>

1244
01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:29.460
<v Speaker 1>so young believer that you didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have an individual relationship if</v>

1245
01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:33.660
<v Speaker 1>you were in a traditional culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>because women did women things and men</v>

1246
01:11:33.661 --> 01:11:38.160
<v Speaker 1>did men things and they walked along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>path in parallel and there were no</v>

1247
01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:39.540
<v Speaker 1>conflicts because there were no.</v>

1248
01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.590
<v Speaker 1>There were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1249
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of what you were supposed to do was</v>

1250
01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:47.580
<v Speaker 1>laid out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1251
01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:52.230
<v Speaker 1>monitor people don't like that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just try negotiating over who should</v>

1252
01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:54.270
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who should cook dinner,</v>

1253
01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>see if you set a lap for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a decision about whether the roles</v>

1254
01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.670
<v Speaker 1>are useful or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

1255
01:11:59.671 --> 01:12:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I'd been in lots of houses where that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight had been going on for 35 years.</v>

1256
01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I've never solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So camps couldn't eat.</v>

1257
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Neo is the food was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The husband and wife are at each other's</v>

1258
01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:11.790
<v Speaker 1>throats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1259
01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:15.810
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really hard once you're under</v>

1260
01:12:15.811 --> 01:12:17.940
<v Speaker 1>the rules to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you're out of the rules,</v>

1261
01:12:17.941 --> 01:12:20.730
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it as an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a trek.</v>

1262
01:12:20.731 --> 01:12:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Tremendous demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievable demand.</v>

1263
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:27.030
<v Speaker 1>It's the same demand that essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Dostoyevsky he put on himself.</v>

1264
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:31.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're partners will say you are one</v>

1265
01:12:31.531 --> 01:12:36.531
<v Speaker 1>weird and unwieldy and malevolent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>peculiar creature and so alive.</v>

1266
01:12:36.571 --> 01:12:39.690
<v Speaker 1>So like how the hell are we going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort that out?</v>

1267
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better be awake if you're going to</v>

1268
01:12:44.011 --> 01:12:45.540
<v Speaker 1>sort that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

1269
01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:47.790
<v Speaker 1>But the alternative is the Gottman</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

1270
01:12:47.791 --> 01:12:49.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's fine.</v>

1271
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:53.370
<v Speaker 1>And your heart's racing and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortisol is generating and you know</v>

1272
01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:58.640
<v Speaker 1>you're having murderous dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had clients who were very motivated</v>

1273
01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:03.780
<v Speaker 1>to commit homicide and they had their</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons and one client I'm thinking</v>

1274
01:13:03.781 --> 01:13:06.840
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she thought it was her moral duty to do</v>

1275
01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:11.841
<v Speaker 1>this because the person that she hated</v>
<v Speaker 1>had really hurt their family.</v>

1276
01:13:12.090 --> 01:13:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Like not in some trivial way but like</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt them as badly as she possibly</v>

1277
01:13:16.741 --> 01:13:19.350
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was nothing she could do about</v>

1278
01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:21.840
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no legal recourse and so she</v>

1279
01:13:21.841 --> 01:13:23.550
<v Speaker 1>was a very moral person.</v>

1280
01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:28.840
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat I would say it doesn't matter.</v>

1281
01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.860
<v Speaker 1>She's a very moral person and this was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just driving her crazy.</v>

1282
01:13:31.861 --> 01:13:33.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like I have to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to act.</v>

1283
01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:36.750
<v Speaker 1>I can't just let this person get away</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it because it was also ongoing.</v>

1284
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what are you going to say?</v>

1285
01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop thinking about that.</v>

1286
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could put your thoughts to a more</v>

1287
01:13:44.311 --> 01:13:45.660
<v Speaker 1>productive use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1288
01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:47.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not unhelpful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>

1289
01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:50.210
<v Speaker 1>You can't help a person like that at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you put your.</v>

1290
01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.380
<v Speaker 1>You put yourself in their situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

1291
01:13:52.381 --> 01:13:54.960
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was in that situation and that had</v>

1292
01:13:54.961 --> 01:13:57.000
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would I do?</v>

1293
01:13:57.001 --> 01:13:58.620
<v Speaker 1>And then the first thing I thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1294
01:13:58.621 --> 01:14:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I'd be having the same kind of burgers</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies so that that doesn't seem like</v>

1295
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.550
<v Speaker 1>it's possible that that's not a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

1296
01:14:05.551 --> 01:14:07.200
<v Speaker 1>So let's see if we can come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

1297
01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.710
<v Speaker 1>But the danger there is that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put yourself in that situation and</v>

1298
01:14:11.711 --> 01:14:13.300
<v Speaker 1>people don't like to do that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>

1299
01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:13.571
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1300
01:14:13.571 --> 01:14:18.460
<v Speaker 1>I've never had murdered his fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if you would never have</v>

1301
01:14:18.461 --> 01:14:20.740
<v Speaker 1>murderous fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would actually say there's something</v>

1302
01:14:20.741 --> 01:14:24.160
<v Speaker 1>wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not capable of that,</v>

1303
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:26.860
<v Speaker 1>then there's like there's a path of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing.</v>

1304
01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:29.350
<v Speaker 1>It's in there man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

1305
01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.480
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone's pushing on you at some</v>

1306
01:14:31.481 --> 01:14:35.020
<v Speaker 1>point in your life and they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better have that reserve capacity or</v>

1307
01:14:35.021 --> 01:14:36.580
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to mow you right</v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

1308
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:42.390
<v Speaker 1>So you could see what this would mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would simply mean that before</v>

1309
01:14:43.421 --> 01:14:46.300
<v Speaker 1>presenting your own point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be necessary for you to really</v>

1310
01:14:46.301 --> 01:14:50.080
<v Speaker 1>achieve the other speakers frame of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reference to understand his thoughts and</v>

1311
01:14:50.081 --> 01:14:53.530
<v Speaker 1>feeling so well that you could summarize</v>
<v Speaker 1>them for him.</v>

1312
01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Sounds simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

1313
01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:58.330
<v Speaker 1>But if you try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will discover it as one of the most</v>

1314
01:14:58.331 --> 01:15:02.530
<v Speaker 1>difficult things I've ever tried to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1315
01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.530
<v Speaker 1>once you have been able to see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other's point of view,</v>

1316
01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.320
<v Speaker 1>your own comments will have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>drastically revised.</v>

1317
01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:11.800
<v Speaker 1>You will also find the emotion going out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the discussion,</v>

1318
01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:16.010
<v Speaker 1>the differences being reduced and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences which renamed being under</v>

1319
01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.800
<v Speaker 1>rational and understandable sore.</v>

1320
01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.910
<v Speaker 1>So Roger's thought that courage was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prerequisite for empathic understanding.</v>

1321
01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:28.930
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know here,</v>

1322
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:30.610
<v Speaker 1>here's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a question for you.</v>

1323
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:35.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like check you trust people</v>
<v Speaker 1>or more specifically,</v>

1324
01:15:35.951 --> 01:15:37.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I trust you?</v>

1325
01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think if you've heard me talk,</v>

1326
01:15:41.561 --> 01:15:42.191
<v Speaker 1>you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1327
01:15:42.191 --> 01:15:45.310
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you should trust a person</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're just so full of snakes</v>

1328
01:15:45.311 --> 01:15:48.130
<v Speaker 1>and malevolence that it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely mind boggling.</v>

1329
01:15:48.131 --> 01:15:50.950
<v Speaker 1>So why in the world would you ever trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that?</v>

1330
01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Well then you can think about it this</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1331
01:15:53.141 --> 01:15:55.570
<v Speaker 1>There's two kinds of trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the kind of trust you have when</v>

1332
01:15:55.571 --> 01:15:58.210
<v Speaker 1>you're too stupid to know better and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not trust,</v>

1333
01:15:58.211 --> 01:16:02.320
<v Speaker 1>that's naive and that is not a moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue and there's the kind of trust you</v>

1334
01:16:02.321 --> 01:16:05.710
<v Speaker 1>have when you know that the person your</v>
<v Speaker 1>car can do and you are completely full</v>

1335
01:16:05.711 --> 01:16:10.570
<v Speaker 1>of snakes and you decide as an act of</v>
<v Speaker 1>courage that you're going to trust the</v>

1336
01:16:10.571 --> 01:16:15.571
<v Speaker 1>person anyways because that of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you could do to help lead them</v>

1337
01:16:15.881 --> 01:16:18.760
<v Speaker 1>and the discussion towards the light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the most important.</v>

1338
01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:23.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm going to assume that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our interactions,</v>

1339
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:28.090
<v Speaker 1>your impulse towards the good is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be victorious.</v>

1340
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Now isn't if you're interested in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could go online,</v>

1341
01:16:31.451 --> 01:16:34.570
<v Speaker 1>you can watch Paul Bernardo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember Old Paul Bernardo.</v>

1342
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's videos of Paul Bernardo online</v>

1343
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:41.560
<v Speaker 1>when he's talking to a bunch of RCMP</v>
<v Speaker 1>officers and judges.</v>

1344
01:16:41.561 --> 01:16:45.250
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to extract some more</v>
<v Speaker 1>information from him about some murders</v>

1345
01:16:45.251 --> 01:16:48.430
<v Speaker 1>that remained unsolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see a psychopath,</v>

1346
01:16:48.431 --> 01:16:51.040
<v Speaker 1>that operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just watch those videos.</v>

1347
01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.560
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1348
01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:55.150
<v Speaker 1>he runs the meeting like he's the CEO of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple.</v>

1349
01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:57.580
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1350
01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's a problem I would say to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree for the Rogerian approach,</v>

1351
01:17:00.971 --> 01:17:01.804
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because.</v>

1352
01:17:02.670 --> 01:17:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about Paul Bernardo,</v>

1353
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:09.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is everyone fundamentally oriented</v>

1354
01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:10.910
<v Speaker 1>towards the good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1355
01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:17.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a reasonable presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time I think it works better</v>

1356
01:17:17.451 --> 01:17:20.210
<v Speaker 1>if society is organized themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to that principal because</v>

1357
01:17:20.211 --> 01:17:21.470
<v Speaker 1>otherwise we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1358
01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:26.300
<v Speaker 1>that one of the mite thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a natural resource oil,</v>

1359
01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1360
01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:32.290
<v Speaker 1>For a</v>
<v Speaker 1>box site or iron ore or forget about all</v>

1361
01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:36.020
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental natural resource is</v>

1362
01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:39.650
<v Speaker 1>trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look around the world and you</v>

1363
01:17:39.651 --> 01:17:41.660
<v Speaker 1>look at economies like Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1364
01:17:41.661 --> 01:17:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Japan has no natural resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1365
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:45.920
<v Speaker 1>While they're filthy rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1366
01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Because the economy is basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on interpersonal trust.</v>

1367
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:55.040
<v Speaker 1>So when there's been some lovely work</v>
<v Speaker 1>done in economics regarding precisely</v>

1368
01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:57.770
<v Speaker 1>that without trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your oil just sits in the ground or it</v>

1369
01:17:57.771 --> 01:18:00.590
<v Speaker 1>leaks out of the pipelines because</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody weld with the property.</v>

1370
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't.</v>

1371
01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:06.380
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to assume that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to do anything</v>

1372
01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:10.100
<v Speaker 1>cooperative or collaborative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so trust is a necessity if you're really</v>

1373
01:18:10.101 --> 01:18:12.170
<v Speaker 1>willing to understand the person in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1374
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:15.770
<v Speaker 1>If you're willing to enter his private</v>
<v Speaker 1>world at see the way life appears to</v>

1375
01:18:15.771 --> 01:18:17.900
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run the risk of being changed</v>

1376
01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:18.734
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1377
01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:22.340
<v Speaker 1>You might see it his way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might find yourself influenced in</v>

1378
01:18:22.341 --> 01:18:26.600
<v Speaker 1>your attitudes or personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Risk of being changed is one of the most</v>

1379
01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:28.640
<v Speaker 1>frightening prospects most of us can</v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

1380
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:32.240
<v Speaker 1>If I enter as fully as I am able into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the private world.</v>

1381
01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:36.320
<v Speaker 1>If the neurotic or psychotic individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there a risk that I might become</v>

1382
01:18:36.321 --> 01:18:39.980
<v Speaker 1>lost in that world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of us are afraid to take that risk.</v>

1383
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:45.310
<v Speaker 1>The great majority of us cannot listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find ourselves compelled to evaluate</v>

1384
01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:49.820
<v Speaker 1>because listening is too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first requirement is courage and we</v>

1385
01:18:49.821 --> 01:18:54.821
<v Speaker 1>do not always have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it says 3:00 on this.</v>

1386
01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:00.180
<v Speaker 1>That right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1387
01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:01.550
<v Speaker 1>that's a good place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>
