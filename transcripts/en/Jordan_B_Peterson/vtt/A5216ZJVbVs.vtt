1
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.243
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an atheist anymore because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look at the world that way </v>

2
00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:10.550
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a materialist anymore.</v>

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the world is made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's made out of what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of meaning.</v>

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.133
<v Speaker 1>Look at it from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.930
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of modern brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.033
<v Speaker 1>what we orient towards unconsciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means what captures our attention </v>

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.200
<v Speaker 1>is meaning and it captures our attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we know what it is the brain acts</v>

9
00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>as if the world is made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information or made out of meaning.</v>

10
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

11
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.313
<v Speaker 1>German philosopher was convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world was made out of meaning </v>

12
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:40.334
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that people's primary interaction </v>

13
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:45.164
<v Speaker 1>with being was interaction with meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that isn't what modern people think </v>

14
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:50.294
<v Speaker 1>because they're deeply materialistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go back 400 years or 500 years </v>

15
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.600
<v Speaker 1>and you look at what people meant when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they said matter,</v>

16
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.710
<v Speaker 1>which is what things are made out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they thought mattered was,</v>

17
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.573
<v Speaker 1>isn't like what we think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like this material stuff sort </v>

18
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:07.640
<v Speaker 1>of like dirt that everything was made </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of.</v>

19
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was much more complicated than not.</v>

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.833
<v Speaker 1>Problem with the standard view of matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it doesn't really deal with the </v>

21
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:16.004
<v Speaker 1>fact that matter comes in a raise and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns and the patterns and the </v>

22
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:20.714
<v Speaker 1>arrays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of lost when you think </v>

23
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>about Adam's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where all the action is.</v>

24
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 1>That's where the reality is.</v>

25
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.420
<v Speaker 1>God creates Adam and Eve explicitly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own image.</v>

26
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a variety of interpretations </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the first being that God created,</v>

27
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:38.654
<v Speaker 1>so there's a tradition in medieval </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and Judaism as well that </v>

28
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:43.724
<v Speaker 1>the first man was hermaphroditic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>male and female together and then </v>

29
00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:49.844
<v Speaker 1>separated into two separate entities </v>
<v Speaker 1>which then we're forever looking to be </v>

30
00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:53.714
<v Speaker 1>rejoined and there's a very profound </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological idea there which is that </v>

31
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 1>the union of masculine and feminine </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces a kind of perfect wholeness and</v>

32
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:05.654
<v Speaker 1>you can think about that as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressed biologically given the males </v>

33
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:11.570
<v Speaker 1>need females and masculine needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

34
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.673
<v Speaker 1>But you can also think about it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>different aspects of the psyche or </v>

35
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.820
<v Speaker 1>between people or different aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the psyche within people.</v>

36
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.450
<v Speaker 1>So whatever consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever consciousness is,</v>

37
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>it comes in masculine and feminine </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodiments.</v>

38
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.013
<v Speaker 1>The masculine and the feminine </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodiment are equally representations </v>

39
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:31.034
<v Speaker 1>of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is quite remarkable </v>

40
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:33.404
<v Speaker 1>because you know there's a whole line of</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist criticism of the western </v>

41
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:36.854
<v Speaker 1>tradition that makes the presumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the whole structure is patriarchal </v>

42
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.390
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think that's true.</v>

43
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.553
<v Speaker 1>If it was patriarchal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been man that was created </v>

44
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:46.634
<v Speaker 1>in the image of God and it is explicitly</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that what feminine and masculine as </v>

45
00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.930
<v Speaker 1>well as being markers for gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

46
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.813
<v Speaker 1>Also symbolic categories and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine symbolic category is the the </v>

47
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.723
<v Speaker 1>genet tricks of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Matrix because the female is </v>

48
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:05.524
<v Speaker 1>associated with the act of with with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most fundamental aspects of the act of </v>

49
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>reproduction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's out of the feminine.</v>

50
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:12.874
<v Speaker 1>That new form spring for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new forms come out of what you don't </v>

51
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>understand and that's the matrix of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being and new biological forms come come</v>

52
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:22.714
<v Speaker 1>out of a feminine substrate that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>female creatures and so the masculine </v>

53
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.150
<v Speaker 1>aspect is more seminal in in a symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of that.</v>

54
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>The seminal idea is the instigator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

55
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:36.754
<v Speaker 1>and it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also stands in mythology for a kind </v>

56
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:40.564
<v Speaker 1>of logical clarity and cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas the feminine stands for more </v>

57
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>like something that's whole and </v>
<v Speaker 1>undifferentiated.</v>

58
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.933
<v Speaker 1>There's some suggestion in the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and Eve that the woman is the </v>

59
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:52.354
<v Speaker 1>primary food sharer and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated in some way with her ability </v>

60
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>to make Adam self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what she does.</v>

61
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.873
<v Speaker 1>She offers him something that makes him </v>
<v Speaker 1>self conscious and she becomes self </v>

62
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>consciousness conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>

63
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence in women make men self </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>

64
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>You can't think of a truth that's truer </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

65
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>and the reason they do it is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very selective and most men they</v>

66
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:17.554
<v Speaker 1>reject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So God comes up and he's looking for </v>

67
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:21.514
<v Speaker 1>Adam because he's used to wandering </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with them and Adam's hiding </v>

68
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>behind a bush which says something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam's level of intelligence first.</v>

69
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Because you know God can see through </v>
<v Speaker 1>bushes,</v>

70
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>but it also says something about his </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of self consciousness.</v>

71
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Because what it means is that when Adam </v>
<v Speaker 1>become self conscious,</v>

72
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.793
<v Speaker 1>he no longer believes that the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was made in the image of God is </v>

73
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 1>sufficient to give him stature.</v>

74
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>And so God says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

75
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>who told you you were naked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is where.</v>

76
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>This is really Adam's fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he says it was the woman.</v>

77
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 1>He blames her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really pathological.</v>

78
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>The woman you gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was her fault.</v>

79
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she made you self conscious.</v>

80
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hooray.</v>

81
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you woke up.</v>

82
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 1>There's something to be said for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

83
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:04.984
<v Speaker 1>Women torture man into being awake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't suppose that's always </v>

84
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 1>received with gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Milton,</v>

85
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:11.434
<v Speaker 1>he wrote paradise lost for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was to justify the ways of God to </v>

86
00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the second rationale for his writing</v>

87
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:20.914
<v Speaker 1>was to codify mythologies stories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in some ways peripheral to </v>

88
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>canonical Christianity into a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>coherent narrative.</v>

89
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Here's a question he tried to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

90
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if God was a all knowing,</v>

91
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>why would he sat Adam and eve up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall?</v>

92
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>And Milton has a very sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to that,</v>

93
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>and it is that people truly have </v>
<v Speaker 1>freewill,</v>

94
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>and even if God knew that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to fall,</v>

95
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing he could do to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>that except deny them freewill.</v>

96
00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.690
<v Speaker 1>And Freewill is valuable that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>denial was not going to happen.</v>

97
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.623
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky points out that freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to be very important to people </v>

98
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:07.124
<v Speaker 1>and even arbitrary freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people want the freedom to go to </v>

99
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 1>hell in a handbasket even they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want constraints.</v>

100
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 1>They're willing to put up with a lot to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have their freedom.</v>

101
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>And God's judgment is something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom is better than safety.</v>

102
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.090
<v Speaker 1>The snake in the garden of Eden is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting character.</v>

103
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.213
<v Speaker 1>Human beings and their closest </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological relative chimpanzees are </v>

104
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:33.710
<v Speaker 1>innately afraid of and attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reptiles.</v>

105
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.573
<v Speaker 1>They automatically trigger off responses</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a part of the brain called the </v>

106
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Amygdala that's associated with anxiety.</v>

107
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.603
<v Speaker 1>And I think the evolutionary reason for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is that mammals and reptiles have </v>

108
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:49.721
<v Speaker 1>been at war in a sense over ecological </v>
<v Speaker 1>turf for something between $60,000,200,</v>

109
00:06:51.601 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 1>million years reptilian features which </v>
<v Speaker 1>are cold blooded,</v>

110
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piercing I'd tooth lurking,</v>

111
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.670
<v Speaker 1>nocturnal out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the unknown.</v>

112
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.013
<v Speaker 1>Outward chaos is the snake is </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of the unknown in a </v>

113
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:10.724
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's an ambivalent feature and you </v>

114
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:13.244
<v Speaker 1>see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that even in its used in </v>

115
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:17.000
<v Speaker 1>mythology because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon in,</v>

116
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.913
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in western culture is a negative </v>

117
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:19.934
<v Speaker 1>feature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Chinese culture it's positive </v>

118
00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 1>feature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the unknown is like that.</v>

119
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:25.094
<v Speaker 1>It's positive and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The snake in the garden of Eden is </v>

120
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 1>representative of all those things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lurk when you think you know what you're</v>

121
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 1>doing and when you think you know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>

122
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:35.714
<v Speaker 1>you've carved out this little Eden has </v>
<v Speaker 1>little paradise in which you're </v>

123
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:38.744
<v Speaker 1>operating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's always something that's </v>

124
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:42.800
<v Speaker 1>lurking and that's all the things you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not paying attention to.</v>

125
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.993
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the snake and we're not snake </v>

126
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 1>pops up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are,</v>

127
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 1>we're wired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a little snake pops out,</v>

128
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>we might want to run away from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're curious about that.</v>

129
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go over there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate right away.</v>

130
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.273
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when chimps come across a python in the </v>

131
00:07:57.501 --> 00:07:59.720
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a specific cry.</v>

132
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 1>It's called a snake wrath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the chimps who don't like snakes,</v>

133
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.693
<v Speaker 1>they don't run from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They back off and then they watch the </v>

134
00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:10.190
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cannot tear their eyes away from it</v>

135
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 1>and some of them will stand there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it for 10 minutes.</v>

136
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Other individuals will stand there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours watching the snake.</v>

137
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>The unknown is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't look away from it.</v>

138
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>We have to encounter it even if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>

139
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 1>It's partly why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know teenagers like horror movies,</v>

140
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 1>they're driven to look at the snake.</v>

141
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.660
<v Speaker 1>They're driven to interact with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>

142
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.370
<v Speaker 1>In Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

143
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the snake means the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of paradise just like it does in life.</v>

144
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.693
<v Speaker 1>There are ideas that the serpent in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden of Eden was Satan and trying to </v>

145
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.223
<v Speaker 1>destroy God's handiwork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People often look back in their lives </v>

146
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

147
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:46.814
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got knocked out of my little paradise </v>

148
00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:48.800
<v Speaker 1>by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:49.634
<v Speaker 1>this particular event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but looking back on it really made me </v>

150
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.420
<v Speaker 1>grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really made me mature.</v>

151
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the serpent in the garden of Eden</v>

152
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 1>certainly plays that role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a catalyst.</v>

153
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.513
<v Speaker 1>Much of what's unknown is redemptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of what's unknown gives life saver </v>

154
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.253
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It provides the kind of excitement that </v>

155
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:06.834
<v Speaker 1>justifies suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The injunction behind religious thought </v>

156
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:10.404
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally is that you should live </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life in such a way that the </v>

157
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:15.144
<v Speaker 1>suffering it has to contain because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're confined and vulnerable is </v>

158
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:18.714
<v Speaker 1>justified.</v>

159
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.303
<v Speaker 1>A Profane World exists because paradise </v>
<v Speaker 1>always falls apart now and that's a </v>

160
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:27.804
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the human catastrophe and maybe </v>

161
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:30.084
<v Speaker 1>that's original scent and profane life </v>
<v Speaker 1>is characterized by suffering intense </v>

162
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a terrible thing.</v>

163
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.853
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so terrible that the first two </v>

164
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:42.000
<v Speaker 1>people to really inhabit the profane </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

165
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.863
<v Speaker 1>who cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain is so disturbed by the nature of </v>

166
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>the world that he turns into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>revengeful,</v>

167
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Speaker 1>homicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>

168
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 1>fascist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian,</v>

169
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>and the father of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

170
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:01.080
<v Speaker 1>that's how bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how bad profane existence can be,</v>

171
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 1>but if you keep going in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

172
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.343
<v Speaker 1>you can get so conscious that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>profane conditions of of being are no </v>

173
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:12.540
<v Speaker 1>longer tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're acceptable,</v>

174
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.460
<v Speaker 1>but you have to live well enough so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the suffering is worth it.</v>

175
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.220
<v Speaker 1>If you took advantage of every </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity you had,</v>

176
00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:23.530
<v Speaker 1>if you crawl through every window that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was open to you,</v>

177
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:24.663
<v Speaker 1>if you lived as perfectly as you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life would be justifiable on its </v>

178
00:10:29.081 --> 00:10:32.920
<v Speaker 1>own terms despite its suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the tragedy in the world.</v>

179
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:33.813
<v Speaker 1>That's why character guard said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are redeemed one by one and not </v>

180
00:10:36.671 --> 00:10:37.870
<v Speaker 1>in groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

181
00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:39.460
<v Speaker 1>it's an individual project.</v>

182
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I would say human beings are built to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take tragedy,</v>

183
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.403
<v Speaker 1>but they're not built to take evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most unsettling thing isn't that a </v>

184
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:48.814
<v Speaker 1>close relative dies of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unsettling as that is the most </v>

185
00:10:51.641 --> 00:10:56.050
<v Speaker 1>unsettling thing is to be treated </v>
<v Speaker 1>casually in a brutal manner for no other</v>

186
00:10:56.051 --> 00:10:58.000
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the brutality itself,</v>

187
00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.013
<v Speaker 1>that's what undermines your sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your belief in human existence and in </v>

188
00:11:01.391 --> 00:11:02.224
<v Speaker 1>the value of human existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what demoralizes and kills many </v>

189
00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:08.020
<v Speaker 1>social scientists in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

190
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I feel that the idea of evil is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anachronistic.</v>

191
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.043
<v Speaker 1>The reason that evil is obliterated out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of consciousness is because we don't </v>

192
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.540
<v Speaker 1>have a theory to account for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lana,</v>

193
00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.020
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a framework within which </v>
<v Speaker 1>it fits on.</v>

194
00:11:23.021 --> 00:11:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Religious ideation certainly provides </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of framework.</v>

195
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I also think that we dismiss evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's such a terrifying phenomena</v>

196
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.690
<v Speaker 1>and whenever it crops up its head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody runs around saying,</v>

197
00:11:34.691 --> 00:11:35.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who could have predicted this?</v>

198
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Who could have predicted this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

199
00:11:37.601 --> 00:11:39.580
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is look and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict it,</v>

200
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:44.170
<v Speaker 1>and the people who perpetrated often say</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what they're doing and why.</v>

201
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.300
<v Speaker 1>So the columbine kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

202
00:11:46.301 --> 00:11:49.690
<v Speaker 1>they said something very much like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

203
00:11:49.691 --> 00:11:53.770
<v Speaker 1>we've taken a close look at existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't worthy.</v>

204
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not worthy because people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited invulnerable and there's way too</v>

205
00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:02.461
<v Speaker 1>much suffering and suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vulnerable things are kind of despicable</v>

206
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 1>and it would be better if they were just</v>
<v Speaker 1>all wiped out.</v>

207
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Plus I'm the guy to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly.</v>

208
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what they claimed.</v>

209
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.321
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

210
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 1>why would someone come to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion?</v>

211
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good answer.</v>

212
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.003
<v Speaker 1>Everyone comes to that conclusion from </v>
<v Speaker 1>from time to time when they're </v>

213
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.213
<v Speaker 1>disappointed or frustrated or when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know their dreams of falling apart or </v>

214
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:24.694
<v Speaker 1>when someone near them suffers or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt the utility not only of their own </v>

215
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:31.810
<v Speaker 1>existence but of existence itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's taken far enough,</v>

216
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 1>taken far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that attitude in genders,</v>

217
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 1>atrocity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's evil,</v>

218
00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 1>and I think you can define it no problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people say,</v>

219
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:42.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can define evil.</v>

220
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.353
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evil is the production of suffering for </v>

221
00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:47.374
<v Speaker 1>its own sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's simple and if you think people </v>

222
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 1>don't do that regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know you're just.</v>

223
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 1>You just haven't been looking.</v>
