1
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.680
Jordan Peterson has become hugely successful.

2
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.440
What do you make of the phenomena?

3
00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:14.240
Why do you think he's become so successful now?

4
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.890
<v 2>There is a drought of authenticity and courage and Peterson has found that</v>

5
00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:30.430
hunger and he's tapped into it and I,

6
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.090
I admire his ability to detect it and to speak to it plainly in a way that it

7
00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:39.790
resonates with.
I did.

8
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.300
We were on a panel together in Vancouver and I watched his talk and he described

9
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:54.781
his own surprise at how effective his message has had been and he basically said

10
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.410
that if he had outlined his message as the core of a business model,

11
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.130
that it would have looked laughable to him and that he was as shocked as anybody

12
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:10.360
that people are resonating with it.
But
when,

13
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.030
when you live in a world that is as full of crap of the world we live in,

14
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.050
where people are advertising bullshit to you from the moment you get up to the

15
00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:25.051
moment you go to sleep and then somebody finally tells you some truth that you

16
00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:27.850
need to hear,
it's a relief.

17
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.360
It's a relief just to know that there's some channel that isn't compromised by

18
00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:34.360
nonsense.
And,
uh,
he,

19
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.990
I don't think he's the only one speaking truthfully,

20
00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:42.991
but I think he is speaking from the heart and people know it.

21
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.640
<v 3>I think that he grasps directly the fact that human beings can only actually</v>

22
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:52.641
make sense of the world by virtue of communication with other human beings.

23
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.760
And this is all about the notion of ad mixture.
One must have a mixture of,

24
00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.440
of what I mean,

25
00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:04.420
he uses the myth of poetic to make sense that the order order and chaos,
uh,

26
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.540
the way or the Taoist way is the al chemical admixture of order and chaos.

27
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.340
Uh,
and that's it.
Like that's how you do it.

28
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.540
And so if you bias towards orderliness,
uh,

29
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.570
you find yourself in a rigid non-adaptive,
uh,

30
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.210
noncreative not exploratory framework,
um,

31
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.110
which will die because the world changes.
If you buy us towards chaos,
um,

32
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.270
you,
you eat your young and evaporate.
Um,

33
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.860
which also ties for obvious reasons,
uh,

34
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.680
and the key is to actually be enabled these things to be in relationship with

35
00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:41.110
each other and vital healthy relationship with each other.

36
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.860
And I think that's the,
in some sense,
the essence of what he's focusing on and,

37
00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:46.790
and sort of the core of what he's asking about,

38
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.690
<v 1>very easy to work with as his voice,</v>

39
00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:54.691
as an instrument because he speaks very deliberately and sonorously and

40
00:02:55.781 --> 00:02:57.340
rhythmically anyway,

41
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.020
he actually speaks in a kind of form of rhythmic poetry or sometimes he is

42
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:06.790
actually Rafiq Peterson's words plus low fi hip hop.

43
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.560
He calls Jb

44
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.493
<v 0>p waves.</v>

45
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.260
<v 1>At first it's like,
oh,
it's a novelty thing.
And then I kind of listened to it.</v>

46
00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:20.270
It's like,
no,
it's not a novelty thing.
This is actually really good.

47
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.630
<v 2>Yeah,
that's been,
that's been the reaction all over.</v>

48
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.620
I think that that was Peterson's reaction rolling.
He was instantly like,

49
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.840
this was going to be silly and was music and then was like,
oh,

50
00:03:29.841 --> 00:03:34.310
this is actually artful and now it's actually proving useful.

51
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.440
And uh,
that's generally the reaction from people.

52
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.990
<v 4>And if you don't have a no lane,
that's not good.
That's what I'm doing.</v>

53
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.403
Good.

54
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.770
<v 1>Shelly,</v>

55
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.770
interesting that you say as well that Peterson has a very musical or a very

56
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.060
performative aspect to to his speech because he talks about performance

57
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.220
performance or aligning yourself with the truth and if you are aligning yourself

58
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:01.020
with the logos of the creative principle,

59
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.290
you would expect to be for that to have an effect on your actual performance.

60
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.530
Like he feels like a very embodied speaker when he's on stage,

61
00:04:10.531 --> 00:04:13.260
like he's fully inhabiting the stories that he's,

62
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.830
that he's telling and that that performative aspect of it is,

63
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.950
seems to me at least also related to what he's talking about,

64
00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:23.130
the logos and the incarnating it more in your life and incarnating it more in

65
00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:24.720
your,
in your Ba.

66
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.983
<v 2>Yes.</v>

67
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.340
And watching him become that over the years because he was not always is as

68
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:34.930
confident and able to just now you know,
your freestyle this,
right.

69
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.490
He's,
he's his whole career,
his whole career.
It's really reminded me of,

70
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.220
it's very 57 for example,
got big,
uh,

71
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:48.040
off the back of a drama.

72
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.160
There was created drama,
you know,

73
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:55.270
beefs with other rappers and being shot 13 times and all this stuff was draws

74
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:56.410
people into the story.

75
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.860
But then he had this huge body of work and that kept people there.

76
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.290
Peterson did this,
PSN had these public dramas and that brought people to him.

77
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:06.850
But then when they got to him there,

78
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.990
there was this huge body of work for them to get sort of lost and immersed in
it.

79
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.290
Peterson has some kind of drama like every week at this point.

80
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:16.430
He's like the ultimate sort of contemporary and battle rapper.

81
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.630
He's at war with all sorts of people that whole time.
Is it this,
it's brilliant.

82
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:21.040
Very interesting.
And if you're in,
so you know,

83
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:22.390
if you're a rat fan or if you're a,

84
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.410
what would you call if you're a intellectual dark web or whatever the hell it is

85
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:30.490
fan.
It's like this guy's getting incredible beefs every week.
Right?

86
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:34.120
And there's a new sort of super villain to root against every week regards to

87
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:35.850
him.
Or if you're on his side or not,
you know,

88
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.660
the whole thing is very entertaining,

89
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:40.960
but then it pulls you in and then there's all this meaning of this huge body of

90
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.853
<v 5>just to charge.</v>

91
00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.650
<v 2>He's quite on this lake.
If you watch him like 15 years ago,</v>

92
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.780
he was a bit awkward and sort of,

93
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.660
he was very charming and he knew what he was talking about,

94
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.480
but the absolute fucking beast that he has become as a performance creature who

95
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:15.920
can now just rock up at an amphitheater and just like freestyle the new two hour

96
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.490
lecture off the top of his head and he's very into not repeating himself too

97
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:22.030
much and it's like you go see a standup comedian,

98
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.040
you'll see pretty much the same set every week for like a year or something.

99
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:29.660
Right.
He won't do that.
Uh,
he's more like a very good Dj.
Like,

100
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.360
you know,
he has all these yes,
like a fist full of things that,
you know,

101
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:34.970
his works together and they're linked and he can take you on these different

102
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:37.970
journeys.
But depending on who's in the room and where he is,

103
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:42.530
he will create a new and transformative,
always experienced.

104
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.700
<v 6>I remember discovering Jordan Peterson last June and just immediately thinking</v>

105
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:50.420
this is the thing that is needed right now.

106
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.480
This is about the re-enchantment of,
of the world,

107
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:57.050
the assimilation of spirituality,
the assimilation of religion.
This is,

108
00:06:57.051 --> 00:07:00.500
this is the thing.
And I was kind of obsessed,
like digesting,

109
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:04.350
listening to all of his stuff,
and then pitched,
um,

110
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.550
an interview to him and was lucky enough to get an interview with him in October

111
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.380
that we then put out as the truth and the time of chaos documentary in,

112
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.060
in January at exactly the time that ironically,
he then,

113
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.750
uh,

114
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.750
kind of shop for fame with an interview with my ex colleague Kathy Newman on

115
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:28.121
channel four news when a lot of what I had gone to talk to Jordan Peterson about

116
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.320
was synchronicity.
And it was just uncanny.

117
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.210
That's when the synchronicity,

118
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.150
<v 7>that's right.
That's when things start to line up.</v>

119
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.450
And the more you're in that space,
the more they line up.
Yeah.

120
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.190
And so the question is,
if you're like really in that space,

121
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.230
how much do things line up?

122
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.290
<v 6>All of this was happening and I,
I wonder what I was going to meet,</v>

123
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.330
what to make of this.
And for quite a while I was thinking,
well,

124
00:07:54.331 --> 00:07:58.500
I have this kind of link to,
to,
to cafe and I have some kind of link to Jordan.

125
00:07:58.501 --> 00:08:01.740
So what I need to do is liaise between them and get them to go and do the second

126
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.780
interview that I thought was necessary.

127
00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:08.400
And so for a while I was doing that kind of trying to do stuff behind the scenes

128
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.230
and then it was clear that Kathy wasn't interested at channel four,

129
00:08:13.231 --> 00:08:17.190
weren't interested.
So Jennifer new,
sorry,
weren't interested.

130
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.940
So in the end I thought,
well,
okay.
And then it came to me,
okay,

131
00:08:20.941 --> 00:08:24.030
I should make a documentary glitch in the matrix,

132
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.080
which then was a way of like just downloading all the stuff that I'd been

133
00:08:28.081 --> 00:08:32.040
thinking about for quite a while,
especially since the election of Trump,

134
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:36.960
about kind of the shadow side of liberalism and all of the blind spots of

135
00:08:36.961 --> 00:08:40.920
liberalism.
So glitch in the Matrix was kind of the,
the title of it and it all,

136
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.980
it was,
it came from a very,

137
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:48.360
from a real flow state of like being really aligned and feeling like,
okay,

138
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.560
this is what I meant to be doing,

139
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.740
which is the essence of kind of synchronicity and the essence of Jordan

140
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:57.741
Peterson's deeper meaning is you when you're aligned at the right place and then

141
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.480
your sense of meaning and tells you what to do.

142
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.810
And I think he is often misconstrued by people who can't get past the politics

143
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:09.240
or have a reactivity to him.

144
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.420
But to me he is doing nothing less than channeling and fully articulating the

145
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:20.230
deep story of Western culture for the first time.
And,
well,

146
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.620
certainly for the first time in the Internet age,

147
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:26.850
you could argue that your mom was doing the same thing back in the,
in the 50s.

148
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.480
And there are people who come along and do this at times in the past.

149
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.010
But effectively he's saying,
we already know a lot of the answers.

150
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:37.140
We already know the way to live.

151
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:42.000
It's embodied in our action that's embodied in mythologies embodied in our

152
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.780
religions.
It's embodied in all of these things.
Look at this piece of art.

153
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.800
What is it saying?
We represented it in art,
we represented it in all these ways,

154
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.700
and now we can fully articulate it tight into neuroscience,
tie into,

155
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.960
and that it's a,
it's an epic,
epic project.

156
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.320
And so I get accused and it's very easy to sort of say,

157
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:07.410
well,
you're obsessed with Jordan Peterson or your fan boy and all that stuff.

158
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:10.230
And um,
but for me,

159
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.250
the message that he's bringing forward is that deep.
It's that deep.

160
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.280
And therefore I want to continue to use his thought as a lens to link into other

161
00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:22.740
great thinkers.

162
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.700
Like we just put out an interview with Rupert Sheldrake who I think is an

163
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:28.030
amazing rebellious thing guy.

164
00:10:28.031 --> 00:10:33.031
He's been doing this stuff for a long time and I want to also continue to kind

165
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:37.940
of expand that into other,
into other thinkers.
Make the conscious link to,

166
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.570
to this sort of deeper worldview and help.
Yeah,
just bring out great,

167
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.130
bring out great content really

168
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.710
<v 8>where,
where is his insight coming from?</v>

169
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.780
And so we taught you when you were describing,
hey,

170
00:10:49.781 --> 00:10:53.260
you almost sound a little bit like Jordan pieces.
I mean in the sense of,
yeah,

171
00:10:53.261 --> 00:10:58.261
I mean if I had to describe my world view in a nutshell,

172
00:10:58.721 --> 00:11:01.750
it would be sort of a neoplatonic.

173
00:11:01.751 --> 00:11:05.350
So there was a neoplatonic stoic,
um,

174
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.690
mystic Christic gnostic.

175
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.400
So the idea of neoplatonic I believe that I've always just sort of felt like

176
00:11:12.401 --> 00:11:15.640
there was a,
a realm of ideal forms,
stoic do the,

177
00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:20.050
suck it up fat kid and do the hard thing 100%.
Um,
gnostic.

178
00:11:20.051 --> 00:11:22.570
There is a sudden ineffable experience of being.

179
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.120
And then the mystic Christic is some,

180
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.240
some reflection on the Judeo Christian western tradition,

181
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.980
but nothing to do with 2000 years of bureaucratic administration and everything

182
00:11:32.981 --> 00:11:37.600
to do with what is nominally the metaphor of Kairos and Kronos,

183
00:11:37.601 --> 00:11:41.660
the intersection of kind of sacred and profane time in human form.
Um,

184
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.240
so in that respect,
yeah.
Um,
I would track with with Peterson,
my sense is for me,

185
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.070
um,
my,
you know,
gnosis or understanding,

186
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.830
um,
has come x stasis has come from um,

187
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.760
peak experiences.
Um,

188
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:02.110
and my sense for him or at least as he shares what he does have his life has

189
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:05.340
come from Catharsis,
has come from the suffering.
It's come from,
um,

190
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.580
battling depression has come from staring at the abyss in the face versus the

191
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:10.391
view from the summit.

192
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:13.840
And those are ideally come full circle and reinforce each other.

193
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.790
But if I had to sort of delineate maybe where's his transmission anchoring from,

194
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:23.440
it's maybe a little bit more the staring the abyss and,
and,
and surviving it.

195
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.310
Then,
uh,
then calling out coordinates from the mountaintop.

196
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.940
<v 2>The most important thing for me,</v>

197
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.040
quite apart from his work with,
you know,

198
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.140
these stories of modern myth was,
as you say,

199
00:12:37.141 --> 00:12:41.550
he's investigation to the Bible.
And I've always been fascinated,

200
00:12:41.551 --> 00:12:42.600
although I'm an atheist,

201
00:12:42.601 --> 00:12:47.130
I'm always been fascinated by the power of the biblical stories.

202
00:12:47.131 --> 00:12:52.131
I often found myself looking at these huge cathedrals and churches that sprouted

203
00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:57.720
up all over Europe,
you know,
and I asked myself,
well,

204
00:12:57.721 --> 00:13:02.070
what's that about?
You know,
why was this story so powerful?
I mean,
yeah,

205
00:13:02.071 --> 00:13:05.400
it's a defense against death if you want to be cynical,
but hey,
you know,

206
00:13:05.401 --> 00:13:07.280
it could be lots of other stories,
you know,
and well,
why?

207
00:13:07.281 --> 00:13:11.580
Why is this one so unbelievably powerful and what does it mean for it to be so

208
00:13:11.581 --> 00:13:13.140
powerful?
And pieces,

209
00:13:13.141 --> 00:13:17.760
I think really answers that question in the biblical lectures he's done and he

210
00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:20.040
really trained me.
Those lectures are,

211
00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:25.041
you genuinely did I think change the way I lived my life because he came to this

212
00:13:25.201 --> 00:13:28.530
very,
very important conclusion,
which I'm pretty convinced buyer.

213
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.470
I don't think I'm ever 100% convinced by anything,

214
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.550
but I'm very convinced by his idea as I've,
I've,

215
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:40.110
I'm someone who's suffered depression and depression is like a crisis of meaning

216
00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.440
in your,
in your eyes.

217
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.890
The worst thing about depression is not about being miserable as being,

218
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.910
having a life that seems utterly meaningless and that's why it's such torment

219
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.890
and pizza and in Hawaii tries to answer the question,

220
00:13:52.891 --> 00:13:57.310
how do we as an individual,
that's a bit of a paradox.

221
00:13:57.311 --> 00:14:02.311
How do I as an individual acquire meaning because meaning is the most important

222
00:14:02.811 --> 00:14:06.600
thing any of us could have.
You know there's meaning is it,
you know,

223
00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:09.860
if you don't know you yet,
no one can quite see what meaning is,

224
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.610
which I think is interesting in itself.
Yeah,
it was as well.

225
00:14:13.611 --> 00:14:17.000
I wanted to send some menial,
what is that sense of me?
What is meaning?

226
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.203
<v 9>And</v>

227
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:24.910
<v 2>Peterson I think acknowledges that mystery but also says,
well,
you know,</v>

228
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.070
if you want a sense of meaning,
it's not about just doing what you want.

229
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:35.130
It's not about just following your bliss as Joseph Campbell would be or or,

230
00:14:35.781 --> 00:14:38.230
or having as much fun as possible

231
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.850
or even necessarily

232
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.610
<v 9>being happy.</v>

233
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.150
<v 2>No,
absolutely not.
Not necessarily big happy.
It's,</v>

234
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:52.230
there were more things than being happy

235
00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.160
<v 1>and I've also found that to be true in my life.</v>

236
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.580
I hadn't heard someone making a compelling case like this that was actually

237
00:14:58.581 --> 00:15:02.270
getting traction with people and it was clear Peterson was getting traction and

238
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:04.250
so then I said,
I've got to listen to this guy.

239
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.200
I've got to figure out what he's saying and why it's working and what,

240
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.840
how I should respond to what's happening around him.

241
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.100
<v 6>How has it been as well?</v>

242
00:15:14.101 --> 00:15:16.950
Because Peterson has obviously began it and been getting more and more

243
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:17.970
controversial.

244
00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:19.150
<v 10>Yeah,</v>

245
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.070
<v 6>and I've kind of felt this as well.</v>

246
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.640
Sort of like you end up getting into conversations.
No,
he didn't mean that.

247
00:15:24.641 --> 00:15:26.380
It wasn't about that.
How has,

248
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:31.440
how has that been like have people started arguing with you or judging what

249
00:15:32.651 --> 00:15:33.760
you're saying or,

250
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.230
<v 10>yeah.
How's that been?</v>

251
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:40.840
<v 1>I deeply suspect there are a number of friends of mine that are deeply concerned</v>

252
00:15:40.841 --> 00:15:43.570
for me because of this Jordan Peterson thing,

253
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.170
because they hear,
again,
the soundbite world grabs a few things.

254
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.670
Jordan Peterson is a bigot,
he's transphobic,
he's homophobic,

255
00:15:54.671 --> 00:15:58.870
he's,
you know,
the godfather of the patriarchy,
whatever he is.

256
00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:03.570
And so Paul,
but the thing is they know me.
They know I'm not a bigot.

257
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.820
They know.
They know where I was raised.

258
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.230
They know who's in my church,
they know.

259
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.030
They know me by my actions.

260
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.680
So what to do with this?

261
00:16:17.681 --> 00:16:20.260
I've given Jordan Peterson in a sense a year of my life.

262
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.110
What do you do with that?
Well,
they don't know what to do with that.

263
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:26.960
So they're quiet and they watch and they wait.

264
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.640
<v 11>When Adam and Matt invited me to do that podcast,
we were all someone who,</v>

265
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.750
similar to the two of you,

266
00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:37.751
I believe we're starting to track Peterson and not just Jordan Peterson and he

267
00:16:38.571 --> 00:16:41.450
was saying,
but also the ripples.
He was having a culture,

268
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.480
the absolute phenomenon and explosion of attention that was happening around him

269
00:16:48.051 --> 00:16:53.030
in the media and started kind of watching him,
reading him with an open mind.

270
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.430
My experience was an open mind like,
oh,
I resonate with that.

271
00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:59.030
I love how he's bringing in Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell and archetypal

272
00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:00.410
dimensions to his thinking.

273
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.740
Like how he's kind of kicking the left a little bit in calling them on some of

274
00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:06.360
their problematic um,

275
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.120
thinking and then watching this kind of phenomenon from the left or the far left

276
00:17:11.121 --> 00:17:15.740
with people just with extraordinary levels of,
um,

277
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.890
anger and fear and distrust and kind of the,

278
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.120
the difference in that experience of my own and some of our experiences of

279
00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:29.750
Peterson.
And then watching a lot of friends who are on the far left,

280
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.860
having radically different experience and perception of who he is and what he's

281
00:17:33.861 --> 00:17:37.490
bringing.
And it was really just curious about that.
And it,

282
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:42.020
it seems like similar to some of the stuff you've been doing with rebel wisdom

283
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:47.210
<v 6>and as a,
I mean,
you're training as a psychologist.
We do a lot of work with,</v>

284
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.950
with psychology as well.
When there's a huge reactivity

285
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.551
<v 2>to something,</v>

286
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:53.010
there's always something interesting going on behind it and then it sort of

287
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:57.120
makes you inquire.
It's like,
okay,
what is,
what are people reacting to?
Yes.

288
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.010
Whether you love him or hate him,

289
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:03.580
<v 11>it's an equal proportion of intensity and whenever that's there it's with,</v>

290
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.700
to kind of call it a complex,
complex is a,
is a psychological,

291
00:18:07.701 --> 00:18:11.390
and I think young would say it like it can be a autonomous and autonomous

292
00:18:11.391 --> 00:18:16.220
complex is,
it's not part of the ego.
It's so deep rooted and it's my opinion,

293
00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:19.550
it's a collective complex.
It's in the collective unconscious

294
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.780
<v 2>and it's like everyone on the right things separate.</v>

295
00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:23.680
One on the left is a Stalinist and everyone,

296
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.040
everyone on the right thinks everyone,
everyone on the left thing said,

297
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:31.041
we're on the right is a Nazi and there's this polarization happening where

298
00:18:31.151 --> 00:18:35.200
people like,
like Peterson who are trying to carve out,

299
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.420
I would say not nonpolitical,

300
00:18:37.421 --> 00:18:40.270
but it kind of a position that's lateral to politics.

301
00:18:40.271 --> 00:18:44.350
It's more in the psychological domain to ask people to look at themselves as

302
00:18:44.351 --> 00:18:48.370
individuals to question the extent to which they're projecting their shadow onto

303
00:18:48.371 --> 00:18:52.210
the other,
which until we can resolve issues on that level,

304
00:18:52.211 --> 00:18:55.840
it's going to be very difficult to resolve these political disagreements.

305
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.660
And so that's one of the main reasons that I've found myself.

306
00:18:58.661 --> 00:19:00.580
So interested in what Peterson is saying,

307
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.580
shifting the level of the conversation of trying to at least

308
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.360
<v 12>I was so excited to see Jordan Peterson erupt onto the stage and I know you had</v>

309
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.400
particularly part in that

310
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.730
there is a culture war that is in

311
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.600
bright precedents.

312
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.750
I mean we are in the middle of a culture war.

313
00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:34.090
There's a polarization and Jordan Peterson is standing in the middle is a

314
00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:38.620
lightening rod taking all the projections from both sides.

315
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.090
He clearly sees the postmodern,

316
00:19:43.091 --> 00:19:47.080
idiotic Mudgee and it is an ideology.

317
00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:52.740
It's a system of beliefs and values that will not lead us to the promised land.

318
00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.030
It is,
it is problematic.

319
00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:01.420
It leads us into a swamp with no exit.

320
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.580
It is not sustainable.

321
00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.350
He sees it very clarity and in my opinion,

322
00:20:08.351 --> 00:20:10.960
he sees it from a modern perspective,

323
00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.790
very brilliant modern perspective.
He's,
he's,

324
00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.240
and he has a depth because of his understanding of Carl Young and his own work

325
00:20:22.481 --> 00:20:27.340
in psychology,
the field of psychology that is deeper than most people.

326
00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.460
So people are drawn to that depth.

327
00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:36.030
He sees something much deeper than other people are seeing right now.

328
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.410
<v 2>We had had,
we'd never met one another.
Um,
I knew,</v>

329
00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.090
I actually knew very little about Jordan Peterson has written work.

330
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.040
He knew pretty little about Maine and we were just told

331
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.210
<v 6>sit down and shoot and we had no idea where we were going.</v>

332
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.100
So he just started talking.
So why the mastering this hemisphere?

333
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.980
They just went from that.

334
00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:01.350
But what I felt was here was a super intelligent man who had wide ranging

335
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:05.980
interests in psychology,

336
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.000
philosophy and didn't rule out a spiritual angle to things.
Um,

337
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:13.840
and I don't think that I would add in the film in that clip.

338
00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:17.530
I think it probably comes out that there are aspects of what Jordan was saying

339
00:21:17.531 --> 00:21:22.350
that I was getting.
Well,
yes,
but so I don't entirely,
you kind of,
uh,

340
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.250
uh,
not a pizza,
pizza 70th,

341
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.620
but I do have huge respectful and we had a great conversation and we're

342
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:36.610
proposing to do more.
What do you make of the sort of the criticisms?

343
00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:40.510
Cause often he's described as a fraud or a charlatan in some of the media

344
00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:43.290
coverage,
but when you watch the interview with yourself,
I mean that's,

345
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.010
that's a very high level conversation.

346
00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:49.230
The idea of him as a fraud or a charlatan just seems kind of,
it's,

347
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:54.280
it's outrageous.
It's um,
it's disrespectful,

348
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:59.110
it's dismissive and it's entirely typical of blinkered liberalism.

349
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.631
He,

350
00:22:00.631 --> 00:22:04.810
you can disagree with him about many things and I would disagree with him about

351
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:06.123
a number of things,

352
00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.840
but to say that is just to show how blinkered could you are.

353
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.410
He's clearly an extraordinary man.

354
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:19.860
And I had a call ever [inaudible] what does that mean?

355
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.600
I think what strikes people is that he was relatively unknown and then he became

356
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:26.420
known.
No,

357
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.710
<v 8>but that's what life is.
And it just approved for Rochelle is,
yeah.</v>

358
00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.150
I mean a lot of this sounds quite Jordan pieces and ask,

359
00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.010
what's your attitude to Jordan Peterson?
Yeah,
I mean,
I,
I'm,

360
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.730
I'm glad he's out there.
Um,
and I think there are,
I mean,

361
00:22:40.731 --> 00:22:43.570
I think at a minimum there's sort of three different Jordan Peterson's,
you know,

362
00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.190
there's Jordan Peterson,
the analysts and academic,

363
00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.460
which virtually nobody overheard her.
There's Jordan Peterson,

364
00:22:49.461 --> 00:22:53.110
the kind of contrarian public intellectual,
which Sorta,
you know,

365
00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.280
kicked off in 2016.
Um,

366
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:59.270
and then there's sort of Jordan Peterson and sort of raw sharp blood for the

367
00:22:59.271 --> 00:23:03.950
culture wars of which both left and rate wildly distort who he is,

368
00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:08.450
what he's saying and what it and what it means for them.
And so we get,

369
00:23:08.451 --> 00:23:11.330
we get the,
the second and the third one's completely maxed out there.

370
00:23:11.331 --> 00:23:14.170
The first one,
you know,
University of Toronto and you know,

371
00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.210
former Harvard professor is the one that gives the credibility and the wheat to

372
00:23:17.211 --> 00:23:21.500
the other two dialogues.
So in that respect,
um,
I think as an,

373
00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.490
what I imagined him to be as an actual man,
it's a pretty high integrity,

374
00:23:25.491 --> 00:23:28.430
principled person who likes to think for himself.
And likes to speak,

375
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.410
not just truth to power,
but,

376
00:23:30.411 --> 00:23:34.520
but also likes to remained his audience,

377
00:23:34.521 --> 00:23:39.190
whether it's students or,
or broader than that.
Um,
what,
what is,
you know,

378
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:43.700
what is the,
what is it a life?
Well,
a good life,
well lived.
Um,
and now they're,

379
00:23:43.701 --> 00:23:47.990
I think there are there problems in how,

380
00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:52.991
in the age of soundbites and hundreds of hours of footage and tons of speaking

381
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:56.210
and those kinds of things that become problematic.

382
00:23:56.211 --> 00:24:00.290
And I'm not in any way convinced that if I sat down with him and said,
hey mate,

383
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:03.020
what about this bit that he would actually stand and defend them,

384
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.920
but impressions I get would be that his,
um,

385
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.410
I think he's sometimes over catastrophizes the slippery slope to Marxism,
uh,

386
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:14.150
in the sense of that,
that all that,
you know,

387
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:19.010
this way lifestyle and his death camps,
therefore we cannot give one inch,
um,
on,

388
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.990
um,
concessions to progressive ideals or agendas.

389
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.250
Although having said that,

390
00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.630
I've also personally experienced the almost Chinese communists,

391
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:34.100
like Thompson struggle sessions of political correctness in the academy and it's

392
00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:36.930
kind of left wing,
you know,
left coast,
um,
idea.

393
00:24:36.931 --> 00:24:39.980
So it's not that I don't see the peril.
I do,

394
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:45.250
I just think sometimes he uses the slippery slope argument.

395
00:24:46.191 --> 00:24:46.491
Maybe he,

396
00:24:46.491 --> 00:24:49.730
I think he pulls it out just sometimes a little early is the bottom line without

397
00:24:49.731 --> 00:24:54.590
necessarily enough conditions to justify it.
He sometimes,
um,
in my experience,

398
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:59.450
I think I remember him on Joe Rogan doing the life is nasty,
brutish and short,

399
00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:02.900
that kind of Hobbsy in it's always been this way.
Therefore,

400
00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:07.340
any efforts to try and re calibrate or rebalance the scales are fundamentally

401
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:10.510
flawed,
delusional,
and by the way,
lead to the style and his death camps,
um,

402
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.550
without any more nuance,

403
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:17.540
sociopolitical critique of practices and policies.
So for instance,

404
00:25:17.541 --> 00:25:22.430
concentration of wealth and the 1% and even the percent of the 1% has been

405
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.580
directly traceable in,
at least in the u s over it,
you know,

406
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.440
tax and tax and corporate law,
uh,

407
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:33.460
various various deliberate policies that are fundamentally different than the

408
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.100
seventies and eighties and have now resulted in an incredible skewing and

409
00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:40.880
aggregation of wealth in the hands of the few for him to skip over that and go

410
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:42.190
to lobsters.

411
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:47.180
And serotonin feels like skipping two critical steps and also skipping some

412
00:25:47.181 --> 00:25:50.870
critical places of potential responsibility.
Um,

413
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:56.050
<v 13>and what became real clear,
is it left and liberal?
We're no longer the same deal.</v>

414
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.260
All a regional leftists were liberals,

415
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.560
but the near leftists were illiberals.

416
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:07.670
They are anti liberal and das a disaster.

417
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.380
You can't go forward with that kind of pathology.

418
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.630
And so if you're somebody like Jordan Peterson who is thinking internally and

419
00:26:16.631 --> 00:26:21.490
you're looking around and seeing what the hell is going on and you're starting

420
00:26:21.491 --> 00:26:26.170
to notice this,
and then the government comes along and says,
oh,
and by the way,

421
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:31.230
I'm going to compel your speech that resend anybody with integrity and integral

422
00:26:33.971 --> 00:26:35.920
thinking over the wall.

423
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:41.170
And so he was up all night.
He did those three videos,

424
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.930
uh,
and um,
you know,
if forcing,
uh,

425
00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:51.000
unconscious bias retraining and political correctness and what he saw happening

426
00:26:51.001 --> 00:26:51.850
with that,
and the,

427
00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.760
and the nightmare of bill [inaudible] threw them up on the net,
went viral.

428
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.310
And
the main cause of that in my opinion,

429
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:07.610
is that he sees orange liberal values of equal opportunity that we're getting

430
00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:15.381
crushed between the extreme far left of green and a strong far right of

431
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.390
ethnocentric amber and these liberal values in between.

432
00:27:24.391 --> 00:27:29.391
We're just getting left out of the out of the picture and that was a disaster

433
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:35.120
and that was the thing that at least put Jordan Peterson on the map and he was

434
00:27:36.841 --> 00:27:41.841
arguing against bill see 16 because not only that it put into law a

435
00:27:45.481 --> 00:27:49.080
constructivist view of human identity.

436
00:27:49.081 --> 00:27:54.081
That was his complaint had nothing to do with transgender people and the people

437
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:59.991
that attacked him for being anti transgender had absolutely nothing to do with

438
00:28:00.391 --> 00:28:02.670
that and he's very clear about that.

439
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:08.180
What it was was putting into actual law,

440
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.800
a constructivist view of human nature,

441
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.710
which by the way it is pure green,

442
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:21.740
it's pure postmodern green viewpoint and that also is an attack on free speech

443
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.350
and the worst possible way for me,

444
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:33.410
<v 6>his success signifies how much we're thirsting for this father energy in our</v>

445
00:28:33.871 --> 00:28:35.730
culture.
What do you make of Jordan Peterson?

446
00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:37.380
What do you make of the Jordan Peterson phenomena?

447
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.110
<v 14>No,
I think,
first of all,
I would not have predicted it,
so I don't want to,</v>

448
00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.060
I think maybe I'm often called among my,

449
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.430
among my people who agree with me.
I'm called a visionary and,

450
00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.930
but I was not a visionary and enforcing,
um,
Jordan Peterson.
Um,

451
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.890
I think it's amazing that an intellectual,
um,

452
00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.040
that is a youngin who is,
um,
you know,

453
00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:03.250
who speaks in terms of often a metaphor,
an allegory,

454
00:29:03.251 --> 00:29:07.360
a that he has risen to such extraordinary success.

455
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:12.610
And I think it is,
it is in part a result of our enormous hunger.

456
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.023
We,
you know,
we have,

457
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:19.360
we've attached to two extremely unlikely figures because at our hunger that

458
00:29:19.451 --> 00:29:23.350
Donald Trump on the one hand and Jordan Peterson on the other two ends of the

459
00:29:23.351 --> 00:29:27.880
extreme in terms of somebody who's been willing to say,
you know,

460
00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.250
fathers are important,
families are important.

461
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.700
And so Jordan and I found ourselves in,

462
00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:37.350
in an hour and a half dialogue in which I would give,
uh,

463
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.250
uh,
you know,

464
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.680
I would talk about fathers and rough housing and he would talk about,
um,

465
00:29:41.681 --> 00:29:46.320
some intellectual Piaget or someone else who was,
um,
you know,

466
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.600
who was in the literature,
um,
uh,

467
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.570
or in Disney movies or something else that related to that.

468
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.930
And it was just a fascinating hour and a half I think,

469
00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.170
because I know I'm usually,
when I'm being interviewed,

470
00:29:59.171 --> 00:30:02.440
I don't learn a great deal.
Um,
but I certainly learned,

471
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.460
I always wonderful the way we learned from each other.

472
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:12.320
<v 6>You'll,
you're from Canada.
One of the,
the biggest,
um,</v>

473
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:16.100
phenomenon of the last couple of years has been Jordan Peterson.
Yeah.

474
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.020
Would it be made of of him his rise and what it says about the culture that

475
00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.990
people are so thirsting for what he's talking about?

476
00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:28.680
<v 15>Peterson,
firstly,
he was very bright,
extraordinary,
articulate,</v>

477
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.140
and in some ways a compelling speaker.
So he's an,

478
00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.870
he's an attractive figure in some ways.
When I read him,

479
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.800
I sense a lot of suppressed rage in him.
I,
in fact,

480
00:30:40.801 --> 00:30:43.080
I think his voice is choking with Rachel out of our farm.

481
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.500
It's interesting because he talks about rage that you have to deal with it I

482
00:30:46.501 --> 00:30:49.640
don't think you'd understand your Sangria with.
And it's,
and,
and,

483
00:30:49.641 --> 00:30:52.290
and if you look at those websites,
the comments

484
00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:59.040
are full of rage by his young acolytes.
Well,

485
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.300
that's an energetic thing,

486
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:06.000
but it's this energy that draws people as much as what he actually teaches.

487
00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.800
Secondly,
he teaches a repression.
I mean,
he,

488
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:16.670
he very rightly takes an issue where somebody mandates a certain goal in

489
00:31:17.011 --> 00:31:20.970
language and he very rightly and righteously sums up.

490
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:25.230
I will not be dictated to about what language I'm going.
He look good for him.

491
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:30.630
I'm all in favor of mandating language on the one hand.

492
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:36.420
On the other hand,
he basically advocates repression

493
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:38.551
in his book,

494
00:31:38.551 --> 00:31:42.600
he talks about how an angry to your child needs to be sit by themselves until

495
00:31:42.601 --> 00:31:43.434
they get over it.

496
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.970
Rather than understanding why a child would be angry at age two,

497
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:53.460
what frustrations are having and what human contact they need to help them move

498
00:31:53.461 --> 00:31:58.100
through that anger.
He says repressed the anger.
So he's all about redress tigers,

499
00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.110
for example.
And it's very interesting.

500
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.690
It talks about children and he talks to them a little environments and little

501
00:32:03.691 --> 00:32:06.510
monsters and so on.
I know that's meant to be humorous,

502
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.870
but it's also a certain way of thinking of the young human child.

503
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.590
So fundamentally I steam as an Asian to repression.

504
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.950
He posing as an agent,
the libertarianism,

505
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:24.470
not to mention he's got this bee in his bonnet about what he considers to be,

506
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:30.140
seems to consider it to be conspiracies by left wing intellectuals.

507
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:35.520
They seem to be,
as Beth know,
are,
uh,
being in a left wing intellectual myself.

508
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.730
I like to talk to them.
Something that what you so upset about Jordan,

509
00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:43.840
what are you so afraid of?
You know,
he talks about this bloody Marxists and,

510
00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.100
and any,
any points.
So very accurately,

511
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:51.850
all the horror that occurred under so-called Marxists.

512
00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.220
There's teams,
particularly in the Soviet Union.

513
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.720
He was absolutely accurate about that.
But then he put,
wants Christianity,

514
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.420
shall I tell him about the mass murders that occurred in the name of Christian?

515
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:04.263
I think,

516
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.790
should I tell him about all the millions that were slaughtered in the names of

517
00:33:07.791 --> 00:33:11.420
the gentle Jesus?
In other words,
let's be fair about it.

518
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.910
Uh,

519
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.910
he seems to pick ideologies to attack and the horror and embrace other

520
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:23.630
etiologies thought it just as murderers in practice.

521
00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:27.620
Sometimes it's a much more interesting question for me.

522
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.520
What happened in Eastern Europe?
How come under any biology,

523
00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:34.610
it was meant to be liberated people.
So many people who are oppressed.

524
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.530
I come from eastern Europe,
I was born in Hungary.

525
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.420
He doesn't have to tell me about what it was like,

526
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:44.710
but how about asking how come a religious philosophy that was meant to promote

527
00:33:44.961 --> 00:33:49.961
love and acceptance and compassion has become such an agent of 2 million.

528
00:33:51.801 --> 00:33:55.520
They have repression,
oppression,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and killing.

529
00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.890
So can we be objective or we're going to be simply tribal about it?

530
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.530
I have a lot to say to Jordan or a lot too,

531
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.700
as much as I appreciate actually some of what he says and as interesting as I

532
00:34:07.701 --> 00:34:10.580
find them,
I think is a very mixed figure,

533
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:12.920
largely any Asian tour of repression.
