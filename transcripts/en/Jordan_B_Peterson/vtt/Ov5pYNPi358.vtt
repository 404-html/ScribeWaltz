1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we talked a lot about the brain last </v>

2
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.300
<v Speaker 1>time and we're going to talk a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit more about that.</v>

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And then we're going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization of hierarchical systems and</v>

4
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to talk about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation in mythology.</v>

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.873
<v Speaker 1>So this is from a paper by Swanson and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Swanson has been studying the </v>

6
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus for a very long time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain organization in general.</v>

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.430
<v Speaker 1>And the way he conceptualized as it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>is in a rather piaget the incense.</v>

8
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.633
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the essential outputs of the nervous </v>

9
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:36.294
<v Speaker 1>system are basically patterns of motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and those are controlled by </v>

10
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.453
<v Speaker 1>patterns of spinal cord activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are controlled by patterns </v>

11
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>that higher brain levels including the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>

12
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And then those are controlled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional systems.</v>

13
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>There's patterned responses at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional level.</v>

14
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:54.234
<v Speaker 1>And then those are controlled by pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern responses at the level of the </v>

15
00:00:58.171 --> 00:00:59.004
<v Speaker 1>cortex.</v>

16
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>And the body sort of builds itself from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom up.</v>

17
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.513
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as it builds itself from the bottom </v>

18
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to integrate the function of</v>

19
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:10.614
<v Speaker 1>all the systems that are necessary for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the maintenance of the biological </v>

20
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>maintenance of life in the medium term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short term,</v>

21
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:18.594
<v Speaker 1>medium term and long term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a social context that works for </v>

22
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:23.604
<v Speaker 1>the social context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also works for the individual </v>

23
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:26.004
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could imagine that that's a </v>

24
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:27.894
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hypothetically possible that </v>

25
00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:35.251
<v Speaker 1>there's only a certain set of solutions </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a problem that complex.</v>

26
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.223
<v Speaker 1>And if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that would account for the </v>

27
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>emergence of something approximating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal morality.</v>

28
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>And it would also explain why every </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible political system won't work.</v>

29
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.433
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

30
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.213
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Swanson's map of the </v>

31
00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:57.584
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you'll note that the hypothalamic </v>

32
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones with the little circles</v>

33
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.320
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the left.</v>

34
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.970
<v Speaker 1>It like every other element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

35
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.900
<v Speaker 1>The hypothalamus isn't a homogenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

36
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And generally when you name something,</v>

37
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name presumes a homogenous structure</v>

38
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.723
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate the name and you would </v>

39
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.110
<v Speaker 1>call it a bunch of names instead of just</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

40
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.730
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

41
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:28.190
<v Speaker 1>that as people learn more about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

42
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:29.024
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice this as you learn more </v>

43
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:31.154
<v Speaker 1>about the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking about it necessarily </v>

44
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:34.484
<v Speaker 1>as the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a homogenous mass of </v>

45
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:39.230
<v Speaker 1>neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you start thinking about it in terms</v>

46
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:40.064
<v Speaker 1>of its functional subsystems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once you learn more about </v>

47
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:43.394
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about those functional </v>

48
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:47.720
<v Speaker 1>subsystems in terms of their functional </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsystems.</v>

49
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.110
<v Speaker 1>And you can keep differentiating all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way down.</v>

50
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 1>You can differentiate all the way down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the molecular level.</v>

51
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.913
<v Speaker 1>And so as your knowledge improves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your level of resolution improves and </v>

52
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>you can use more and more precise </v>
<v Speaker 1>terminology.</v>

53
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>What you see is that the hypothalamus is</v>
<v Speaker 1>composed of a number of systems.</v>

54
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.843
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that Swanson has </v>
<v Speaker 1>done with this particular diagram is </v>

55
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:13.504
<v Speaker 1>indicate which parts of the hypothalamus</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is in a rat's brain are basically </v>

56
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:17.794
<v Speaker 1>responsible for reproductive behaviors </v>
<v Speaker 1>in which are responsible for defensive </v>

57
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the hypothalamus.</v>

58
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Now the other part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

59
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:27.604
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a very archaic system way </v>

60
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:31.684
<v Speaker 1>down in the bottom of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>older than emotions about his oldest </v>

61
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 1>pain that's responsible for these very </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental motivational drive.</v>

62
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:39.784
<v Speaker 1>So you can think about the hypothalamus </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to think about this way as </v>

63
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>the part of the biological basis of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud would have called the Ed.</v>

64
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.153
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to think about it as in </v>

65
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>terms of relatively vague statements </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Ed anymore because we know more</v>

66
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>about the underlying circuitry and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that it's,</v>

67
00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.390
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

68
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.693
<v Speaker 1>quite standard across mammalian species </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even farther back in the genetic </v>

69
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:10.070
<v Speaker 1>chain then just mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

70
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.923
<v Speaker 2>System.</v>

71
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems develop in an evolutionary </v>

73
00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:25.140
<v Speaker 1>chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

74
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.603
<v Speaker 1>And some systems are more primordial </v>
<v Speaker 1>than others and so the hypothalamic </v>

75
00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:31.974
<v Speaker 1>systems are more primordial than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus and the Amygdala acts </v>

76
00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:38.250
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so pain,</v>

77
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>you can think of pain as an emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People usually don't,</v>

78
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:44.460
<v Speaker 1>they usually think about it as an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a motivational system.</v>

79
00:04:44.461 --> 00:04:47.340
<v Speaker 1>But the distinction between those terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>is vague.</v>

80
00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:48.174
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain has a emotion like component and a </v>

81
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:53.700
<v Speaker 1>motivation like component,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anger does.</v>

82
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.150
<v Speaker 1>All I mean by older is that it was their</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

83
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.350
<v Speaker 1>So anxiety for example seems to be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaboration of pain.</v>

84
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.650
<v Speaker 1>So pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain represents pain indicates damage to</v>

85
00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:11.310
<v Speaker 1>the system that's being stimulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

86
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.144
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well let me get to that because I will </v>

87
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:20.070
<v Speaker 1>get to that because that's another</v>

88
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.713
<v Speaker 2>reduction</v>

89
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.280
<v Speaker 1>probably for all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

91
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.473
<v Speaker 1>so this governs reproductive behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be outputs from the </v>

92
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:37.980
<v Speaker 1>reproductive system to other systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that mediate positive emotion,</v>

93
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.330
<v Speaker 1>but they're all too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so part of the hippocampus,</v>

94
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.580
<v Speaker 1>part of the hypothalamus is devoted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these motivation like processes.</v>

95
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.760
<v Speaker 1>I think their motivation like </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities and part of it is actually</v>

96
00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:51.840
<v Speaker 1>devoted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other part of it,</v>

97
00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:52.674
<v Speaker 1>the other half of it is devoted towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration and the exploration system </v>

98
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.063
<v Speaker 1>is the source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The roots of the exploration system in </v>

99
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the,</v>

100
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.823
<v Speaker 1>are the bottom part of the structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that produces the kind of positive </v>

101
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:11.831
<v Speaker 1>emotion that's associated with approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and joy.</v>

102
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.783
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also extremely all because it </v>

103
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>has its roots in the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the dopaminergic system.</v>

104
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>So half the Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

105
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:21.404
<v Speaker 1>is devoted towards the regulation of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally motivated behaviors like </v>

106
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.973
<v Speaker 1>sexuality and defensive aggression say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other half of it is devoted </v>

107
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 1>towards exploration.</v>

108
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.113
<v Speaker 1>And so that's quite interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that means is that </v>

109
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 1>exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tendency,</v>

110
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>the proclivity towards exploration is </v>
<v Speaker 1>also unbelievably archaic.</v>

111
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.730
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really old.</v>

112
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 1>And as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you this before,</v>

113
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 1>if you studied the behavior of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decorticate cat,</v>

114
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.093
<v Speaker 1>which is a cap that really has almost no</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain left except the hypothalamus and </v>

115
00:06:56.151 --> 00:07:00.110
<v Speaker 1>the spinal structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cat is hypo exploratory,</v>

116
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.510
<v Speaker 1>hyper exploratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

117
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.583
<v Speaker 1>It explores more than a normal cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite strange given that it </v>

118
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:07.784
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have much of a brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But part of the reason it explores more </v>

119
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.773
<v Speaker 1>is because it can't form the memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that would inhibit the </v>

120
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 1>exploration has a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

121
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 1>So basically what happens is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>curious about something until you figure</v>

122
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:22.964
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you've built a representation </v>

123
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:25.844
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in some sense a representation </v>

124
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 1>of what to do around that thing.</v>

125
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 1>And once you've built that </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

126
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:32.803
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessary to be curious about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing anymore because you've </v>

127
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:35.924
<v Speaker 1>figured it out and you might as well go </v>
<v Speaker 1>on to some other thing that you don't </v>

128
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't have much of a brain,</v>

129
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.050
<v Speaker 1>you can't store the consequences of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory activity.</v>

130
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:45.884
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't inhibit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why a cat without a brain is </v>

131
00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:49.364
<v Speaker 1>hyper exploratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I think is really interesting </v>

132
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:52.964
<v Speaker 1>about the hypothalamic work is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk a lot about the </v>

133
00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:58.880
<v Speaker 1>representation of exploration in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>

134
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.373
<v Speaker 1>And it was very interesting to me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn that the proclivity towards </v>

135
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:05.714
<v Speaker 1>exploration and the positive emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with that is so </v>

136
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:11.300
<v Speaker 1>ancient that it's grounded in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>

137
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's as all so to speak as hunger and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex knows are very,</v>

138
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:21.311
<v Speaker 1>very old things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might say,</v>

139
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the hypothalamus can do all this,</v>

140
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>why do you need the rest of the brain?</v>

141
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's a perfectly good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

142
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 1>some animals don't have much more brazen</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

143
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.233
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that the reason that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need it is because when you have </v>

144
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:36.524
<v Speaker 1>motivational system a and motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>system be in motivational system c and </v>

145
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Motivational System d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are conflicts.</v>

146
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>There are potential conflicts between </v>
<v Speaker 1>their operations across spans of time.</v>

147
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.143
<v Speaker 1>One can interfere with another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the optimal arrangement is so that </v>

148
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.723
<v Speaker 1>the operations of each of these systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>is sequenced in such a manner that each </v>

149
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 1>of them get what they need on an ongoing</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

150
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.103
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason that you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your brain is to do the </v>

151
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 1>proper sequencing is to figure out when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do what.</v>

152
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 1>And so the rest of the brain and part is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there to take time into account.</v>

153
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 1>But it's not only there to take time </v>
<v Speaker 1>into account,</v>

154
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.920
<v Speaker 1>it's also there to take context into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account because reproductive behavior,</v>

155
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be context sensitive.</v>

156
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

157
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Speaker 1>It has to be context sensitive because </v>
<v Speaker 1>every situation is not the same as every</v>

158
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:34.254
<v Speaker 1>other situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially among animals that become </v>

159
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:39.930
<v Speaker 1>increasingly complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the reason that you need more</v>

160
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 1>brain or that that it might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile under some conditions to have</v>

161
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:44.604
<v Speaker 1>more brain is to solve the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to organize multiple fundamental </v>

162
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems working </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>

163
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.793
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of the problems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to solve on a day to day </v>

164
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:56.910
<v Speaker 1>basis are precisely that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

165
00:09:56.911 --> 00:10:01.911
<v Speaker 1>you have to add emotional regulation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you have to also,</v>

166
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:02.843
<v Speaker 1>because we're social animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to add the problem of the fact </v>

167
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:05.964
<v Speaker 1>that there's all sorts of other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are trying to do exactly the same </v>

168
00:10:07.891 --> 00:10:08.724
<v Speaker 1>thing cooperatively and competitively in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same environment across different </v>

169
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:13.314
<v Speaker 1>spans of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very complex optimization </v>

170
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:16.614
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

171
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like it's precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>computable.</v>

172
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.573
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it seems to have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the way we do it seems to have </v>

173
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:25.860
<v Speaker 1>to do with ongoing negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 1>because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

175
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.170
<v Speaker 1>what's the answer to the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical arrangement of motivational</v>

176
00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:34.740
<v Speaker 1>necessities?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the past can offer,</v>

177
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:35.993
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hints in that direction and also can </v>

178
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:40.590
<v Speaker 1>probably inform us about what won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

179
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:41.783
<v Speaker 1>But those are sort of vague and broad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in order to determine how to update </v>

180
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:48.750
<v Speaker 1>that and bring it into the present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be continual,</v>

181
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 1>ongoing communication and negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

182
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.043
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you can think about the </v>

183
00:10:56.801 --> 00:10:59.560
<v Speaker 1>relationship between what we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about as the</v>

184
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:03.903
<v Speaker 1>fundamental unit of personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think of this not only as the </v>

185
00:11:07.481 --> 00:11:08.314
<v Speaker 1>fundamental unit of narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental unit of personality </v>

186
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.790
<v Speaker 1>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic motivational systems,</v>

187
00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:18.320
<v Speaker 1>which I've sort of outlined here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

188
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.833
<v Speaker 1>in schematic format,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not claiming that these are </v>

189
00:11:22.001 --> 00:11:22.834
<v Speaker 1>precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely accurate or scientific </v>

190
00:11:25.661 --> 00:11:28.270
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can think of them.</v>

191
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.493
<v Speaker 1>The basic motivational states basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>as associated with self propagation and </v>

192
00:11:33.101 --> 00:11:33.934
<v Speaker 1>self maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two big problems that are </v>

193
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.043
<v Speaker 1>a living creature has to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then those problems are broken down </v>

194
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.710
<v Speaker 1>into the operation of more specialized </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsystems,</v>

195
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.870
<v Speaker 1>like the desire for affiliation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

196
00:11:46.871 --> 00:11:48.940
<v Speaker 1>seems to be a basic motivation among </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

197
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual desire.</v>

198
00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Those are all proper itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Propagation motivations,</v>

199
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 1>thermal regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirst,</v>

200
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elimination,</v>

201
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.110
<v Speaker 1>all the sorts of things that you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>of as basic biological necessities.</v>

202
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.303
<v Speaker 1>And so each of those has the capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop up something that's approximating a </v>

203
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:08.920
<v Speaker 1>personality when it needs to.</v>

204
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.520
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not a drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an important thing to realize.</v>

205
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:13.354
<v Speaker 1>There's a drive like element to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree that that process has become </v>

206
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 1>habitual or that it's based in instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

207
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:23.830
<v Speaker 1>but so the drive like the more drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>like something is,</v>

208
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.750
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is that lower levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the nervous system are taking care of</v>

209
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe spinal systems for example.</v>

210
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:34.240
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put your hand on a hot stove,</v>

211
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 1>you'll jerk it back fast before you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain.</v>

212
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:38.883
<v Speaker 1>And that's because there's a reflex loop</v>
<v Speaker 1>between your sensory receptors on your </v>

213
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:45.730
<v Speaker 1>hand and your spinal cord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very fast.</v>

214
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:46.564
<v Speaker 1>It just goes like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sensory motor loop and it's </v>

215
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:53.290
<v Speaker 1>basically deterministic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So things that extremely high resolution</v>

216
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:58.291
<v Speaker 1>are becoming increasingly deterministic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the pain comes in after you've pulled</v>

217
00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:02.350
<v Speaker 1>your hand away and that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like it's teaching you in some</v>

218
00:13:02.351 --> 00:13:03.820
<v Speaker 1>sense your body is teaching you.</v>

219
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.150
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to do that stupid thing again.</v>

220
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.373
<v Speaker 1>And are they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People also think maybe that pain </v>

221
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:10.624
<v Speaker 1>immobilizes us so that we're more likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to heal and or less likely to keep </v>

222
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:17.140
<v Speaker 1>engaging in the behavior that caused the</v>
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>

223
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

224
00:13:20.741 --> 00:13:21.574
<v Speaker 1>so our motivational systems are popping </v>
<v Speaker 1>up these little personalities all the </v>

225
00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:26.561
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

226
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:27.394
<v Speaker 1>one of the dictums of psychoanalytic </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought is that those little </v>

227
00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:29.974
<v Speaker 1>motivational personalities can more or </v>
<v Speaker 1>less have a life of their own because </v>

228
00:13:32.831 --> 00:13:35.200
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are subsets of you,</v>

229
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.410
<v Speaker 1>and if they're not integrated into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete personality,</v>

230
00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:39.244
<v Speaker 1>well then when they emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be rather primordial </v>

231
00:13:42.971 --> 00:13:45.010
<v Speaker 1>and unsophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see this in people,</v>

232
00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have outbursts of anger.</v>

233
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that it isn't exactly reasonable to</v>

234
00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:52.444
<v Speaker 1>say that they've become disinhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although that's one way of thinking </v>

235
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:55.960
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

236
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.793
<v Speaker 1>It's actually more reasonable to assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they haven't developed enough </v>

237
00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:04.400
<v Speaker 1>sophistication to integrate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational system.</v>

238
00:14:04.401 --> 00:14:06.520
<v Speaker 1>So that capacity for anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

239
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.503
<v Speaker 1>into their personality as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the dictums of Humean </v>

240
00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:12.484
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy in particular is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>are extraordinarily useful to integrate </v>

241
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:20.620
<v Speaker 1>those elements of your personality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have like a fiery liked nature,</v>

242
00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:21.454
<v Speaker 1>a potentially dangerous nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anger and aggression is a really good </v>

243
00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:25.084
<v Speaker 1>example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sexual desire is also a really good </v>

244
00:14:27.671 --> 00:14:30.070
<v Speaker 1>example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're sophisticated,</v>

245
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.610
<v Speaker 1>you have that system at hand when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need it,</v>

246
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.493
<v Speaker 1>but you don't use it in a manner that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive to your operations as a </v>

247
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:41.884
<v Speaker 1>whole across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't use it in a manner that </v>

248
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:45.274
<v Speaker 1>dis dis disrupts the relationship that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've established socially with your </v>

249
00:14:49.031 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>family and broader society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all integrated.</v>

250
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's integrated into a game.</v>

251
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.613
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you might think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about is that a lot of the games that </v>

252
00:14:57.771 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 1>people do play and that people like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch our games of aggression,</v>

253
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:03.560
<v Speaker 1>integration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 1>so football is a really good example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

255
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:07.244
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys are massive and they're </v>

256
00:15:08.061 --> 00:15:10.640
<v Speaker 1>strong and they're aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

257
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by and large,</v>

258
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:17.300
<v Speaker 1>when they're in the football game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use that to further the game.</v>

259
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Now they're trying to win individually </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their treat teams trying to win.</v>

260
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:21.254
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both teams are competing within a </v>

261
00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:24.134
<v Speaker 1>framework of rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's in a broader framework that </v>

262
00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:27.434
<v Speaker 1>encompasses the entire audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also continually giving them </v>

263
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 1>feedback on the quality of their play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

264
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:36.050
<v Speaker 1>So if somebody does something </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly brutal and unnecessary,</v>

265
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.300
<v Speaker 1>the whole audience is going to complain </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>

266
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.130
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

267
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.053
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the ways by which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>players determine how much force can be </v>

268
00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:48.440
<v Speaker 1>used and how much force can't be used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as the,</v>

269
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:49.274
<v Speaker 1>as the game continues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to tell when you're being </v>

270
00:15:52.641 --> 00:15:55.550
<v Speaker 1>too aggressive or not too aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

271
00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:56.384
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

272
00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.313
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading a little while ago about </v>

273
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:01.923
<v Speaker 1>the Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia Harkey series in 1972 and if I </v>

274
00:16:04.781 --> 00:16:07.720
<v Speaker 1>remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Canadians played by European rules,</v>

275
00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:09.460
<v Speaker 1>which meant that there was no body </v>
<v Speaker 1>checking.</v>

276
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.430
<v Speaker 1>So that was kind of hard on them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Europeans don't check.</v>

277
00:16:12.431 --> 00:16:17.200
<v Speaker 1>But the Canadians claimed that in games </v>
<v Speaker 1>they played where there was no checking,</v>

278
00:16:17.201 --> 00:16:18.034
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot more hitting with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends of sticks and a lot more slashing </v>

279
00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:21.604
<v Speaker 1>and like there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were still all sorts of </v>

280
00:16:23.231 --> 00:16:24.064
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was ne never able to get up to </v>

281
00:16:25.991 --> 00:16:28.750
<v Speaker 1>the point where you could give someone a</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid hit.</v>

282
00:16:28.751 --> 00:16:29.584
<v Speaker 1>And the Canadians take on that was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the game wasn't necessarily less </v>

283
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.580
<v Speaker 1>dangerous or less rough without </v>
<v Speaker 1>checking.</v>

284
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just at the aggression got </v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinated.</v>

285
00:16:39.401 --> 00:16:41.140
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

286
00:16:41.141 --> 00:16:41.974
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easy thing to figure out </v>

287
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:48.760
<v Speaker 1>exactly what level of force is necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>to push any given thing forward.</v>

288
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.240
<v Speaker 1>But none is definitely the wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

289
00:16:52.241 --> 00:16:57.100
<v Speaker 1>and if you're ever involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you will be an oh no doubt are now</v>

290
00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.520
<v Speaker 1>if you're involved in difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiations as you move forward,</v>

291
00:17:00.521 --> 00:17:01.354
<v Speaker 1>salary negotiations or negotiations </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a given project or even even </v>

292
00:17:06.221 --> 00:17:11.221
<v Speaker 1>complaints that even attempts on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>part to solve problems at work,</v>

293
00:17:12.071 --> 00:17:14.830
<v Speaker 1>like being subject to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

294
00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:15.664
<v Speaker 1>to arbitrary tyranny or being bored to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death by a useless project or something </v>

295
00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:20.074
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have that capacity for </v>

296
00:17:22.421 --> 00:17:25.720
<v Speaker 1>force at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to win.</v>

297
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.410
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to get walked over and</v>

298
00:17:29.411 --> 00:17:30.790
<v Speaker 1>how much force you need.</v>

299
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.130
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the ongoing dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

300
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.433
<v Speaker 1>and that's really worth thinking about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of what happens in psychotherapy as </v>

301
00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:42.494
<v Speaker 1>well as exposure to things that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are afraid of and the </v>

302
00:17:46.371 --> 00:17:49.560
<v Speaker 1>development of new micro skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

303
00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.813
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a client who isn't very socially </v>

304
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:54.060
<v Speaker 1>skilled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

305
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:54.894
<v Speaker 1>we might practice things like shaky </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and telling each other who we are </v>

306
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.620
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't have that down as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>routine,</v>

307
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.250
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to make a foray into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader social environment.</v>

308
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.084
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes people are stopped socially</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they lock micro skills and </v>

309
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:12.930
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's because they're afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those two things interplay.</v>

310
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.183
<v Speaker 1>But another thing that happens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy and awful lot is that people </v>

311
00:18:16.501 --> 00:18:17.334
<v Speaker 1>come in for assertiveness training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when there are people who've </v>

312
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:21.354
<v Speaker 1>usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're usually agreeable in </v>

313
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:23.064
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are also people who have </v>

314
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.533
<v Speaker 1>failed to integrate that capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression into their personality for </v>

315
00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:31.500
<v Speaker 1>one reason or another.</v>

316
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they weren't taught to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's certainly possible.</v>

317
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe when they manifested aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were punished for it.</v>

318
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:38.963
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they observed other people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were too aggressive and decided that </v>

319
00:18:42.181 --> 00:18:45.210
<v Speaker 1>they were never going to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a common response,</v>

320
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.253
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter because once </v>

321
00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:51.210
<v Speaker 1>you're an adult and you're working in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive world,</v>

322
00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:52.044
<v Speaker 1>which you will definitely be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have that capacity because </v>

323
00:18:56.281 --> 00:19:00.120
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you get pushed to the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the dominance hierarchy and exploited</v>

324
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.523
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not necessarily because of </v>

325
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:06.120
<v Speaker 1>malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly it can be that,</v>

326
00:19:06.121 --> 00:19:06.954
<v Speaker 1>but often it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the consequence of the fact that </v>

327
00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 1>generally if you're negotiating for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

328
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.433
<v Speaker 1>there are forces pulling on that from </v>
<v Speaker 1>all directions and the out the obvious </v>

329
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.200
<v Speaker 1>what outcome is obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

330
00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:20.034
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a matter of negotiation and </v>

331
00:19:22.891 --> 00:19:26.880
<v Speaker 1>so you have to be able to put your </v>
<v Speaker 1>position forward with some force and not</v>

332
00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:27.714
<v Speaker 1>be timid about it and be articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and all that is a consequence </v>

333
00:19:30.751 --> 00:19:31.584
<v Speaker 1>of integrating these systems that can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous if they're not working </v>

334
00:19:35.671 --> 00:19:36.504
<v Speaker 1>properly into your personality rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than ignoring them and letting them run </v>

335
00:19:40.711 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 1>in an underground fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what they would do.</v>

336
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.213
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

337
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the thing about Freud,</v>

338
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.663
<v Speaker 1>this is what the comment was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's reminiscent of Friday and </v>

339
00:19:53.261 --> 00:19:54.094
<v Speaker 1>sublimation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud more or less had an inhibitory </v>

340
00:19:57.311 --> 00:19:59.740
<v Speaker 1>mortal of socialization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

341
00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:00.574
<v Speaker 1>because he thought of people as pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Ed so that the ego has pushed by </v>

342
00:20:04.451 --> 00:20:05.284
<v Speaker 1>the head and inhibited by the superego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's some truth in that to the </v>

343
00:20:09.941 --> 00:20:10.774
<v Speaker 1>degree that that you're subject to quasi</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical pressure by a society that </v>

344
00:20:15.671 --> 00:20:16.504
<v Speaker 1>isn't well integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what's going to happen to you </v>

345
00:20:20.591 --> 00:20:21.424
<v Speaker 1>is don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the capacity to not do something </v>

346
00:20:25.211 --> 00:20:26.044
<v Speaker 1>that you're motivated to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an impulsive thing is obviously </v>

347
00:20:28.781 --> 00:20:29.614
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sublimation in a sense is the basis </v>

348
00:20:34.391 --> 00:20:35.224
<v Speaker 1>of Piagetian theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Piaget's alternative to Friday and </v>

349
00:20:39.851 --> 00:20:44.230
<v Speaker 1>thinking is that it's not inhibitory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially not if it's,</v>

350
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.900
<v Speaker 1>if your personality is properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated,</v>

351
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.500
<v Speaker 1>what it is instead is integration into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>game like structure.</v>

352
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.333
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk more about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is is that you're starting </v>

353
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:56.560
<v Speaker 1>at high levels of resolution with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

354
00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're building these structures out</v>

355
00:20:59.831 --> 00:21:00.664
<v Speaker 1>of your capacity to move and at your </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to perceive and these </v>

356
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:05.170
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems that are driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

357
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.483
<v Speaker 1>And as you become socialized and as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring more and more people into the </v>

358
00:21:10.151 --> 00:21:13.450
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy gets more and more complex</v>

359
00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:17.230
<v Speaker 1>and sophisticated and then it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing that's regulating.</v>

360
00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:19.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not inhibitory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

361
00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:21.610
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to inhibit your </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

362
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:22.444
<v Speaker 1>You want to harness it so it serves the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes of the greater the individual </v>

363
00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:28.480
<v Speaker 1>and the greater good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can figure out how to do that,</v>

364
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.540
<v Speaker 1>it's better that way because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>more power now.</v>

365
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.110
<v Speaker 1>It might be better for you to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardly and,</v>

366
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.123
<v Speaker 1>and retreating if the alternative is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be impulsively aggressive and </v>

367
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:39.664
<v Speaker 1>destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not nearly as good as having </v>

368
00:21:42.311 --> 00:21:43.144
<v Speaker 1>the capacity for aggression at your hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being able to use it in a </v>

369
00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:47.830
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

370
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.423
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is a way of thinking about how </v>

371
00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:52.924
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

372
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.913
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

373
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can say that it's that</v>

374
00:22:12.541 --> 00:22:15.780
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that happens,</v>

375
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.970
<v Speaker 1>but how it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>

376
00:22:17.971 --> 00:22:22.950
<v Speaker 1>And the thing too is that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization does not only take place in</v>

377
00:22:22.951 --> 00:22:23.784
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that the </v>

378
00:22:25.231 --> 00:22:26.064
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts I think over estimated </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they tend to think of psychic </v>

379
00:22:30.331 --> 00:22:34.560
<v Speaker 1>regulation as internal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

380
00:22:34.561 --> 00:22:35.394
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're acceptable to your </v>

381
00:22:39.451 --> 00:22:40.284
<v Speaker 1>peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seldom have to regulate your own </v>

382
00:22:42.901 --> 00:22:46.290
<v Speaker 1>behavior because they'll regulate it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

383
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're out in the world,</v>

384
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys are all sitting there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a particular way,</v>

385
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.730
<v Speaker 1>partly because if you deviated from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate way to sit there,</v>

386
00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:00.450
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you deviated from that sufficiently,</v>

387
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.493
<v Speaker 1>the group would turn on you right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as long as you're awake enough to </v>

388
00:23:05.281 --> 00:23:08.220
<v Speaker 1>respond to the subtle cues that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are giving you,</v>

389
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't even have to worry about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal inhibitory problem.</v>

390
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.433
<v Speaker 1>Now what you want is you want your </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system is organized in a way so </v>

391
00:23:17.041 --> 00:23:21.480
<v Speaker 1>that it fits well into the overall </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization of the society.</v>

392
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.940
<v Speaker 1>And there has to be cross talk between </v>
<v Speaker 1>notes.</v>

393
00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.880
<v Speaker 1>But Society exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

394
00:23:26.881 --> 00:23:30.420
<v Speaker 1>So anything society will do to regulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

395
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.720
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really useful.</v>

396
00:23:33.721 --> 00:23:36.000
<v Speaker 1>It's an outsourcing problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

397
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:37.800
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>outsource.</v>

398
00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:41.340
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things is think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like self esteem.</v>

399
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.053
<v Speaker 1>Self esteem is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the word because self </v>

400
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:49.850
<v Speaker 1>esteem is really something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion minus neuroticism.</v>

401
00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's close to that.</v>

402
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:52.510
<v Speaker 1>But let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

403
00:23:52.511 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 1>so let's look at it in a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>

404
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:55.364
<v Speaker 1>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how valuable should you regard </v>

405
00:23:57.441 --> 00:23:59.840
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think,</v>

406
00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:02.480
<v Speaker 1>well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and then we might think,</v>

407
00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:04.880
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that has something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>

408
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:05.991
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

409
00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:08.480
<v Speaker 1>so how competent are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

410
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.373
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is you really don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know and there's actually no way of </v>

411
00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:14.120
<v Speaker 1>telling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your nervous system has to guess.</v>

412
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:14.954
<v Speaker 1>And the way it does that is that first </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're put on a normal distribution for </v>

413
00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:21.320
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion and that you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of given that at birth.</v>

414
00:24:21.321 --> 00:24:25.490
<v Speaker 1>That's your temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the socialization can pull that</v>

415
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.280
<v Speaker 1>one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it can,</v>

416
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.473
<v Speaker 1>it can make you more stable or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable depending on how you interact </v>

417
00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:33.314
<v Speaker 1>with your parents and the immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment and how dangerous the </v>

418
00:24:35.151 --> 00:24:35.984
<v Speaker 1>environment is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing you do is you </v>

419
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:39.614
<v Speaker 1>observe yourself operating in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see how good you are at solving </v>

420
00:24:43.341 --> 00:24:44.174
<v Speaker 1>problems and that adjusts it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everyone else is broadcasting </v>

421
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.630
<v Speaker 1>to you all the time what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparative value is.</v>

422
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.213
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really how you establish an </v>

423
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.970
<v Speaker 1>estimate of your competence.</v>

424
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.193
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost always comparative </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence because the question in most </v>

425
00:25:00.171 --> 00:25:02.330
<v Speaker 1>groups isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you do something?</v>

426
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.880
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real question is,</v>

427
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.103
<v Speaker 1>can you do something as well or better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than anyone else in this particular </v>

428
00:25:09.801 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 1>group?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no absolute standard for</v>

429
00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:14.870
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to do things precisely.</v>

430
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:15.763
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is insufficient when you think </v>

431
00:25:19.311 --> 00:25:21.170
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate task,</v>

432
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because people's knowledge have limits.</v>

433
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.790
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

434
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.690
<v Speaker 1>are you up for the challenge compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people around you?</v>

435
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.583
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complex calibration process </v>

436
00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:34.520
<v Speaker 1>and it certainly doesn't all take place </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

437
00:25:34.521 --> 00:25:35.750
<v Speaker 1>It can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

438
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.990
<v Speaker 1>you're not complex enough to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's foolish anyways,</v>

439
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly what the stock market does.</v>

440
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:46.250
<v Speaker 1>The stock market has a massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about the relative value of</v>

441
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.930
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking and it it,</v>

442
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:51.003
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it moves around a lot because you think </v>

443
00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:54.230
<v Speaker 1>about all the variables that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating,</v>

444
00:25:54.231 --> 00:25:55.064
<v Speaker 1>taking into account at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not only every company and every </v>

445
00:25:59.271 --> 00:26:03.290
<v Speaker 1>commodity in relationship to every other</v>
<v Speaker 1>company in every other commodity.</v>

446
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.180
<v Speaker 1>It's also all that in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the price of all the currencies and that</v>

447
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:09.014
<v Speaker 1>takes into account political stability </v>
<v Speaker 1>or instability in disease and </v>

448
00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:17.500
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe and hurricanes and so on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth like that has,</v>

449
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.373
<v Speaker 1>there has to be something dynamic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ongoing that enables those calculations </v>

450
00:26:22.071 --> 00:26:25.700
<v Speaker 1>to be made because there it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>incalculable otherwise,</v>

451
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.570
<v Speaker 1>and the same thing is true in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your competence.</v>

452
00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.613
<v Speaker 1>You can't calculate that on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have help and so that's </v>

453
00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:37.820
<v Speaker 1>partly why the group also decides where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are in the dominance hierarchy.</v>

454
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Now the group could also under or </v>
<v Speaker 1>overshoot that happens lots of times,</v>

455
00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:45.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because maybe the local environment that</v>

456
00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:46.584
<v Speaker 1>you're in isn't a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of the broader </v>

457
00:26:48.961 --> 00:26:49.794
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This happens to lots of smart people in </v>

458
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:52.950
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

459
00:26:52.951 --> 00:26:56.940
<v Speaker 1>or junior high where if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

460
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:02.670
<v Speaker 1>that is not necessarily socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable for a number of years.</v>

461
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And if the person who's intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get out of that environment into</v>

462
00:27:06.991 --> 00:27:09.510
<v Speaker 1>an environment where intelligence is </v>
<v Speaker 1>valued.</v>

463
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:13.530
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully that's a university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know their,</v>

464
00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:14.364
<v Speaker 1>their actual potential isn't going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>valued by the dominance hierarchy in </v>

465
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.990
<v Speaker 1>proper keeping with its,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with its actual re real world value.</v>

466
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.090
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

467
00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:29.040
<v Speaker 1>So the issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the ethical issue is this is</v>

468
00:27:29.041 --> 00:27:29.874
<v Speaker 1>the ethical issue is how do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchically organize these </v>

469
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.180
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities because you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

470
00:27:36.181 --> 00:27:38.910
<v Speaker 1>well why do you have to hierarchically </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize them to begin with?</v>

471
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Now there's an element here for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists you can think of of this.</v>

472
00:27:44.791 --> 00:27:49.791
<v Speaker 1>So 130 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche announced that God was dead,</v>

473
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.593
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was a rep that was a </v>

474
00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:53.304
<v Speaker 1>reflection of the collapse in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the believability of traditional </v>

475
00:27:56.431 --> 00:27:57.264
<v Speaker 1>religions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can think of traditional </v>

476
00:27:58.681 --> 00:28:02.280
<v Speaker 1>religions as a coherent overarching </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>

477
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:03.323
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might argue about how coherent </v>

478
00:28:03.991 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 1>coherent it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty coherent.</v>

479
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't necessarily mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're accurate,</v>

480
00:28:08.941 --> 00:28:09.774
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the slats were pulled out from </v>

481
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:13.644
<v Speaker 1>underneath those structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what happened during the 20th </v>

482
00:28:17.731 --> 00:28:18.564
<v Speaker 1>century was two things and one was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those religious narratives were </v>

483
00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:26.490
<v Speaker 1>replaced by ideological narratives and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that turned out to be a really bad idea.</v>

484
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.630
<v Speaker 1>And so that was one stream of thought in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense stemming from Nietzsche,</v>

485
00:28:30.631 --> 00:28:31.464
<v Speaker 1>or at least from his observation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was another stream of thought </v>

486
00:28:33.001 --> 00:28:33.834
<v Speaker 1>which basically said if religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures have collapsed and they had </v>

487
00:28:39.181 --> 00:28:40.014
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means all grand narratives have </v>

488
00:28:41.731 --> 00:28:44.760
<v Speaker 1>collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really a postmodernist claim.</v>

489
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:50.150
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that claim is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't act unless you have a hierarchy of</v>

490
00:28:50.491 --> 00:28:53.520
<v Speaker 1>values because you can't figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do next.</v>

491
00:28:53.521 --> 00:28:54.354
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even figure out if you should </v>

492
00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:56.064
<v Speaker 1>do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you certainly can't figure out what </v>

493
00:28:57.931 --> 00:29:01.770
<v Speaker 1>to do next because in order to organize </v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior and move forward,</v>

494
00:29:01.771 --> 00:29:05.910
<v Speaker 1>you have to say that one thing is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important than many other things,</v>

495
00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:06.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

496
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Every time you act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making that decision.</v>

497
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

498
00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:12.090
<v Speaker 1>you can only make that decision at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro level,</v>

499
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.350
<v Speaker 1>like what's best now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people who do that are impulsive.</v>

500
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.213
<v Speaker 1>That's how we define them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't work out well across </v>

501
00:29:20.311 --> 00:29:21.144
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what they're doing is </v>

502
00:29:22.621 --> 00:29:25.140
<v Speaker 1>responding to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

503
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.950
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instinctual whims moment by moment,</v>

504
00:29:28.951 --> 00:29:32.250
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't seem very sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want someone round like that.</v>

505
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.870
<v Speaker 1>You can't predict what they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

506
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.390
<v Speaker 1>You can't cooperate with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't follow rules.</v>

507
00:29:36.391 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a project with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't trust them.</v>

508
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.313
<v Speaker 1>It's like that isn't going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that grand narratives </v>

509
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:45.814
<v Speaker 1>are obsolete is it's based on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>misunderstanding of exactly what the </v>

510
00:29:52.911 --> 00:29:53.744
<v Speaker 1>narratives are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also based on absence of </v>

511
00:29:56.781 --> 00:29:57.614
<v Speaker 1>realization that a narrative is </v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily something you act out before </v>

512
00:30:01.491 --> 00:30:04.760
<v Speaker 1>you represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a narrative can be latent.</v>

513
00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.700
<v Speaker 1>So let me give you an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

514
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I thought it puzzled about this for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

515
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I'd say you go out and watch a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee troop.</v>

516
00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.053
<v Speaker 1>Now we know of the chimps are organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a dominance hierarchy and we know </v>

517
00:30:21.051 --> 00:30:24.830
<v Speaker 1>that the dominance hierarchy among </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps is male dominated.</v>

518
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:26.660
<v Speaker 1>The females have a dormant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hierarchy too,</v>

519
00:30:26.661 --> 00:30:29.150
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental dominant Turkey's </v>
<v Speaker 1>male dominated.</v>

520
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that so much with barnum </v>
<v Speaker 1>bolts by the way,</v>

521
00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:32.893
<v Speaker 1>which are very much like chips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so you can watch the chimps and you </v>

522
00:30:37.491 --> 00:30:38.324
<v Speaker 1>can see that chimp a knows the chimp B </v>
<v Speaker 1>is higher up in the dominance hierarchy </v>

523
00:30:41.451 --> 00:30:45.590
<v Speaker 1>and Chimp d knows the C is higher up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy and you can even</v>

524
00:30:45.591 --> 00:30:46.424
<v Speaker 1>see that the offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you have a high dominant female </v>

525
00:30:49.341 --> 00:30:52.370
<v Speaker 1>and she has offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other chimps know that you don't</v>

526
00:30:52.371 --> 00:30:55.190
<v Speaker 1>mess around with her offspring because </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a dominant female.</v>

527
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:58.670
<v Speaker 1>So that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mapping of the dominance hierarchy,</v>

528
00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.690
<v Speaker 1>the mapping is quite sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>

529
00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:07.550
<v Speaker 1>well the chimps are following rules so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you think,</v>

530
00:31:07.551 --> 00:31:08.384
<v Speaker 1>well no they're not because they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't actually know rules because </v>

531
00:31:10.581 --> 00:31:11.414
<v Speaker 1>while it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you got to ask what exactly is a </v>

532
00:31:12.261 --> 00:31:13.160
<v Speaker 1>rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

533
00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh well that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a rule seems to be the articulation</v>

534
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:20.443
<v Speaker 1>of a principal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to be something that you </v>

535
00:31:22.701 --> 00:31:24.110
<v Speaker 1>have to represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you say,</v>

536
00:31:24.111 --> 00:31:24.944
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rule is chimp be always submits to </v>

537
00:31:28.551 --> 00:31:29.384
<v Speaker 1>chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

538
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:30.463
<v Speaker 1>that's the rule that the is following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the chip isn't following rules </v>

539
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.333
<v Speaker 1>because the chimp doesn't have rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's regularities there and so </v>

540
00:31:37.521 --> 00:31:39.830
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those really are a behavioral patterns.</v>

541
00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.560
<v Speaker 1>They're not rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

542
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:47.060
<v Speaker 1>understanding that is extremely useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what you can understand is that</v>

543
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:49.703
<v Speaker 1>regularities in complex social behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>can emerge in the absence of any </v>

544
00:31:54.421 --> 00:31:55.254
<v Speaker 1>conscious representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any consciously articulated </v>

545
00:31:57.931 --> 00:32:00.780
<v Speaker 1>representation of those rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you might ask,</v>

546
00:32:00.781 --> 00:32:01.614
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do moral presuppositions come </v>

547
00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:05.550
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that,</v>

548
00:32:05.551 --> 00:32:07.320
<v Speaker 1>say religious systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

549
00:32:07.321 --> 00:32:08.154
<v Speaker 1>are concerned with moral presuppositions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that social systems are concerned </v>

550
00:32:11.551 --> 00:32:13.440
<v Speaker 1>with those two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do they come from?</v>

551
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of theories about that,</v>

552
00:32:15.271 --> 00:32:16.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Marxists would say,</v>

553
00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.813
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about exploitation and an </v>

554
00:32:19.811 --> 00:32:20.644
<v Speaker 1>economic advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a postmodernist would say it's all </v>

555
00:32:23.311 --> 00:32:26.790
<v Speaker 1>about exclusion and power because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of quasi Marxist sorted.</v>

556
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.320
<v Speaker 1>They're quasi marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

557
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.890
<v Speaker 1>there's always this there and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what Karl Marx,</v>

558
00:32:31.891 --> 00:32:32.724
<v Speaker 1>for Karl Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion was the opiate of the people </v>

559
00:32:34.501 --> 00:32:38.700
<v Speaker 1>and he thought about it as a structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it emerged because the power elites</v>

560
00:32:38.701 --> 00:32:41.030
<v Speaker 1>wanted to dominate the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

561
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:41.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

562
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.070
<v Speaker 1>the people who weren't empowered to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract out value from them.</v>

563
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.903
<v Speaker 1>And it's like there's no doubt that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there can be an element of exploitation </v>

564
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.060
<v Speaker 1>in any social system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no doubt that social systems</v>

565
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:53.894
<v Speaker 1>are hierarchical so that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the top and people on the </v>

566
00:32:56.661 --> 00:32:59.360
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in human society,</v>

567
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:02.240
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not just one.</v>

568
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.000
<v Speaker 1>And we value lots of different things </v>
<v Speaker 1>from people.</v>

569
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.073
<v Speaker 1>And it's by no means obvious that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies were set up </v>

570
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:09.704
<v Speaker 1>consciously through conscious thought by</v>
<v Speaker 1>any group of people over any span of </v>

571
00:33:13.911 --> 00:33:14.744
<v Speaker 1>time for any purpose whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's particularly obvious when you also </v>

572
00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:18.734
<v Speaker 1>understand that while we are not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only things that have dominance </v>

573
00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:23.000
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps have them,</v>

574
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.700
<v Speaker 1>wolves have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can have a pet dog.</v>

575
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:26.563
<v Speaker 1>You understand the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it doesn't even want to be the </v>

576
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:31.940
<v Speaker 1>boss in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a nervous and upset dog.</v>

577
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:37.120
<v Speaker 1>It wants to have its position as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>valued low level entity in the dominance</v>

578
00:33:37.671 --> 00:33:38.060
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

579
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.760
<v Speaker 1>And a dog is just absolutely happy when </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens.</v>

580
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.103
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause what is the dog gonna do buy </v>

581
00:33:43.611 --> 00:33:45.530
<v Speaker 1>groceries?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no it's not.</v>

582
00:33:45.531 --> 00:33:46.364
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be low in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the dominance hierarchy because it </v>

583
00:33:48.321 --> 00:33:51.320
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have the competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very,</v>

584
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:52.154
<v Speaker 1>very bizarre about Marxist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist thinking is that there </v>

585
00:33:55.731 --> 00:33:56.564
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to be any recognition that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies are often </v>

586
00:33:59.601 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 1>structured based on competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one on like arbitrary distribution of</v>

587
00:34:03.951 --> 00:34:04.784
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you want to go have your </v>

588
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:08.510
<v Speaker 1>appendix out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to look for?</v>

589
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.483
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to look for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful doctor or you can look for the </v>

590
00:34:12.591 --> 00:34:13.424
<v Speaker 1>most competent doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you hope that there's a rough </v>

591
00:34:15.771 --> 00:34:18.470
<v Speaker 1>relationship between power and status </v>
<v Speaker 1>and competence,</v>

592
00:34:18.471 --> 00:34:19.304
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise how are you going to </v>

593
00:34:19.821 --> 00:34:22.460
<v Speaker 1>figure it out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it's a good hierarchy,</v>

594
00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:25.490
<v Speaker 1>it's based on competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not on arbitrary power.</v>

595
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.863
<v Speaker 1>So we might say that when a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy starts to be based on </v>

596
00:34:29.421 --> 00:34:30.254
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary power or purely on economics </v>
<v Speaker 1>on economic terms than it's actually </v>

597
00:34:34.281 --> 00:34:35.114
<v Speaker 1>turned into a tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no longer a functional heart </v>

598
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:41.330
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already stultified and twisted into</v>

599
00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:42.164
<v Speaker 1>a form that can't be sustained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people are going to get upset </v>

600
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 1>about that and start talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or or worse,</v>

601
00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:49.490
<v Speaker 1>they're going to start doing things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are quite disrupted.</v>

602
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:55.090
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that the hierarchical </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure per se is pathological or that</v>

603
00:34:55.701 --> 00:35:00.701
<v Speaker 1>it's consciously imposed or that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessary or that it has,</v>

604
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.680
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

605
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.503
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just that better not be the case </v>

606
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.300
<v Speaker 1>because we would be in serious trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was the case.</v>

607
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:16.690
<v Speaker 1>So I would say the more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more functional the society,</v>

608
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:18.643
<v Speaker 1>the more the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power hierarchy is based on </v>

609
00:35:20.331 --> 00:35:24.830
<v Speaker 1>competence in relationship to what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>society deems is actually valuable.</v>

610
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:25.993
<v Speaker 1>Now in not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously no society meets those </v>

611
00:35:27.501 --> 00:35:30.860
<v Speaker 1>criteria perfectly because you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

612
00:35:30.861 --> 00:35:35.510
<v Speaker 1>it's part of a dialogue and a continual </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing of information,</v>

613
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't hit the target always </v>

614
00:35:37.651 --> 00:35:38.484
<v Speaker 1>moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can hope that the dialogue </v>

615
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.330
<v Speaker 1>continues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

616
00:35:42.331 --> 00:35:45.180
<v Speaker 1>here's a little vision I had of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>things work,</v>

617
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:46.014
<v Speaker 1>like a democratic society works okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people often think if they're </v>

618
00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:51.060
<v Speaker 1>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly,</v>

619
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:51.953
<v Speaker 1>low and openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they think the conservatives are </v>

620
00:35:53.641 --> 00:35:56.130
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they're more on the liberal or on</v>

621
00:35:56.131 --> 00:35:58.020
<v Speaker 1>the left side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high in openness,</v>

622
00:35:58.021 --> 00:35:58.854
<v Speaker 1>low and orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than they think that the left is </v>

623
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.460
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

624
00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:05.190
<v Speaker 1>but the left and the right aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

625
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.473
<v Speaker 1>They represent different systems of </v>
<v Speaker 1>values and the values that they </v>

626
00:36:08.641 --> 00:36:12.780
<v Speaker 1>represent are valid sometimes in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

627
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:14.520
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

628
00:36:14.521 --> 00:36:15.354
<v Speaker 1>when and in what situations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is not only did </v>

629
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.360
<v Speaker 1>not know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell.</v>

630
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that people are on a cliff.</v>

631
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're on a flat plateau and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cliff on both sides.</v>

632
00:36:29.611 --> 00:36:32.520
<v Speaker 1>And down at the bottom of the cliff is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and rocks.</v>

633
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:33.743
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to stay on top of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliff and it's quite narrow and there's </v>

634
00:36:37.801 --> 00:36:39.870
<v Speaker 1>a line you should walk down right down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle,</v>

635
00:36:39.871 --> 00:36:42.240
<v Speaker 1>but you can't tell where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>

636
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:43.103
<v Speaker 1>You put all the left these here and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>put all the right wingers here and you </v>

637
00:36:45.841 --> 00:36:46.674
<v Speaker 1>put a rope between them and you tie the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rope to you and the right pull this way </v>

638
00:36:51.031 --> 00:36:53.610
<v Speaker 1>in the left poles that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they're pulling properly,</v>

639
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:54.743
<v Speaker 1>then you can walk right down the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the only way they can pull property </v>

640
00:36:57.991 --> 00:37:00.960
<v Speaker 1>is if they keep talking to one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

641
00:37:00.961 --> 00:37:02.670
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the left disappears,</v>

642
00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:04.560
<v Speaker 1>then the right pulls everything over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cliff,</v>

643
00:37:04.561 --> 00:37:07.980
<v Speaker 1>down into the flaming rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the left disappears,</v>

644
00:37:07.981 --> 00:37:10.290
<v Speaker 1>then the right pulls everything off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliff,</v>

645
00:37:10.291 --> 00:37:12.870
<v Speaker 1>down onto the rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know that.</v>

646
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.240
<v Speaker 1>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's been good personality models</v>

647
00:37:15.241 --> 00:37:18.210
<v Speaker 1>developed recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not public yet precisely.</v>

648
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:22.350
<v Speaker 1>That show that if you push a virtue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>its extreme,</v>

649
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.573
<v Speaker 1>it turns into a vice and that all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vices that basically ended up in the </v>

650
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:28.140
<v Speaker 1>same place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

651
00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.073
<v Speaker 4>What would you say happens if both sides</v>
<v Speaker 4>are talking a lot but not to one </v>

652
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:34.123
<v Speaker 4>another?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if there's a lot of preaching to </v>

653
00:37:35.511 --> 00:37:36.344
<v Speaker 4>the choir.</v>

654
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Well its dysfunction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dysfunction</v>

655
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:40.003
<v Speaker 4>because I was thinking about modern </v>
<v Speaker 4>American politics where they can </v>

656
00:37:42.161 --> 00:37:44.800
<v Speaker 4>actually show with data that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>increasingly polarized,</v>

657
00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.410
<v Speaker 4>like just increasingly left and right </v>
<v Speaker 4>and subcultures.</v>

658
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Well what what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that means is that people can't get</v>

659
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:54.510
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>

660
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.100
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

661
00:37:56.101 --> 00:38:00.090
<v Speaker 1>well part of getting along is following </v>
<v Speaker 1>a shared set of rules and that's true.</v>

662
00:38:00.091 --> 00:38:01.920
<v Speaker 1>But the rules are kind of low </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution.</v>

663
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.920
<v Speaker 1>But to get along like you think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

664
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:06.683
<v Speaker 1>if your family is structured so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a bunch of rules and you </v>

665
00:38:09.271 --> 00:38:11.340
<v Speaker 1>better damn follow them or there'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment,</v>

666
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.190
<v Speaker 1>you know that can be better than just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheer chaos,</v>

667
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.503
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as good as general </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles encompassing continual </v>

668
00:38:19.261 --> 00:38:21.870
<v Speaker 1>dialogue that works best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

669
00:38:21.871 --> 00:38:24.030
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what are the general principles and</v>

670
00:38:24.031 --> 00:38:24.864
<v Speaker 1>what we'd hope our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we can look at what people have </v>

671
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:27.594
<v Speaker 1>done in the past and we can look at our </v>
<v Speaker 1>history and our culture and we can </v>

672
00:38:30.451 --> 00:38:31.284
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

673
00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:32.903
<v Speaker 1>we're going to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to try not to do the things </v>

674
00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:38.710
<v Speaker 1>that people have done in the past that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are evidently stupid.</v>

675
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe Nazi-ism isn't the way to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

676
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:45.130
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to see not what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to try not to do that.</v>

677
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.230
<v Speaker 1>We can extract out those general </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles,</v>

678
00:38:47.231 --> 00:38:48.064
<v Speaker 1>but then we have to talk continually in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the present because the present keeps </v>

679
00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:51.664
<v Speaker 1>moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way of mapping it using a </v>

680
00:38:54.221 --> 00:38:56.560
<v Speaker 1>structure from the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only approximate,</v>

681
00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

682
00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took up a google map of Toronto </v>

683
00:39:01.961 --> 00:39:04.660
<v Speaker 1>from 10 years ago and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is the map,</v>

684
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:05.494
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be updated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you'd have a real rough time </v>

685
00:39:08.231 --> 00:39:11.290
<v Speaker 1>driving around the waterfront cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd keep running into skyscrapers that</v>

686
00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't supposed to be there.</v>

687
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.730
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the map is obviously useful,</v>

688
00:39:15.731 --> 00:39:19.180
<v Speaker 1>but the update process is also </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably useful.</v>

689
00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.090
<v Speaker 1>And you can also say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at left and right,</v>

690
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.253
<v Speaker 1>you can roughly say that the left is on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the side of update and the right is on </v>

691
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:29.290
<v Speaker 1>the side of structure.</v>

692
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:30.603
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how much update and how much </v>

693
00:39:32.201 --> 00:39:36.430
<v Speaker 1>structure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like enough to solve the problem.</v>

694
00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.070
<v Speaker 1>That's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem?</v>

695
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Keeps changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we keep up,</v>

696
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:42.183
<v Speaker 1>we talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of that also is like if you're </v>

697
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:45.004
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of you guys are lefties because </v>

698
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.030
<v Speaker 1>most of you are open and not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly.</v>

699
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Now there is going to be exceptions in </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

700
00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:51.874
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're young because youth is often </v>

701
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.063
<v Speaker 1>associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with political beliefs that are more in </v>

702
00:39:55.691 --> 00:39:56.524
<v Speaker 1>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because you're in a </v>

703
00:39:57.641 --> 00:40:00.490
<v Speaker 1>more plastic state of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of development,</v>

704
00:40:00.491 --> 00:40:01.324
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still a lot of things open to </v>

705
00:40:02.681 --> 00:40:04.060
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

706
00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:09.330
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about it is that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get along with the right.</v>

707
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents what's already there.</v>

708
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:16.180
<v Speaker 1>So how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

709
00:40:16.181 --> 00:40:17.014
<v Speaker 1>that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the one thing you definitely do is </v>

710
00:40:18.461 --> 00:40:19.294
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to figure out what the hell </v>

711
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.090
<v Speaker 1>they're up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

712
00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.090
<v Speaker 1>and why and what they stand for and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>value of that and where it's too extreme</v>

713
00:40:26.091 --> 00:40:27.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's not easy.</v>

714
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.310
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why a democracy is a dialogue and</v>

715
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:31.144
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it regulates itself is </v>

716
00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:34.030
<v Speaker 1>through the dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

717
00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:39.031
<v Speaker 1>So what you're basically trying to do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>or integrate your abilities,</v>

718
00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.453
<v Speaker 1>your sub personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how I'm going to represented </v>

719
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.553
<v Speaker 1>into a functional hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a functional hierarchy is one where </v>

720
00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:53.740
<v Speaker 1>the subsidiary parts of the hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't conflict.</v>

721
00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:59.490
<v Speaker 1>So let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell me what I based this on the</v>

722
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Piagetian notion of the equilla braided </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

723
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:04.503
<v Speaker 1>So Piaget had this idea that there's two</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways you might be able to run an </v>

724
00:41:09.671 --> 00:41:10.504
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So say you're moving towards a </v>

725
00:41:12.071 --> 00:41:12.904
<v Speaker 1>collectively defined goal and one would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be to put someone at the top of it and </v>

726
00:41:16.211 --> 00:41:19.060
<v Speaker 1>kind of give them complete control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical power.</v>

727
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:23.470
<v Speaker 1>And so that meant you were going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that person said or else.</v>

728
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

729
00:41:24.731 --> 00:41:25.564
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person isn't always going to be right </v>

730
00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.600
<v Speaker 1>and that you're not always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy about doing what they say.</v>

731
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:32.703
<v Speaker 1>And that the fact that you're not happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>means you're not going to be as </v>

732
00:41:35.931 --> 00:41:36.764
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also means that the organization </v>

733
00:41:38.601 --> 00:41:42.350
<v Speaker 1>is going to have to expand quite a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of energy keeping you in line.</v>

734
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an alternative.</v>

735
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Alternative is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the goal.</v>

736
00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.133
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

737
00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:53.490
<v Speaker 1>well let's agree on some general </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles in relationship to the goal.</v>

738
00:41:53.491 --> 00:41:54.324
<v Speaker 1>And then let's negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I did with my kids </v>

739
00:41:56.821 --> 00:42:01.821
<v Speaker 1>when they were teenagers was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that there's a certain set of</v>

740
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:07.190
<v Speaker 1>procedures that have to be undertaken in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a household in order for that household.</v>

741
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.210
<v Speaker 1>The function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

742
00:42:08.211 --> 00:42:10.610
<v Speaker 1>So roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people need to eat.</v>

743
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:14.810
<v Speaker 1>It should be clean enough so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>contamination isn't a problem.</v>

744
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:15.973
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be so messy that it's </v>

745
00:42:17.631 --> 00:42:20.180
<v Speaker 1>impossible to do anything that you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do when house.</v>

746
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:21.290
<v Speaker 1>You know what Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

747
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:22.303
<v Speaker 1>there's guidelines that we all basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>implicitly understand that that </v>

748
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.390
<v Speaker 1>constitute a well regulated familial </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

749
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then how do you obtain that?</v>

750
00:42:32.691 --> 00:42:37.640
<v Speaker 1>And one of the processes that I put into</v>
<v Speaker 1>place was we would meet and parse up the</v>

751
00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:38.474
<v Speaker 1>jobs and come to a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the rule was you can't leave the </v>

752
00:42:42.771 --> 00:42:43.604
<v Speaker 1>discussion until the solution is found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to accept the solution unless </v>

753
00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:47.984
<v Speaker 1>you can come up with a better one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will implement it over a period of </v>

754
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:52.280
<v Speaker 1>time and see how it works.</v>

755
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.473
<v Speaker 1>And that work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it worked perfectly </v>

756
00:42:55.011 --> 00:42:55.844
<v Speaker 1>because nothing works perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good process because it </v>

757
00:42:58.821 --> 00:43:01.730
<v Speaker 1>brings everyone into the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get to define the,</v>

758
00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:04.670
<v Speaker 1>and they get to define the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get to define the rules,</v>

759
00:43:04.671 --> 00:43:09.671
<v Speaker 1>they get to define the processes by </v>
<v Speaker 1>which those rules will be enforced.</v>

760
00:43:09.891 --> 00:43:13.190
<v Speaker 1>They get to run it as a simulation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>see how it works.</v>

761
00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:16.790
<v Speaker 1>And then at some point later they get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have another discussion about it.</v>

762
00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:18.530
<v Speaker 1>But you don't want to be discussing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

763
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:20.060
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

764
00:43:20.061 --> 00:43:20.894
<v Speaker 1>every time there's dishes to be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't want to discuss the entire </v>

765
00:43:23.121 --> 00:43:25.040
<v Speaker 1>moral substructure of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>household.</v>

766
00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:26.413
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dishes are a big deal because </v>

767
00:43:27.951 --> 00:43:32.000
<v Speaker 1>they're part of dishes and cooking are a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big deal because they are part of the,</v>

768
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous conflict in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>area because of,</v>

769
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:38.660
<v Speaker 1>because of the role</v>

770
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.273
<v Speaker 1>rapid roll transformation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized men and women's since the </v>

771
00:43:44.041 --> 00:43:46.890
<v Speaker 1>pill was invented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a place where,</v>

772
00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive social transformations manifest </v>

773
00:43:50.551 --> 00:43:55.551
<v Speaker 1>themselves in local landscapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also why solving the problems</v>

774
00:43:55.561 --> 00:43:59.550
<v Speaker 1>in your local landscape is also the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>of solving the big problems.</v>

775
00:43:59.551 --> 00:44:00.384
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like who does the dishes when and </v>

776
00:44:01.771 --> 00:44:04.650
<v Speaker 1>why and what are the rewards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishments associated with that?</v>

777
00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:05.663
<v Speaker 1>Solve that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you solve like 30% of the tension </v>

778
00:44:09.181 --> 00:44:11.180
<v Speaker 1>between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

779
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:13.050
<v Speaker 1>and that means it's really hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve.</v>

780
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.333
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious how you do that and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that over the long run and what </v>

781
00:44:17.341 --> 00:44:19.260
<v Speaker 1>the reward should be and how valuable it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

782
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:20.820
<v Speaker 1>So et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

783
00:44:20.821 --> 00:44:24.150
<v Speaker 1>It takes an awful lot of negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't get it right,</v>

784
00:44:24.151 --> 00:44:27.300
<v Speaker 1>then you have a continual war in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>household and you pay for that.</v>

785
00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're having a war in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>household,</v>

786
00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be stressed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and will kill you.</v>

787
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.970
<v Speaker 1>So it's no joke to get these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and when you're doing it,</v>

788
00:44:35.971 --> 00:44:36.804
<v Speaker 1>it's applied philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sophisticated and applied </v>

789
00:44:39.751 --> 00:44:42.540
<v Speaker 1>philosophy because that's all you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have roles,</v>

790
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:43.913
<v Speaker 1>right roles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't negotiate and that's good </v>

791
00:44:46.351 --> 00:44:49.350
<v Speaker 1>cause you don't know how to negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No rules.</v>

792
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.480
<v Speaker 1>It's negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>

793
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:53.250
<v Speaker 1>or tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are your options.</v>

794
00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:57.900
<v Speaker 1>So these are very complicated problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also the why.</v>

795
00:44:57.901 --> 00:44:58.734
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you work hard to solve them in the </v>

796
00:45:00.871 --> 00:45:01.704
<v Speaker 1>domain that you have in your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're also doing the best you can </v>

797
00:45:04.891 --> 00:45:08.130
<v Speaker 1>possibly do to figure out how that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale up on a broader,</v>

798
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:10.350
<v Speaker 1>in a broader way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

799
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.850
<v Speaker 1>I read a great book once called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Systematics,</v>

800
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.720
<v Speaker 1>written by a guy named John Galt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really fast,</v>

801
00:45:15.721 --> 00:45:16.770
<v Speaker 1>fantastic book.</v>

802
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know John Galt,</v>

803
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.370
<v Speaker 1>weird enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man was actually his name.</v>

804
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.193
<v Speaker 1>John Galt is the name of a fictional </v>
<v Speaker 1>character in an Ayn rand book and he's </v>

805
00:45:25.021 --> 00:45:28.620
<v Speaker 1>one person who stops the world because </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a variety of reasons,</v>

806
00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:31.740
<v Speaker 1>he stops the industrial world because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's thinking he's getting exploited.</v>

807
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:36.840
<v Speaker 1>It's had a huge effect on modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>American monetary policy by the way.</v>

808
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.093
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Guy John Galt has written a whole </v>

809
00:45:39.871 --> 00:45:42.690
<v Speaker 1>bunch of axioms about organizational </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

810
00:45:42.691 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 1>which are quite brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a couple I really remembered</v>

811
00:45:45.631 --> 00:45:48.690
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the organization does not do what</v>

812
00:45:48.691 --> 00:45:51.240
<v Speaker 1>it's name says it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that one.</v>

813
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.580
<v Speaker 1>It's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

814
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:55.163
<v Speaker 1>and the second one was large functional </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations grow out of small </v>

815
00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:04.410
<v Speaker 1>functional organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to build something big,</v>

816
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.670
<v Speaker 1>you have to start it small and local and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then figure out how to make it scale.</v>

817
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.710
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense that's what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

818
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:11.933
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're doing and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with other people and </v>

819
00:46:13.531 --> 00:46:15.570
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're doing in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>familial situation.</v>

820
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:17.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationships.</v>

821
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.070
<v Speaker 1>You solve those problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

822
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:20.933
<v Speaker 1>you develop a template,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a skilled template of perception </v>

823
00:46:24.871 --> 00:46:27.960
<v Speaker 1>and action that you can then bring out </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the broader world.</v>

824
00:46:27.961 --> 00:46:29.850
<v Speaker 1>It's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

825
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.990
<v Speaker 1>so partly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

826
00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:34.824
<v Speaker 1>you inherit a hierarchical structure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think about that as whatever </v>

827
00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:38.694
<v Speaker 1>principles bind your culture together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some of that's rigid and </v>

828
00:46:42.481 --> 00:46:43.314
<v Speaker 1>pathological and half dead and needs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be destroyed and re updated and some of </v>

829
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:49.104
<v Speaker 1>it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to figure that out by </v>

830
00:46:50.071 --> 00:46:51.750
<v Speaker 1>negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's hard,</v>

831
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.550
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to blow the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn thing down in one gasp,</v>

832
00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.413
<v Speaker 1>like the bad wolf and the straw house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like then you have nothing to live </v>

833
00:46:59.131 --> 00:47:01.170
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want him,</v>

834
00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:02.423
<v Speaker 1>you want to make modifications in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally determined structure with </v>

835
00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:11.190
<v Speaker 1>caution and care because that is all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stops you.</v>

836
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:12.083
<v Speaker 1>That's all that protects you from chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from your ability to update your </v>

837
00:47:16.171 --> 00:47:17.004
<v Speaker 1>models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you blow that over and you find out </v>

838
00:47:18.631 --> 00:47:19.464
<v Speaker 1>what's behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of what's behind it is the </v>

839
00:47:21.181 --> 00:47:24.330
<v Speaker 1>dragon of chaos and the terrible mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

840
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:25.613
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw what happened to Iraq when the </v>

841
00:47:26.731 --> 00:47:29.740
<v Speaker 1>American's knocked over the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

842
00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

843
00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:34.180
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't good before cause it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny.</v>

844
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:37.360
<v Speaker 1>But it's clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious that it's better now,</v>

845
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:38.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

846
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:42.400
<v Speaker 1>it's also possible that what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen is it's going to be replaced by a</v>

847
00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse tyranny.</v>

848
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:48.550
<v Speaker 1>So northover is structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The water comes flooding in.</v>

849
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a dyke or a or a dam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

850
00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.200
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's your problem.</v>

851
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

852
00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.350
<v Speaker 1>I set that up as part of a moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

853
00:47:59.351 --> 00:48:02.170
<v Speaker 1>So at the bottom of any process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

854
00:48:02.171 --> 00:48:04.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're trying to be a good person.</v>

855
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:05.980
<v Speaker 1>We might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what might as well assume that.</v>

856
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:07.023
<v Speaker 1>You might say why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my answer to that would be because </v>

857
00:48:10.091 --> 00:48:11.860
<v Speaker 1>it's better than not being a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

858
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:12.933
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna run into a lot less pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and misery and you're going to be a lot </v>

859
00:48:16.151 --> 00:48:19.420
<v Speaker 1>less destructive and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt a lot fewer people.</v>

860
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.850
<v Speaker 1>And you might leave everything better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you found it.</v>

861
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.193
<v Speaker 1>And that's not so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly better than doing the </v>

862
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:26.523
<v Speaker 1>reverse of all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unless you think there's something </v>

863
00:48:29.801 --> 00:48:34.801
<v Speaker 1>particularly positively valuable about </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain and misery because,</v>

864
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:37.510
<v Speaker 1>and that seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make that case,</v>

865
00:48:37.511 --> 00:48:42.511
<v Speaker 1>but if I put you in pain and misery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do everything you could to get out.</v>

866
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.240
<v Speaker 1>So even if you thought that that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable solution,</v>

867
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.433
<v Speaker 1>if I imposed it on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do everything you possibly could to </v>

868
00:48:49.571 --> 00:48:51.460
<v Speaker 1>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all that means is that you don't know</v>

869
00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:53.410
<v Speaker 1>what the hell you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

870
00:48:53.411 --> 00:48:54.244
<v Speaker 1>So because what you act out is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of who you are than what </v>

871
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:00.124
<v Speaker 1>you say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what the hell do you know about </v>

872
00:49:01.661 --> 00:49:02.494
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a vague model of who you are </v>

873
00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:08.230
<v Speaker 1>and if vague model of society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you can wrap off some articulated</v>

874
00:49:08.231 --> 00:49:09.064
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that they're going </v>

875
00:49:11.021 --> 00:49:13.690
<v Speaker 1>to really map the underlying structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>is low.</v>

876
00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:15.400
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

877
00:49:15.401 --> 00:49:17.140
<v Speaker 1>so we'll assume you're going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good person.</v>

878
00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:17.974
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're striving for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we can decompose that and you </v>

879
00:49:20.441 --> 00:49:23.170
<v Speaker 1>can decompose it all the way down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro behaviors.</v>

880
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:27.730
<v Speaker 1>And so the issue is you try to build a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy at the bottom.</v>

881
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:30.790
<v Speaker 1>It has all your micro behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the things you can do with your</v>

882
00:49:30.791 --> 00:49:33.160
<v Speaker 1>hands and your eyes and your mouth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>

883
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the highest resolution level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're trying to organize those</v>

884
00:49:37.631 --> 00:49:42.631
<v Speaker 1>into higher and higher into more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more abstract and powerful structures in</v>

885
00:49:44.651 --> 00:49:48.070
<v Speaker 1>some sense that are also homogenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

886
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.470
<v Speaker 1>They're not full of internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions.</v>

887
00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:52.053
<v Speaker 1>So that's how you establish peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how you establish psychological </v>

888
00:49:55.301 --> 00:49:57.820
<v Speaker 1>stability and that's how you establish </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace.</v>

889
00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:00.850
<v Speaker 1>And there has to be negotiations at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those levels.</v>

890
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.133
<v Speaker 1>And roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better to negotiate at the low </v>

891
00:50:05.381 --> 00:50:08.050
<v Speaker 1>levels and you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

892
00:50:08.051 --> 00:50:12.220
<v Speaker 1>So I use this example fairly frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

893
00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.910
<v Speaker 1>so you've got a four year old kid in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their room is a mess because they'd been</v>

894
00:50:15.911 --> 00:50:19.180
<v Speaker 1>playing and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that room can't be a mess.</v>

895
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:20.103
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

896
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:22.773
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to play in a messy room that </v>

897
00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:24.453
<v Speaker 1>that might be one answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to restructure it so that </v>

898
00:50:26.711 --> 00:50:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you can have so that you can play again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of why it should be clean.</v>

899
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:35.780
<v Speaker 1>So then you tell the four year old clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>up this room and then you leave and then</v>

900
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:37.730
<v Speaker 1>you come back and it's like nothing's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

901
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:39.043
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that in part perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because that's the wrong level of </v>

902
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:46.370
<v Speaker 1>resolution to solve the problem at with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to the four year old,</v>

903
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:47.803
<v Speaker 1>you could only say clean up your room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be maybe at the same level </v>

904
00:50:50.571 --> 00:50:55.571
<v Speaker 1>as say family care there to someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>has the underlying structures already in</v>

905
00:50:55.671 --> 00:50:58.610
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say to the child,</v>

906
00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:00.373
<v Speaker 1>see your shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can do that because they know </v>

907
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:03.434
<v Speaker 1>how to follow pointing and they know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to specify an absence and they know how </v>

908
00:51:06.561 --> 00:51:07.700
<v Speaker 1>to link that to language.</v>

909
00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:09.230
<v Speaker 1>So they will do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that hole?</v>

910
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

911
00:51:10.461 --> 00:51:14.900
<v Speaker 1>So you know the person has enough skill </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath that abstraction to implement</v>

912
00:51:14.901 --> 00:51:15.800
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

913
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Then you say see that bear and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can manage that.</v>

914
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.370
<v Speaker 1>So they look at the bear and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

915
00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:24.260
<v Speaker 1>pick up the bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know they can do that.</v>

916
00:51:24.261 --> 00:51:27.800
<v Speaker 1>So they pick up the bear and you'd give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them a pat and then you say,</v>

917
00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:30.890
<v Speaker 1>put the bear in this space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they do that and they look at,</v>

918
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:32.870
<v Speaker 1>you need to give them a pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

919
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:37.700
<v Speaker 1>and if you do that with a child for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole room three or four times,</v>

920
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:38.833
<v Speaker 1>then what you're doing is building the </v>
<v Speaker 1>under structures right from the bottom </v>

921
00:51:41.781 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can say clean up your room.</v>

922
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the child,</v>

923
00:51:47.691 --> 00:51:50.420
<v Speaker 1>so exempt for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come back in the room isn't clean,</v>

924
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:51.433
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what do you do about a child who's </v>

925
00:51:53.631 --> 00:51:56.750
<v Speaker 1>being intransigent and won't clean up </v>
<v Speaker 1>their room?</v>

926
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.610
<v Speaker 1>And answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

927
00:51:58.611 --> 00:52:01.640
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you do is make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the right level of instruction.</v>

928
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

929
00:52:03.321 --> 00:52:07.430
<v Speaker 1>if you're negotiating with a partner or </v>
<v Speaker 1>an intimate partner,</v>

930
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:10.010
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you should assume if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do something stupid,</v>

931
00:52:10.011 --> 00:52:12.470
<v Speaker 1>which they certainly will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they're stupid,</v>

932
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:15.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you have to help them out.</v>

933
00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.093
<v Speaker 1>Building the micro structures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that you're asking them </v>

934
00:52:18.621 --> 00:52:22.190
<v Speaker 1>to do because people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are full of gaping holes and they</v>

935
00:52:22.191 --> 00:52:24.320
<v Speaker 1>lack social skills of all sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

936
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:29.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's a huge part of the tension </v>
<v Speaker 1>between friends and between couples.</v>

937
00:52:29.571 --> 00:52:33.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like its absence of ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you do your person a great favor.</v>

938
00:52:33.681 --> 00:52:36.380
<v Speaker 1>If you say um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

939
00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:40.280
<v Speaker 1>you forgot my birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay well what am I supposed to do about</v>

940
00:52:40.281 --> 00:52:41.114
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you might say well that's up to </v>

941
00:52:41.811 --> 00:52:42.470
<v Speaker 1>you to figure it out.</v>

942
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:43.303
<v Speaker 1>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume I'm stupid and tell me exactly </v>

943
00:52:45.921 --> 00:52:46.754
<v Speaker 1>what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll say well that doesn't </v>

944
00:52:48.621 --> 00:52:49.454
<v Speaker 1>really mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll say yeah but we're going to be </v>

945
00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:52.004
<v Speaker 1>like together for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you teach me this one time and </v>

946
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:58.910
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of awkward and stupid then </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the next time it'll be 50% better.</v>

947
00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.013
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause well cause you're looking at a </v>

948
00:53:01.131 --> 00:53:02.360
<v Speaker 1>trajectory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

949
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:04.760
<v Speaker 1>And so you can build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause one of the things,</v>

950
00:53:04.761 --> 00:53:05.594
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you could think about </v>

951
00:53:06.441 --> 00:53:11.030
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is let's say you make a meal.</v>

952
00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's say your,</v>

953
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:14.143
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your goal is to make a really good meal </v>

954
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:21.800
<v Speaker 1>in an efficient way so that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really happy about it,</v>

955
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.593
<v Speaker 1>including you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the probability that you'll get </v>

956
00:53:26.431 --> 00:53:27.264
<v Speaker 1>to eat lots of really good meals across </v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole life goes up not to good </v>

957
00:53:31.891 --> 00:53:33.810
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might think,</v>

958
00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:37.200
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made this meal and it was,</v>

959
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.093
<v Speaker 1>it was a costly expenditure of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have to be paid for that in some </v>

960
00:53:42.841 --> 00:53:45.180
<v Speaker 1>way in order to be happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

961
00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:46.014
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think about that for a minute </v>

962
00:53:46.981 --> 00:53:47.814
<v Speaker 1>because it's a concrete product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you spent a bunch of time </v>

963
00:53:49.951 --> 00:53:51.750
<v Speaker 1>making a good meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

964
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.540
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you not want people to do?</v>

965
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:57.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

966
00:53:59.020 --> 00:53:59.801
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

967
00:53:59.801 --> 00:54:01.570
<v Speaker 1>So they're not supposed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

968
00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:02.830
<v Speaker 1>what's this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

969
00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad response.</v>

970
00:54:04.631 --> 00:54:06.130
<v Speaker 1>What else do you not want them to do?</v>

971
00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Not enjoyed.</v>

972
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:10.371
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

973
00:54:10.371 --> 00:54:11.001
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

974
00:54:11.001 --> 00:54:11.834
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's not going to be a lot of </v>

975
00:54:12.231 --> 00:54:13.880
<v Speaker 1>bickering at the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

976
00:54:13.881 --> 00:54:14.714
<v Speaker 1>Because then you're going to think what </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stupid idiot would make a nice </v>

977
00:54:17.391 --> 00:54:20.240
<v Speaker 1>meal for this lot of like insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees.</v>

978
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not going to want to replicate</v>

979
00:54:22.761 --> 00:54:23.594
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else would,</v>

980
00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.640
<v Speaker 1>would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you want them not to do?</v>

981
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Not Finish it.</v>

982
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

983
00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:32.100
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not help clean up.</v>

984
00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

985
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:33.743
<v Speaker 1>Not Be grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Notice that you put a lot of time </v>

986
00:54:36.001 --> 00:54:36.834
<v Speaker 1>and effort into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not notice that it's above the normal </v>

987
00:54:39.631 --> 00:54:42.570
<v Speaker 1>standards that you sort of went above </v>
<v Speaker 1>and beyond the call of duty.</v>

988
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe show a little bit of thankfulness.</v>

989
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>

990
00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:47.574
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I want to set up my life so that I </v>

991
00:54:48.721 --> 00:54:49.554
<v Speaker 1>get to eat really good meals for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of my life and be happy about </v>

992
00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:53.270
<v Speaker 1>making them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

993
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.113
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what are the preconditions for </v>

994
00:54:54.781 --> 00:54:55.614
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you have to fight for the </v>

995
00:54:57.811 --> 00:55:02.811
<v Speaker 1>preconditions because the alternative is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cook slop miserably and you fight.</v>

996
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's interesting</v>

997
00:55:06.631 --> 00:55:07.464
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I don't have to </v>

998
00:55:08.311 --> 00:55:09.144
<v Speaker 1>do with my clients is we do some </v>
<v Speaker 1>arithmetic because people have a weird </v>

999
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:14.100
<v Speaker 1>idea about what's important in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1000
00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:18.000
<v Speaker 1>So you might think you got 16 hours a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day of awake time,</v>

1001
00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1002
00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to spend four of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

1003
00:55:24.061 --> 00:55:27.270
<v Speaker 1>three of those hours interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

1004
00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1005
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:32.730
<v Speaker 1>let's say for let's say three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one fifth of your life,</v>

1006
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.850
<v Speaker 1>20% of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1007
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 1>get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get it right.</v>

1008
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.950
<v Speaker 1>It's 20% of your life you got to taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of.</v>

1009
00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

1010
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:43.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1011
00:55:43.801 --> 00:55:45.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to think about think through</v>

1012
00:55:45.481 --> 00:55:46.410
<v Speaker 1>those things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1013
00:55:46.411 --> 00:55:47.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the math.</v>

1014
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's arithmetic.</v>

1015
00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:50.571
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1016
00:55:50.571 --> 00:55:53.970
<v Speaker 1>and so sometimes people will come to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll say,</v>

1017
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I have to fight with my child for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour a night to get them to go to bed.</v>

1018
00:55:58.410 --> 00:55:59.131
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1019
00:55:59.131 --> 00:55:59.964
<v Speaker 1>let's do the arithmetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how long have you been fighting with </v>

1020
00:56:02.851 --> 00:56:03.810
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six months.</v>

1021
00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.340
<v Speaker 1>How long do you think this will </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue?</v>

1022
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Indefinitely?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two years.</v>

1023
00:56:07.861 --> 00:56:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it's two years.</v>

1024
00:56:09.481 --> 00:56:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1025
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:14.640
<v Speaker 1>we're going to say that's 800 days for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sake of simplicity in math,</v>

1026
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:15.871
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1027
00:56:15.871 --> 00:56:20.871
<v Speaker 1>we'll say 800 and so that's 800 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's 20 work weeks.</v>

1028
00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:28.740
<v Speaker 1>So in the next two years you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend five months of work weeks fighting</v>

1029
00:56:29.501 --> 00:56:30.970
<v Speaker 1>with your child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1030
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:32.770
<v Speaker 1>You expect to like them at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1031
00:56:32.771 --> 00:56:33.604
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're going to fight with </v>

1032
00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:39.391
<v Speaker 1>someone for like five months and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to like them.</v>

1033
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:42.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't going to happen.</v>

1034
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:44.081
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1035
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 1>how important is it to solve that </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem?</v>

1036
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's five months of work,</v>

1037
00:56:49.901 --> 00:56:50.734
<v Speaker 1>weeks worth of importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could put a week into it and you </v>

1038
00:56:52.751 --> 00:56:53.980
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be helpful.</v>

1039
00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.320
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

1040
00:56:58.680 --> 00:56:59.220
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1041
00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make a case that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at the hierarchy,</v>

1042
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.220
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchical structure of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>

1043
00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:06.054
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the best way to do that often is by </v>

1044
00:57:08.221 --> 00:57:10.560
<v Speaker 1>paying close attention to things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1045
00:57:10.561 --> 00:57:11.394
<v Speaker 1>normally they're invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally they're invisible and that's </v>

1046
00:57:17.941 --> 00:57:19.590
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to fix them.</v>

1047
00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:22.080
<v Speaker 1>And if you fix all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little tiny things,</v>

1048
00:57:22.081 --> 00:57:23.730
<v Speaker 1>if you fix them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hard,</v>

1049
00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes negotiation but it's not </v>

1050
00:57:25.411 --> 00:57:26.520
<v Speaker 1>impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1051
00:57:26.521 --> 00:57:29.250
<v Speaker 1>cause it's the first thing you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask your partner or your family is,</v>

1052
00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:31.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would we like to have a meal?</v>

1053
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:32.333
<v Speaker 1>You want wretched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty food that someone just threw </v>

1054
00:57:33.751 --> 00:57:36.930
<v Speaker 1>together and it's burnt and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight about it all the time.</v>

1055
00:57:36.931 --> 00:57:39.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's really erratic and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable.</v>

1056
00:57:39.511 --> 00:57:40.344
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the person who's making it as </v>

1057
00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:42.024
<v Speaker 1>unhappy and the kitchen is a disaster </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and everybody's angry about </v>

1058
00:57:45.331 --> 00:57:46.830
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's like one solution.</v>

1059
00:57:46.831 --> 00:57:47.664
<v Speaker 1>Do you want that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they all are sensible enough to </v>

1060
00:57:50.041 --> 00:57:51.900
<v Speaker 1>say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then then you can say to them,</v>

1061
00:57:51.901 --> 00:57:56.200
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the alternative?</v>

1062
00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:58.000
<v Speaker 1>And then you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1063
00:57:58.001 --> 00:57:58.834
<v Speaker 1>we could imagine what the alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be and then we can work on laying </v>

1064
00:58:03.101 --> 00:58:06.070
<v Speaker 1>out the microprocessors that would lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that outcome.</v>

1065
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:06.933
<v Speaker 1>And we can practice them over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we can assume that if we don't get </v>

1066
00:58:09.311 --> 00:58:11.380
<v Speaker 1>it right in three months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean it's hopeless.</v>

1067
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.293
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

1068
00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:21.310
<v Speaker 1>when Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me give you an example.</v>

1069
00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:31.500
<v Speaker 1>I was reading a Gartman study the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day on marital stability.</v>

1070
00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Gottman has done some really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of couples behavior.</v>

1071
00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:38.183
<v Speaker 1>He has set up a lab that's basically a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed and breakfast and he brings couples </v>

1072
00:58:41.911 --> 00:58:42.744
<v Speaker 1>in there for a weekend and he wires the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mop physiologically and monitors their </v>

1073
00:58:46.801 --> 00:58:48.270
<v Speaker 1>reactivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what he's,</v>

1074
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:52.230
<v Speaker 1>he can predict whether a couple's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to divorce with 95 94% accuracy.</v>

1075
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:55.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does he found?</v>

1076
00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:57.653
<v Speaker 1>He's found two categories of he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's identified two phenomena that are </v>

1077
00:59:02.161 --> 00:59:02.994
<v Speaker 1>very much worth knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is that the couples who are </v>

1078
00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:08.844
<v Speaker 1>going to get divorced and they come into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bed and breakfast and they speak </v>

1079
00:59:13.141 --> 00:59:13.974
<v Speaker 1>with each other quite commonly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more walking on eggs calm and </v>

1080
00:59:19.651 --> 00:59:21.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're speaking with each other calmly.</v>

1081
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Their physiology is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very aroused and so,</v>

1082
00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:28.550
<v Speaker 1>so they're sort of aroused like someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's facing a predator.</v>

1083
00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:29.593
<v Speaker 1>So you might think about an unhappy </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple as Predator and prey to each </v>

1084
00:59:33.021 --> 00:59:33.854
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the words are there mostly to </v>

1085
00:59:36.051 --> 00:59:40.940
<v Speaker 1>stop predatory activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to actually communicate anything.</v>

1086
00:59:40.941 --> 00:59:44.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just to keep the surface comp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might think,</v>

1087
00:59:44.511 --> 00:59:47.280
<v Speaker 1>well what's under the surface?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one,</v>

1088
00:59:47.281 --> 00:59:50.870
<v Speaker 1>it's under the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Freud would say it's what's under the</v>

1089
00:59:50.871 --> 00:59:55.100
<v Speaker 1>surface is unconscious and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can say,</v>

1090
00:59:55.101 --> 00:59:56.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's under the surface is one of these</v>

1091
00:59:56.901 --> 00:59:59.710
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies that's all banged up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>twisted and,</v>

1092
00:59:59.711 --> 01:00:02.150
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not in reasonable shape.</v>

1093
01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.910
<v Speaker 1>And so people don't want to open the </v>
<v Speaker 1>door to that.</v>

1094
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:06.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do.</v>

1095
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.260
<v Speaker 1>This is a Freudian slip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say this,</v>

1096
01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:11.900
<v Speaker 1>this goes to the second part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gottman's observations.</v>

1097
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:17.470
<v Speaker 1>So the woman goes over to the window and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>

1098
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a cardinal outside,</v>

1099
01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:22.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardinals,</v>

1100
01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:24.050
<v Speaker 1>that bright red bird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of cool looking,</v>

1101
01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a trivial thing in some </v>

1102
01:00:26.811 --> 01:00:27.200
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

1103
01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.880
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1104
01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a little positive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1105
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:35.330
<v Speaker 1>20 of them in a day is good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1106
01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:36.550
<v Speaker 1>So then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1107
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.070
<v Speaker 1>the partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the husband in this example has a two by</v>

1108
01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:43.250
<v Speaker 1>two matrix of choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>

1109
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>who the hell cares about your stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>bird?</v>

1110
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one.</v>

1111
01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.040
<v Speaker 1>The second one is then you go over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the bird,</v>

1112
01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:55.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the third one is you don't make</v>

1113
01:00:55.581 --> 01:00:56.414
<v Speaker 1>the contempt noise but yanked it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fourth one is you go over there </v>

1114
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>like a civilized human being and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1115
01:01:02.631 --> 01:01:05.780
<v Speaker 1>and that you're interacting with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you care for and you take a look at</v>

1116
01:01:05.781 --> 01:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>the damn bird and you're happy about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

1117
01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:12.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's as truthful and real as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can manage.</v>

1118
01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the option,</v>

1119
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a Freudian slip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1120
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Because what it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole monster underneath that.</v>

1121
01:01:23.541 --> 01:01:24.374
<v Speaker 1>And the monster is all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorganization in this entire </v>

1122
01:01:28.011 --> 01:01:30.950
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the might be,</v>

1123
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:37.060
<v Speaker 1>we have been tormenting each other about</v>
<v Speaker 1>various things for the last 10 years and</v>

1124
01:01:37.581 --> 01:01:38.414
<v Speaker 1>none of them are resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not very happy about you for so </v>

1125
01:01:42.111 --> 01:01:44.510
<v Speaker 1>many reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even remember all of them.</v>

1126
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't enumerate them right now because</v>

1127
01:01:47.661 --> 01:01:49.430
<v Speaker 1>that would take forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it may be,</v>

1128
01:01:49.431 --> 01:01:52.580
<v Speaker 1>we would have a huge fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>

1129
01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to come over there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you happy with your stupid bird.</v>

1130
01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.373
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to indicate that subtly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't call me a son of a bitch </v>

1131
01:01:59.961 --> 01:02:03.470
<v Speaker 1>because I've just sighing and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'll say if you do ask me.</v>

1132
01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going to load all that up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to deliver it to you.</v>

1133
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:08.203
<v Speaker 1>And what's going to happen to you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're smart is your heart </v>

1134
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:12.260
<v Speaker 1>rate's going to go way up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're being attacked.</v>

1135
01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the good couples do,</v>

1136
01:02:16.761 --> 01:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>the couples that you know stay together </v>
<v Speaker 1>is they respond to each other's bids,</v>

1137
01:02:20.761 --> 01:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>he calls them bids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if one person wants to share some</v>

1138
01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>little trivial daily positive thing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

1139
01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1140
01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:30.053
<v Speaker 1>isn't carrying around a bloody cartload </v>
<v Speaker 1>of resentment and is able to respond to </v>

1141
01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:35.874
<v Speaker 1>that in a positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that way the general interactions </v>

1142
01:02:39.421 --> 01:02:40.254
<v Speaker 1>between the couple stay positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's also because they've worked </v>

1143
01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1144
01:02:45.031 --> 01:02:45.864
<v Speaker 1>you know it's gotta be because they work</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out because the couples who are </v>

1145
01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>physiologically reactive to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're communicating,</v>

1146
01:02:52.081 --> 01:02:52.914
<v Speaker 1>but there's all sorts of horror </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the surface and we're trying </v>

1147
01:02:56.341 --> 01:02:56.851
<v Speaker 1>to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1148
01:02:56.851 --> 01:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>what is it that's underneath the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface?</v>

1149
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:02.580
<v Speaker 1>What's the structure of the unconscious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1150
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:04.103
<v Speaker 1>that's the structure of the unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's either well structured and </v>

1151
01:03:07.411 --> 01:03:12.090
<v Speaker 1>functional and mutually agreed to porn </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as explicit as possible,</v>

1152
01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:17.250
<v Speaker 1>or it's this constantly and then when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the couples fight about it,</v>

1153
01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:20.410
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1154
01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:21.243
<v Speaker 1>because they're not very sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not very awake and they're </v>

1155
01:03:23.411 --> 01:03:24.244
<v Speaker 1>not very aware and they don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do micro analysis and they're tired </v>

1156
01:03:26.861 --> 01:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>and unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't say,</v>

1157
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I would rather that you use cloth </v>
<v Speaker 1>napkins when we have a formal dinner.</v>

1158
01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.493
<v Speaker 1>Then paper Napkins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say you do a bad job of </v>

1159
01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:42.090
<v Speaker 1>entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1160
01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:43.560
<v Speaker 1>that's not helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1161
01:03:43.561 --> 01:03:44.394
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're wiping out the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bad job of entertaining would be </v>

1162
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:52.650
<v Speaker 1>probably about at the level of family </v>
<v Speaker 1>care in the hierarchy.</v>

1163
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:53.873
<v Speaker 1>And so what you're doing is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting them in a place that if they </v>

1164
01:03:56.731 --> 01:03:57.564
<v Speaker 1>listened to you would knock out maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>10% of their entire be behavioral and </v>

1165
01:04:02.791 --> 01:04:03.624
<v Speaker 1>perceptual structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you really want to do that to </v>

1166
01:04:06.151 --> 01:04:06.984
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only want to do that to someone </v>

1167
01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:10.350
<v Speaker 1>under extreme conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1168
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Extreme conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be something like,</v>

1169
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:16.390
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1170
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:21.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe a warning to a child who's gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>astray very badly,</v>

1171
01:04:21.071 --> 01:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the skills,</v>

1172
01:04:22.751 --> 01:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1173
01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:24.903
<v Speaker 1>the kind of mistakes that you're making </v>
<v Speaker 1>are sufficiently catastrophic so that </v>

1174
01:04:27.821 --> 01:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>your life is going to go off course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1175
01:04:30.071 --> 01:04:32.590
<v Speaker 1>And then you might have a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them about,</v>

1176
01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:37.370
<v Speaker 1>often for kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for guide,</v>

1177
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.820
<v Speaker 1>for people that say are between 15 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>25 I know they're not kids really,</v>

1178
01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:43.640
<v Speaker 1>but my kids are that age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of that might be,</v>

1179
01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.560
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you going to do for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>career?</v>

1180
01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that's an unspecified,</v>

1181
01:04:47.391 --> 01:04:50.060
<v Speaker 1>the person's just all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1182
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:52.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1183
01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.960
<v Speaker 1>so here's some slides that represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1184
01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see the progression of that.</v>

1185
01:05:16.421 --> 01:05:17.254
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if things are operating at the top of </v>

1186
01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:20.044
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy that what that means is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've mastered all the subsidiary </v>

1187
01:05:23.861 --> 01:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>elements and you've built them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only from the bottom up,</v>

1188
01:05:27.311 --> 01:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>but because the levels crosstalk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1189
01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can use,</v>

1190
01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:34.563
<v Speaker 1>and that's the next thing we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about because you're not just a </v>

1191
01:05:36.281 --> 01:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>behavioral creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not just an animal like a chimp.</v>

1192
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.470
<v Speaker 1>You're capable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1193
01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:43.630
<v Speaker 1>there's things you can do that animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do.</v>

1194
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:44.703
<v Speaker 1>And what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that not only can you act things out </v>

1195
01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:48.993
<v Speaker 1>in a manner that through action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll organize your hierarchy because </v>

1196
01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:52.414
<v Speaker 1>that's what animals do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can also represent that </v>

1197
01:05:54.641 --> 01:05:57.580
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about the hierarchy,</v>

1198
01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:01.990
<v Speaker 1>you can articulate the hierarchy and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can play with it abstractly.</v>

1199
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:05.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're doing when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging in philosophy.</v>

1200
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's also what you're doing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're negotiating.</v>

1201
01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.493
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really good thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that you can not only </v>

1202
01:06:11.021 --> 01:06:13.480
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize changes and then implement</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1203
01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.713
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can conceptualize a broad range </v>

1204
01:06:16.151 --> 01:06:16.984
<v Speaker 1>of potential potential changes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvements and you can implement them </v>

1205
01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:23.740
<v Speaker 1>and you can observe what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can also communicate that to all</v>

1206
01:06:23.741 --> 01:06:26.380
<v Speaker 1>sorts of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a great thing to be able to do.</v>

1207
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.680
<v Speaker 1>The problem with it is obviously that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can abstractly represent and</v>

1208
01:06:32.381 --> 01:06:33.214
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also knock the hell out of your </v>

1209
01:06:35.261 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Speaker 1>belief in the top elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

1210
01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:38.643
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what does it mean to be a good </v>

1211
01:06:39.401 --> 01:06:41.020
<v Speaker 1>person anyways?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1212
01:06:41.021 --> 01:06:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Or why should I be a good person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is there any,</v>

1213
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.910
<v Speaker 1>is there any utility or meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a good person?</v>

1214
01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:46.744
<v Speaker 1>Or is there even any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't even reasonable to say that there </v>

1215
01:06:48.451 --> 01:06:49.150
<v Speaker 1>is such a thing.</v>

1216
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:52.480
<v Speaker 1>He's a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I think all of those questions</v>

1217
01:06:52.481 --> 01:06:53.314
<v Speaker 1>in some sense are ill post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I think that is because </v>

1218
01:06:55.631 --> 01:06:57.310
<v Speaker 1>they're at the wrong level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution.</v>

1219
01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:58.533
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't throw the damn baby out with </v>

1220
01:06:59.411 --> 01:07:00.244
<v Speaker 1>the bath water so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to critique </v>

1221
01:07:01.721 --> 01:07:03.640
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't start.</v>

1222
01:07:03.641 --> 01:07:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Don't start at the highest level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>

1223
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:07.083
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a big part of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with what people are taught in </v>

1224
01:07:09.101 --> 01:07:09.934
<v Speaker 1>universities today because you're often </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to criticize systems at the </v>

1225
01:07:13.931 --> 01:07:15.760
<v Speaker 1>highest level of obstruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1226
01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with capitalism.</v>

1227
01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:19.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

1228
01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to do something about that?</v>

1229
01:07:21.881 --> 01:07:22.714
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to work better in your </v>

1230
01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:26.440
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to happen.</v>

1231
01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:27.371
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1232
01:07:27.371 --> 01:07:29.650
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1233
01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:32.260
<v Speaker 1>if you stick a stick in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a functioning machine,</v>

1234
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:33.094
<v Speaker 1>even if you think the machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all rattling and it's like pulling </v>

1235
01:07:34.691 --> 01:07:38.080
<v Speaker 1>people's arms in and it's got all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of catastrophic problems.</v>

1236
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:40.840
<v Speaker 1>You come home and like hit it with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick.</v>

1237
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:44.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not going to run better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong level of analysis.</v>

1238
01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:45.993
<v Speaker 1>And just because you have a stick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that the machine doesn't </v>

1239
01:07:47.921 --> 01:07:50.020
<v Speaker 1>work very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that you're very bright.</v>

1240
01:07:50.021 --> 01:07:52.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like obviously it doesn't work very</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1241
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:55.000
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not the issue.</v>

1242
01:07:55.001 --> 01:07:59.380
<v Speaker 1>The issue is could you improve it </v>
<v Speaker 1>without making it worse?</v>

1243
01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:02.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like now that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big problem.</v>

1244
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:08.670
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a wheelchair,</v>

1245
01:08:08.891 --> 01:08:10.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bearings are gone.</v>

1246
01:08:10.361 --> 01:08:12.400
<v Speaker 1>So the bloody thing just grinds away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1247
01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:14.730
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's wobbly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work very well on ice.</v>

1248
01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:15.573
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think,</v>

1249
01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:18.710
<v Speaker 1>well that's a horrible wheelchair and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just take it from the person.</v>

1250
01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:20.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like then they're lying there on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ice,</v>

1251
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1252
01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:22.431
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1253
01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:23.264
<v Speaker 1>that's helpful while you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that horrible wheelchair </v>

1254
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:26.810
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1255
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:28.580
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>

1256
01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like so like a rattle trap thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that works is better than nothing.</v>

1257
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:35.900
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to fix something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you have to be,</v>

1258
01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:36.853
<v Speaker 1>I would think about it more like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would do if you had to fix a </v>

1259
01:08:38.961 --> 01:08:41.140
<v Speaker 1>helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1260
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:44.540
<v Speaker 1>like you're not going to critique the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole helicopter now.</v>

1261
01:08:44.541 --> 01:08:45.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1262
01:08:45.771 --> 01:08:47.210
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good helicopter.</v>

1263
01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.433
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can tell that because it's not </v>

1264
01:08:49.071 --> 01:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>working very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what are you going to do?</v>

1265
01:08:51.081 --> 01:08:51.914
<v Speaker 1>Well then you have to learn a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the helicopter and all of its parts and </v>

1266
01:08:54.351 --> 01:08:55.184
<v Speaker 1>how they function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out which </v>

1267
01:08:56.361 --> 01:08:57.194
<v Speaker 1>part isn't working properly and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to take that part out and then you </v>

1268
01:08:59.901 --> 01:09:03.110
<v Speaker 1>have to find a better park and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put it back in.</v>

1269
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:04.213
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe the bloody thing or work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like a high level abstract solution </v>

1270
01:09:08.121 --> 01:09:10.400
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like helicopters aren't useful.</v>

1271
01:09:10.401 --> 01:09:14.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I use the helicopter example because</v>

1272
01:09:14.961 --> 01:09:17.570
<v Speaker 1>with a military helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

1273
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:21.440
<v Speaker 1>you have to perform about 30 hours of </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintenance for each hour.</v>

1274
01:09:21.441 --> 01:09:24.290
<v Speaker 1>The thing is in the air because like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a helicopter?</v>

1275
01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:25.183
<v Speaker 1>It's a big lump of metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to get those things to </v>

1276
01:09:27.171 --> 01:09:28.790
<v Speaker 1>stay in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1277
01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:30.830
<v Speaker 1>and everything we do is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1278
01:09:30.831 --> 01:09:31.664
<v Speaker 1>it's like the fact that the electricity </v>
<v Speaker 1>is working in this room is a bloody </v>

1279
01:09:35.451 --> 01:09:38.810
<v Speaker 1>miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's unbelievable that it works and</v>

1280
01:09:38.811 --> 01:09:39.644
<v Speaker 1>there it is working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even have to pay any attention </v>

1281
01:09:40.881 --> 01:09:44.450
<v Speaker 1>to it and it always works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't fix that.</v>

1282
01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:49.733
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1283
01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a major response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denial isn't,</v>

1284
01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:54.173
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's what we're trying to do </v>

1285
01:09:54.811 --> 01:09:55.644
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to figure out what the </v>

1286
01:09:56.491 --> 01:09:57.950
<v Speaker 1>meaning of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1287
01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:01.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the big talk on Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1288
01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:02.410
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1289
01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should.</v>

1290
01:10:04.831 --> 01:10:08.640
<v Speaker 1>So that's also part of what people talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about when they talk about humility.</v>

1291
01:10:08.670 --> 01:10:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Because if you look at classic religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtues,</v>

1292
01:10:11.251 --> 01:10:12.084
<v Speaker 1>and this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's true of virtually every </v>

1293
01:10:14.191 --> 01:10:16.230
<v Speaker 1>religious system that I've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>

1294
01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:18.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like humility.</v>

1295
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what does that mean?</v>

1296
01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Start at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1297
01:10:22.921 --> 01:10:23.754
<v Speaker 1>it's like fix the little things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the other thing is little </v>

1298
01:10:25.771 --> 01:10:27.000
<v Speaker 1>things aren't little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

1299
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1300
01:10:27.481 --> 01:10:28.314
<v Speaker 1>they're not little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we already went through that with </v>

1301
01:10:29.731 --> 01:10:32.370
<v Speaker 1>the example of mealtime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1302
01:10:32.371 --> 01:10:33.204
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much fuss should you make about </v>

1303
01:10:33.901 --> 01:10:35.970
<v Speaker 1>meals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's 20% of your life?</v>

1304
01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.150
<v Speaker 1>So how much faster would you make about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1305
01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:40.373
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should expand 20% of your energy </v>

1306
01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:44.070
<v Speaker 1>getting that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you get it right,</v>

1307
01:10:44.071 --> 01:10:45.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like an art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1308
01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because meal preparation,</v>

1309
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are highly social.</v>

1310
01:10:50.850 --> 01:10:53.940
<v Speaker 1>They're highly social eaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're not eating socially,</v>

1311
01:10:53.941 --> 01:10:54.774
<v Speaker 1>they're eating goes badly right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't regulate their intake and </v>

1312
01:10:57.901 --> 01:10:58.734
<v Speaker 1>they eat terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see this with isolated people all </v>

1313
01:11:00.541 --> 01:11:01.920
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even eat.</v>

1314
01:11:01.921 --> 01:11:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Or if they do eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like popcorn and,</v>

1315
01:11:03.721 --> 01:11:05.550
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gummy worms or something.</v>

1316
01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:06.593
<v Speaker 1>It's really not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very eating behavior among </v>

1317
01:11:09.841 --> 01:11:11.730
<v Speaker 1>human beings is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex.</v>

1318
01:11:11.731 --> 01:11:14.580
<v Speaker 1>We're omnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have way too much choice.</v>

1319
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Plus we're social eaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1320
01:11:16.921 --> 01:11:19.020
<v Speaker 1>so it's hard to get that right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1321
01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:19.883
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's sick and miserable and </v>

1322
01:11:21.241 --> 01:11:23.070
<v Speaker 1>unhappy and irritable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1323
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:23.904
<v Speaker 1>and if you get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you bring it right up to the </v>

1324
01:11:26.161 --> 01:11:28.350
<v Speaker 1>level of aesthetics and art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1325
01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:29.184
<v Speaker 1>that's way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know when also when you're </v>

1326
01:11:31.231 --> 01:11:33.390
<v Speaker 1>thinking about things like the meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life,</v>

1327
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:38.910
<v Speaker 1>life has all sorts of meanings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1328
01:11:38.911 --> 01:11:39.744
<v Speaker 1>many meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the meetings are arranged in a </v>

1329
01:11:41.371 --> 01:11:42.204
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so whether there's an meaning or </v>

1330
01:11:43.981 --> 01:11:46.470
<v Speaker 1>many meanings depend on where you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the hierarchy.</v>

1331
01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:47.933
<v Speaker 1>But if you want your life to be better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might be some element of </v>

1332
01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:53.160
<v Speaker 1>meaningful life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1333
01:11:53.161 --> 01:11:53.994
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you can start doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>start doing all the things that you </v>

1334
01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:58.680
<v Speaker 1>actually do right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1335
01:11:58.681 --> 01:11:59.514
<v Speaker 1>that'll improve things a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once once you improve those </v>

1336
01:12:01.591 --> 01:12:02.424
<v Speaker 1>things and then the way you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the problem isn't even going to be </v>

1337
01:12:04.081 --> 01:12:04.914
<v Speaker 1>the same pit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed the micro routines and then see </v>

1338
01:12:07.591 --> 01:12:09.960
<v Speaker 1>what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you might find that if you get</v>

1339
01:12:09.961 --> 01:12:10.794
<v Speaker 1>all the micro routines running properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole problem of nihilism just </v>

1340
01:12:14.371 --> 01:12:18.390
<v Speaker 1>vanishes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at least it's worth a shot.</v>

1341
01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:21.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1342
01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:22.163
<v Speaker 1>now here's the next thing we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out is like how does that </v>

1343
01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:29.940
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy come into being now for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1344
01:12:29.941 --> 01:12:33.660
<v Speaker 1>this is also a Nietzsche in observation </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>

1345
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.033
<v Speaker 1>and this is also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also the basis of conspiracy </v>

1346
01:12:38.371 --> 01:12:42.060
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy sits theory,</v>

1347
01:12:42.061 --> 01:12:44.490
<v Speaker 1>sociology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say roughly speaking,</v>

1348
01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.353
<v Speaker 1>it's like Freud critiqued religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that it was a defense against </v>

1349
01:12:50.101 --> 01:12:52.200
<v Speaker 1>death anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

1350
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.903
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of problems with a </v>

1351
01:12:55.781 --> 01:12:57.280
<v Speaker 1>critique like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

1352
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.760
<v Speaker 1>it's partly a defense against death </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

1353
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:04.583
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to watch when you're listening to </v>

1354
01:13:06.391 --> 01:13:07.224
<v Speaker 1>thinkers and when you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to organize your thought </v>

1355
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.433
<v Speaker 1>is you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to be skeptical of people </v>

1356
01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:16.050
<v Speaker 1>who boil things down to one prop </v>
<v Speaker 1>principal.</v>

1357
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:19.260
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marks,</v>

1358
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:22.800
<v Speaker 1>it's economics and class struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1359
01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:24.053
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that relevant to the study of </v>

1360
01:13:24.961 --> 01:13:26.490
<v Speaker 1>societies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1361
01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:29.370
<v Speaker 1>we're structured in dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies when we trade,</v>

1362
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:33.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the problem.</v>

1363
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:34.913
<v Speaker 1>It's one of many complex problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take a Marxist view of </v>

1364
01:13:38.701 --> 01:13:41.340
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you basically do is you take a look</v>

1365
01:13:41.341 --> 01:13:46.260
<v Speaker 1>at history and you interpret it through </v>
<v Speaker 1>an a priori set of axioms,</v>

1366
01:13:46.261 --> 01:13:50.250
<v Speaker 1>which is that everything that happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>was determined by economic causes.</v>

1367
01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:51.653
<v Speaker 1>Well the ant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is you can do that because </v>

1368
01:13:54.091 --> 01:13:54.924
<v Speaker 1>every single thing that ever happened is</v>
<v Speaker 1>determined in part by economic </v>

1369
01:13:59.101 --> 01:13:59.820
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

1370
01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:00.653
<v Speaker 1>So all you have to do or causes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is ignore all the </v>

1371
01:14:03.571 --> 01:14:07.380
<v Speaker 1>other causes and come up with a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>coherent narrative that you can,</v>

1372
01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:09.780
<v Speaker 1>that you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who is a Marxist can do that.</v>

1373
01:14:09.781 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>And like three tenths of a second cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a machine.</v>

1374
01:14:12.341 --> 01:14:13.174
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1375
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:14.320
<v Speaker 1>what was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

1376
01:14:14.321 --> 01:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to a guy the other day and</v>

1377
01:14:17.171 --> 01:14:18.010
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of,</v>

1378
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:19.100
<v Speaker 1>he's an idiot log.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1379
01:14:19.210 --> 01:14:20.043
<v Speaker 1>and I asked him a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been bugging me for a long </v>

1380
01:14:22.271 --> 01:14:23.260
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I thought,</v>

1381
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Greece everybody cheats on their </v>

1382
01:14:26.231 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 1>income tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1383
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:27.963
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not so good because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government can't work and then the </v>

1384
01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:34.030
<v Speaker 1>economy fails and then everyone starves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

1385
01:14:34.031 --> 01:14:36.100
<v Speaker 1>why shouldn't you cheat on your income </v>
<v Speaker 1>tax?</v>

1386
01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:36.934
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then the government won't work and </v>

1387
01:14:38.711 --> 01:14:40.720
<v Speaker 1>the economy will collapse and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>will starve.</v>

1388
01:14:40.721 --> 01:14:43.150
<v Speaker 1>So don't cheat on your income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1389
01:14:43.151 --> 01:14:43.984
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I can cheat and that won't really </v>

1390
01:14:45.341 --> 01:14:46.121
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1391
01:14:46.121 --> 01:14:47.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it matters.</v>

1392
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.273
<v Speaker 1>Here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're doing your income </v>

1393
01:14:51.941 --> 01:14:53.800
<v Speaker 1>tax and you're pissed off about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because like,</v>

1394
01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:54.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're giving away your money and you </v>

1395
01:14:55.631 --> 01:14:57.760
<v Speaker 1>don't know which it's being well spent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

1396
01:14:57.761 --> 01:15:01.300
<v Speaker 1>mostly it's not because mostly nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>works very well.</v>

1397
01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:02.523
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I can cheat because I'm only one </v>

1398
01:15:04.301 --> 01:15:07.060
<v Speaker 1>person and you know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does it matter?</v>

1399
01:15:07.061 --> 01:15:07.894
<v Speaker 1>But then you think,</v>

1400
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:14.083
<v Speaker 1>imagine we were all supposed to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>money into a pool and then take money </v>

1401
01:15:18.741 --> 01:15:19.574
<v Speaker 1>out and I knew that one of you wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting money in the pool but that you </v>

1402
01:15:23.911 --> 01:15:25.280
<v Speaker 1>were going to take it out I'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1403
01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:27.140
<v Speaker 1>well whatever one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1404
01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:29.210
<v Speaker 1>crooked psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just,</v>

1405
01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.890
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to worry about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1406
01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:32.203
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like three people and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like eight and then it's 10 and </v>

1407
01:15:35.571 --> 01:15:36.404
<v Speaker 1>then it's 10% of the room and 10% seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be something like a tipping point at </v>

1408
01:15:40.791 --> 01:15:41.624
<v Speaker 1>some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly if you're the only person </v>

1409
01:15:44.361 --> 01:15:47.600
<v Speaker 1>putting money in that pot and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else is taking your,</v>

1410
01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:51.140
<v Speaker 1>anybody with any sense is going to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are complete blithering idiot</v>

1411
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:53.120
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to start playing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

1412
01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.013
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is at what point do you </v>

1413
01:15:56.421 --> 01:15:57.254
<v Speaker 1>collect enough cheaters so that the s </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are basically honest </v>

1414
01:16:00.141 --> 01:16:03.180
<v Speaker 1>start feeling like the game is crooked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and quit playing?</v>

1415
01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:04.483
<v Speaker 1>While the answer is probably something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10% so art back to the back to the </v>

1416
01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:14.643
<v Speaker 1>Floridians.</v>

1417
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't remember why I told you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1418
01:16:17.881 --> 01:16:19.950
<v Speaker 1>It had to do with economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>determination.</v>

1419
01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1420
01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1421
01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is the story.</v>

1422
01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.890
<v Speaker 1>So I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1423
01:16:28.891 --> 01:16:29.724
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if like 10% is a tipping point or 30% I </v>

1424
01:16:33.031 --> 01:16:34.200
<v Speaker 1>don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

1425
01:16:34.201 --> 01:16:35.034
<v Speaker 1>50 I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a tipping point is at some </v>

1426
01:16:37.501 --> 01:16:41.010
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a minority of people,</v>

1427
01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.380
<v Speaker 1>if they're corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can bring down the whole system.</v>

1428
01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:47.190
<v Speaker 1>How in the world do you ever create a </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that isn't corrupt?</v>

1429
01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Because all everybody almost has to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>it honestly before the thing will work.</v>

1430
01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:56.250
<v Speaker 1>And so how do people get from the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's chaotic and corrupt,</v>

1431
01:16:56.251 --> 01:16:58.260
<v Speaker 1>which is the case in most of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1432
01:16:58.261 --> 01:17:01.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most places are insanely corrupt.</v>

1433
01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Some places aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1434
01:17:04.230 --> 01:17:06.650
<v Speaker 1>how the hell did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

1435
01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:08.820
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem possible to me that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1436
01:17:08.821 --> 01:17:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I understand it because the default is </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously chaos and corruption.</v>

1437
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:15.860
<v Speaker 1>That's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anybody can do that.</v>

1438
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like sometimes systems work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more or less honest.</v>

1439
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Like Ebay is a really good example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1440
01:17:20.991 --> 01:17:21.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>

1441
01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I proxy bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the average level of cheating?</v>

1442
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1443
01:17:27.651 --> 01:17:30.320
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievably honest and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>

1444
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:32.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody thought that would happen.</v>

1445
01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:33.973
<v Speaker 1>So how the hell does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was asking a friend of mine and </v>

1446
01:17:37.461 --> 01:17:38.294
<v Speaker 1>this guy too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I laid this out and like I didn't </v>

1447
01:17:40.641 --> 01:17:42.560
<v Speaker 1>even get finished the question and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1448
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:44.360
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1449
01:17:44.770 --> 01:17:45.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

1450
01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:45.831
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1451
01:17:45.831 --> 01:17:48.460
<v Speaker 1>it's those places that don't have too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much government that are honest.</v>

1452
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:49.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well thank you.</v>

1453
01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:51.043
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was a complicated </v>

1454
01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:52.634
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1455
01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:53.570
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here are you,</v>

1456
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:54.583
<v Speaker 1>you didn't even have to listen to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole damn question before you had an </v>

1457
01:17:56.691 --> 01:17:58.190
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's government.</v>

1458
01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh well I'll stop thinking about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

1459
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:05.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like God really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really come on,</v>

1460
01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:07.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1461
01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:11.060
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1462
01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:11.894
<v Speaker 1>a single causal answers to complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and it's like all the tapping </v>

1463
01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:20.510
<v Speaker 1>there is that the person is playing an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual game.</v>

1464
01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:24.230
<v Speaker 1>That's all that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got this set of axioms.</v>

1465
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:27.440
<v Speaker 1>They've learned how to manipulate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like chess game basically,</v>

1466
01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:30.320
<v Speaker 1>and no matter what the problem is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you throw at them,</v>

1467
01:18:30.321 --> 01:18:32.810
<v Speaker 1>they can run them through the algorithm </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pop out announcer.</v>

1468
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:34.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1469
01:18:34.761 --> 01:18:36.050
<v Speaker 1>because for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1470
01:18:36.051 --> 01:18:38.900
<v Speaker 1>that question only sets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if he's right,</v>

1471
01:18:38.901 --> 01:18:39.734
<v Speaker 1>it only sets the problem back one step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay if government is the cause of </v>

1472
01:18:43.821 --> 01:18:45.290
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it isn't.</v>

1473
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:49.160
<v Speaker 1>It's an because of corruption and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the solution to corruption.</v>

1474
01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.113
<v Speaker 1>But if it is that because of corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then how come some places have more </v>

1475
01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:56.630
<v Speaker 1>government than others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no information in that</v>

1476
01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:57.464
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All there is is a rephrasing of the </v>

1477
01:18:58.821 --> 01:19:01.250
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like announcer,</v>

1478
01:19:01.251 --> 01:19:04.300
<v Speaker 1>it's got nothing to do with announcer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1479
01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.353
<v Speaker 1>and what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that really disturbs </v>

1480
01:19:06.681 --> 01:19:08.930
<v Speaker 1>me about modern university education is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1481
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:10.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quarter of the people who are in the </v>

1482
01:19:11.631 --> 01:19:14.780
<v Speaker 1>humanities and of the distribution are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being taught to think this way.</v>

1483
01:19:14.781 --> 01:19:15.561
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1484
01:19:15.561 --> 01:19:17.960
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a little rubric power.</v>

1485
01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:18.973
<v Speaker 1>That would be the postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 1>deconstructionist routine courtesy of </v>

1486
01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:24.134
<v Speaker 1>Derrida who was a Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you take his propositions and you </v>

1487
01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:29.264
<v Speaker 1>can apply them to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not helpful and it's not </v>

1488
01:19:31.191 --> 01:19:32.024
<v Speaker 1>thinking it doesn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just gives you the illusion of of </v>

1489
01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:36.980
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1490
01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:37.873
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1491
01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.333
<v Speaker 1>let me just take here now for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were talking about ideological </v>

1492
01:19:51.150 --> 01:19:52.680
<v Speaker 1>propositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1493
01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.581
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1494
01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:54.414
<v Speaker 1>So what seemed to happen once the slats </v>
<v Speaker 1>were knocked out of the assumption that </v>

1495
01:20:02.521 --> 01:20:05.400
<v Speaker 1>there were fundamental assumptions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could rely on.</v>

1496
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:06.263
<v Speaker 1>So let's say like the existence God and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your relationship to God was an </v>

1497
01:20:09.931 --> 01:20:10.764
<v Speaker 1>indication of the greater good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The greater good was an actual concrete </v>

1498
01:20:14.041 --> 01:20:14.874
<v Speaker 1>thing in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once the intellectual slacks were </v>

1499
01:20:18.331 --> 01:20:21.570
<v Speaker 1>knocked out from underneath that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then as Nietzsche pointed out,</v>

1500
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.260
<v Speaker 1>the power of organized religion started </v>
<v Speaker 1>to decline.</v>

1501
01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.153
<v Speaker 1>Now it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't declined as rapidly or as </v>

1502
01:20:28.561 --> 01:20:30.900
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly as everyone thought it might </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 20th century.</v>

1503
01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:31.763
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the Americans have a pretty </v>

1504
01:20:33.271 --> 01:20:34.104
<v Speaker 1>thriving Christianity on the right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course there's all sorts of </v>

1505
01:20:37.951 --> 01:20:39.600
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist movements all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1506
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:41.400
<v Speaker 1>But we'll just put that aside for now.</v>

1507
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:42.623
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have anything to do with the </v>

1508
01:20:45.601 --> 01:20:48.990
<v Speaker 1>main issue in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1509
01:20:48.991 --> 01:20:49.824
<v Speaker 1>So then what is the consequence of not </v>
<v Speaker 1>having the great cultural narratives </v>

1510
01:20:53.851 --> 01:20:55.080
<v Speaker 1>anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1511
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:58.710
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is everything's up in the air and no</v>

1512
01:20:58.711 --> 01:21:01.650
<v Speaker 1>one knows what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody has a question about every</v>

1513
01:21:01.651 --> 01:21:02.484
<v Speaker 1>single level of the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why are we doing this and what's </v>

1514
01:21:04.801 --> 01:21:07.260
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of life and should we bother</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing anything at all?</v>

1515
01:21:07.261 --> 01:21:09.690
<v Speaker 1>And Are we running around destroying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet and you know,</v>

1516
01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:12.300
<v Speaker 1>so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's chaotic.</v>

1517
01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:13.643
<v Speaker 1>And the other one is people just </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmute their religious beliefs into </v>

1518
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:17.663
<v Speaker 1>another kind of monotheistic explanation</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's based on some intellectual </v>

1519
01:21:21.691 --> 01:21:23.310
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so with the Marxists,</v>

1520
01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:24.420
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be,</v>

1521
01:21:24.710 --> 01:21:27.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic relationships with people.</v>

1522
01:21:27.211 --> 01:21:31.620
<v Speaker 1>For Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud was not an unsophisticated thing,</v>

1523
01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:34.620
<v Speaker 1>but he did try to boil everything down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sex and aggression,</v>

1524
01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.760
<v Speaker 1>mostly sex.</v>

1525
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.260
<v Speaker 1>And he had his reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1526
01:21:37.261 --> 01:21:37.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1527
01:21:37.741 --> 01:21:38.574
<v Speaker 1>without sex you don't propagate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Propagation is obviously necessary </v>

1528
01:21:41.401 --> 01:21:45.450
<v Speaker 1>for the continuation of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And therefore sexuality must be a main,</v>

1529
01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:49.020
<v Speaker 1>the main function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a powerful claim.</v>

1530
01:21:49.021 --> 01:21:52.140
<v Speaker 1>But we do know if you look at biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

1531
01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:54.540
<v Speaker 1>we know that your motivational systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>are disparate,</v>

1532
01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:57.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't seem to unite themselves into</v>

1533
01:21:57.961 --> 01:21:58.794
<v Speaker 1>a single motivational system except </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe at the level of the reticular </v>

1534
01:22:02.941 --> 01:22:05.550
<v Speaker 1>activating system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something like general arousal.</v>

1535
01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:09.360
<v Speaker 1>So Freud's wrong about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1536
01:22:09.361 --> 01:22:12.410
<v Speaker 1>but he was wrong in an interesting way </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think he was an idiot log.</v>

1537
01:22:12.450 --> 01:22:13.283
<v Speaker 1>But the point is is that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are multiple forms of meaning and </v>

1538
01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:20.130
<v Speaker 1>motivation and their implicit and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be organized.</v>

1539
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:22.530
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question is how do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize them?</v>

1540
01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:23.393
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a conspiracy theory of </v>

1541
01:22:27.181 --> 01:22:29.700
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Marxists for example,</v>

1542
01:22:29.701 --> 01:22:30.534
<v Speaker 1>or maybe like Freud even because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought religion was only a defense </v>

1543
01:22:33.211 --> 01:22:34.044
<v Speaker 1>against death anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you basically propose is that </v>

1544
01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:40.013
<v Speaker 1>the structures of society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our rules first and that the rules were </v>

1545
01:22:44.611 --> 01:22:49.530
<v Speaker 1>imposed on the society by either someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some group of people or something.</v>

1546
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:51.990
<v Speaker 1>So for Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's talking about religion,</v>

1547
01:22:51.991 --> 01:22:53.850
<v Speaker 1>he says religion is the opiate of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1548
01:22:53.851 --> 01:22:55.890
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

1549
01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:56.813
<v Speaker 1>allies itself with the capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests because it allows people to </v>

1550
01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:03.420
<v Speaker 1>justify their misery and the hope of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>eternal reward.</v>

1551
01:23:03.421 --> 01:23:04.254
<v Speaker 1>And so then they're not rattling up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole economic system and the top guys </v>

1552
01:23:06.851 --> 01:23:09.100
<v Speaker 1>can keep extracting value from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1553
01:23:09.101 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit,</v>

1554
01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:15.820
<v Speaker 1>but not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1555
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:16.953
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a law part of Bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of propositions about that that </v>

1556
01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:20.044
<v Speaker 1>are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1557
01:23:20.230 --> 01:23:21.063
<v Speaker 1>and this is goes back to the chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chimps are out there and their </v>

1558
01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:23.764
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy and they understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy and they behave in </v>

1559
01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:27.634
<v Speaker 1>accordance with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they following rules and answer to </v>

1560
01:23:30.161 --> 01:23:33.310
<v Speaker 1>that is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are not following rules.</v>

1561
01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:36.640
<v Speaker 1>What they are doing is manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior.</v>

1562
01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Now then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well did they think up those patterns of</v>

1563
01:23:40.391 --> 01:23:41.224
<v Speaker 1>behavior?</v>

1564
01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:42.333
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't think up those patterns of </v>

1565
01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:47.560
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the next question is,</v>

1566
01:23:47.561 --> 01:23:49.750
<v Speaker 1>cause they can't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

1567
01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.300
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next question is,</v>

1568
01:23:52.301 --> 01:23:53.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they didn't think the mop,</v>

1569
01:23:53.651 --> 01:23:56.170
<v Speaker 1>where the hell did they come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1570
01:23:56.171 --> 01:23:58.780
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting question to ask of</v>

1571
01:23:58.781 --> 01:24:01.000
<v Speaker 1>a of a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Bible for example,</v>

1572
01:24:01.001 --> 01:24:03.310
<v Speaker 1>which is so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bunch of books by the way.</v>

1573
01:24:03.311 --> 01:24:04.144
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that it's extraordinarily old </v>

1574
01:24:05.681 --> 01:24:07.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's been cobbled together over </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>

1575
01:24:07.901 --> 01:24:10.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like where did that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1576
01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.670
<v Speaker 1>it's an extraordinarily complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

1577
01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Obviously some people wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other people edited,</v>

1578
01:24:15.731 --> 01:24:16.564
<v Speaker 1>some other people put it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of different people sequenced </v>

1579
01:24:18.701 --> 01:24:20.560
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got modified over time.</v>

1580
01:24:20.561 --> 01:24:24.970
<v Speaker 1>It's full of cross references.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it emerged roughly speaking.</v>

1581
01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.313
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can show you a very interesting </v>

1582
01:24:27.791 --> 01:24:30.280
<v Speaker 1>visual demonstration of that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

1583
01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:33.323
<v Speaker 6>religion.</v>

1584
01:24:36.210 --> 01:24:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's late.</v>

1585
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:39.810
<v Speaker 1>I want to also explain what it's latent </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1586
01:24:40.230 --> 01:24:45.230
<v Speaker 1>That's because this is the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if there's a,</v>

1587
01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:49.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a claim that was basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought forth in the late teenagers,</v>

1588
01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:50.333
<v Speaker 1>late 18 hundreds it was formalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the systems that we use to </v>

1589
01:24:54.001 --> 01:24:58.080
<v Speaker 1>govern our morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our arbitrary and predicated on belief.</v>

1590
01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the proposition.</v>

1591
01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:02.453
<v Speaker 1>So the question and that's how it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of consequences and it's a </v>

1592
01:25:04.771 --> 01:25:07.290
<v Speaker 1>powerful proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

1593
01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.780
<v Speaker 1>is it a correct preposition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1594
01:25:10.290 --> 01:25:14.550
<v Speaker 1>so here's a little diagram here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's from Panksepp.</v>

1595
01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Jaak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jaak,</v>

1596
01:25:16.081 --> 01:25:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Panksepp the two top ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little rats.</v>

1597
01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll tell a story about rats.</v>

1598
01:25:19.591 --> 01:25:24.591
<v Speaker 1>This is quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So juvenile male rats are wired to play.</v>

1599
01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Now rats are in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1600
01:25:28.111 --> 01:25:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Because rats have a place circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a circuit.</v>

1601
01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:33.420
<v Speaker 1>We have it to dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Habit.</v>

1602
01:25:33.450 --> 01:25:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Mammals have it.</v>

1603
01:25:34.290 --> 01:25:35.123
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the zoo the other day and I </v>

1604
01:25:36.211 --> 01:25:39.720
<v Speaker 1>saw a rhinoceros playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch that for like 10 minutes.</v>

1605
01:25:39.721 --> 01:25:44.550
<v Speaker 1>It has this huge ball in its,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its compartment and the bloody thing was</v>

1606
01:25:44.551 --> 01:25:45.384
<v Speaker 1>like dancing around walloping this ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>with its huge horn and like it was </v>

1607
01:25:48.871 --> 01:25:50.220
<v Speaker 1>dancing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was playing.</v>

1608
01:25:50.221 --> 01:25:54.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like that was really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Playful Rhinoceros,</v>

1609
01:25:54.421 --> 01:25:55.254
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out there and play soccer with </v>

1610
01:25:56.521 --> 01:25:58.530
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you'd get crunched like in two</v>

1611
01:25:58.531 --> 01:26:00.420
<v Speaker 1>seconds flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1612
01:26:00.450 --> 01:26:03.060
<v Speaker 1>so play well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that relevant?</v>

1613
01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.640
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a cool thing.</v>

1614
01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:06.890
<v Speaker 1>I think this is like an earth shattering</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>

1615
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Panksepp is a very smart guy.</v>

1616
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:14.530
<v Speaker 1>So you take a juvenile rat and you put </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a an a player arena.</v>

1617
01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.153
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he throw another juvenile rat in </v>

1618
01:26:17.331 --> 01:26:19.760
<v Speaker 1>there and they wrestle around ames.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you separate them.</v>

1619
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Then the rat has figured out that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he can play.</v>

1620
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:26.120
<v Speaker 1>So the next thing you could do is figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out whether or not that route we'll work</v>

1621
01:26:26.150 --> 01:26:27.770
<v Speaker 1>to get into that arena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1622
01:26:27.771 --> 01:26:28.604
<v Speaker 1>So like will it pull levers to get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there because then you can infer that </v>

1623
01:26:31.401 --> 01:26:32.234
<v Speaker 1>the route would be happy to go in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause otherwise he wouldn't be pulling </v>

1624
01:26:34.291 --> 01:26:35.124
<v Speaker 1>the levers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1625
01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Straight behaviorism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except they wouldn't say happy.</v>

1626
01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:42.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like the rats pulling away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pop these out in a little play chambers.</v>

1627
01:26:42.261 --> 01:26:46.310
<v Speaker 1>So there's another rat there and let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that route is 10% bigger.</v>

1628
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Now the rats rough and tumble play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wrestle just like kids wrestle.</v>

1629
01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:52.573
<v Speaker 1>They wrestle weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're wrestling around having a fine </v>

1630
01:26:55.521 --> 01:26:58.040
<v Speaker 1>time of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not aggression.</v>

1631
01:26:59.330 --> 01:27:02.540
<v Speaker 1>It's different than aggression and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can easily see the difference.</v>

1632
01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Just like you can tell the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know my dog,</v>

1633
01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:06.933
<v Speaker 1>I'll play with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like kind of grabbed his paws and he </v>

1634
01:27:08.811 --> 01:27:10.880
<v Speaker 1>just goes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just has a short circuit.</v>

1635
01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.713
<v Speaker 1>He's growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hair is up and he's trying to bite </v>

1636
01:27:13.641 --> 01:27:15.620
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the only thing he ever does this hit</v>

1637
01:27:15.621 --> 01:27:16.850
<v Speaker 1>me with his teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1638
01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.130
<v Speaker 1>and it's a game he knows that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be able to,</v>

1639
01:27:19.131 --> 01:27:19.964
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to grab these for and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to bite me and so we do this and </v>

1640
01:27:22.551 --> 01:27:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you didn't know what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>

1641
01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:25.364
<v Speaker 1>you'd think the dog was going to tear me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pieces because it's roaring away and </v>

1642
01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:28.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's having a great time and I let </v>

1643
01:27:30.321 --> 01:27:31.154
<v Speaker 1>it nail me now and then and but it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing and now it's obvious that it's </v>

1644
01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:38.030
<v Speaker 1>playing and that's way different than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>being attacked by an angry dog.</v>

1645
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:39.103
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know there's a difference between </v>

1646
01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:42.020
<v Speaker 1>play aggression in real aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fine,</v>

1647
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:43.243
<v Speaker 1>you get the rats out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if one wrap is 10% bigger than the </v>

1648
01:27:46.351 --> 01:27:48.860
<v Speaker 1>other rat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that rat can win all the time.</v>

1649
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.903
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's an the weight differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and the size differences enough </v>

1650
01:27:52.161 --> 01:27:55.880
<v Speaker 1>so that the big rock can just pin this </v>
<v Speaker 1>small rat over and over and over.</v>

1651
01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:58.213
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what does a small rack think about </v>

1652
01:28:00.171 --> 01:28:01.640
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

1653
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:02.743
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go out there and they wrestle and </v>

1654
01:28:04.491 --> 01:28:06.920
<v Speaker 1>the big rat establishes dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wins,</v>

1655
01:28:06.921 --> 01:28:09.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you take them apart and then you</v>

1656
01:28:09.441 --> 01:28:12.020
<v Speaker 1>put them back together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that then the little</v>

1657
01:28:12.021 --> 01:28:12.854
<v Speaker 1>rat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's charged with inviting the big wrap </v>

1658
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:16.940
<v Speaker 1>to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's his role now.</v>

1659
01:28:16.941 --> 01:28:20.000
<v Speaker 1>So it goes up and does whatever rat does</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it wants to play.</v>

1660
01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Suspected does something like a dog does</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it wants to play.</v>

1661
01:28:22.641 --> 01:28:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Party puts its head down and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dances around.</v>

1662
01:28:25.371 --> 01:28:26.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1663
01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:26.963
<v Speaker 1>are you ready for this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the big rat jumps on him and </v>

1664
01:28:29.391 --> 01:28:30.080
<v Speaker 1>they roll around.</v>

1665
01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:35.080
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well let's say you do that over and over</v>

1666
01:28:35.211 --> 01:28:36.044
<v Speaker 1>and over because that's the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that something that happens once is not </v>

1667
01:28:40.131 --> 01:28:42.560
<v Speaker 1>the same thing as something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>iterates across time.</v>

1668
01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:47.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how rats play is,</v>

1669
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:48.283
<v Speaker 1>it's a completely different question if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they play once or if they play a long </v>

1670
01:28:50.721 --> 01:28:53.330
<v Speaker 1>time with the same partner cause and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's different rules.</v>

1671
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:54.343
<v Speaker 1>And so here's the emergent rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little rat won't play with the big </v>

1672
01:28:57.141 --> 01:28:57.974
<v Speaker 1>rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the big rat doesn't let him win 30% </v>

1673
01:29:00.021 --> 01:29:00.854
<v Speaker 1>of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big rat has to let the little rat </v>

1674
01:29:02.851 --> 01:29:06.540
<v Speaker 1>win 30% of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that's so cool.</v>

1675
01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:10.860
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool because what you see there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an emergent morality,</v>

1676
01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:11.991
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1677
01:29:11.991 --> 01:29:15.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not codafide in rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a,</v>

1678
01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:16.013
<v Speaker 1>there's a procedural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's our social proposition that </v>

1679
01:29:17.941 --> 01:29:18.720
<v Speaker 1>emerges there.</v>

1680
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.553
<v Speaker 1>And the social proposition is you got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the little guy win sometimes and </v>

1681
01:29:23.341 --> 01:29:24.510
<v Speaker 1>even rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1682
01:29:24.511 --> 01:29:26.220
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1683
01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.720
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's not a rule.</v>

1684
01:29:27.721 --> 01:29:30.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not handed down on high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

1685
01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:35.420
<v Speaker 1>It's an emergent consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction of two rats now.</v>

1686
01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>

1687
01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:39.450
<v Speaker 1>well there are some boys doing the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1688
01:29:39.570 --> 01:29:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now Panksepp has always also found other</v>

1689
01:29:41.671 --> 01:29:42.451
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's found,</v>

1690
01:29:42.451 --> 01:29:43.284
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you don't let rats play rough </v>

1691
01:29:45.841 --> 01:29:46.674
<v Speaker 1>and tumble play in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their prefrontal cortex is don't mature </v>

1692
01:29:51.690 --> 01:29:52.523
<v Speaker 1>and they get hyperactive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can treat that in routes with </v>

1693
01:29:55.171 --> 01:29:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Ritalin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1694
01:29:58.290 --> 01:29:59.123
<v Speaker 1>So you know Panksepp's hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an extraordinarily </v>

1695
01:30:02.191 --> 01:30:03.024
<v Speaker 1>credible hypothesis is that the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>boys in particular hyperactive is </v>

1696
01:30:06.061 --> 01:30:06.894
<v Speaker 1>because they're not playing enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can fix that with Ritalin </v>

1697
01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:13.290
<v Speaker 1>instead of letting them play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you do if you're gonna let them</v>

1698
01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:15.240
<v Speaker 1>plays you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watched the man,</v>

1699
01:30:15.241 --> 01:30:18.450
<v Speaker 1>they're going to like play and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get a bit too rough and</v>

1700
01:30:18.451 --> 01:30:19.290
<v Speaker 1>then you stop them.</v>

1701
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:20.730
<v Speaker 1>You say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1702
01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:23.910
<v Speaker 1>if you play like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game won't continue.</v>

1703
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:25.103
<v Speaker 1>That's like a first part of moral rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to play each game in a manner </v>

1704
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:32.550
<v Speaker 1>that lets the repetition of those games </v>
<v Speaker 1>occur.</v>

1705
01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.400
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why you would have to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good sport,</v>

1706
01:30:35.401 --> 01:30:36.390
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1707
01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Be a good sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1708
01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:39.630
<v Speaker 1>What if I can win?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1709
01:30:39.631 --> 01:30:40.464
<v Speaker 1>the question is what does weird mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does win mean you win this game or does </v>

1710
01:30:46.501 --> 01:30:47.334
<v Speaker 1>win mean that you play this game in such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way so that the probability that </v>

1711
01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:54.240
<v Speaker 1>you'll get invited to play more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>games as you mature increases.</v>

1712
01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:57.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's two games at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1713
01:30:57.690 --> 01:31:02.070
<v Speaker 1>There's the game and the metagame and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're telling a child when you say</v>

1714
01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:03.743
<v Speaker 1>be a good sport is you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know this because you're </v>

1715
01:31:07.411 --> 01:31:08.244
<v Speaker 1>not smart enough and you know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell do you know about Metta Games and </v>

1716
01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:12.000
<v Speaker 1>so on and so forth.</v>

1717
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.590
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well be a good sport.</v>

1718
01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1719
01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:18.930
<v Speaker 1>cause that's how to play properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollow explanation.</v>

1720
01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:20.093
<v Speaker 1>But the answer is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and maybe a parent will say this </v>

1721
01:31:23.401 --> 01:31:24.960
<v Speaker 1>cause other kids won't want to play with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1722
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:26.430
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a reason.</v>

1723
01:31:26.490 --> 01:31:28.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's getting somewhere with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>

1724
01:31:28.710 --> 01:31:30.720
<v Speaker 1>You might have to say why and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1725
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:34.020
<v Speaker 1>you decompose it and the kid will </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably know how to ask anyways.</v>

1726
01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:34.854
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is is that there's a </v>

1727
01:31:37.441 --> 01:31:39.690
<v Speaker 1>higher moral principle at stake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

1728
01:31:39.691 --> 01:31:40.524
<v Speaker 1>well why is it higher?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things he might ask </v>

1729
01:31:42.511 --> 01:31:43.344
<v Speaker 1>yourself is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are some moral propositions higher than </v>

1730
01:31:46.321 --> 01:31:48.180
<v Speaker 1>other moral propositions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1731
01:31:48.181 --> 01:31:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Which is an anti relativist claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1732
01:31:51.841 --> 01:31:53.760
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only a binary answer to that.</v>

1733
01:31:54.090 --> 01:31:54.923
<v Speaker 1>The answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some values are higher than others or </v>

1734
01:31:57.331 --> 01:31:58.260
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

1735
01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:02.320
<v Speaker 1>No means the hierarchy is flat and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be organized.</v>

1736
01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes means either that the ordering is </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary and tyrannical or that there's</v>

1737
01:32:10.781 --> 01:32:11.614
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's some other process at work </v>

1738
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:14.103
<v Speaker 1>that has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that applies across wide ranges of </v>

1739
01:32:17.801 --> 01:32:20.380
<v Speaker 1>contexts and situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1740
01:32:22.330 --> 01:32:23.163
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Kuhn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who studied the structure of scientific </v>

1741
01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:28.730
<v Speaker 1>revolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said his art,</v>

1742
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:29.583
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never really figured out whether he </v>

1743
01:32:30.551 --> 01:32:33.630
<v Speaker 1>was a relativist or a phd and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda,</v>

1744
01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:36.963
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1745
01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:37.843
<v Speaker 1>wishy washy on the topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what Kuhn basically said with </v>

1746
01:32:40.251 --> 01:32:41.084
<v Speaker 1>something like</v>

1747
01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:44.233
<v Speaker 1>science is a hierarchy and now and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>a revolution takes place at the highest </v>

1748
01:32:46.581 --> 01:32:47.414
<v Speaker 1>level of abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And usually that happens when there's a </v>

1749
01:32:50.121 --> 01:32:53.630
<v Speaker 1>theory and it's being applied to explain</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

1750
01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:56.090
<v Speaker 1>And there's an anomaly that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain.</v>

1751
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:57.920
<v Speaker 1>And for a while you can just ignore </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1752
01:32:57.921 --> 01:32:58.754
<v Speaker 1>And normally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it gets more and more annoying </v>

1753
01:33:00.591 --> 01:33:04.850
<v Speaker 1>and aggravating and takes full stage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't explain it in.</v>

1754
01:33:04.851 --> 01:33:08.300
<v Speaker 1>That means there's something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your damn theory and then poof,</v>

1755
01:33:08.301 --> 01:33:12.950
<v Speaker 1>someone comes along with another theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>which explains that a normally now Kuvan</v>

1756
01:33:12.951 --> 01:33:13.784
<v Speaker 1>was never sure if the new theory was </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than the old theory or what </v>

1757
01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:20.330
<v Speaker 1>better meant or if it was just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement for the old theory,</v>

1758
01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:25.070
<v Speaker 1>it was like to Olay didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tool b works in this situation.</v>

1759
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Now what Piaget said though was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was talking about revolutions of</v>

1760
01:33:29.331 --> 01:33:31.550
<v Speaker 1>the same type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that'd be the stage transformation.</v>

1761
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.971
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1762
01:33:31.971 --> 01:33:32.804
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1763
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:34.303
<v Speaker 1>There's a rule for better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rule is the new paradigm accounts </v>

1764
01:33:41.511 --> 01:33:42.344
<v Speaker 1>for everything the other paradigm did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus it accounts for some other things </v>

1765
01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.473
<v Speaker 1>and so why is it better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While there's a definition of better </v>

1766
01:33:49.401 --> 01:33:50.234
<v Speaker 1>that's implicit in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so imagine that you knew something </v>

1767
01:33:52.521 --> 01:33:54.650
<v Speaker 1>and it was only good one place at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1768
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:55.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

1769
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:56.263
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you replace that with another </v>

1770
01:33:58.341 --> 01:34:01.280
<v Speaker 1>thing you knew and it was good in three </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

1771
01:34:01.281 --> 01:34:02.720
<v Speaker 1>At three different times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1772
01:34:02.721 --> 01:34:04.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of those are you going to use?</v>

1773
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:06.530
<v Speaker 1>All other things being equal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1774
01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Why not use the one that works in more </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations?</v>

1775
01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:10.550
<v Speaker 1>And so we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1776
01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:14.930
<v Speaker 1>our moral principle is super ordinate to</v>
<v Speaker 1>another moral principle.</v>

1777
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.943
<v Speaker 1>If the superordinate principle works to </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate the same man's across longer </v>

1778
01:34:22.251 --> 01:34:26.570
<v Speaker 1>spans of time with more people.</v>

1779
01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:28.850
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1780
01:34:28.851 --> 01:34:29.684
<v Speaker 1>how should you play a game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is what are you doing </v>

1781
01:34:32.811 --> 01:34:33.644
<v Speaker 1>while you're playing a game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one answer is you're trying to win </v>

1782
01:34:36.141 --> 01:34:38.780
<v Speaker 1>that game in other answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to play that game.</v>

1783
01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:39.883
<v Speaker 1>Another answer is you're engaged in </v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing emotive playing that will </v>

1784
01:34:43.101 --> 01:34:46.130
<v Speaker 1>enable you to play many games in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations successfully.</v>

1785
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:47.323
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1786
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:49.190
<v Speaker 1>which of those is most important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1787
01:34:49.191 --> 01:34:50.750
<v Speaker 1>it's obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is most important.</v>

1788
01:34:51.230 --> 01:34:55.220
<v Speaker 1>If the game is worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you propose.</v>

1789
01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:57.860
<v Speaker 1>If you play it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've agreed to that.</v>

1790
01:34:58.670 --> 01:34:59.503
<v Speaker 1>Then obviously playing in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>enables you to play more games of that </v>

1791
01:35:02.391 --> 01:35:03.224
<v Speaker 1>type better is better end of problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you can think that through and </v>

1792
01:35:08.121 --> 01:35:09.860
<v Speaker 1>see if there's any flaws in the logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1793
01:35:13.210 --> 01:35:14.043
<v Speaker 1>but people have been thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for about a hundred years and I think </v>

1794
01:35:16.061 --> 01:35:20.350
<v Speaker 1>that's about as far as it's got and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see up off whole in that.</v>

1795
01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:22.360
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1796
01:35:22.361 --> 01:35:25.030
<v Speaker 1>so the boys are playing now you make me </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1797
01:35:25.031 --> 01:35:27.370
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing when they're playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play.</v>

1798
01:35:27.670 --> 01:35:28.503
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I have played with kids that </v>

1799
01:35:29.621 --> 01:35:30.454
<v Speaker 1>haven't had any rough and tumble play </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really hard to play with them </v>

1800
01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:37.360
<v Speaker 1>partly because they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're easily frightened,</v>

1801
01:35:37.630 --> 01:35:38.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd like to play.</v>

1802
01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.470
<v Speaker 1>I know how to play with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd liked to play.</v>

1803
01:35:41.471 --> 01:35:43.030
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty hepped up on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1804
01:35:43.031 --> 01:35:44.470
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really excited,</v>

1805
01:35:44.471 --> 01:35:47.920
<v Speaker 1>especially about physical play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're awkward,</v>

1806
01:35:47.921 --> 01:35:49.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you play with them,</v>

1807
01:35:49.001 --> 01:35:51.460
<v Speaker 1>they stick their thumb in your eye or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1808
01:35:51.461 --> 01:35:52.294
<v Speaker 1>or they cry really easily when nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>really happens and like they just don't </v>

1809
01:35:56.201 --> 01:35:57.370
<v Speaker 1>have it together.</v>

1810
01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:01.210
<v Speaker 1>A kid that has done a lot of physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction,</v>

1811
01:36:01.211 --> 01:36:03.550
<v Speaker 1>physical play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kid,</v>

1812
01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:06.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a different sort of kid because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing the kid knows,</v>

1813
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:07.383
<v Speaker 1>it's not a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing the kid knows is how </v>

1814
01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:12.093
<v Speaker 1>forceful can he be with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that it's exciting and interesting </v>

1815
01:36:15.911 --> 01:36:18.280
<v Speaker 1>and fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not too much.</v>

1816
01:36:18.370 --> 01:36:22.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's really an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>question name because actually to really</v>

1817
01:36:22.361 --> 01:36:25.240
<v Speaker 1>play a good game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a physical contact game,</v>

1818
01:36:25.241 --> 01:36:26.074
<v Speaker 1>like wrestling with a kid is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to let that kid come right up to </v>

1819
01:36:29.621 --> 01:36:33.340
<v Speaker 1>the edge of hurting you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the closer the kid gets to the edge,</v>

1820
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:36.130
<v Speaker 1>the more fun it is for both because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid will give you a whack and go,</v>

1821
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:37.840
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1822
01:36:38.050 --> 01:36:38.940
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1823
01:36:38.941 --> 01:36:39.761
<v Speaker 1>it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1824
01:36:39.761 --> 01:36:42.340
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe he'll give you a harder </v>
<v Speaker 1>whack to see if he can get away with it.</v>

1825
01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:44.050
<v Speaker 1>And kids will often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come up to you,</v>

1826
01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.740
<v Speaker 1>whack you and then run away and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll look and if you're laughing then</v>

1827
01:36:47.741 --> 01:36:49.450
<v Speaker 1>they'll come back and try a harder one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1828
01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it incrementally because </v>

1829
01:36:51.671 --> 01:36:54.880
<v Speaker 1>it's exploratory behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the exploration is,</v>

1830
01:36:55.150 --> 01:36:58.120
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what our bodies like.</v>

1831
01:36:58.970 --> 01:37:02.770
<v Speaker 1>And the answer that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what can you get away with doing to</v>

1832
01:37:02.771 --> 01:37:03.604
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a more sophisticated answer to </v>

1833
01:37:05.411 --> 01:37:06.244
<v Speaker 1>which is what can you get away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing to them in a way that allows you </v>

1834
01:37:10.391 --> 01:37:15.391
<v Speaker 1>to continue to explore without fear or </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment and without blowing the whole</v>

1835
01:37:15.671 --> 01:37:17.050
<v Speaker 1>game to bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1836
01:37:17.051 --> 01:37:17.884
<v Speaker 1>so how do you figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do not talk about it cause you </v>

1837
01:37:21.071 --> 01:37:22.870
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to act it out.</v>

1838
01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:26.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the kids hitting you in wrestling and</v>

1839
01:37:26.201 --> 01:37:29.230
<v Speaker 1>pulling your hair and doing all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and you're modifying its behavior</v>

1840
01:37:29.231 --> 01:37:30.490
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very carefully and,</v>

1841
01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:33.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in my minuscule detail.</v>

1842
01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:36.130
<v Speaker 1>And then you get a kid who can like </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestle like mad and they're fun to play</v>

1843
01:37:36.131 --> 01:37:38.060
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bounced around like a dog that will</v>

1844
01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.110
<v Speaker 1>bite you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know a good well trained dog you can</v>

1845
01:37:41.111 --> 01:37:44.380
<v Speaker 1>really play with and you can play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them rough and it's a blast.</v>

1846
01:37:44.381 --> 01:37:46.510
<v Speaker 1>The dog has a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person has a good time.</v>

1847
01:37:46.511 --> 01:37:49.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a socialized dog.</v>

1848
01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:50.313
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1849
01:37:51.810 --> 01:37:54.510
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that kids learn learns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite cool,</v>

1850
01:37:54.511 --> 01:37:55.344
<v Speaker 1>is what hurts them and what doesn't and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how afraid can they be and still have </v>

1851
01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:01.770
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1852
01:38:01.771 --> 01:38:03.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're wrestling with the kid,</v>

1853
01:38:03.631 --> 01:38:04.560
<v Speaker 1>you've put them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1854
01:38:04.561 --> 01:38:07.030
<v Speaker 1>you put them face down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put your elbow on Mia,</v>

1855
01:38:07.450 --> 01:38:08.283
<v Speaker 1>bend them around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you throw them in the air and catch </v>

1856
01:38:09.901 --> 01:38:10.740
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1857
01:38:10.741 --> 01:38:13.590
<v Speaker 1>you've grabbed her by the leg and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you pull them over and you know,</v>

1858
01:38:13.591 --> 01:38:14.424
<v Speaker 1>and what you're showing the kid is </v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a bunch of things that your body </v>

1859
01:38:17.011 --> 01:38:19.170
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's okay that they're,</v>

1860
01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:20.093
<v Speaker 1>they're being done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it isn't going to hurt you and </v>

1861
01:38:22.710 --> 01:38:24.480
<v Speaker 1>you're not talking about you're showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1862
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:25.583
<v Speaker 1>And so the kid gets kind of confident </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what he or she can withstand </v>

1863
01:38:30.721 --> 01:38:31.554
<v Speaker 1>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the difference between pain and not </v>

1864
01:38:34.561 --> 01:38:35.394
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the difference between fear and not </v>

1865
01:38:37.981 --> 01:38:38.310
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>

1866
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:41.940
<v Speaker 1>And when something's threatening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's not very sophisticated,</v>

1867
01:38:42.150 --> 01:38:46.800
<v Speaker 1>it's very sophisticated behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why kids love to play.</v>

1868
01:38:47.190 --> 01:38:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's happened,</v>

1869
01:38:48.571 --> 01:38:49.404
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1870
01:38:49.410 --> 01:38:50.243
<v Speaker 1>an indication of a deep sickness in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society is that I used to work in a </v>

1871
01:38:53.911 --> 01:38:58.530
<v Speaker 1>daycare center right when I was about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your age because I really liked kids and</v>

1872
01:38:58.531 --> 01:39:00.840
<v Speaker 1>they like to play with me because I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to play with them.</v>

1873
01:39:00.841 --> 01:39:01.674
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I would do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little kids was I would draw them </v>

1874
01:39:04.861 --> 01:39:06.330
<v Speaker 1>horrible monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1875
01:39:06.331 --> 01:39:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Like big teeth things on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sketched them out.</v>

1876
01:39:09.211 --> 01:39:10.560
<v Speaker 1>They weren't any works of art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1877
01:39:10.561 --> 01:39:13.230
<v Speaker 1>But those damn kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would line up to get a picture of a</v>

1878
01:39:13.231 --> 01:39:15.180
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw me a picture of the monster,</v>

1879
01:39:15.181 --> 01:39:16.014
<v Speaker 1>draw me a picture of a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they love those little </v>

1880
01:39:17.731 --> 01:39:18.780
<v Speaker 1>pictures of monsters.</v>

1881
01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:19.993
<v Speaker 1>So then I was pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing I would do is play </v>

1882
01:39:21.961 --> 01:39:22.651
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1883
01:39:22.651 --> 01:39:23.484
<v Speaker 1>I'd take him out in the yard and grab an</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm and a leg and spin them around and </v>

1884
01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:29.180
<v Speaker 1>bend them over and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twist them around,</v>

1885
01:39:29.190 --> 01:39:30.390
<v Speaker 1>let them crawl on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1886
01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:31.753
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always one kid in the group who </v>

1887
01:39:33.931 --> 01:39:35.160
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

1888
01:39:35.850 --> 01:39:37.770
<v Speaker 1>he hadn't been paid attention to enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1889
01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:38.604
<v Speaker 1>so he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's like a Taoist uncarved </v>

1890
01:39:40.561 --> 01:39:41.394
<v Speaker 1>block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very vague and ill defined and clunky </v>

1891
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.890
<v Speaker 1>and so kid like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1892
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:47.783
<v Speaker 1>you'd sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so sad you sit down and you're </v>

1893
01:39:49.921 --> 01:39:53.100
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the kids and that kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes along sort of lumping along,</v>

1894
01:39:53.101 --> 01:39:56.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this and they plop plop on your lap</v>

1895
01:39:56.671 --> 01:39:59.490
<v Speaker 1>and they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're about as sophisticated as like a</v>

1896
01:39:59.491 --> 01:40:00.690
<v Speaker 1>six month old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1897
01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:02.730
<v Speaker 1>and they're quite annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1898
01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:03.593
<v Speaker 1>which is a horrible thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so desperate for attention and </v>

1899
01:40:05.971 --> 01:40:06.600
<v Speaker 1>it's too late.</v>

1900
01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Often by the time they're four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1901
01:40:08.610 --> 01:40:11.370
<v Speaker 1>good luck fixing that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to happen.</v>

1902
01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:12.533
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those kids are just screwed because </v>

1903
01:40:14.071 --> 01:40:17.250
<v Speaker 1>what happens to them is they're so lumpy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ill formed and,</v>

1904
01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:18.353
<v Speaker 1>and uncomfortable in their body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>socially clueless and inattentive and </v>

1905
01:40:21.421 --> 01:40:25.920
<v Speaker 1>blind and ignored and resentful that no </v>
<v Speaker 1>other kids would play with them.</v>

1906
01:40:26.690 --> 01:40:27.523
<v Speaker 1>And it's no wonder because the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids are way the hell up on the play </v>

1907
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:32.820
<v Speaker 1>development trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so their board staffed by them,</v>

1908
01:40:33.090 --> 01:40:36.150
<v Speaker 1>it's like playing with a nine month old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which kids will do,</v>

1909
01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:38.760
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not pure play.</v>

1910
01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And so those kids just drift off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>

1911
01:40:42.481 --> 01:40:45.840
<v Speaker 1>they stay on the outside of the peer </v>
<v Speaker 1>group and they never get into it.</v>

1912
01:40:46.650 --> 01:40:49.560
<v Speaker 1>They never get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So very,</v>

1913
01:40:49.561 --> 01:40:51.690
<v Speaker 1>very ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now in daycare centers,</v>

1914
01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 1>you can't touch the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1915
01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:56.920
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1916
01:40:56.921 --> 01:40:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1917
01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:58.533
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he can't distinguish play for </v>

1918
01:40:59.621 --> 01:41:01.870
<v Speaker 1>molesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like who can't distinguish that?</v>

1919
01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.880
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what are you going to do?</v>

1920
01:41:03.881 --> 01:41:06.910
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to deprive the kids of play</v>

1921
01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.940
<v Speaker 1>because of your stupid paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole,</v>

1922
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.680
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1923
01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>

1924
01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:15.333
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're doing is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching children that adults are so </v>

1925
01:41:18.281 --> 01:41:20.620
<v Speaker 1>dangerous that they can't be trusted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be near you.</v>

1926
01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:21.843
<v Speaker 1>That's a lovely thing to teach children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because they're gonna be </v>

1927
01:41:23.831 --> 01:41:25.270
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1928
01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:36.613
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's competent Satori.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a different level of </v>

1929
01:41:39.411 --> 01:41:42.020
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to talk about that next.</v>

1930
01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the rats even routes need play,</v>

1931
01:41:46.701 --> 01:41:47.534
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's are smart enough to figure </v>

1932
01:41:48.441 --> 01:41:50.270
<v Speaker 1>out that the little guy has to win </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

1933
01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:51.433
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1934
01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:54.863
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1935
01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:59.420
<v Speaker 1>here's what happens with chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is quite cool.</v>

1936
01:41:59.421 --> 01:42:03.410
<v Speaker 1>So the little male chimps in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because chimps are very aggressive,</v>

1937
01:42:03.710 --> 01:42:07.910
<v Speaker 1>they do a lot of playing and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things they do is tease the older males.</v>

1938
01:42:07.911 --> 01:42:11.810
<v Speaker 1>So maybe the older males like having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>snooze under a tree and like the,</v>

1939
01:42:12.130 --> 01:42:12.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young chimps have come up and like </v>

1940
01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:17.720
<v Speaker 1>poking with a stick or tickle them or </v>
<v Speaker 1>poke them and runaway and so,</v>

1941
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:20.330
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to see what they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get away with.</v>

1942
01:42:20.690 --> 01:42:21.523
<v Speaker 1>And that's dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy challenge in its childhood </v>

1943
01:42:23.031 --> 01:42:23.864
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can be a game if it's done </v>

1944
01:42:24.681 --> 01:42:25.790
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a gate.</v>

1945
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.923
<v Speaker 1>If it's not done properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insubordination and its aggression </v>

1946
01:42:29.690 --> 01:42:31.190
<v Speaker 1>and then something's actually gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

1947
01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a story about that.</v>

1948
01:42:32.991 --> 01:42:37.790
<v Speaker 1>So one time I was in Montreal and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived in a pretty poor area of Montreal.</v>

1949
01:42:38.170 --> 01:42:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was like a historically poor,</v>

1950
01:42:40.191 --> 01:42:41.024
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a slum or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a very on the low end of the </v>

1951
01:42:45.601 --> 01:42:48.660
<v Speaker 1>working class neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and uh,</v>

1952
01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.153
<v Speaker 1>cross the alley about two houses down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this house where things </v>

1953
01:42:55.411 --> 01:42:56.880
<v Speaker 1>weren't going on that we're good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1954
01:42:56.881 --> 01:42:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was a crack house or </v>
<v Speaker 1>some damn thing,</v>

1955
01:42:58.891 --> 01:42:59.724
<v Speaker 1>but there were people in and out of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time and there was a lot of </v>

1956
01:43:01.981 --> 01:43:04.530
<v Speaker 1>drinking beer and which is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>

1957
01:43:04.770 --> 01:43:06.480
<v Speaker 1>it was like antisocial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1958
01:43:06.481 --> 01:43:08.250
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't fun party.</v>

1959
01:43:08.251 --> 01:43:09.660
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1960
01:43:11.070 --> 01:43:13.860
<v Speaker 1>corrupt biker Weirdos and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1961
01:43:13.861 --> 01:43:14.694
<v Speaker 1>And there was a little kid there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was about three and I could kind of </v>

1962
01:43:18.001 --> 01:43:20.190
<v Speaker 1>kept an eye on that kid and he was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappy kid.</v>

1963
01:43:20.191 --> 01:43:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Like he was already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a contempt,</v>

1964
01:43:22.681 --> 01:43:24.900
<v Speaker 1>resentment face pretty well developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

1965
01:43:25.230 --> 01:43:29.730
<v Speaker 1>And so one day I was out in the back </v>
<v Speaker 1>alley and I was building this fence.</v>

1966
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:31.320
<v Speaker 1>You guys are going to fence in my yard </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1967
01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:32.153
<v Speaker 1>And so then this little kid came up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he came up with a bunch of his little </v>

1968
01:43:34.801 --> 01:43:35.700
<v Speaker 1>cronies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1969
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.770
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching them,</v>

1970
01:43:37.771 --> 01:43:39.960
<v Speaker 1>they're watching me with like hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

1971
01:43:39.961 --> 01:43:41.880
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1972
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:43.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was looking at one of the kids and </v>

1973
01:43:44.401 --> 01:43:46.890
<v Speaker 1>they were watching me hammer and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>motioned to the kid,</v>

1974
01:43:46.891 --> 01:43:47.724
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to,</v>

1975
01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't speak to him cause he spoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>cave quad and it was like [inaudible],</v>

1976
01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:53.930
<v Speaker 1>which I can't speak French very well at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1977
01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:55.660
<v Speaker 1>And jewel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real is ul.</v>

1978
01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:56.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1979
01:43:56.691 --> 01:43:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't even hear what the hell that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1980
01:43:58.941 --> 01:44:00.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1981
01:44:01.450 --> 01:44:02.780
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I motioned to the kid,</v>

1982
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want a hammer.</v>

1983
01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:06.920
<v Speaker 1>And so he comes up and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said in French,</v>

1984
01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:10.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to steal this and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was tugging on it and I thought,</v>

1985
01:44:11.210 --> 01:44:12.080
<v Speaker 1>well that's pretty weird.</v>

1986
01:44:12.170 --> 01:44:14.870
<v Speaker 1>So if he was looking at me mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to take this,</v>

1987
01:44:14.871 --> 01:44:15.950
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stealing this.</v>

1988
01:44:16.290 --> 01:44:16.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1989
01:44:16.791 --> 01:44:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give it to you if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to steal it.</v>

1990
01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:19.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was fine.</v>

1991
01:44:19.971 --> 01:44:22.060
<v Speaker 1>So I said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I kept hammering.</v>

1992
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.903
<v Speaker 1>They were all watching and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>stepped about 15 feet back and he ran </v>

1993
01:44:30.561 --> 01:44:33.740
<v Speaker 1>right over the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like running on it,</v>

1994
01:44:33.741 --> 01:44:34.580
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

1995
01:44:34.581 --> 01:44:35.960
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty damn interesting.</v>

1996
01:44:35.961 --> 01:44:37.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of golf or a three year old</v>

1997
01:44:37.881 --> 01:44:38.714
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1998
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:40.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was provocative,</v>

1999
01:44:40.251 --> 01:44:41.084
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was dominance provocation and it </v>

2000
01:44:43.131 --> 01:44:45.230
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a game because he didn't know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play a game.</v>

2001
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:48.560
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know how to play a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just knew like outright aggression.</v>

2002
01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:51.380
<v Speaker 1>So he ran over this fence and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>stood there and looked at me,</v>

2003
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:52.580
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2004
01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:56.030
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly what I did.</v>

2005
01:44:56.031 --> 01:44:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was just watching him.</v>

2006
01:44:57.591 --> 01:44:59.360
<v Speaker 1>I eventually finished the fence and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>it away,</v>

2007
01:44:59.361 --> 01:45:00.194
<v Speaker 1>but I thought that kids headed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison just as certainly as as a rock </v>

2008
01:45:03.501 --> 01:45:04.700
<v Speaker 1>falls to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2009
01:45:04.730 --> 01:45:08.690
<v Speaker 1>and I know the antisocial literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you're antisocial at four,</v>

2010
01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:10.363
<v Speaker 1>good luck to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't much that can be done about </v>

2011
01:45:12.081 --> 01:45:12.914
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so ruined by that point already </v>

2012
01:45:13.941 --> 01:45:15.230
<v Speaker 1>that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2013
01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:19.400
<v Speaker 1>it would have taken me if I would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to that kid,</v>

2014
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:20.263
<v Speaker 1>I probably would had to fight with him </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonstop for three months to straighten </v>

2015
01:45:25.281 --> 01:45:27.050
<v Speaker 1>him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wouldn't have been pretty,</v>

2016
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:28.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was already,</v>

2017
01:45:28.851 --> 01:45:29.684
<v Speaker 1>he hated adults already and they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought they were contemptible and </v>

2018
01:45:33.051 --> 01:45:33.884
<v Speaker 1>useless and that he could prevail over </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and that they were erratic and you </v>

2019
01:45:36.231 --> 01:45:39.290
<v Speaker 1>couldn't trust them to punish or reward </v>
<v Speaker 1>or to pay attention.</v>

2020
01:45:39.291 --> 01:45:42.170
<v Speaker 1>And there was no such thing as real </v>
<v Speaker 1>social rules and you know,</v>

2021
01:45:42.171 --> 01:45:44.090
<v Speaker 1>power dominated everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2022
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:45.800
<v Speaker 1>and that was all in him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2023
01:45:45.801 --> 01:45:46.790
<v Speaker 1>It was built into them.</v>

2024
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:52.550
<v Speaker 1>They were mostly watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2025
01:45:52.730 --> 01:45:53.563
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what sort of peer </v>

2026
01:45:54.441 --> 01:45:56.390
<v Speaker 1>interactions they would have had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2027
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:57.343
<v Speaker 1>but as far as I could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes the more aggressive </v>

2028
01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:01.754
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do form gangs and the gang is </v>

2029
01:46:03.441 --> 01:46:05.690
<v Speaker 1>actually there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a functional unit.</v>

2030
01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.300
<v Speaker 1>There is some social interaction only </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the gang.</v>

2031
01:46:08.301 --> 01:46:09.134
<v Speaker 1>Generally it's like a tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are the more socialized </v>

2032
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:16.980
<v Speaker 1>antisocial guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of the kids are so antisocial,</v>

2033
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.500
<v Speaker 1>they can't even work with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A gang.</v>

2034
01:46:18.501 --> 01:46:20.750
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know exactly where he was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spectrum,</v>

2035
01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:23.180
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his behavior was,</v>

2036
01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:24.750
<v Speaker 1>it was already criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2037
01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:28.040
<v Speaker 1>it was just kid criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

2038
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:29.990
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2039
01:46:30.170 --> 01:46:33.320
<v Speaker 1>So some things I should tell you about </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps too,</v>

2040
01:46:33.321 --> 01:46:34.154
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you kind of think of the top chimp </v>

2041
01:46:35.210 --> 01:46:36.620
<v Speaker 1>like a cave man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2042
01:46:36.621 --> 01:46:38.480
<v Speaker 1>the tough caveman with a big club.</v>

2043
01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:41.630
<v Speaker 1>And so it's the tough chimp that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominates the hierarchy and it's sort of</v>

2044
01:46:41.631 --> 01:46:45.410
<v Speaker 1>like the tyranny theory of male </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies.</v>

2045
01:46:45.411 --> 01:46:47.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the strongest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meanest chimp that wins.</v>

2046
01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Frans de Waal has been studying chimps </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and he's found it.</v>

2047
01:46:51.901 --> 01:46:53.490
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not true.</v>

2048
01:46:53.610 --> 01:46:55.980
<v Speaker 1>What he found was what piaget would </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest,</v>

2049
01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:56.873
<v Speaker 1>which is that the chimps that only use </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression and dominance form </v>

2050
01:47:00.931 --> 01:47:04.050
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies that are unstable and prone </v>
<v Speaker 1>to revolution.</v>

2051
01:47:04.650 --> 01:47:06.360
<v Speaker 1>So he tells one story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2052
01:47:06.361 --> 01:47:08.480
<v Speaker 1>of this chimp that climb to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was,</v>

2053
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the Arnhem Zoo and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like brutal champ.</v>

2054
01:47:12.391 --> 01:47:14.420
<v Speaker 1>And he was a big tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2055
01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:19.590
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't very good at consolidating</v>
<v Speaker 1>his social relationships,</v>

2056
01:47:19.591 --> 01:47:22.710
<v Speaker 1>say with other male chimps or with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>females.</v>

2057
01:47:23.190 --> 01:47:24.870
<v Speaker 1>So cause he was too brutal for any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2058
01:47:24.871 --> 01:47:25.704
<v Speaker 1>So we didn't engage in a lot of mutual </v>
<v Speaker 1>grooming say with other males because </v>

2059
01:47:28.231 --> 01:47:31.710
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you see in the chimps </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the chimp males fight a lot,</v>

2060
01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:34.530
<v Speaker 1>but they also groom each other a lot.</v>

2061
01:47:34.530 --> 01:47:35.520
<v Speaker 1>So their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

2062
01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:38.190
<v Speaker 1>their relationship is more fractious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>

2063
01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.400
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and also more cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite cool.</v>

2064
01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:42.353
<v Speaker 1>But he had forgotten most of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't pay much attention to the </v>

2065
01:47:44.041 --> 01:47:46.950
<v Speaker 1>females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened was that the two second</v>

2066
01:47:46.951 --> 01:47:49.590
<v Speaker 1>order chimps jumped in one day and torn </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bits.</v>

2067
01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:53.310
<v Speaker 1>So that was the end of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was brutal,</v>

2068
01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:54.330
<v Speaker 1>brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal.</v>

2069
01:47:54.331 --> 01:47:56.130
<v Speaker 1>I think they castrated them with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth,</v>

2070
01:47:56.131 --> 01:47:58.290
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And torn to shreds.</v>

2071
01:47:58.650 --> 01:47:59.483
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the troop was really </v>

2072
01:48:00.091 --> 01:48:03.090
<v Speaker 1>agitated by this and agitated for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time afterwards.</v>

2073
01:48:03.091 --> 01:48:05.040
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chimps are brutal.</v>

2074
01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:06.353
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll catch colobus monkeys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat them alive and the things are </v>

2075
01:48:08.971 --> 01:48:12.150
<v Speaker 1>screaming away like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're unbelievably strong.</v>

2076
01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Like a chimp is about six times as </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong as a grown man.</v>

2077
01:48:15.690 --> 01:48:18.870
<v Speaker 1>And so you get near a champ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy do not get near a chimp.</v>

2078
01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Those things can break 300 pound tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steel cables with their hands.</v>

2079
01:48:23.610 --> 01:48:26.130
<v Speaker 1>They are super strong and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>vicious.</v>

2080
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:27.143
<v Speaker 1>They're vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a lot of what seems to inhibit </v>

2081
01:48:29.191 --> 01:48:32.250
<v Speaker 1>chimp aggression is actually the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>

2082
01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:35.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear that they have any limits</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their aggression internally.</v>

2083
01:48:36.090 --> 01:48:37.950
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so chimps will,</v>

2084
01:48:37.951 --> 01:48:38.784
<v Speaker 1>the male juvenile sometimes in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company of females will sort of patrol </v>

2085
01:48:42.241 --> 01:48:43.074
<v Speaker 1>the edges of their territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they come across a chimp from a </v>

2086
01:48:46.231 --> 01:48:47.064
<v Speaker 1>different troop and they outnumber them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll attack them and tear them to </v>

2087
01:48:50.011 --> 01:48:53.430
<v Speaker 1>shreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was discovered.</v>

2088
01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:56.130
<v Speaker 1>I think Jane Goodall discovered that </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

2089
01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:57.593
<v Speaker 1>And she was shocked by it because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was still kind of operating under Russo </v>

2090
01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Soliah and assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then for a long time she thought,</v>

2091
01:49:03.271 --> 01:49:04.104
<v Speaker 1>well maybe these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I've corrupted these chimps by </v>

2092
01:49:05.821 --> 01:49:08.850
<v Speaker 1>feeding them and messing about a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their natural order.</v>

2093
01:49:08.850 --> 01:49:12.480
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe that's just a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of pathological human interaction.</v>

2094
01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:16.620
<v Speaker 1>But then other chimp researchers </v>
<v Speaker 1>reported the same sort of thing.</v>

2095
01:49:16.621 --> 01:49:17.454
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really interesting because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that chimps do territorial </v>

2096
01:49:20.191 --> 01:49:21.024
<v Speaker 1>rating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that also means that while one </v>

2097
01:49:23.281 --> 01:49:24.270
<v Speaker 1>thing it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2098
01:49:24.271 --> 01:49:26.880
<v Speaker 1>is religion is not the cause of wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2099
01:49:26.881 --> 01:49:28.440
<v Speaker 1>when you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's quite a leap.</v>

2100
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:29.011
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2101
01:49:29.011 --> 01:49:32.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite elite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tribalism might be the cause of wars and</v>

2102
01:49:32.701 --> 01:49:36.750
<v Speaker 1>religion might be a form of tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But chimps basically engage in,</v>

2103
01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:37.733
<v Speaker 1>cause I wore like behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're not going to lay that at the </v>

2104
01:49:40.141 --> 01:49:44.310
<v Speaker 1>hands of any abstract conceptual system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's territorial protection.</v>

2105
01:49:44.970 --> 01:49:46.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

2106
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:51.350
<v Speaker 1>So what do all found instead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the chimps who come to the top,</v>

2107
01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:55.900
<v Speaker 1>who managed to stay there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our chimps who are,</v>

2108
01:49:56.170 --> 01:49:59.500
<v Speaker 1>they're strong for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also,</v>

2109
01:49:59.890 --> 01:50:00.723
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also engage in a lot of mutual </v>

2110
01:50:02.771 --> 01:50:06.160
<v Speaker 1>social interactions and they pay a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of attention to the females.</v>

2111
01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:09.280
<v Speaker 1>And so what it appears to be the case is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2112
01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:11.680
<v Speaker 1>and this is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>

2113
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:13.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2114
01:50:13.190 --> 01:50:17.780
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be king of the chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be a good king.</v>

2115
01:50:18.430 --> 01:50:19.041
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2116
01:50:19.041 --> 01:50:21.260
<v Speaker 1>what does good mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's an,</v>

2117
01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:23.210
<v Speaker 1>you think of that as a moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>

2118
01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:24.830
<v Speaker 1>What does good mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

2119
01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:26.450
<v Speaker 1>good king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2120
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:28.303
<v Speaker 1>let's figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being torn to bits in a violent </v>

2121
01:50:33.011 --> 01:50:36.490
<v Speaker 1>insurrection seems like failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2122
01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:38.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2123
01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:39.993
<v Speaker 1>being constantly hounded from all sides </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're to Roston not social </v>

2124
01:50:45.041 --> 01:50:45.874
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't seem like an optimal </v>

2125
01:50:47.201 --> 01:50:48.034
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

2126
01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Maintaining order in the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the hierarchy maintains its structure</v>

2127
01:50:53.511 --> 01:50:54.344
<v Speaker 1>across time and so that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>attended to properly decreases the </v>

2128
01:50:58.011 --> 01:51:00.260
<v Speaker 1>probability of violent insurrection a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

2129
01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:02.090
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2130
01:51:02.091 --> 01:51:02.924
<v Speaker 1>what the chimp is trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chimp at the top is trying to </v>

2131
01:51:05.241 --> 01:51:06.074
<v Speaker 1>structure the dominance hierarchy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a way that it can maintain itself </v>

2132
01:51:08.541 --> 01:51:13.130
<v Speaker 1>without violence in a productive manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>with many individuals across large spans</v>

2133
01:51:13.131 --> 01:51:16.910
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's nothing abstract about that.</v>

2134
01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2135
01:51:17.781 --> 01:51:19.880
<v Speaker 1>there may be different ways to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2136
01:51:19.881 --> 01:51:20.361
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2137
01:51:20.361 --> 01:51:21.194
<v Speaker 1>there probably are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like you can be a plumber or you </v>

2138
01:51:23.061 --> 01:51:24.710
<v Speaker 1>can be a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there's men,</v>

2139
01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:28.640
<v Speaker 1>there are different ways potentially of </v>
<v Speaker 1>solving that set of problems,</v>

2140
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:33.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's within a bounded universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things you can't do.</v>

2141
01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:34.123
<v Speaker 1>There may be many things you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's certainly things that you </v>

2142
01:51:35.871 --> 01:51:36.704
<v Speaker 1>can't do.</v>

2143
01:51:37.190 --> 01:51:38.023
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then that's really useful to know </v>

2144
01:51:39.111 --> 01:51:39.944
<v Speaker 1>because what we can surmise from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially is that even higher order </v>

2145
01:51:43.851 --> 01:51:44.684
<v Speaker 1>morality is something that emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It emerges as a consequence of social </v>

2146
01:51:49.011 --> 01:51:53.540
<v Speaker 1>interactions between motivated beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>across large spans of time.</v>

2147
01:51:53.541 --> 01:51:55.280
<v Speaker 1>And that there's actually a pattern to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2148
01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:56.653
<v Speaker 1>There's a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the pattern that </v>

2149
01:51:58.041 --> 01:52:03.041
<v Speaker 1>characterizes the stable hierarch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now what is that pattern?</v>

2150
01:52:04.130 --> 01:52:04.963
<v Speaker 1>That's where you get to mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because this is where people differ </v>

2151
01:52:09.171 --> 01:52:10.550
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from chimps,</v>

2152
01:52:10.610 --> 01:52:13.790
<v Speaker 1>so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

2153
01:52:13.791 --> 01:52:15.560
<v Speaker 1>well why did the chimps act the way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>did?</v>

2154
01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:16.730
<v Speaker 1>D Dupe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

2155
01:52:16.731 --> 01:52:19.700
<v Speaker 1>well that's because they're their </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents acted that way.</v>

2156
01:52:19.701 --> 01:52:20.534
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's because their parents acted </v>

2157
01:52:22.011 --> 01:52:22.844
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can make that argument going as </v>

2158
01:52:24.501 --> 01:52:27.950
<v Speaker 1>far back in time as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I already made it at one point going</v>

2159
01:52:27.951 --> 01:52:29.600
<v Speaker 1>all the way back to lobsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2160
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:32.270
<v Speaker 1>400 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a dominance hierarchy.</v>

2161
01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:33.493
<v Speaker 1>So how do behave in a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy is something that's been </v>

2162
01:52:37.431 --> 01:52:40.220
<v Speaker 1>figured out across 400 million years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

2163
01:52:40.221 --> 01:52:43.220
<v Speaker 1>At least now you can infer two things </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>

2164
01:52:43.730 --> 01:52:47.440
<v Speaker 1>One is your adapted to a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

2165
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Cause that bloody thing is old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2166
01:52:50.150 --> 01:52:50.983
<v Speaker 1>so you have literally the forces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection have shaped you such that if </v>

2167
01:52:56.901 --> 01:52:59.450
<v Speaker 1>you weren't able to function within a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

2168
01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:00.433
<v Speaker 1>you weren't going to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone would kill you and you weren't </v>

2169
01:53:02.121 --> 01:53:04.100
<v Speaker 1>going to meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2170
01:53:04.101 --> 01:53:06.530
<v Speaker 1>So you're prepared for the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hurt.</v>

2171
01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:07.933
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next thing is you can observe and </v>

2172
01:53:09.771 --> 01:53:10.604
<v Speaker 1>transmit information across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy because it's a living thing </v>

2173
01:53:12.711 --> 01:53:15.800
<v Speaker 1>that continues across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of has its own structure that</v>

2174
01:53:15.801 --> 01:53:17.810
<v Speaker 1>perpetuates itself across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>

2175
01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:19.700
<v Speaker 1>So with the chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2176
01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:20.713
<v Speaker 1>the status of a family is heritable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't know if that's a </v>

2177
01:53:24.111 --> 01:53:27.710
<v Speaker 1>sociological phenomena or a biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena or whatever,</v>

2178
01:53:27.711 --> 01:53:29.780
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still the case.</v>

2179
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:32.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's because it's probably</v>

2180
01:53:32.511 --> 01:53:37.490
<v Speaker 1>easier for high status animals to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce high status offspring.</v>

2181
01:53:37.850 --> 01:53:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

2182
01:53:39.081 --> 01:53:41.930
<v Speaker 1>They have better access to everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're more confident.</v>

2183
01:53:41.931 --> 01:53:44.600
<v Speaker 1>So stands to reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2184
01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:45.733
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the constraints of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy itself because it's </v>

2185
01:53:48.201 --> 01:53:49.034
<v Speaker 1>a particular kind of structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to operate within particular </v>

2186
01:53:51.411 --> 01:53:53.150
<v Speaker 1>kinds of principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2187
01:53:53.151 --> 01:53:55.490
<v Speaker 1>So we were chimps</v>

2188
01:53:56.890 --> 01:54:00.280
<v Speaker 1>and then our brains started to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We discovered how to use fire,</v>

2189
01:54:00.281 --> 01:54:04.210
<v Speaker 1>we discovered how to use language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we discovered how to imitate each other.</v>

2190
01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:05.493
<v Speaker 1>And we're really good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We discovered how to specify what </v>

2191
01:54:08.201 --> 01:54:11.080
<v Speaker 1>someone is interested in by looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>where their eyes were pointing.</v>

2192
01:54:11.230 --> 01:54:13.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we have whites around our</v>
<v Speaker 1>iris.</v>

2193
01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:15.520
<v Speaker 1>It's so that I can tell where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking,</v>

2194
01:54:15.521 --> 01:54:18.400
<v Speaker 1>so I know what you're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gorillas don't have that.</v>

2195
01:54:18.970 --> 01:54:19.803
<v Speaker 1>So what that basically meant was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>precursors to us whose eyes weren't </v>

2196
01:54:23.921 --> 01:54:26.470
<v Speaker 1>distinguishable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the direction of their eyes pointing,</v>

2197
01:54:26.471 --> 01:54:28.960
<v Speaker 1>they didn't make or were killed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one knew what they were up to.</v>

2198
01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:32.440
<v Speaker 1>So we have all these abilities that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>built right into our body.</v>

2199
01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:36.580
<v Speaker 1>We built the hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come up automatically,</v>

2200
01:54:36.610 --> 01:54:39.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They emerged from the bottom and then we</v>

2201
01:54:39.161 --> 01:54:39.994
<v Speaker 1>watched them and infer the structure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we start getting into </v>

2202
01:54:44.650 --> 01:54:46.720
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's imitation,</v>

2203
01:54:46.721 --> 01:54:47.554
<v Speaker 1>but complex imitation of longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives and then representations of </v>

2204
01:54:50.711 --> 01:54:52.570
<v Speaker 1>the drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be fiction.</v>

2205
01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:56.050
<v Speaker 1>And then extraction of archetipal themes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

2206
01:54:56.290 --> 01:54:58.030
<v Speaker 1>from the fiction or the other way </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

2207
01:54:58.031 --> 01:55:00.070
<v Speaker 1>It might be that what we extracted out </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

2208
01:55:00.071 --> 01:55:02.830
<v Speaker 1>where the archetypal themes makes more </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense really.</v>

2209
01:55:03.010 --> 01:55:05.140
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the primordial </v>
<v Speaker 1>religions.</v>

2210
01:55:05.410 --> 01:55:07.540
<v Speaker 1>What's at the top of the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy?</v>

2211
01:55:08.050 --> 01:55:09.790
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's God?</v>

2212
01:55:09.970 --> 01:55:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a kind of ideal.</v>

2213
01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:14.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think that</v>

2214
01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:21.170
<v Speaker 1>this is an oversimplification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was frequently the case.</v>

2215
01:55:21.230 --> 01:55:22.063
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you the stories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic people like the Sumerians </v>

2216
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:31.070
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize their leader as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>incarnation of God on earth,</v>

2217
01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:33.710
<v Speaker 1>and he would have the responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act that way.</v>

2218
01:55:33.711 --> 01:55:36.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a very common human cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>operations,</v>

2219
01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:37.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese,</v>

2220
01:55:37.701 --> 01:55:38.534
<v Speaker 1>we're doing that right up to the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war and they still do it to some </v>

2221
01:55:40.731 --> 01:55:43.740
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like this is natural thought.</v>

2222
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:45.113
<v Speaker 1>The leader is an Avatar of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's God will leave that question </v>

2223
01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:55.480
<v Speaker 1>aside for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a good avatar or good avatars,</v>

2224
01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:58.920
<v Speaker 1>whatever has sovereignty and authority?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2225
01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:01.980
<v Speaker 1>what is sovereignty and authority?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2226
01:56:01.981 --> 01:56:02.814
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sovereignty and authority is whatever </v>

2227
01:56:04.741 --> 01:56:05.574
<v Speaker 1>stabilizes the dominance hierarchy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple members across large spans of </v>

2228
01:56:09.091 --> 01:56:09.924
<v Speaker 1>time in a way that won't be overthrown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know the answer to it because </v>

2229
01:56:12.961 --> 01:56:13.794
<v Speaker 1>it's an ongoing investigation and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it's worked out at the behavioral </v>

2230
01:56:17.401 --> 01:56:18.234
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then once we started to observe it </v>

2231
01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:22.380
<v Speaker 1>and tell stories about each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitate each other,</v>

2232
01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:24.810
<v Speaker 1>we could start encapsulating that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

2233
01:56:25.530 --> 01:56:27.630
<v Speaker 1>And so what time is it?</v>

2234
01:56:29.970 --> 01:56:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Three 11 okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll one more sentence.</v>

2235
01:56:32.951 --> 01:56:34.590
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you a break then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you,</v>

2236
01:56:34.630 --> 01:56:36.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the world's great stories.</v>

2237
01:56:36.361 --> 01:56:37.051
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here,</v>

2238
01:56:37.051 --> 01:56:39.390
<v Speaker 1>here's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're banging.</v>

2239
01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:43.320
<v Speaker 1>So just like when I'm playing with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>son physically,</v>

2240
01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:45.960
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to optimize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

2241
01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:47.393
<v Speaker 1>And the way we do that is by calibrating</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other's strengths and weaknesses </v>

2242
01:56:50.610 --> 01:56:51.443
<v Speaker 1>and at each other's emotional reactions </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that makes it fun and </v>

2243
01:56:54.751 --> 01:56:58.380
<v Speaker 1>interesting and exciting and almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>

2244
01:56:58.590 --> 01:57:02.400
<v Speaker 1>And that in a way that both players </v>
<v Speaker 1>really want the game to continue.</v>

2245
01:57:02.730 --> 01:57:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>

2246
01:57:04.410 --> 01:57:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say,</v>

2247
01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:08.131
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2248
01:57:08.131 --> 01:57:10.860
<v Speaker 1>you have to play fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a reasonable proposition.</v>

2249
01:57:10.861 --> 01:57:12.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't hurt the kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2250
01:57:12.691 --> 01:57:13.524
<v Speaker 1>there's arbitrary things you can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can draw out some general </v>

2251
01:57:15.451 --> 01:57:16.284
<v Speaker 1>principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically you have to figure it out </v>

2252
01:57:17.281 --> 01:57:18.114
<v Speaker 1>on the fly.</v>

2253
01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how we organize our hierarchies.</v>

2254
01:57:20.431 --> 01:57:23.100
<v Speaker 1>We figure it out on the fly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then what do we do?</v>

2255
01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:29.100
<v Speaker 1>We watch those hierarchies over </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years and communicate about</v>

2256
01:57:29.101 --> 01:57:29.934
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're trying to figure out what </v>

2257
01:57:31.231 --> 01:57:33.120
<v Speaker 1>the hell is it that we're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2258
01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:36.480
<v Speaker 1>And then we even take it a bit further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not only what is it that we are</v>

2259
01:57:36.481 --> 01:57:39.420
<v Speaker 1>up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is it that we should be up to?</v>

2260
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:40.583
<v Speaker 1>It's like how do you idealize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy structure and what </v>

2261
01:57:42.631 --> 01:57:46.230
<v Speaker 1>should be at the top?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the proposition is something like an</v>

2262
01:57:46.231 --> 01:57:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Avatar of the highest value is the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's at the top.</v>

2263
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:53.580
<v Speaker 1>And then the next question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is that?</v>

2264
01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:58.860
<v Speaker 1>An answer to that is we're not smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to conceptualize it property,</v>

2265
01:57:58.861 --> 01:58:00.450
<v Speaker 1>partly because it's an emergent </v>
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>

2266
01:58:00.451 --> 01:58:03.510
<v Speaker 1>It's very complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological,</v>

2267
01:58:03.511 --> 01:58:05.520
<v Speaker 1>sociological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emergent phenomena.</v>

2268
01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:06.713
<v Speaker 1>And so we're trying to close in on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what we're doing when we're </v>

2269
01:58:09.031 --> 01:58:11.940
<v Speaker 1>telling stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to close in on it.</v>

2270
01:58:11.970 --> 01:58:12.803
<v Speaker 1>What's the ideal human behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have a friend visiting right now </v>

2271
01:58:17.161 --> 01:58:17.850
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2272
01:58:17.850 --> 01:58:19.830
<v Speaker 1>he writes thrillers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's written like 20 of them.</v>

2273
01:58:20.630 --> 01:58:23.730
<v Speaker 1>And he writes comic books like Batman </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Wolverine and so on and so forth.</v>

2274
01:58:23.731 --> 01:58:27.690
<v Speaker 1>And so he's interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the thriller genre,</v>

2275
01:58:27.691 --> 01:58:30.630
<v Speaker 1>most of what he writes about are our </v>
<v Speaker 1>vigilante stories.</v>

2276
01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:31.493
<v Speaker 1>You know where someone is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their family is threatened in some </v>

2277
01:58:34.170 --> 01:58:36.540
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's outside the normal strictures</v>

2278
01:58:36.541 --> 01:58:38.850
<v Speaker 1>of the law and they're supposed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it.</v>

2279
01:58:39.150 --> 01:58:42.740
<v Speaker 1>So I asked him what the hell he was up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to because he's a smart guy.</v>

2280
01:58:42.741 --> 01:58:43.151
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2281
01:58:43.151 --> 01:58:44.680
<v Speaker 1>why are you writing these thrillers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2282
01:58:44.681 --> 01:58:45.514
<v Speaker 1>Why is that the genre that captures your</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest very highly verbally </v>

2283
01:58:48.221 --> 01:58:49.150
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

2284
01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:50.680
<v Speaker 1>and he's very well educated.</v>

2285
01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:51.701
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2286
01:58:51.701 --> 01:58:52.720
<v Speaker 1>what are you up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

2287
01:58:52.721 --> 01:58:54.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be something like this.</v>

2288
01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:58.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So usually in a thriller,</v>

2289
01:58:58.330 --> 01:59:03.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the force that is attacking the castle,</v>

2290
01:59:03.221 --> 01:59:06.490
<v Speaker 1>the structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the family is some male gone mad.</v>

2291
01:59:06.491 --> 01:59:08.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like animal man,</v>

2292
01:59:08.710 --> 01:59:11.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some brutal psychopathic guy or a serial</v>

2293
01:59:11.921 --> 01:59:14.530
<v Speaker 1>killer or some like arch criminal or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2294
01:59:14.531 --> 01:59:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Same thing you see in comic books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2295
01:59:16.541 --> 01:59:17.800
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

2296
01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:20.860
<v Speaker 1>that's like the masculine end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

2297
01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the protagonist and say,</v>

2298
01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:27.910
<v Speaker 1>typical protagonist might be a man </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to protect his family.</v>

2299
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:29.143
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2300
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:32.620
<v Speaker 1>what do you do in a monster attack?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that you love.</v>

2301
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:33.663
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2302
01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:36.150
<v Speaker 1>if you're just like made out of tissue </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper and,</v>

2303
01:59:36.410 --> 01:59:37.720
<v Speaker 1>and gelatin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2304
01:59:37.721 --> 01:59:38.554
<v Speaker 1>you just fall over and die and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster comes in and steals everything </v>

2305
01:59:40.991 --> 01:59:43.120
<v Speaker 1>you have and kills everyone and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the story.</v>

2306
01:59:43.690 --> 01:59:44.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2307
01:59:44.801 --> 01:59:45.634
<v Speaker 1>you have to meet force with force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a weird thing because if you </v>

2308
01:59:49.181 --> 01:59:50.014
<v Speaker 1>go on a monster on the outside and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the inside and you're also </v>

2309
01:59:53.981 --> 01:59:56.020
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll save for this example.</v>

2310
01:59:56.290 --> 02:00:00.850
<v Speaker 1>If you don't allow yourself to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of monster that the monster is,</v>

2311
02:00:00.851 --> 02:00:05.140
<v Speaker 1>he's going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is how do you allow</v>

2312
02:00:05.141 --> 02:00:05.974
<v Speaker 1>yourself to be the kind of monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's capable of protecting things </v>

2313
02:00:08.770 --> 02:00:09.603
<v Speaker 1>without turning into the monster while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all his books are explorations of </v>

2314
02:00:13.121 --> 02:00:13.870
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2315
02:00:13.870 --> 02:00:14.703
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a limit situation where even the </v>

2316
02:00:16.301 --> 02:00:19.120
<v Speaker 1>rules aren't working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your families on the line,</v>

2317
02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:21.790
<v Speaker 1>the law can't protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

2318
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>

2319
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:26.050
<v Speaker 1>You've curl up and die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you hide in the basement?</v>

2320
02:00:26.051 --> 02:00:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you make a safe room?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you move to another state?</v>

2321
02:00:28.691 --> 02:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could just take it,</v>

2322
02:00:30.430 --> 02:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>you fight back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you arm yourself?</v>

2323
02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

2324
02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:36.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the right thing to do?</v>

2325
02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right thing to do doesn't seem to be</v>

2326
02:00:40.661 --> 02:00:43.810
<v Speaker 1>to let that win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2327
02:00:43.811 --> 02:00:44.644
<v Speaker 1>So he's trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's laying out various simulations of </v>

2328
02:00:46.931 --> 02:00:47.980
<v Speaker 1>responses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2329
02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>and he has all sorts of reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing so.</v>

2330
02:00:50.230 --> 02:00:53.050
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly what we're doing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

2331
02:00:53.051 --> 02:00:53.884
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not only representing what it is </v>

2332
02:00:55.181 --> 02:00:56.014
<v Speaker 1>that we're doing and if we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd go and watch the movie and you'd </v>

2333
02:00:58.271 --> 02:00:59.104
<v Speaker 1>say that wasn't very realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be a good enough model of the </v>

2334
02:01:03.041 --> 02:01:05.410
<v Speaker 1>world as it is so that you find it </v>
<v Speaker 1>credible.</v>

2335
02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It can twist a principal or two around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ask you to suspend disbelief for the</v>

2336
02:01:10.211 --> 02:01:12.130
<v Speaker 1>purposes of exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2337
02:01:12.131 --> 02:01:14.740
<v Speaker 1>like what would it be like if you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>ex-ray eyes?</v>

2338
02:01:14.741 --> 02:01:15.401
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2339
02:01:15.401 --> 02:01:16.234
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like a superhero thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will put up with that because </v>

2340
02:01:18.851 --> 02:01:22.570
<v Speaker 1>it's an exploratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an exploratory process.</v>

2341
02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:23.433
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just break a bunch of rules </v>

2342
02:01:24.791 --> 02:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>arbitrarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll,</v>

2343
02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>because people get bored of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2344
02:01:27.221 --> 02:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a realistic simulation.</v>

2345
02:01:29.770 --> 02:01:32.470
<v Speaker 1>You're playing out simulations in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral landscape.</v>

2346
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:34.143
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say the simulations that </v>

2347
02:01:37.751 --> 02:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>have worked best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our architect,</v>

2348
02:01:42.110 --> 02:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>so there's deep themes that are kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2349
02:01:45.441 --> 02:01:46.274
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2350
02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:49.010
<v Speaker 1>they're like templates and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat vague,</v>

2351
02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the details have to be filled in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your own life.</v>

2352
02:01:52.610 --> 02:01:53.443
<v Speaker 1>But there are broad narrative themes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are the fundamental framework </v>

2353
02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>within which the specific moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy that you need has to be built.</v>

2354
02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:05.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2355
02:02:05.901 --> 02:02:10.250
<v Speaker 1>so now what we're going to do is we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to look at those narratives.</v>

2356
02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:13.190
<v Speaker 1>And so what we're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things,</v>

2357
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.000
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to figure out what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper way to conceptualize the world if</v>

2358
02:02:20.721 --> 02:02:23.300
<v Speaker 1>your problem is that you have to act and</v>
<v Speaker 1>live it.</v>

2359
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:24.703
<v Speaker 1>Question Number One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>question number two is if you're in the </v>

2360
02:02:28.971 --> 02:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>world and you have it conceptualized </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

2361
02:02:32.150 --> 02:02:34.520
<v Speaker 1>how should you act?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

2362
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:37.820
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what these stories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to solve now,</v>

2363
02:02:39.170 --> 02:02:40.003
<v Speaker 1>are they correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're low resolution </v>

2364
02:02:45.181 --> 02:02:48.660
<v Speaker 1>photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they are.</v>

2365
02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:50.453
<v Speaker 1>Or they're low resolution movies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been working on them for a </v>

2366
02:02:53.581 --> 02:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>long time now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a twist here,</v>

2367
02:02:55.771 --> 02:02:57.570
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a very cool twist.</v>

2368
02:03:01.770 --> 02:03:02.603
<v Speaker 1>The twist is what is it that's necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a story for you to find the story </v>

2369
02:03:07.231 --> 02:03:08.970
<v Speaker 1>compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2370
02:03:08.971 --> 02:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>because that's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like obviously you go to a movie,</v>

2371
02:03:12.161 --> 02:03:12.721
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2372
02:03:12.721 --> 02:03:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I love that are you go there and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that stunk.</v>

2373
02:03:15.211 --> 02:03:17.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never inflict that on anyone.</v>

2374
02:03:17.251 --> 02:03:18.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2375
02:03:18.181 --> 02:03:20.850
<v Speaker 1>they're both stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both expensive.</v>

2376
02:03:20.851 --> 02:03:22.980
<v Speaker 1>They're borth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well produced and sophisticated.</v>

2377
02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:27.180
<v Speaker 1>One grabs your interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get away from it and the other</v>

2378
02:03:27.181 --> 02:03:29.400
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like why?</v>

2379
02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:31.253
<v Speaker 1>What is it about some kinds of stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that grab you and won't let you go and </v>

2380
02:03:35.221 --> 02:03:37.080
<v Speaker 1>now there's the don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2381
02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:40.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a complicated thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I'm going to pause</v>

2382
02:03:40.021 --> 02:03:40.854
<v Speaker 1>it is that not only are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only does the dominance hierarchy </v>

2383
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:49.920
<v Speaker 1>have a structure that replicates itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly across time,</v>

2384
02:03:51.450 --> 02:03:52.283
<v Speaker 1>but you're adapted to that structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of that Ab deputation is that </v>

2385
02:03:57.030 --> 02:04:01.770
<v Speaker 1>when you're presented with patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior that are general,</v>

2386
02:04:02.490 --> 02:04:03.323
<v Speaker 1>but that also partake of the quality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being useful within dominance </v>

2387
02:04:07.141 --> 02:04:08.490
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a chat,</v>

2388
02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:12.450
<v Speaker 1>you're attracted to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like when you're a little kid,</v>

2389
02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:13.170
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of,</v>

2390
02:04:13.170 --> 02:04:14.760
<v Speaker 1>there must be people you admire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2391
02:04:14.761 --> 02:04:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Think of someone you admire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2392
02:04:16.651 --> 02:04:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you admire them?</v>

2393
02:04:19.450 --> 02:04:22.440
<v Speaker 1>So give me an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you pick someone you admire,</v>

2394
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:24.210
<v Speaker 1>why do you admire them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pick someone.</v>

2395
02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Anybody got an answer to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2396
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:34.870
<v Speaker 5>thank are respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Paved the way for some potential.</v>

2397
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2398
02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that seems to be about right Tay.</v>

2399
02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:39.473
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting because often the </v>

2400
02:04:42.421 --> 02:04:46.440
<v Speaker 1>admiration will emerge in the absence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated reasons for it.</v>

2401
02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:47.573
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more or less something that hits </v>

2402
02:04:48.271 --> 02:04:51.090
<v Speaker 1>you rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you post-hoc think,</v>

2403
02:04:51.091 --> 02:04:53.550
<v Speaker 1>well this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it hits you.</v>

2404
02:04:53.970 --> 02:04:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Now there's some being some experiments </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

2405
02:04:56.161 --> 02:04:56.994
<v Speaker 1>I think with vervet monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take vervet monkeys in a </v>

2406
02:05:01.471 --> 02:05:02.304
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and you take photos of the low</v>
<v Speaker 1>ranking individuals and you take photos </v>

2407
02:05:05.011 --> 02:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>of the high ranking individuals and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you show the vervet monkeys,</v>

2408
02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:10.320
<v Speaker 1>the low ranking individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the high ranking individuals,</v>

2409
02:05:10.590 --> 02:05:13.530
<v Speaker 1>the verbage will look longer at the high</v>
<v Speaker 1>ranking individuals.</v>

2410
02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:17.490
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a hypothesis for you.</v>

2411
02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:19.913
<v Speaker 1>If you see someone manifest elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rough pattern that across dominance </v>

2412
02:05:24.991 --> 02:05:29.040
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies enables people to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be attracted to that,</v>

2413
02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:31.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that person,</v>

2414
02:05:31.711 --> 02:05:32.544
<v Speaker 1>by focusing on that person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can flesh out the archetype in some </v>

2415
02:05:36.151 --> 02:05:37.140
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2416
02:05:37.141 --> 02:05:40.440
<v Speaker 1>because the one a student asked me once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

2417
02:05:40.441 --> 02:05:42.720
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if archetypal stories are real,</v>

2418
02:05:42.721 --> 02:05:43.554
<v Speaker 1>why can't we just tell the architectural</v>
<v Speaker 1>story over and over the same story I </v>

2419
02:05:47.281 --> 02:05:48.870
<v Speaker 1>called Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really the question.</v>

2420
02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:49.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

2421
02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:51.053
<v Speaker 1>why would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say like in primordial </v>

2422
02:05:52.981 --> 02:05:54.600
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does really happen.</v>

2423
02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:57.090
<v Speaker 1>It is repetition of the architectural </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

2424
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:59.100
<v Speaker 1>But in a sophisticated culture like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ours,</v>

2425
02:05:59.101 --> 02:06:02.820
<v Speaker 1>there's like 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction works.</v>

2426
02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2427
02:06:04.201 --> 02:06:05.034
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it is is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype in some sense is the template </v>

2428
02:06:10.741 --> 02:06:11.574
<v Speaker 1>for good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't fill in the details </v>

2429
02:06:13.831 --> 02:06:16.740
<v Speaker 1>underneath that are relevant for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and this time.</v>

2430
02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:20.250
<v Speaker 1>And so the fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a good work of fiction,</v>

2431
02:06:20.490 --> 02:06:21.323
<v Speaker 1>the archetype shines through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it shines through in a way that you </v>

2432
02:06:24.121 --> 02:06:24.954
<v Speaker 1>can extract out information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually works here and now in this </v>

2433
02:06:27.661 --> 02:06:29.700
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need,</v>

2434
02:06:29.850 --> 02:06:31.890
<v Speaker 1>you need both the archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

2435
02:06:31.891 --> 02:06:32.724
<v Speaker 1>which is how to be a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you need information about the </v>

2436
02:06:35.611 --> 02:06:39.180
<v Speaker 1>particulars of how to be a good person </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can actually do that.</v>

2437
02:06:39.181 --> 02:06:40.014
<v Speaker 1>And I think that what happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find someone you admire is they embody </v>

2438
02:06:42.991 --> 02:06:46.110
<v Speaker 1>the archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've fleshed out the skills.</v>

2439
02:06:46.210 --> 02:06:49.440
<v Speaker 1>And so if you watch them and copy them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and apprentice yourself to them,</v>

2440
02:06:49.650 --> 02:06:51.990
<v Speaker 1>then you can pull that in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a great,</v>

2441
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:53.143
<v Speaker 1>magnificent way of developing because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you can benefit from their </v>

2442
02:06:56.161 --> 02:06:56.994
<v Speaker 1>experience without having to go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same laborious process hopefully of </v>

2443
02:07:01.891 --> 02:07:04.860
<v Speaker 1>acquiring that wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you go to university,</v>

2444
02:07:05.130 --> 02:07:07.800
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And principle cause it's easier to go to</v>

2445
02:07:07.801 --> 02:07:08.634
<v Speaker 1>university and learn the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is to go out there and bang </v>

2446
02:07:11.611 --> 02:07:15.120
<v Speaker 1>yourself out against the world and learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things the hard way,</v>

2447
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:17.190
<v Speaker 1>which you don't have time for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2448
02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Or don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2449
02:07:30.801 --> 02:07:31.634
<v Speaker 1>Because a good counter example is also </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a counter example is even </v>

2450
02:07:34.281 --> 02:07:35.114
<v Speaker 1>better because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is another way to think about </v>

2451
02:07:37.151 --> 02:07:39.190
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wrote a chapter,</v>

2452
02:07:39.310 --> 02:07:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a chapter called cal the truth,</v>

2453
02:07:42.370 --> 02:07:43.420
<v Speaker 1>and then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2454
02:07:43.690 --> 02:07:47.860
<v Speaker 1>that might not be the right title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then you run into Pontius pilots</v>

2455
02:07:47.861 --> 02:07:48.694
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2456
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:51.580
<v Speaker 1>What is truth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2457
02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:53.050
<v Speaker 1>good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2458
02:07:53.051 --> 02:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>do I know the truth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2459
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:57.610
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's dynamic moves around,</v>

2460
02:07:57.611 --> 02:07:58.444
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe the re the property is don't </v>

2461
02:08:01.451 --> 02:08:03.370
<v Speaker 1>lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's different.</v>

2462
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:04.661
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2463
02:08:04.661 --> 02:08:06.760
<v Speaker 1>how do I know the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth and falsehood?</v>

2464
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:07.541
<v Speaker 1>You might say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

2465
02:08:07.541 --> 02:08:10.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time you don't ignore that.</v>

2466
02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you do,</v>

2467
02:08:13.751 --> 02:08:15.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

2468
02:08:15.370 --> 02:08:16.203
<v Speaker 1>So are you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that you know the </v>

2469
02:08:17.171 --> 02:08:18.004
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does mean that you've identified </v>

2470
02:08:19.331 --> 02:08:20.164
<v Speaker 1>a useful false hood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good thing because partly </v>

2471
02:08:22.901 --> 02:08:26.770
<v Speaker 1>what you need to know to go forward is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what not to do and also what to do.</v>

2472
02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:27.633
<v Speaker 1>But often what not to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Old Testament 10 </v>

2473
02:08:30.071 --> 02:08:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Commandments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2474
02:08:31.271 --> 02:08:32.980
<v Speaker 1>here's some rough things you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2475
02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2476
02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've kind of,</v>

2477
02:08:36.940 --> 02:08:39.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground ground our way through that.</v>

2478
02:08:39.730 --> 02:08:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Or they absolutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2479
02:08:42.341 --> 02:08:43.960
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like a pattern.</v>

2480
02:08:44.110 --> 02:08:46.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can vary it,</v>

2481
02:08:46.150 --> 02:08:47.570
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

2482
02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:49.780
<v Speaker 1>you mess with it at your peril.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

2483
02:08:49.810 --> 02:08:52.210
<v Speaker 1>that's the hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2484
02:08:56.570 --> 02:09:00.080
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take 10 minutes and then I'll tell</v>

2485
02:09:00.081 --> 02:09:03.440
<v Speaker 1>you the Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is lovely story.</v>
