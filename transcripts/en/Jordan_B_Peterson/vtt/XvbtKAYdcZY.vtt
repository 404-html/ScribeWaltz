1
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Ralston College and the Cambridge Center</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the study of platonism,</v>

2
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.463
<v Speaker 1>it's an immense honor to introduce two </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the foremost intellectuals of our </v>

3
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These thinkers,</v>

4
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher,</v>

5
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.103
<v Speaker 1>the other psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A spiritual writers is addressing the </v>

6
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:17.511
<v Speaker 1>malaise of the soul in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Stuart Mill in his magnificent test</v>

7
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>say on Coleridge roots of Benton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Benton,</v>

8
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>who above all others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men that have been led to ask themselves</v>

9
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>in regards to any ancient or received </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

10
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.553
<v Speaker 1>Is it true and by Coleridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the meaning with Coleridge in </v>

11
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>contrast to the utility of Benton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very fact that any doctrine had been</v>

12
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:47.034
<v Speaker 1>believed by thoughtful men I'd received </v>
<v Speaker 1>by whole nations and generations of </v>

13
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.194
<v Speaker 1>mankind was part of the problem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>solved was one of the phenomena to be </v>

14
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:57.894
<v Speaker 1>accounted for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This I think is true of both Roger </v>

15
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Scruton and Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd like to mention just a couple of</v>

16
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>points of convergence.</v>

17
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.933
<v Speaker 1>Warmed is an insistence on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of imagination as conversion </v>

18
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:15.264
<v Speaker 1>to truth in opposition to a mere fantasy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the opposition to idolatry ideology </v>

19
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.373
<v Speaker 1>as well as idolatry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the idolatrous ideology of </v>

20
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.303
<v Speaker 1>the Post Modern for call derived </v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus and the urgent return to </v>

21
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>questions about truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty and goodness,</v>

22
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.063
<v Speaker 1>and of course part of this is linked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what both perceive as the perilous </v>

23
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:51.684
<v Speaker 1>position of the modern university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both argue with that continuity of </v>

24
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:57.684
<v Speaker 1>esteem needs to be regained in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities and the dominant strands of </v>

25
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:11.251
<v Speaker 1>the humanities are leading to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>impoverishment of the souls of students.</v>

26
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Narratives both argue are not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories of power,</v>

27
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>but these narratives persist because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that truth,</v>

28
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.123
<v Speaker 1>so the importance for both Ralston </v>
<v Speaker 1>college and indeed for the Cambridge </v>

29
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the study of platonism,</v>

30
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.130
<v Speaker 1>of both of these thinkers is their </v>
<v Speaker 1>insistence upon the relationship between</v>

31
00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:40.760
<v Speaker 1>mythos and logos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between story and reason,</v>

32
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.003
<v Speaker 1>the insistence upon a hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>values and their vision of education as </v>

33
00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:48.854
<v Speaker 1>conversion to truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This conversation will be moderated by </v>

34
00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:58.970
<v Speaker 1>the president of Rolston College,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Blackwood.</v>

35
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Thank you Douglas Fir those inspiring </v>
<v Speaker 2>and grounding word starting us off,</v>

36
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:20.031
<v Speaker 2>right in relation to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past that we wished to recover.</v>

37
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.833
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with a very straightforward but </v>

38
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:28.140
<v Speaker 2>perhaps difficult question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

39
00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:28.974
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gathered around the theme </v>

40
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.970
<v Speaker 2>apprehending the transcendent loosely to</v>
<v Speaker 2>gather this conversation.</v>

41
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to begin by asking each of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the transcendent?</v>

42
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean for something to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent?</v>

43
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me start that.</v>

44
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.533
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take a position which I attributed </v>

45
00:04:55.221 --> 00:04:57.230
<v Speaker 3>also to can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

46
00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:58.064
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have a very clear negative </v>

47
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.943
<v Speaker 3>understanding of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were advanced to the edge of our </v>

48
00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:09.611
<v Speaker 3>thinking in so many areas knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>although there's nothing further that we</v>

49
00:05:10.401 --> 00:05:11.234
<v Speaker 3>can say that somehow the truth has never</v>
<v Speaker 3>nevertheless not run out of that </v>

50
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.940
<v Speaker 3>negative view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think needs to be</v>

51
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.453
<v Speaker 3>combined with a more positive view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which tells us that there are other </v>

52
00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:26.330
<v Speaker 3>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just,</v>

53
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.570
<v Speaker 3>not maybe not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some other way of,</v>

54
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.443
<v Speaker 3>of crossing that boundary and does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were landing in the realm of the </v>

55
00:05:33.981 --> 00:05:34.814
<v Speaker 3>transcendent and knowing it from inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that this is something that we </v>

56
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 3>understand very quickly when personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>relations in that when I,</v>

57
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.073
<v Speaker 3>when I address you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that I'm addressing something </v>

58
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.060
<v Speaker 3>which addresses me too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from a place where I could never be,</v>

59
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.350
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't at myself from those eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

60
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.320
<v Speaker 3>and I can't capture the thing that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at me from those eyes,</v>

61
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.363
<v Speaker 3>but nevertheless there are leaps of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination which can put me in your </v>

62
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:12.821
<v Speaker 3>point of view and from that point who I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can come to understand exactly what I am</v>

63
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.463
<v Speaker 3>but in a completely different way from </v>
<v Speaker 3>simply the ordinary empirical knowledge </v>

64
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 3>that I have with myself.</v>

65
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.120
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpersonal understanding,</v>

66
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:28.121
<v Speaker 3>I would say we can adapt to all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other aspects of our world,</v>

67
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 3>which is mysterious to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A music for instance.</v>

68
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.680
<v Speaker 3>With that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a beginning of.</v>

69
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 3>And I want to return to music a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bit later,</v>

70
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.913
<v Speaker 3>Jordan.</v>

71
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.753
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's useful as an adjunct to </v>

72
00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:43.810
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

73
00:06:43.811 --> 00:06:48.811
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so roger mentioned that the transcendent</v>

74
00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:53.560
<v Speaker 4>is what we bump up against when we </v>
<v Speaker 4>realize our ignorance.</v>

75
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.320
<v Speaker 4>And so it's that which transcends our </v>
<v Speaker 4>ignorance.</v>

76
00:06:56.321 --> 00:07:00.490
<v Speaker 4>And that in itself makes it an </v>
<v Speaker 4>implacable fact,</v>

77
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.250
<v Speaker 4>unless you believe that you have no </v>
<v Speaker 4>ignorance,</v>

78
00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:07.480
<v Speaker 4>in which case there's no point in </v>
<v Speaker 4>furthering a discussion with you,</v>

79
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.033
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the transcendent is the fact in so </v>

80
00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:13.180
<v Speaker 4>far as it's that which transcends our </v>
<v Speaker 4>ignorance,</v>

81
00:07:13.181 --> 00:07:16.890
<v Speaker 4>but you can also think about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>technically so and,</v>

82
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.670
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think we know enough about how the</v>

83
00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:19.504
<v Speaker 4>brain works now so that not that we know</v>
<v Speaker 4>much so that useful things can be said </v>

84
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:24.364
<v Speaker 4>about that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you tend to represent the world in the </v>

85
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.460
<v Speaker 4>simplest manner that you possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that works for what you're doing.</v>

86
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.010
<v Speaker 4>And so you don't actually see the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>you see sufficiently useful,</v>

87
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:42.340
<v Speaker 4>low represent low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 4>representations of the world.</v>

88
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.073
<v Speaker 4>And if they work then that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no need to adjust them and </v>

89
00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 4>they're relatively easy to remember and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to manipulate.</v>

90
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.740
<v Speaker 4>But now and then you have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>misapprehension about someone let's say,</v>

91
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.550
<v Speaker 4>and you have a conversation with them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the conversation goes sideways.</v>

92
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.503
<v Speaker 4>And what that means is that the thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you thought you were conversing </v>

93
00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:03.970
<v Speaker 4>with is not the thing that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversing with.</v>

94
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.910
<v Speaker 4>And that manifests itself in error,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

95
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:07.744
<v Speaker 4>So error is the place where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcendent reveals itself and what is </v>

96
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.633
<v Speaker 4>actually revealing itself is the reality</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's outside and underneath your </v>

97
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:21.181
<v Speaker 4>perceptions and so what you see in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world in some sense is a set of animated</v>

98
00:08:21.671 --> 00:08:22.504
<v Speaker 4>cartoons and a lot of that is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of you seeing nothing but </v>

99
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:27.214
<v Speaker 4>your memory because your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 4>organized so that instead of going </v>

100
00:08:30.251 --> 00:08:34.090
<v Speaker 4>through all of the difficulty of having </v>
<v Speaker 4>to look at the thing and that in itself,</v>

101
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.373
<v Speaker 4>you look at what you assumed to be there</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you can get away with that so </v>

102
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:39.304
<v Speaker 4>much the better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing in itself is always much </v>

103
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.910
<v Speaker 4>richer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>richer than your apprehension of it,</v>

104
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.073
<v Speaker 4>which is partly why you make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also partly why you can continue to </v>

105
00:08:50.441 --> 00:08:51.850
<v Speaker 4>garner wisdom in the world.</v>

106
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:52.773
<v Speaker 4>There's always more there than meets the</v>
<v Speaker 4>eye and God only knows how much more </v>

107
00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:57.324
<v Speaker 4>there is there than meets the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can show this even in the </v>

108
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:01.734
<v Speaker 4>religious sense to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you could say that there's an </v>

109
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:04.974
<v Speaker 4>element to the transcendent that </v>
<v Speaker 4>instills people with a sense of </v>

110
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 4>religious significance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do that by immediately,</v>

111
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 4>scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by feeding people chemicals,</v>

112
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:14.994
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that disrupt the inhibition of </v>

113
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 4>perception by memory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that puts them in a place where</v>

114
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:24.210
<v Speaker 4>the transcendent tends to reveal itself </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes an overwhelming force.</v>

115
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.630
<v Speaker 4>So this is not some fiction that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>exists.</v>

116
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:28.464
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's transcendent is more real than </v>

117
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 4>the reality that you perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

118
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 4>let's pick up.</v>

119
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Let's pick up on that because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

120
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.873
<v Speaker 2>the ancients and medievals had a clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that it wasn't the world that was </v>

121
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 2>changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was we ourselves,</v>

122
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:45.380
<v Speaker 2>as we make an ascent towards deeper </v>
<v Speaker 2>truths,</v>

123
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.170
<v Speaker 2>higher forms of the beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

124
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 2>as we ourselves become more self </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious.</v>

125
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.270
<v Speaker 2>So it's not the world that's changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

126
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.600
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but us,</v>

127
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering if you could say how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the nature of that ascent,</v>

128
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.611
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

129
00:10:00.611 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

130
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.480
<v Speaker 2>that movement and what brings it about.</v>

131
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would</v>

132
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.320
<v Speaker 3>be a bit wary of the metaphor of ascent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

133
00:10:11.321 --> 00:10:11.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

134
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.250
<v Speaker 3>I think in Plato is quite clear what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>meant.</v>

135
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.623
<v Speaker 3>He wanted us to actually to transcend </v>
<v Speaker 3>our earthly perceptions in the way of </v>

136
00:10:20.651 --> 00:10:23.800
<v Speaker 3>seeing things and look on the world from</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

137
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.320
<v Speaker 3>from a God's eye perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

138
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.340
<v Speaker 3>and this could be done if we enter the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world of the pure forms,</v>

139
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so on,</v>

140
00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:35.470
<v Speaker 3>leave empirical reality behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think actually</v>

141
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 3>insofar as the experience of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent that I,</v>

142
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.880
<v Speaker 3>as I understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is available to us modern people.</v>

143
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not that way that we get it perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 3>about some Jordan might be right.</v>

144
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.591
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

145
00:10:48.591 --> 00:10:49.424
<v Speaker 3>that there are these drug induced </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences where things open up to us </v>

146
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.320
<v Speaker 3>because old barriers of suddenly swept </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

147
00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 3>But in my own case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the concentration on the empirical</v>

148
00:11:02.381 --> 00:11:06.170
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which at a certain point flips from mere</v>

149
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:07.743
<v Speaker 3>sensory understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took to a vision in that of it's </v>

150
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.083
<v Speaker 3>communicating something to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is what the literature </v>

151
00:11:15.911 --> 00:11:20.911
<v Speaker 3>and art and music to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at their best they read,</v>

152
00:11:21.221 --> 00:11:26.221
<v Speaker 3>described reality so that it is actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating something to you.</v>

153
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.400
<v Speaker 3>It's not just there as an inert object </v>
<v Speaker 3>before you,</v>

154
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:31.443
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that sense of the transcendence is </v>

155
00:11:33.911 --> 00:11:38.911
<v Speaker 3>like discovering yourself in the mirror </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing in the world as a whole,</v>

156
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.960
<v Speaker 3>that thing in you that you could never </v>
<v Speaker 3>identify in words,</v>

157
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the subject which is looking at it.</v>

158
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not a mystery mystery,</v>

159
00:11:49.871 --> 00:11:53.140
<v Speaker 3>but it's something that you can then </v>
<v Speaker 3>explain the difference.</v>

160
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.570
<v Speaker 3>A good writer and a bad writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

161
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:56.703
<v Speaker 3>it's such a good writer will describe </v>
<v Speaker 3>something in such a way that the thing </v>

162
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 3>described has the soul of the reader in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

163
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.560
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

164
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.453
<v Speaker 4>so that might be a distinction in part </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the thing and the meaningful </v>

165
00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:09.390
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

166
00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:12.360
<v Speaker 4>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a very mysterious phenomenon.</v>

167
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.413
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some sense that the essence of </v>

168
00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:15.894
<v Speaker 4>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that means to shine forth is </v>

169
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.060
<v Speaker 4>we're surrounded by empirical facts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're everywhere.</v>

170
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.460
<v Speaker 4>There's more of them than we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly count,</v>

171
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.300
<v Speaker 4>but some of them do emerge and manifest </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves as that,</v>

172
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.390
<v Speaker 4>as that conjunction between the factual </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the meaningful,</v>

173
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.110
<v Speaker 4>and then that's what's gripping and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fortunate.</v>

174
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me that's also partly what what leads</v>

175
00:12:36.871 --> 00:12:37.704
<v Speaker 4>us onward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe in something approximating the </v>

176
00:12:40.231 --> 00:12:41.064
<v Speaker 4>asset that you described is that the set</v>
<v Speaker 4>of facts manifests itself as implicitly </v>

177
00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:46.164
<v Speaker 4>meaningful and that means in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there is a call to you that he </v>

178
00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:51.210
<v Speaker 4>hasn't from within you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

179
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.133
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how else to put it exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you walk into a bookstore and a </v>

180
00:12:54.871 --> 00:12:58.230
<v Speaker 4>book will will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will reveal itself to you.</v>

181
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:59.623
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or or you have a conversation and part </v>

182
00:13:01.351 --> 00:13:02.184
<v Speaker 4>of the conversation will trigger </v>
<v Speaker 4>something in you or you're reading a </v>

183
00:13:04.681 --> 00:13:05.514
<v Speaker 4>scientific paper and much of it's dull </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then all of a sudden there's </v>

184
00:13:07.651 --> 00:13:08.484
<v Speaker 4>something that sparks outward that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a port that's a portal into the </v>

185
00:13:11.401 --> 00:13:12.234
<v Speaker 4>transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is a place where the fact and </v>

186
00:13:13.771 --> 00:13:14.604
<v Speaker 4>the meaning converge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's a phenomenon we don't </v>

187
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:17.423
<v Speaker 4>understand very well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has something to do with its </v>

188
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.110
<v Speaker 4>convergence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the narrative that drives us,</v>

189
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.580
<v Speaker 4>whatever that happens to be.</v>

190
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.883
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so good way of putting into </v>

191
00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:26.404
<v Speaker 3>actually it connects with the general </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem of what the humanities are in </v>

192
00:13:33.051 --> 00:13:35.540
<v Speaker 3>the university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've,</v>

193
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.030
<v Speaker 3>I've always assumed that in some way or </v>
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>

194
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.580
<v Speaker 3>if you're teaching literature or </v>
<v Speaker 3>musicology or,</v>

195
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.673
<v Speaker 3>or history of art or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are opening young people to those </v>

196
00:13:46.281 --> 00:13:47.114
<v Speaker 3>moments when the world ceases to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mirror accumulation of facts and as it </v>

197
00:13:53.151 --> 00:13:55.650
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>addresses you and um,</v>

198
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:56.623
<v Speaker 3>that requires literary criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It requires opening yourself to </v>

199
00:14:00.621 --> 00:14:02.010
<v Speaker 3>experience in a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

200
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.380
<v Speaker 3>it requires serious education of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a special kind.</v>

201
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.430
<v Speaker 3>And I think that if we thought that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanities as directed towards that,</v>

202
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:15.610
<v Speaker 3>we can see why they might be one way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fill the moral void that,</v>

203
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.010
<v Speaker 3>that grows so easily in people's lives.</v>

204
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.960
<v Speaker 4>So young had this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I really love.</v>

205
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a very sophisticated idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

206
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:25.543
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

207
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.200
<v Speaker 4>it's this idea of how the self,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

208
00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:32.040
<v Speaker 4>so the self for young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this Christ was a symbol of the self.</v>

209
00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:35.940
<v Speaker 4>So the logos was a symbol of the self.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's sort of what would you say?</v>

210
00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:36.774
<v Speaker 4>It's the divine essence of humanity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the image of that is a symbol of the </v>

211
00:14:40.081 --> 00:14:40.914
<v Speaker 4>self and for young the self was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>totality of the individual across time </v>

212
00:14:46.621 --> 00:14:49.890
<v Speaker 4>and space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's whatever you are as,</v>

213
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.790
<v Speaker 4>as a transcendent object.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

214
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.253
<v Speaker 4>And then can imagine that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcended object also has to interact </v>

215
00:14:57.171 --> 00:15:02.171
<v Speaker 4>with you and the world moment by moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his belief was that those times when</v>

216
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:07.100
<v Speaker 4>that space of meaning opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there is that convergence between the</v>

217
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:07.934
<v Speaker 4>fact and the gripping of the fact was </v>
<v Speaker 4>the manifestation of the self which is </v>

218
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 4>this transcendent object in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>specific moment of time and space.</v>

219
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.433
<v Speaker 4>And therefore our call forward to move </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards revealing that totality as much </v>

220
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.540
<v Speaker 4>as it can be revealed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it would be partly and that would</v>

221
00:15:27.541 --> 00:15:30.440
<v Speaker 4>be partly revealed by then following a </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningful pathway.</v>

222
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.423
<v Speaker 4>And it would be the case that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>engaged in the teaching of humanities </v>

223
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:35.903
<v Speaker 4>and literature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you are trying to engage exactly </v>

224
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:41.360
<v Speaker 4>that part of the person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's to pull them into the story and to,</v>

225
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.150
<v Speaker 4>and have that open up to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that's a portal.</v>

226
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.370
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not words on paper,</v>

227
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:48.020
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a portal to their,</v>

228
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.330
<v Speaker 4>to their further development towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

229
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.343
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the manifestation of this higher and </v>

230
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.520
<v Speaker 4>more transcendent motive being</v>

231
00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.360
<v Speaker 2>the Hindu idea for the transition from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the to Brahman,</v>

232
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.980
<v Speaker 2>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've suddenly pass through a,</v>

233
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.103
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a barrier that can't actually be </v>

234
00:16:07.331 --> 00:16:12.130
<v Speaker 2>described because you can only know it </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're on the other side of it.</v>

235
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.353
<v Speaker 2>But when you're on the other side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you looking back at the thing that </v>

236
00:16:16.091 --> 00:16:19.390
<v Speaker 2>you've left and seeing it in as it were </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the first time.</v>

237
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.553
<v Speaker 2>And knowing what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's a little connects a </v>

238
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.970
<v Speaker 2>little bit with what Douglas was saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

239
00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:25.923
<v Speaker 2>about courage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That courage was an advocate of a form </v>

240
00:16:31.931 --> 00:16:32.764
<v Speaker 2>of education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a form of knowledge which shows the </v>

241
00:16:35.051 --> 00:16:35.884
<v Speaker 2>meaning of things as opposed to the mere</v>
<v Speaker 2>facts accumulated by Bentham and people </v>

242
00:16:40.481 --> 00:16:41.314
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of you have done quite deep dives </v>

243
00:16:43.841 --> 00:16:44.674
<v Speaker 2>into 20th century totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologies at both of you have been a </v>

244
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:56.370
<v Speaker 2>very trenchant critics of the etiology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the various forms of nihilism in,</v>

245
00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our own culture.</v>

246
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think all of us tire of,</v>

247
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.750
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

248
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:09.430
<v Speaker 2>I kind of negativity that has come to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>very prevalent in our culture,</v>

249
00:17:11.411 --> 00:17:15.490
<v Speaker 2>not simply the nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then we can criticize the nihilism.</v>

250
00:17:15.491 --> 00:17:17.380
<v Speaker 2>We ought to criticize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of you have been,</v>

251
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.900
<v Speaker 2>had been brilliant critics of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

252
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.183
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I take to be at work in both of </v>

253
00:17:22.451 --> 00:17:23.284
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

254
00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:26.740
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the work that both of you do is,</v>

255
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.780
<v Speaker 2>is not fundamentally criticism but a </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn towards something positive,</v>

256
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.840
<v Speaker 2>a recovery of a sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent.</v>

257
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:35.973
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a turn for a moment to what does </v>

258
00:17:39.941 --> 00:17:43.870
<v Speaker 2>that recovery look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do we start?</v>

259
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.543
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're thinking intellectually world </v>

260
00:17:48.341 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 2>of scholarship and education</v>

261
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 3>that we both belonged to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has turned,</v>

262
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:56.130
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this negative direction,</v>

263
00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.480
<v Speaker 3>always preferring debunking explanations</v>
<v Speaker 3>of everything,</v>

264
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.480
<v Speaker 3>show reducing them to the lowest motive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

265
00:18:04.481 --> 00:18:06.300
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's not truth,</v>

266
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:09.510
<v Speaker 3>but par that we pursue in all that food </v>
<v Speaker 3>codian nonsense.</v>

267
00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:10.743
<v Speaker 3>And I think the only response to that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come up with bunking explanations of </v>

268
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:15.414
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to put back into the subject matter </v>

269
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:23.450
<v Speaker 3>of one's own inherent belief in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to recognize that,</v>

270
00:18:23.451 --> 00:18:24.284
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

271
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.733
<v Speaker 3>we're not around on this earth for very </v>
<v Speaker 3>long and we do have an obligation to </v>

272
00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:33.120
<v Speaker 3>find the things that we love and not the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that,</v>

273
00:18:33.121 --> 00:18:36.730
<v Speaker 3>that we reject a under those things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we love the view,</v>

274
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.860
<v Speaker 3>the best way towards them is to look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that other people have loved.</v>

275
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:41.813
<v Speaker 3>That's what a culture is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the residue of all the things that </v>

276
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:44.934
<v Speaker 3>people thought were worthwhile to </v>
<v Speaker 3>preserve and teaching that will will </v>

277
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:50.820
<v Speaker 3>again reconnect us to what matters.</v>

278
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.710
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's,</v>

279
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.720
<v Speaker 4>there's also ways of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

280
00:18:55.110 --> 00:19:00.110
<v Speaker 4>of providing a pathway forward by making</v>
<v Speaker 4>the food.</v>

281
00:19:00.411 --> 00:19:02.580
<v Speaker 4>Kalia and arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say about power,</v>

282
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.870
<v Speaker 4>more high resolution and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that I do in my lectures,</v>

283
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.903
<v Speaker 4>public lectures that I think is rather </v>
<v Speaker 4>comical is to take and poke fun in some </v>

284
00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:14.604
<v Speaker 4>sense about the idea of power as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental foundation for the </v>

285
00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:20.040
<v Speaker 4>hierarchal structures of the West.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

286
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:23.730
<v Speaker 4>well you can think of the West as one </v>
<v Speaker 4>large scale,</v>

287
00:19:23.731 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 4>low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totalitarian tyranny,</v>

288
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.353
<v Speaker 4>the tyranny of the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you can decompose that and which in </v>

289
00:19:31.021 --> 00:19:33.780
<v Speaker 4>some senses to transcend the concept.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

290
00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

291
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:35.623
<v Speaker 4>I asked my audiences what they think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the tyranny of plumbers or the </v>

292
00:19:40.141 --> 00:19:42.240
<v Speaker 4>tyranny of massage therapists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

293
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.163
<v Speaker 4>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

294
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.700
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's dead relevant.</v>

295
00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:45.534
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say you need a plumber and you do </v>

296
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:49.260
<v Speaker 4>need a plumber.</v>

297
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.093
<v Speaker 4>Everyone agrees that you need a plumber </v>
<v Speaker 4>and because there's hell to pay </v>

298
00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:54.450
<v Speaker 4>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

299
00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.130
<v Speaker 4>and then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

300
00:19:56.131 --> 00:19:58.290
<v Speaker 4>how is it that you go about selecting a </v>
<v Speaker 4>plumber?</v>

301
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:03.330
<v Speaker 4>And the answer isn't that there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>roving bands of tyrannical plumbers that</v>

302
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:08.331
<v Speaker 4>go door to door telling housewives that </v>
<v Speaker 4>if they don't use their services,</v>

303
00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:12.150
<v Speaker 4>the surface of the most tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 4>plumber,</v>

304
00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.163
<v Speaker 4>that they'll be mafia like consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens instead is that you look </v>

305
00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:22.680
<v Speaker 4>for the plumber who is most able in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>estimation and in the,</v>

306
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.840
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

307
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.013
<v Speaker 4>in his reputation as distributed through</v>
<v Speaker 4>the community for being able to fix </v>

308
00:20:28.171 --> 00:20:33.171
<v Speaker 4>pipes and run a business and engage in </v>
<v Speaker 4>an honest transaction with you.</v>

309
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.450
<v Speaker 4>And that's competence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not power.</v>

310
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.523
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I see as most corrosive about the </v>

311
00:20:39.421 --> 00:20:40.254
<v Speaker 4>postmodern types,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially those who've derived </v>

312
00:20:41.791 --> 00:20:46.710
<v Speaker 4>themselves from let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the idea that every hierarchy or</v>

313
00:20:46.711 --> 00:20:49.480
<v Speaker 4>the hierarchy as such is predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 4>power,</v>

314
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:53.170
<v Speaker 4>is actually an assault on the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 4>competence itself.</v>

315
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.123
<v Speaker 4>And that in turn is an assault on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that there are real problems that </v>

316
00:20:56.801 --> 00:20:57.634
<v Speaker 4>can actually be solved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then if you dispense with all that </v>

317
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.420
<v Speaker 4>and it's only power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is no real problems to be solved.</v>

318
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.433
<v Speaker 4>And there's no noble ways of solving </v>
<v Speaker 4>them even even as in even in as </v>

319
00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:10.534
<v Speaker 4>concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a manner as a good plumber would solve </v>

320
00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:13.750
<v Speaker 4>that which is a not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a trivial thing.</v>

321
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.913
<v Speaker 4>And so then you deprive people of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>deprive people of that have that sense </v>

322
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:22.750
<v Speaker 4>of purpose in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even even at the high resolution levels.</v>

323
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.933
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've insisted in my lectures that </v>

324
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:27.723
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're the sort of person who runs a </v>

325
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:29.764
<v Speaker 4>small diner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's incumbent on you to run the </v>

326
00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:33.874
<v Speaker 4>highest quality small diner that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly can because what you're doing </v>

327
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Speaker 4>there is not merely providing people </v>
<v Speaker 4>with basic nutrition.</v>

328
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:46.770
<v Speaker 4>There's way more to the space than meets</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eye and your noble.</v>

329
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:48.963
<v Speaker 4>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Acceptance of your limited </v>

330
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:54.370
<v Speaker 4>responsibility is also simultaneously a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way to transcend that.</v>

331
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.710
<v Speaker 4>And that can be a place where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood meets.</v>

332
00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.693
<v Speaker 4>That can be a place where tired people </v>
<v Speaker 4>revivify themselves before they go off </v>

333
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:03.910
<v Speaker 4>to do their difficult work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That can be a place where you can mentor</v>

334
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:05.980
<v Speaker 4>your employees and help them develop </v>
<v Speaker 4>their life.</v>

335
00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:09.790
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a rich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an unbelievably rich microcosm.</v>

336
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:10.863
<v Speaker 4>And to take on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the care and tending of that microcosm </v>

337
00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:16.984
<v Speaker 4>as a responsibility is also a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathway to meaning and unnecessary and </v>

338
00:22:21.161 --> 00:22:23.690
<v Speaker 4>meaning is something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well not EPA,</v>

339
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:24.563
<v Speaker 4>phenomenal and not dispensable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but absolutely central to human </v>

340
00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:29.584
<v Speaker 4>thriving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the psychological and practical </v>

341
00:22:30.971 --> 00:22:31.804
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

342
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we do have to try and understand why</v>

343
00:22:34.881 --> 00:22:39.530
<v Speaker 3>it is that there is such a charm in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>food codian position.</v>

344
00:22:39.531 --> 00:22:43.460
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that people want to believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that all the best things.</v>

345
00:22:43.461 --> 00:22:44.294
<v Speaker 3>What we think of the best things in </v>
<v Speaker 3>human relations simply disguised forms </v>

346
00:22:48.051 --> 00:22:49.700
<v Speaker 3>of manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

347
00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:50.534
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

348
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.720
<v Speaker 3>the whole feminist view of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between men and women,</v>

349
00:22:53.721 --> 00:22:54.554
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>switcher is founded on this deep myth </v>

350
00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.753
<v Speaker 3>that men are exercising exercise power </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a agenda to use the fashionable </v>

351
00:23:04.791 --> 00:23:06.800
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the word over over women.</v>

352
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.040
<v Speaker 3>And that all study of this is just a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>of revealing the power and the,</v>

353
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:15.203
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the competitor is through which it </v>

354
00:23:17.061 --> 00:23:18.110
<v Speaker 3>flows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

355
00:23:18.111 --> 00:23:22.740
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a will to believe this and why is,</v>

356
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.240
<v Speaker 3>is one of the big questions that I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>we try,</v>

357
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:26.143
<v Speaker 3>we have to try to understand is it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>when people lose some kind of </v>

358
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.800
<v Speaker 3>transcendental religious faith that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are automatically fall into this pit of,</v>

359
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.480
<v Speaker 3>of resentment as a of the Nietzschean </v>
<v Speaker 3>unkind to try and find a,</v>

360
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.893
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the oppressor in every relationship or </v>

361
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.160
<v Speaker 3>is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are there truths and exploring as well?</v>

362
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:54.460
<v Speaker 3>Is there other forms of power or forms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of human relation that looked like power</v>

363
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:55.993
<v Speaker 3>from one aspect but perhaps also looked </v>
<v Speaker 3>like tenderness and dependence from </v>

364
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:00.794
<v Speaker 3>another aspect and that they've just are</v>
<v Speaker 3>emphasizing one half of it or something </v>

365
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:05.354
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there are real questions as to </v>

366
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:10.550
<v Speaker 3>how it is our culture has got into this </v>
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>

367
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.211
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

368
00:24:11.211 --> 00:24:13.820
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the question below the claim</v>
<v Speaker 4>of power.</v>

369
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:15.080
<v Speaker 4>And so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

370
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:18.980
<v Speaker 4>I've thought about that to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 4>and here's three possibilities.</v>

371
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one is the accusation that all there is,</v>

372
00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:25.810
<v Speaker 4>is power is the justification for use of</v>
<v Speaker 4>power of cool.</v>

373
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's handy.</v>

374
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 4>If that's what you want to use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then then there's another problem and</v>

375
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:33.254
<v Speaker 4>that goes along with the failure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the willful failure to distinguish </v>

376
00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:39.110
<v Speaker 4>competence from tyranny and power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

377
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:42.050
<v Speaker 4>because we might think of power as </v>
<v Speaker 4>unearned authority,</v>

378
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:42.884
<v Speaker 4>something like that because we need a </v>
<v Speaker 4>definition of power and I think that </v>

379
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.070
<v Speaker 4>there's a resentment at work there </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's very,</v>

380
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:50.270
<v Speaker 4>very deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

381
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:55.340
<v Speaker 4>it's deep in the biblical sense which is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there is a proclivity for those who</v>

382
00:24:56.871 --> 00:24:57.704
<v Speaker 4>do not manifest what they could manifest</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world and thereby fail to watch </v>

383
00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:03.734
<v Speaker 4>the success of those who do manifest </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they could manifest in the world </v>

384
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:11.180
<v Speaker 4>and succeed and become embittered by </v>
<v Speaker 4>that tremendously embittered and then to</v>

385
00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:16.130
<v Speaker 4>label that as power and then to attempt </v>
<v Speaker 4>to destroy it because it's simpler to do</v>

386
00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:16.964
<v Speaker 4>that than to do the radical internal </v>
<v Speaker 4>retooling that would be required to set </v>

387
00:25:20.931 --> 00:25:22.280
<v Speaker 4>things straight internally.</v>

388
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that</v>

389
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:23.790
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

390
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:24.300
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

391
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:29.010
<v Speaker 3>that's one explanation of why people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>always tempted by the zero sum vision of</v>

392
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.160
<v Speaker 3>relations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's benefit is my cost sort of thing.</v>

393
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

394
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to pick up on that the,</v>

395
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.933
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

396
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.590
<v Speaker 2>the very widespread view that things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero sum,</v>

397
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.270
<v Speaker 2>which is of course the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

398
00:25:42.271 --> 00:25:45.570
<v Speaker 2>the language of power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the antidote to that?</v>

399
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.940
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does one overturn the,</v>

400
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideology of power?</v>

401
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.960
<v Speaker 2>How does one transcend that with a non </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero sum a truth or approach to life?</v>

402
00:25:59.250 --> 00:25:59.670
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

403
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.503
<v Speaker 3>personally would say that the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to recognize is that there are </v>

404
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.100
<v Speaker 3>positive sum games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

405
00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:09.300
<v Speaker 3>that's what the real theory of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>market tells us,</v>

406
00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:14.340
<v Speaker 3>that there are whole realms of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>transactions where both parties gain,</v>

407
00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:15.613
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

408
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.910
<v Speaker 3>from the shed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

409
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.100
<v Speaker 3>engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

410
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:21.610
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>though that doesn't work,</v>

411
00:26:21.611 --> 00:26:25.980
<v Speaker 3>drive away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real source of this is difficulty.</v>

412
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:26.853
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has something to do with what Jordan </v>

413
00:26:28.531 --> 00:26:31.960
<v Speaker 3>was referring to and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people's,</v>

414
00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.203
<v Speaker 3>people's resentment at the success of </v>
<v Speaker 3>others when they cannot match it or </v>

415
00:26:36.841 --> 00:26:40.260
<v Speaker 3>cannot easily match it will or will not </v>
<v Speaker 3>match it,</v>

416
00:26:40.261 --> 00:26:41.094
<v Speaker 3>which is either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

417
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.270
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

418
00:26:42.271 --> 00:26:44.640
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of the Labor of,</v>

419
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.773
<v Speaker 3>of re reconceived and your own position </v>
<v Speaker 3>in such that you actually have to do </v>

420
00:26:50.371 --> 00:26:51.810
<v Speaker 3>something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

421
00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 3>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is some,</v>

422
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.370
<v Speaker 3>something lazy about the zero sum </v>
<v Speaker 3>ambition,</v>

423
00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

424
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.033
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

425
00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:01.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a vision that successful people</v>

426
00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:03.060
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

427
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:08.060
<v Speaker 4>and that they have at any level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality and you can actually combat that</v>

428
00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.760
<v Speaker 4>to some degree by make it high </v>
<v Speaker 4>resolution again by,</v>

429
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:11.833
<v Speaker 4>by making examples.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like because very few people </v>

430
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:15.883
<v Speaker 4>actually believe once they observe that </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the relationships they've had with </v>

431
00:27:21.171 --> 00:27:22.004
<v Speaker 4>other people have been zero sum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you might get some very </v>

432
00:27:24.891 --> 00:27:25.724
<v Speaker 4>disadvantaged people and these people do</v>
<v Speaker 4>exist who've been taken advantage by </v>

433
00:27:30.621 --> 00:27:31.454
<v Speaker 4>virtually everyone they've ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>encountered in their whole life like </v>

434
00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:34.484
<v Speaker 4>that does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But most of the time all you have to do </v>

435
00:27:36.621 --> 00:27:37.790
<v Speaker 4>is remind people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

436
00:27:37.791 --> 00:27:39.260
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think of someone that you loved.</v>

437
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.590
<v Speaker 4>Even briefly think of a friend that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've had.</v>

438
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.633
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

439
00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:44.623
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you successfully negotiated with that </v>

440
00:27:46.551 --> 00:27:47.384
<v Speaker 4>friend to do things together because </v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise it's not a friendship and it </v>

441
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:52.723
<v Speaker 4>has to be successful negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means your friend has to be happy </v>

442
00:27:55.851 --> 00:27:57.950
<v Speaker 4>with what you were doing and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be happy.</v>

443
00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.053
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then wasn't it the case that you </v>

444
00:28:00.531 --> 00:28:01.364
<v Speaker 4>were both happier doing that than either</v>
<v Speaker 4>of you would have been doing something </v>

445
00:28:04.011 --> 00:28:04.844
<v Speaker 4>else alone and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and isn't that evidence in your own </v>

446
00:28:07.341 --> 00:28:08.174
<v Speaker 4>action and your life for the existence </v>
<v Speaker 4>of non zero sum games and they're </v>

447
00:28:11.151 --> 00:28:11.984
<v Speaker 4>dependent on successful negotiation is </v>
<v Speaker 4>we can both have more than we would </v>

448
00:28:15.591 --> 00:28:16.424
<v Speaker 4>otherwise have if we can come to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>consensus about what will both pursue </v>

449
00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.330
<v Speaker 4>and it's very few people when you make </v>
<v Speaker 4>it personal like that.</v>

450
00:28:23.331 --> 00:28:24.290
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and high resolution.</v>

451
00:28:24.291 --> 00:28:25.124
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very few people who are willing to </v>

452
00:28:26.391 --> 00:28:27.224
<v Speaker 4>pursue their ideology of zero sum of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>zero sum reality so far down that </v>

453
00:28:32.241 --> 00:28:33.074
<v Speaker 4>they'll actually use that to </v>
<v Speaker 4>characterize their most intimate </v>

454
00:28:34.941 --> 00:28:35.774
<v Speaker 4>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I would say that someone who does </v>

455
00:28:37.881 --> 00:28:38.714
<v Speaker 4>that by temperament is literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychopathic because the psychopathic </v>

456
00:28:43.341 --> 00:28:46.400
<v Speaker 4>view of the world is absolutely that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a zero sum game.</v>

457
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's right.</v>

458
00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.060
<v Speaker 3>But of course we have a whole body of </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature,</v>

459
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about sexuality,</v>

460
00:28:54.761 --> 00:28:55.594
<v Speaker 3>which is trying to establish that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexuality is the exercise of power of </v>

461
00:28:59.501 --> 00:29:00.334
<v Speaker 3>one person over another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get it already in south was being </v>

462
00:29:03.431 --> 00:29:08.431
<v Speaker 3>and nothingness where he almost is </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost by logic that,</v>

463
00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:10.383
<v Speaker 3>that a serious sexual desire for him </v>
<v Speaker 3>ends up as sadomasochism because you </v>

464
00:29:16.061 --> 00:29:19.330
<v Speaker 3>cannot extract from the other that gift </v>
<v Speaker 3>of his freedom,</v>

465
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:20.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

466
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.110
<v Speaker 3>which is what you're looking for because</v>
<v Speaker 3>his freedom,</v>

467
00:29:23.111 --> 00:29:23.710
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

468
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.543
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to be obtained by you and therefore </v>

469
00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:27.364
<v Speaker 3>you can only do this by who sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tearing that his flesh and getting him </v>

470
00:29:30.311 --> 00:29:33.760
<v Speaker 3>to confess in the extremes of agony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he can't do it.</v>

471
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of thing.</v>

472
00:29:35.351 --> 00:29:39.100
<v Speaker 3>I know that's a very good vision of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual relations are,</v>

473
00:29:39.101 --> 00:29:42.000
<v Speaker 3>but you get a that image used</v>

474
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:42.843
<v Speaker 4>by Simone de Beauvoir and all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>feminists to essentially to de </v>

475
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:52.291
<v Speaker 4>legitimize the idea that there is such a</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing as love for the other sex.</v>

476
00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:53.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

477
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.903
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it also masks and more </v>

478
00:29:55.031 --> 00:29:57.760
<v Speaker 4>fundamental problem that's really a </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological problem.</v>

479
00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.640
<v Speaker 4>Like it's a misapprehension of a genuine</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

480
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:06.090
<v Speaker 4>But part of what sex does is temporarily</v>
<v Speaker 4>subordinate the individual to nature and</v>

481
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:09.550
<v Speaker 4>the species.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so there is a domination there,</v>

482
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.080
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

483
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.230
<v Speaker 4>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a,</v>

484
00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:15.760
<v Speaker 4>if a woman decides to have a child,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then she is going to undergo a series of</v>

485
00:30:15.761 --> 00:30:16.594
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily radical transformations </v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's also going to end up in this </v>

486
00:30:19.171 --> 00:30:20.004
<v Speaker 4>situation where in all likelihood </v>
<v Speaker 4>something else becomes fundamentally </v>

487
00:30:23.261 --> 00:30:25.540
<v Speaker 4>more important than her and there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there is a,</v>

488
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.030
<v Speaker 4>there is a sub,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be voluntary,</v>

489
00:30:28.031 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 4>subjugation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>subjugation to nature,</v>

490
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:31.773
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's built into the fabric of </v>

491
00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:33.760
<v Speaker 4>existence.</v>

492
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.140
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's very easy not to want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to grapple with that because it's such a</v>

493
00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:38.974
<v Speaker 4>profound problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then to make that a secondary </v>

494
00:30:41.411 --> 00:30:43.480
<v Speaker 4>consequence of something like unbalanced</v>
<v Speaker 4>power,</v>

495
00:30:43.481 --> 00:30:44.314
<v Speaker 4>relationships between the genders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but of course a traditional religion </v>

496
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:53.160
<v Speaker 4>offers you selves for this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rites of passage in which,</v>

497
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.003
<v Speaker 4>which joins men to women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right of passage which makes birth </v>

498
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.890
<v Speaker 4>unexperienced with the whole community </v>
<v Speaker 4>and death.</v>

499
00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:01.310
<v Speaker 4>Likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

500
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.420
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

501
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:08.580
<v Speaker 4>the sense also in these great events,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one is occupying a position in the,</v>

502
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:16.330
<v Speaker 4>in a moral space that has been occupied </v>
<v Speaker 4>by generations before one.</v>

503
00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.253
<v Speaker 4>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This normalizing of these huge </v>

504
00:31:19.721 --> 00:31:20.554
<v Speaker 4>transitions I think is something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have is depended upon religion </v>

505
00:31:24.431 --> 00:31:25.264
<v Speaker 4>to provide this a sacred and having </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken that away well or ignored it or </v>

506
00:31:30.341 --> 00:31:31.174
<v Speaker 4>trying to live without a exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without the idea of a sacrament and </v>

507
00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.360
<v Speaker 4>we're actually at a loss when these </v>
<v Speaker 4>great transitions occur.</v>

508
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.023
<v Speaker 4>Just because it is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact that to to engage in the </v>

509
00:31:45.041 --> 00:31:45.874
<v Speaker 4>integration of sexuality with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual life is a series of </v>

510
00:31:48.971 --> 00:31:50.950
<v Speaker 4>sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

511
00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:51.784
<v Speaker 4>if you get married,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a sacrifice because it's a </v>

512
00:31:53.201 --> 00:31:57.940
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice of all other people and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a sacrifice of that possibility and</v>

513
00:31:57.941 --> 00:31:58.774
<v Speaker 4>then to have a child is the sacrifice of</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the things that you could have done </v>

514
00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:05.870
<v Speaker 4>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then having that child and two but two,</v>

515
00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.900
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you pointed out,</v>

516
00:32:07.901 --> 00:32:10.480
<v Speaker 4>to make that part of a broader tradition</v>
<v Speaker 4>to say that,</v>

517
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.650
<v Speaker 4>well that is a sacrifice and there is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>loss that goes along with that.</v>

518
00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:15.484
<v Speaker 4>But what you gain as a consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 4>if immeasurables significance in </v>

519
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:20.704
<v Speaker 4>contrast to the loss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that's really </v>

520
00:32:22.601 --> 00:32:24.760
<v Speaker 4>struck me in this lecture to her that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing,</v>

521
00:32:24.761 --> 00:32:25.594
<v Speaker 4>so I've been in about 100 cities and one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the things that I've been talking to </v>

522
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:29.794
<v Speaker 4>people about is his meaning and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>suppose it's meaning in relationship to </v>

523
00:32:32.741 --> 00:32:33.574
<v Speaker 4>the transcendent and the necessity of </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning as an antidote to suffering and </v>

524
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.433
<v Speaker 4>malevolence.</v>

525
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.393
<v Speaker 4>And the hypothesis is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well meaning is to be found in </v>

526
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:44.770
<v Speaker 4>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is a,</v>

527
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:45.643
<v Speaker 4>it's a revelation to people because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't conceptualized it that way </v>

528
00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:51.020
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like meaning isn't,</v>

529
00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.103
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't happiness and it isn't self </v>

530
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:55.970
<v Speaker 4>esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it isn't momentary pleasure,</v>

531
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.320
<v Speaker 4>isn't any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

532
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.273
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the bearing of a sacrificial </v>

533
00:33:00.141 --> 00:33:00.974
<v Speaker 4>burden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that that actually works to enrich </v>

534
00:33:02.841 --> 00:33:03.674
<v Speaker 4>and ennoble your life in ways that make </v>
<v Speaker 4>the tragic element of it tolerable and </v>

535
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:11.330
<v Speaker 4>had to keep you from bitterness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so these things that are put forward</v>

536
00:33:11.331 --> 00:33:14.990
<v Speaker 4>as subjugation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the subjugation of women to the,</v>

537
00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.090
<v Speaker 4>to the catastrophe of birth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

538
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:19.010
<v Speaker 4>or even the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the indignity of,</v>

539
00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:19.883
<v Speaker 4>of Patriarchal Union is all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that you can take on as an </v>

540
00:33:22.911 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 4>aspirational goal rather than something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a mere imposition on your,</v>

541
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:27.853
<v Speaker 4>on your moment to moment freedom as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>relief to people to hear that and to </v>

542
00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:31.630
<v Speaker 4>know it.</v>

543
00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:32.520
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

544
00:33:32.521 --> 00:33:33.354
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there is also the sense that in the </v>

545
00:33:38.021 --> 00:33:38.854
<v Speaker 3>world in which we live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where obviously people have been </v>

546
00:33:41.471 --> 00:33:44.400
<v Speaker 3>detached to a greater extent from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

547
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.620
<v Speaker 3>any continuous religious tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there still is a sense of loss.</v>

548
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.290
<v Speaker 3>A people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

549
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:53.230
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know that they're missing something</v>

550
00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:57.430
<v Speaker 3>but don't know quite how to identify it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one reason for thinking,</v>

551
00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.890
<v Speaker 3>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking that it's been taken away.</v>

552
00:33:59.891 --> 00:34:00.724
<v Speaker 3>Something's been stolen from them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they look around at the people who are </v>

553
00:34:03.251 --> 00:34:06.450
<v Speaker 3>at ease in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsuccessful and seem to be a,</v>

554
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:07.723
<v Speaker 3>I'm on good terms with themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of them as the ones who done the </v>

555
00:34:11.831 --> 00:34:13.070
<v Speaker 3>stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

556
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:16.040
<v Speaker 3>and that is a dangerous attitude and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's,</v>

557
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:16.874
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it surely that is part of what he rubs </v>

558
00:34:18.671 --> 00:34:23.671
<v Speaker 3>in all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange academic disciplines like gender</v>

559
00:34:23.681 --> 00:34:25.840
<v Speaker 3>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which simply have as their goal,</v>

560
00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:26.853
<v Speaker 3>the undermining of the existing order </v>
<v Speaker 3>without anything positive to put in its </v>

561
00:34:30.611 --> 00:34:33.240
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know what those,</v>

562
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:38.280
<v Speaker 3>those academic studies recruit people </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time from this fund of,</v>

563
00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

564
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.073
<v Speaker 3>of isolation as the sense your sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of loss without an ability to identify </v>

565
00:34:46.601 --> 00:34:47.434
<v Speaker 3>the thing that's</v>

566
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:50.640
<v Speaker 4>last as the cold lake element of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they do,</v>

567
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.653
<v Speaker 4>I would say to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>degree prey on people whose </v>

568
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:56.610
<v Speaker 4>interpersonal relationships have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>irreparably damaged.</v>

569
00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.680
<v Speaker 4>I have a hypothesis about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the feminist end of the postmodern</v>

570
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.840
<v Speaker 4>radical leftist movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

571
00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.830
<v Speaker 4>and this is something I've talked about </v>
<v Speaker 4>much in public but,</v>

572
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.831
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

573
00:35:07.831 --> 00:35:10.530
<v Speaker 4>but here goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this should get me in lots of trouble.</v>

574
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.390
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

575
00:35:12.391 --> 00:35:13.950
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a variety of things that are</v>

576
00:35:13.951 --> 00:35:14.784
<v Speaker 4>tangled together here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we don't know how female biology </v>

577
00:35:18.661 --> 00:35:22.170
<v Speaker 4>would manifest itself politically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Male biology does.</v>

578
00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:23.183
<v Speaker 4>Female biology is going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's because female political </v>

579
00:35:26.431 --> 00:35:30.630
<v Speaker 4>activity on the largest possible scale </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a relatively new phenomenon.</v>

580
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:32.010
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

581
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.900
<v Speaker 4>and it isn't obviously the case that men</v>
<v Speaker 4>and women's views of the world are going</v>

582
00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Precisely.</v>

583
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.113
<v Speaker 4>So here's a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're telling me what you think about </v>

584
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:41.724
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one thing that a woman really wants </v>

585
00:35:45.481 --> 00:35:46.314
<v Speaker 4>to know about a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or perhaps you might say one thing that </v>

586
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:55.230
<v Speaker 4>femininity wants to know about </v>
<v Speaker 4>masculinity is that it's not a predatory</v>

587
00:35:55.231 --> 00:35:56.064
<v Speaker 4>tyrant.</v>

588
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:57.361
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

589
00:35:57.361 --> 00:35:58.740
<v Speaker 4>and here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

590
00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:02.760
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's fragility and feminine sexuality</v>

591
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.983
<v Speaker 4>to a greater degree than there is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>male sexuality because women bear a </v>

592
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.740
<v Speaker 4>higher price for sexual misadventure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

593
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:14.760
<v Speaker 4>and are perhaps more prone to </v>
<v Speaker 4>exploitation by force.</v>

594
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.163
<v Speaker 4>But more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of being a woman is having the </v>

595
00:36:19.501 --> 00:36:20.334
<v Speaker 4>possibility of bringing something </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily fragile and vulnerable </v>

596
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:27.330
<v Speaker 4>and valuable into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the first concern might be,</v>

597
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.680
<v Speaker 4>are you a predator?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fundamentally,</v>

598
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.760
<v Speaker 4>are you a predator?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what I see happening in the,</v>

599
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.170
<v Speaker 4>in the feminist disciplines like gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies,</v>

600
00:36:37.171 --> 00:36:39.420
<v Speaker 4>is the politicization of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>accusation.</v>

601
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:40.523
<v Speaker 4>And the accusation is prove to me that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not a Predator like in in your </v>

602
00:36:45.271 --> 00:36:46.104
<v Speaker 4>fund,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the fundamental element of your </v>

603
00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:50.220
<v Speaker 4>masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only historically but now,</v>

604
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.460
<v Speaker 4>because the cost of you being a Predator</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

605
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:56.970
<v Speaker 4>is too high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I feel that that's an inappropriate.</v>

606
00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:00.330
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what's driving the </v>
<v Speaker 4>demolition of the idea of presumption of</v>

607
00:37:00.331 --> 00:37:01.440
<v Speaker 4>innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

608
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:02.573
<v Speaker 4>we'll start with presumption of guilt </v>
<v Speaker 4>and prove to you will be proved to me </v>

609
00:37:05.821 --> 00:37:06.654
<v Speaker 4>that you're innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think the problem with that isn't </v>

610
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:13.830
<v Speaker 4>that there are no predatory men because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there are plenty of predatory men.</v>

611
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:15.023
<v Speaker 4>The problem is is that the courageous </v>
<v Speaker 4>way to deal with the problem of the </v>

612
00:37:19.021 --> 00:37:24.021
<v Speaker 4>Predator is to offer a hand in </v>
<v Speaker 4>courageous trust and to invite forward a</v>

613
00:37:24.241 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 4>partner from the monster that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's that mythological manner in which</v>

614
00:37:28.951 --> 00:37:31.770
<v Speaker 4>this is supposed to be undertaken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The courageous,</v>

615
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.950
<v Speaker 4>a courageous part of the woman's </v>
<v Speaker 4>journey,</v>

616
00:37:34.951 --> 00:37:35.784
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to face the monstrosity of a man and </v>

617
00:37:38.731 --> 00:37:42.420
<v Speaker 4>to invite out of that something more </v>
<v Speaker 4>noble to emerge.</v>

618
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.880
<v Speaker 4>And there's courage in that ingenuine </v>
<v Speaker 4>risk.</v>

619
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.690
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that's for gone in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>accusation process.</v>

620
00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:52.350
<v Speaker 4>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other element of that seems to me to</v>

621
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:53.880
<v Speaker 4>be that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

622
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:58.500
<v Speaker 4>if you are a Predator and irredeemable </v>
<v Speaker 4>in your predatory nature,</v>

623
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:02.370
<v Speaker 4>then the best thing to do is to render </v>
<v Speaker 4>you harmless.</v>

624
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.473
<v Speaker 4>And if we're going to obscure the </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship between competence and </v>

625
00:38:06.091 --> 00:38:06.924
<v Speaker 4>power and assume that all of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>striving upward is merely a </v>

626
00:38:09.421 --> 00:38:10.254
<v Speaker 4>manifestation of power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then what we'll do is we can do as much </v>

627
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.270
<v Speaker 4>as possible so that harmlessness can </v>
<v Speaker 4>replace virtue.</v>

628
00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:19.860
<v Speaker 4>And I see all of that driving these </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentful disciplines in there.</v>

629
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:23.070
<v Speaker 4>And their aim is the ems escalation with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the men.</v>

630
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the evil queen.</v>

631
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we have the evil king,</v>

632
00:38:26.551 --> 00:38:28.440
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the tyrannical patriarchy.</v>

633
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the evil queen is lurking somewhere.</v>

634
00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.230
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

635
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 4>the program is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot</v>

636
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:36.963
<v Speaker 3>of this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a society does not seem to have </v>

637
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.680
<v Speaker 3>the capacity to put that to one side and</v>
<v Speaker 3>set up rates the normal.</v>

638
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:50.310
<v Speaker 3>The fact that most men and most women </v>
<v Speaker 3>are not like that and that there is,</v>

639
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.453
<v Speaker 3>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a natural desire and need of the sexist </v>

640
00:38:54.921 --> 00:38:55.754
<v Speaker 3>to love each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be united and to create children and </v>

641
00:38:58.301 --> 00:38:59.350
<v Speaker 3>so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

642
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.273
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the old stability that that was </v>

643
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 3>built upon this has gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean that,</v>

644
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants.</v>

645
00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:11.290
<v Speaker 3>Nobody in the intellectual world wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>to celebrate that.</v>

646
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:12.560
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I,</v>

647
00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:15.790
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this interview a few a month</v>

648
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:20.790
<v Speaker 4>ago or so with a woman from Gq and she </v>
<v Speaker 4>was fully onboard the,</v>

649
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.280
<v Speaker 4>the predatory male train,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

650
00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people like that interview me,</v>

651
00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:28.990
<v Speaker 4>they start talking about the patriarchy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I say,</v>

652
00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:31.030
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in the patriarchy.</v>

653
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't buy that conceptual structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's so interesting,</v>

654
00:39:34.541 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 4>and this has happened more and more over</v>
<v Speaker 4>the years as they've developed this,</v>

655
00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:39.363
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the person that I would be talking to </v>

656
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:42.783
<v Speaker 4>had some idea that it was hypothetically</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible to reject the idea of the </v>

657
00:39:46.451 --> 00:39:47.284
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now when I say I don't believe in </v>

658
00:39:49.451 --> 00:39:50.140
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

659
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.390
<v Speaker 4>it's that idea is meant with stunned </v>
<v Speaker 4>disbelief.</v>

660
00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:53.960
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

661
00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.793
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean you don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the tyrannical Patriot that everyone </v>

662
00:39:58.181 --> 00:39:59.260
<v Speaker 4>knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

663
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.520
<v Speaker 4>And and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

664
00:40:00.521 --> 00:40:01.354
<v Speaker 4>so here's your hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is the hypothesis is that </v>

665
00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:08.200
<v Speaker 4>throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fundamental relationship between man</v>

666
00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:11.110
<v Speaker 4>and woman is one of parasitism and </v>
<v Speaker 4>exploitation.</v>

667
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.160
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

668
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:13.203
<v Speaker 4>and that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess until 1960 and the publication </v>

669
00:40:15.971 --> 00:40:17.920
<v Speaker 4>of the feminine Mystique or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

670
00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:20.740
<v Speaker 4>but that's the entire course of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>history that when the,</v>

671
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:21.783
<v Speaker 4>when it seems to me that the appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 4>story is that men and women labored </v>

672
00:40:25.451 --> 00:40:28.330
<v Speaker 4>mightily under their terrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>constraints for,</v>

673
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:33.490
<v Speaker 4>for uncounted centuries cooperating </v>
<v Speaker 4>together by and large to,</v>

674
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:38.500
<v Speaker 4>to build some modicum of security and </v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom and stability so that they could</v>

675
00:40:38.501 --> 00:40:39.334
<v Speaker 4>raise children and have a somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 4>harmonious and productive life and all </v>

676
00:40:42.761 --> 00:40:43.594
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden it's become not only </v>
<v Speaker 4>questionable to put forth that as a </v>

677
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:50.080
<v Speaker 4>proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but somehow tyrannical in,</v>

678
00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:50.973
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in essence just for positing it as a </v>

679
00:40:52.601 --> 00:40:55.450
<v Speaker 4>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the spot it because isn't it because</v>

680
00:40:55.451 --> 00:41:00.220
<v Speaker 4>of this peculiar view that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>underlying all of this</v>

681
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.790
<v Speaker 3>as a kind of social structure that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is being created.</v>

682
00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.930
<v Speaker 3>The distinction between men and women </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have it spaces in nature,</v>

683
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.033
<v Speaker 3>it's a basis is in the institutions that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have created and since we created </v>

684
00:41:12.911 --> 00:41:14.080
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can change them.</v>

685
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.153
<v Speaker 3>That there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been a sort of a kind of almost </v>

686
00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:22.660
<v Speaker 3>hysterical invasion of everything by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of human choice.</v>

687
00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there is,</v>

688
00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:27.970
<v Speaker 3>if there is a structure to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between men and women,</v>

689
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.340
<v Speaker 3>then we ought to be able to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>

690
00:41:31.341 --> 00:41:35.690
<v Speaker 3>chain it might mean that I have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change my sex in order to conform to the</v>

691
00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:38.810
<v Speaker 3>way things are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that also has become a choice.</v>

692
00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:39.371
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is,</v>

693
00:41:39.371 --> 00:41:39.980
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

694
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.500
<v Speaker 2>is not the very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

695
00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:48.140
<v Speaker 2>very a constant focus on division,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether between man and woman or between</v>

696
00:41:48.391 --> 00:41:49.224
<v Speaker 2>left and right to orbitz or between this</v>
<v Speaker 2>race and that race or any other way in </v>

697
00:41:52.801 --> 00:41:53.634
<v Speaker 2>which we might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might divide people according to </v>

698
00:41:55.981 --> 00:41:58.470
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that very polarized,</v>

699
00:41:58.471 --> 00:41:59.640
<v Speaker 2>fractured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

700
00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.280
<v Speaker 2>fractured polarization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

701
00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:07.080
<v Speaker 2>a sign of a loss of a common human </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture of,</v>

702
00:42:07.081 --> 00:42:07.371
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

703
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:07.671
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

704
00:42:07.671 --> 00:42:07.931
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

705
00:42:07.931 --> 00:42:08.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>

706
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.800
<v Speaker 2>of a universal plane in which we all we </v>
<v Speaker 2>all are as,</v>

707
00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.420
<v Speaker 2>as human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

708
00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 2>and so if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

709
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.700
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's,</v>

710
00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:17.790
<v Speaker 2>if that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that is.</v>

711
00:42:17.791 --> 00:42:22.791
<v Speaker 2>So I suppose what I take to be so very </v>
<v Speaker 2>urgent in our time,</v>

712
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

713
00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:28.830
<v Speaker 2>and I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be difficult to find anyone who</v>

714
00:42:28.831 --> 00:42:32.130
<v Speaker 2>at least when you go down to a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough level of resolution as you say,</v>

715
00:42:32.131 --> 00:42:32.964
<v Speaker 2>Jordan would not think this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we must recover that sense of our </v>

716
00:42:38.531 --> 00:42:43.531
<v Speaker 2>selves as</v>
<v Speaker 2>entities that participate in a universal</v>

717
00:42:45.871 --> 00:42:49.620
<v Speaker 2>and transcendent plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we have a common culture that I see</v>

718
00:42:49.621 --> 00:42:53.010
<v Speaker 2>myself in the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you were saying earlier at Roger,</v>

719
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.023
<v Speaker 2>and I'd like to have both of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts on what strategies were means </v>

720
00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.780
<v Speaker 2>for that recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

721
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.220
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps we can focus particularly on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

722
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

723
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:06.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

724
00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.120
<v Speaker 2>the questions that we started with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

725
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:09.983
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Art Music you've written extensively in </v>

726
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:13.920
<v Speaker 2>architecture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

727
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:14.803
<v Speaker 2>are our Roger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've thought long and hard about </v>

728
00:43:18.121 --> 00:43:19.470
<v Speaker 2>the humanities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>

729
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:20.410
<v Speaker 2>what does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does,</v>

730
00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:23.820
<v Speaker 2>what is the character of recovery?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we bring that about?</v>

731
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

732
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe again,</v>

733
00:43:27.651 --> 00:43:28.484
<v Speaker 3>I think that there are reversed what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to identify those aspects of the </v>

734
00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:39.101
<v Speaker 3>human condition that move of their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>accord towards reconciliation,</v>

735
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:40.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

736
00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.293
<v Speaker 3>rather than a conflict and a and </v>
<v Speaker 3>division of the sort that you're </v>

737
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:47.780
<v Speaker 3>referring to and we are very familiar </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

738
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:48.643
<v Speaker 3>It's not just that just love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of course is something which is a </v>

739
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:55.730
<v Speaker 3>very complex thing and can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't be just conjured from the skies,</v>

740
00:43:55.731 --> 00:43:56.564
<v Speaker 3>but there are other aspects of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>condition that we can educate through a </v>

741
00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:04.130
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

742
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.963
<v Speaker 3>through studying examples and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>through imitation and then through a </v>

743
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:09.303
<v Speaker 3>self discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously forgiveness is one of these </v>

744
00:44:11.841 --> 00:44:13.120
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

745
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:18.170
<v Speaker 3>and the habit of putting yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 3>another person's perspective,</v>

746
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.920
<v Speaker 3>looking at yourself from outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

747
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:21.763
<v Speaker 3>and wondering whether you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are as so seen acceptable to </v>

748
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:27.734
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

749
00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:28.521
<v Speaker 3>All those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

750
00:44:28.521 --> 00:44:29.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

751
00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:31.070
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

752
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:34.370
<v Speaker 3>the Christian religion at least was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

753
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:37.440
<v Speaker 3>built upon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of intellectual discipline.</v>

754
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:38.603
<v Speaker 3>The discipline of seeing your neighbor </v>
<v Speaker 3>as yourself and seeing yourself </v>

755
00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:46.500
<v Speaker 3>therefore as Amir neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

756
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:47.363
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

757
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:50.520
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suspect that you have,</v>

758
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:55.550
<v Speaker 3>we have to revive those basic moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>discipline's not for,</v>

759
00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:01.590
<v Speaker 3>for the use of people who don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>overarching faith,</v>

760
00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:06.830
<v Speaker 3>the belief in the transcendental </v>
<v Speaker 3>judgment to which we will we all called,</v>

761
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.033
<v Speaker 3>but who nevertheless have to be shown </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we do live our lives as an object </v>

762
00:45:12.091 --> 00:45:13.470
<v Speaker 3>of judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nevertheless,</v>

763
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:18.370
<v Speaker 3>and here are some guides just read Anna </v>
<v Speaker 3>Karenina for,</v>

764
00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.100
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

765
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.413
<v Speaker 3>I know it takes a long time for facebook</v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted youth to read Anna Anna </v>

766
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Karenina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's still hope,</v>

767
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:28.103
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

768
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:30.190
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're likely to listen to it if it</v>

769
00:45:30.191 --> 00:45:32.060
<v Speaker 4>becomes an audio book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

770
00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:33.290
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

771
00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:34.713
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because maybe more people can listen </v>

772
00:45:35.771 --> 00:45:37.420
<v Speaker 4>then can read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

773
00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:40.180
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's,</v>

774
00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.890
<v Speaker 4>let's think about literature for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

775
00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:42.843
<v Speaker 4>for a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so now if you read something like a </v>

776
00:45:46.631 --> 00:45:51.631
<v Speaker 4>dusty see novel or Anna Karenina,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not really reading the account of</v>

777
00:45:52.841 --> 00:45:53.674
<v Speaker 4>a single person's life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you're reading is it like the </v>

778
00:45:57.341 --> 00:45:58.174
<v Speaker 4>author has taken a variety of lives and </v>
<v Speaker 4>amalgamated them in unified them into </v>

779
00:46:03.581 --> 00:46:06.790
<v Speaker 4>something that's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a compilation of lives,</v>

780
00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.280
<v Speaker 4>so it's life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like life writ large,</v>

781
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:14.050
<v Speaker 4>so that's what fiction is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more true than than reality because</v>

782
00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:15.123
<v Speaker 4>just like a mathematical abstraction can</v>
<v Speaker 4>be more real than the thing that it </v>

783
00:46:17.621 --> 00:46:19.270
<v Speaker 4>represents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In some sense.</v>

784
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.000
<v Speaker 4>The fiction is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a.</v>

785
00:46:22.001 --> 00:46:24.280
<v Speaker 4>it's like a portrait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you sit for a portrait,</v>

786
00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.473
<v Speaker 4>you'll sit and the artist will paint you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you'll sit again and then </v>

787
00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:29.020
<v Speaker 4>you'll say it again and then you'll say </v>
<v Speaker 4>it again,</v>

788
00:46:29.021 --> 00:46:32.260
<v Speaker 4>and so the portrait is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 4>composite of you,</v>

789
00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:35.380
<v Speaker 4>and so it's got a richness sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 4>that a photograph can't match,</v>

790
00:46:35.381 --> 00:46:39.070
<v Speaker 4>and a fictional character is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 4>composite of many people,</v>

791
00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.173
<v Speaker 4>and so the opportunity to read a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>work of fiction is the opportunity to </v>

792
00:46:44.291 --> 00:46:45.124
<v Speaker 4>place yourself in the perspective not of</v>
<v Speaker 4>merely another person like you do in </v>

793
00:46:49.721 --> 00:46:54.430
<v Speaker 4>normal discourse in a mundane setting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to place yourself in the perspective</v>

794
00:46:54.431 --> 00:46:56.500
<v Speaker 4>of a compiled character.</v>

795
00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.393
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've experienced that extraordinarily </v>

796
00:46:58.991 --> 00:47:03.160
<v Speaker 4>powerfully with dusty eskies crime and </v>
<v Speaker 4>punishment to put myself in the position</v>

797
00:47:03.161 --> 00:47:08.161
<v Speaker 4>of this student who was nihilistic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>who had every reason to commit murder.</v>

798
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:09.993
<v Speaker 4>And it's an unbelievably intense novel </v>
<v Speaker 4>because everybody in the novel is hyper </v>

799
00:47:14.321 --> 00:47:17.770
<v Speaker 4>real and we think of fiction as falsity </v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

800
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:18.783
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

801
00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.590
<v Speaker 4>or as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as untruth.</v>

802
00:47:20.591 --> 00:47:21.590
<v Speaker 4>And it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

803
00:47:21.591 --> 00:47:23.170
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's abstraction.</v>

804
00:47:23.171 --> 00:47:25.070
<v Speaker 4>An abstraction isn't untruth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

805
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.033
<v Speaker 4>it's more than truth often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the humanities help us walk </v>

806
00:47:30.311 --> 00:47:31.144
<v Speaker 4>through the souls of others and because </v>
<v Speaker 4>we can imitate and it's one of our </v>

807
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 4>primary remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>miraculous abilities.</v>

808
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:38.793
<v Speaker 4>We can imitate the compiled characters </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we encounter in literature and </v>

809
00:47:43.391 --> 00:47:44.224
<v Speaker 4>mythology and religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that does help flush us out and </v>

810
00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:48.580
<v Speaker 4>ennoble us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we can,</v>

811
00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:49.443
<v Speaker 4>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wrote the Foreword to </v>

812
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:56.410
<v Speaker 4>Solzhenitsyn's Fiftieth Anniversary </v>
<v Speaker 4>version of,</v>

813
00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:58.510
<v Speaker 4>of the Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the abridged version.</v>

814
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:59.343
<v Speaker 4>And I ran across his wish that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people could learn from what he </v>

815
00:48:05.351 --> 00:48:06.184
<v Speaker 4>communicated all the horror and </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering to put themselves in the </v>

816
00:48:09.401 --> 00:48:13.840
<v Speaker 4>position of both the perpetrator and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the accused simultaneously.</v>

817
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 4>And to decide that that's not the road </v>
<v Speaker 4>to walk down.</v>

818
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:19.023
<v Speaker 4>And so the advantage of placing yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the position of other people is that </v>

819
00:48:22.271 --> 00:48:24.070
<v Speaker 4>if they're good people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can be like them,</v>

820
00:48:24.071 --> 00:48:26.740
<v Speaker 4>and if they're not good people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can avoid that pathway.</v>

821
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.810
<v Speaker 4>And then you don't have to learn that </v>
<v Speaker 4>through,</v>

822
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:29.883
<v Speaker 4>through the agony of direct personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience in the short span of your </v>

823
00:48:33.371 --> 00:48:35.170
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing more,</v>

824
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:36.303
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing greater than you can do </v>
<v Speaker 4>for people then to introduce them into </v>

825
00:48:39.281 --> 00:48:40.114
<v Speaker 4>those patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stories so that they can gain from the </v>

826
00:48:42.341 --> 00:48:44.020
<v Speaker 4>catastrophes of the past.</v>

827
00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.270
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

828
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.430
<v Speaker 3>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

829
00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:53.610
<v Speaker 3>in fiction ones also concerned to </v>
<v Speaker 3>identify if you're writing fiction,</v>

830
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:55.503
<v Speaker 3>identify with the character in order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that character because it's </v>

831
00:49:00.251 --> 00:49:03.510
<v Speaker 3>not as though</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

832
00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:04.663
<v Speaker 3>you can't actually grasp a character </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the outside that you have to be </v>

833
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:13.540
<v Speaker 3>able to see through his eyes what it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the world is in which he is.</v>

834
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:14.470
<v Speaker 3>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

835
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:17.770
<v Speaker 3>an exercise of the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I value greatly.</v>

836
00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:19.350
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

837
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:20.943
<v Speaker 3>you don't necessarily come to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion that therefore I don't want </v>

838
00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 3>to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be just enough to say,</v>

839
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.110
<v Speaker 3>now I see that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

840
00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.230
<v Speaker 3>that that's a possible human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

841
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:32.103
<v Speaker 3>and you knowledge of the possibilities </v>
<v Speaker 3>is amplified and your sense and your </v>

842
00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:41.170
<v Speaker 3>ability to position yourself in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities also,</v>

843
00:49:41.171 --> 00:49:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

844
00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.930
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a matter of differentiation as</v>

845
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:45.340
<v Speaker 4>well as direct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

846
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:50.320
<v Speaker 4>I think sometimes in my more dire </v>
<v Speaker 4>moments that this opposition to cultural</v>

847
00:49:50.321 --> 00:49:52.210
<v Speaker 4>appropriation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

848
00:49:52.211 --> 00:49:53.044
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that I'm not allowed anymore</v>
<v Speaker 4>to imagine myself say fictionally as a </v>

849
00:49:56.321 --> 00:49:59.200
<v Speaker 4>woman or as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or as a character from another ethnicity</v>

850
00:49:59.201 --> 00:50:02.710
<v Speaker 4>or even to play the role that role as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an actor,</v>

851
00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:03.813
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's part of the assault on the idea of </v>

852
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:08.373
<v Speaker 4>the individual and the non zero sum game</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it precludes the possibility </v>

853
00:50:13.631 --> 00:50:15.940
<v Speaker 4>that I can take on the role of another </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

854
00:50:15.941 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 4>and understanding manner and actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>facilitated dialogue.</v>

855
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.133
<v Speaker 4>And that undermines the claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that everything is only a </v>

856
00:50:23.081 --> 00:50:26.950
<v Speaker 4>secondary consequence of power because </v>
<v Speaker 4>if I can actually bridge that gap,</v>

857
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.280
<v Speaker 4>well then I'm not isolated in my group </v>
<v Speaker 4>or my ethnicity or whatever it is I can.</v>

858
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:32.203
<v Speaker 4>I can become partly you and we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate and I would say because of </v>

859
00:50:35.121 --> 00:50:38.270
<v Speaker 4>that literature and art is a great </v>
<v Speaker 4>threat to ideology,</v>

860
00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:41.510
<v Speaker 4>especially of the group identity kind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course they're perfectly aware of</v>

861
00:50:41.511 --> 00:50:42.344
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why the radicals on that side </v>

862
00:50:43.791 --> 00:50:45.790
<v Speaker 4>of the equation are doing everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can to,</v>

863
00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.073
<v Speaker 4>to a reporter from the New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 4>who wrote a rather scurrilous piece </v>

864
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:52.970
<v Speaker 4>about me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had done the literature degree at,</v>

865
00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.270
<v Speaker 4>at Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bright woman,</v>

866
00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.253
<v Speaker 4>and she told me in all honesty and an </v>
<v Speaker 4>apparent transparency that she had no </v>

867
00:51:01.221 --> 00:51:02.054
<v Speaker 4>idea this is how deep this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This has become saturated into our </v>

868
00:51:05.961 --> 00:51:08.090
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had no idea until she,</v>

869
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.193
<v Speaker 4>until she had graduated from Columbia </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there was any other way of reading </v>

870
00:51:13.491 --> 00:51:16.340
<v Speaker 4>a work of literature except through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>postmodern Lens.</v>

871
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.473
<v Speaker 4>And the postmodern Lens is well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are the groups that are being </v>

872
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:25.190
<v Speaker 4>represented and what power games are at </v>
<v Speaker 4>play and who benefits.</v>

873
00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I mean,</v>

874
00:51:26.421 --> 00:51:29.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if because she turned out </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be quite a strange person.</v>

875
00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:30.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

876
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:31.663
<v Speaker 4>so I have no idea if that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that was a ploy on her part or </v>

877
00:51:34.131 --> 00:51:36.050
<v Speaker 4>whether that was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

878
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.590
<v Speaker 4>a naive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you call confession,</v>

879
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:40.753
<v Speaker 4>but it's increasingly the case that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is how literature is taught in my </v>

880
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:46.730
<v Speaker 4>home province of Ontario.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Elementary Teachers,</v>

881
00:51:46.731 --> 00:51:47.564
<v Speaker 4>Federation of Ontario wants to start </v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching literature from a postmodern </v>

882
00:51:50.331 --> 00:51:53.690
<v Speaker 4>critical perspective in elementary </v>
<v Speaker 4>school to demolish it.</v>

883
00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:55.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there we,</v>

884
00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm in favor of cultural,</v>

885
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:59.890
<v Speaker 3>cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

886
00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm a product of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

887
00:52:01.271 --> 00:52:04.920
<v Speaker 3>I appropriated the idea of the English </v>
<v Speaker 3>gentleman and,</v>

888
00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm trying to make myself be it a,</v>

889
00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:14.110
<v Speaker 3>I know it's a Paideia</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's part of doing it well,</v>

890
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.820
<v Speaker 3>but I've understood the world from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside and another way.</v>

891
00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.970
<v Speaker 3>But in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wrote a book of stories which was</v>

892
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:23.013
<v Speaker 3>reviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

893
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who says,</v>

894
00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:25.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

895
00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:29.500
<v Speaker 3>these stories make cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriation into a virtue.</v>

896
00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:32.160
<v Speaker 3>So I felt good about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

897
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.340
<v Speaker 3>they begin with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an inside view of the psyche,</v>

898
00:52:36.341 --> 00:52:37.174
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

899
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.990
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

900
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:39.070
<v Speaker 3>a terrorist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have an,</v>

901
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an Arab terrorists who,</v>

902
00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:44.440
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who has a legacy of vengeance and,</v>

903
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:48.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is a failure and</v>

904
00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:53.260
<v Speaker 3>who's lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to make real in the,</v>

905
00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:55.990
<v Speaker 3>in the feelings of the reader as he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as he reads it.</v>

906
00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:58.170
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

907
00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.013
<v Speaker 3>and then the subsequent stories show the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same kind of loss in completely </v>

908
00:53:01.931 --> 00:53:03.160
<v Speaker 3>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

909
00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to bring up that a book of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>

910
00:53:06.331 --> 00:53:10.920
<v Speaker 2>actually a souls in twilight by Sir </v>
<v Speaker 2>Roger Scruton,</v>

911
00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:12.413
<v Speaker 2>a series of five short stories of five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is it five short stories each </v>

912
00:53:16.351 --> 00:53:19.650
<v Speaker 2>which are our portraits of a character </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a certain moment in time.</v>

913
00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:20.963
<v Speaker 2>I think it's safe to say Roger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're all tragic stories in a </v>

914
00:53:23.641 --> 00:53:26.430
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I found,</v>

915
00:53:26.431 --> 00:53:27.264
<v Speaker 2>so moving about those stories is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these are individuals in states of </v>

916
00:53:32.401 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 2>dislocation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anchor lists,</v>

917
00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:38.400
<v Speaker 2>seeking depth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning truth,</v>

918
00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:40.080
<v Speaker 2>stability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

919
00:53:40.081 --> 00:53:43.620
<v Speaker 2>and yet in their confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their darkness,</v>

920
00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:46.350
<v Speaker 2>willing against that very thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they seek,</v>

921
00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:47.184
<v Speaker 2>or you might say violating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're transgressing that sacred thing </v>

922
00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:51.144
<v Speaker 2>that they're longing for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what's beautiful about the </v>

923
00:53:55.171 --> 00:53:56.280
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

924
00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:57.493
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's beautiful is that in the reading </v>

925
00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:00.713
<v Speaker 2>the reader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her or himself comes to a sense of what </v>

926
00:54:04.891 --> 00:54:08.670
<v Speaker 2>that longing is for positively a sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

927
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:13.940
<v Speaker 2>the stability of love or out of home or </v>
<v Speaker 2>have relationship.</v>

928
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:17.880
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

929
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:18.713
<v Speaker 2>and I suppose what I want to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>following up on this is that that seems </v>

930
00:54:22.621 --> 00:54:26.010
<v Speaker 2>to be a profoundly redemptive vision </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have in that,</v>

931
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.170
<v Speaker 2>in those beautiful stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roger,</v>

932
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:31.650
<v Speaker 2>at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's showing the persistence of the</v>

933
00:54:31.651 --> 00:54:35.580
<v Speaker 2>beautiful and have the good even in its </v>
<v Speaker 2>absence,</v>

934
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:36.503
<v Speaker 2>that I can read that story and have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception of what positively I am I am </v>

935
00:54:39.841 --> 00:54:42.520
<v Speaker 2>looking for and just try to refer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you say in,</v>

936
00:54:42.521 --> 00:54:43.860
<v Speaker 2>in one of your books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan,</v>

937
00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:46.960
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that even through an experience of,</v>

938
00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:52.020
<v Speaker 2>of evil one can develop an apprehension </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what the good is.</v>

939
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.800
<v Speaker 2>And wondering if you could each say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about the,</v>

940
00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:57.143
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either either there is our reality to </v>

941
00:55:00.841 --> 00:55:01.674
<v Speaker 2>these transcendent things where there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the condition did either just a </v>

942
00:55:03.661 --> 00:55:04.494
<v Speaker 2>construct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goodness or beauty and truth or they </v>

943
00:55:06.421 --> 00:55:08.220
<v Speaker 2>have a transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

944
00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.850
<v Speaker 2>and sovereign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>persistent re reality.</v>

945
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 2>And I'm wondering if you can each say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about the,</v>

946
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:17.543
<v Speaker 2>the persistence or sovereignty of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things even amidst our darkness and a </v>

947
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:24.563
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>

948
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

949
00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:30.660
<v Speaker 3>I would say that in tragedy when tragedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israeli effective,</v>

950
00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.413
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a redemption offered in this </v>

951
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.350
<v Speaker 3>through suffering the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

952
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:38.070
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

953
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:40.060
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the we,</v>

954
00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:41.603
<v Speaker 3>we encounter the possibility in tragedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that a human being can through the most </v>

955
00:55:46.711 --> 00:55:47.544
<v Speaker 3>noble motives also</v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing on down upon himself </v>

956
00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:55.820
<v Speaker 3>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

957
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:56.963
<v Speaker 3>this destruction is no different from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the destruction that's going to affect </v>

958
00:55:59.461 --> 00:56:02.710
<v Speaker 3>all of us in the end anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here is somebody who,</v>

959
00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:06.480
<v Speaker 3>who has faced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's down in some way that his Nova,</v>

960
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:07.363
<v Speaker 3>who's ability of nature and his ability </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go out towards others in a condition </v>

961
00:56:11.821 --> 00:56:12.654
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of love and reconciliation has not been </v>

962
00:56:15.031 --> 00:56:15.864
<v Speaker 3>taken away from him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the spectacle of that is all the </v>

963
00:56:20.881 --> 00:56:23.310
<v Speaker 3>more intense because nevertheless,</v>

964
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:29.240
<v Speaker 4>the death intervenes and takes him away </v>
<v Speaker 4>as it will take you and me away.</v>

965
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.120
<v Speaker 4>But without having had the chance to </v>
<v Speaker 4>reveal a nobility or even to acquire it,</v>

966
00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:35.161
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

967
00:56:35.161 --> 00:56:40.161
<v Speaker 4>I think that for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very important that in literature,</v>

968
00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:45.820
<v Speaker 4>a noble characters are seen in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>condition of loss sometimes that,</v>

969
00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:48.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and their,</v>

970
00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:49.573
<v Speaker 4>their redemption comes because even </v>
<v Speaker 4>though they've lost what we all must in </v>

971
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:56.043
<v Speaker 4>the end lose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is that in which is struggling </v>

972
00:56:59.111 --> 00:57:02.590
<v Speaker 4>towards reconciliation with their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>condition and with others,</v>

973
00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:07.800
<v Speaker 4>it's the sense that they are living as </v>
<v Speaker 4>another and not as a self.</v>

974
00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:08.690
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

975
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:09.523
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a crucial thing that see </v>

976
00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:12.893
<v Speaker 4>the Gulag archipelago is often viewed as</v>
<v Speaker 4>an endless documentation of the horrors </v>

977
00:57:17.591 --> 00:57:20.890
<v Speaker 4>of the Soviet enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was an investigation.</v>

978
00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:21.813
<v Speaker 4>It was an experiment in literary </v>
<v Speaker 4>investigation and that isn't what the </v>

979
00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:26.674
<v Speaker 4>book is about.</v>

980
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:31.920
<v Speaker 4>The book is about Solzhenitsyn's </v>
<v Speaker 4>observations of people in those terrible</v>

981
00:57:32.231 --> 00:57:33.064
<v Speaker 4>situations who did not contribute to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>terror and who transcended it and the </v>

982
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:39.783
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful impact observing that had on </v>

983
00:57:43.421 --> 00:57:44.254
<v Speaker 4>him and the personal transformation he </v>
<v Speaker 4>underwent as a consequence of observing </v>

984
00:57:47.771 --> 00:57:48.604
<v Speaker 4>those people and the decision he made </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of seeing them in their </v>

985
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.133
<v Speaker 4>ultimately tragic circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcend that to to to transform his </v>

986
00:57:58.031 --> 00:57:58.864
<v Speaker 4>life from the bottom up and to write </v>
<v Speaker 4>this great book and to reveal the utter </v>

987
00:58:02.381 --> 00:58:03.214
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe of that entire ideological </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement and so you deal see the light </v>

988
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:09.063
<v Speaker 4>most clearly when it's super imposed </v>
<v Speaker 4>against the darkest possible background </v>

989
00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:13.623
<v Speaker 4>and so and great literature which polls </v>
<v Speaker 4>people way down into the depths and in </v>

990
00:58:17.651 --> 00:58:18.580
<v Speaker 4>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this,</v>

991
00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:20.650
<v Speaker 4>in this compiled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fictional manner.</v>

992
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:24.010
<v Speaker 4>Then it also does at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 4>highlight what's what's.</v>

993
00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:29.070
<v Speaker 4>What's the opposite of that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I it by reading of</v>

994
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:30.730
<v Speaker 2>of your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

995
00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:32.440
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your work,</v>

996
00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:33.663
<v Speaker 2>both of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an implicitly theological </v>

997
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:38.103
<v Speaker 2>character here and we can't speak about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the transcendent in a certain sense </v>

998
00:58:40.721 --> 00:58:45.721
<v Speaker 2>without being theological at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that we can't just delights,</v>

999
00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:48.580
<v Speaker 2>just can't be completely shut out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1000
00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.210
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1001
00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:50.043
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1002
00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.213
<v Speaker 2>if evil and darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the sovereign principles as a </v>

1003
00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:56.530
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it might say,</v>

1004
00:58:56.531 --> 00:58:57.700
<v Speaker 2>metaphysically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1005
00:58:57.701 --> 00:58:59.810
<v Speaker 2>they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could just be all delights,</v>

1006
00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:03.910
<v Speaker 2>could just be completely blackened and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet that's not what we see.</v>

1007
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.820
<v Speaker 2>And I'm wondering if you would each </v>
<v Speaker 2>comment on the,</v>

1008
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:11.740
<v Speaker 2>what you take to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what,</v>

1009
00:59:11.741 --> 00:59:14.800
<v Speaker 2>what might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what might be a theological articulation</v>

1010
00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:19.030
<v Speaker 2>of the facts on the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the facts are that you can't shut the</v>

1011
00:59:19.031 --> 00:59:20.740
<v Speaker 2>lights right out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is still there.</v>

1012
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:21.810
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1013
00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:23.593
<v Speaker 3>what's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally agree with what Jordan said </v>

1014
00:59:26.751 --> 00:59:30.050
<v Speaker 3>about the Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1015
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:34.510
<v Speaker 3>and that goes back to just ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1016
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.120
<v Speaker 3>from the house with the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1017
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:40.010
<v Speaker 3>his accountant of being in Osiris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much milder,</v>

1018
00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:41.123
<v Speaker 3>we've kind of imprisonment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nevertheless it was almost a </v>

1019
00:59:43.281 --> 00:59:45.620
<v Speaker 3>vacation home in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1020
00:59:45.621 --> 00:59:47.020
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But nevertheless,</v>

1021
00:59:47.021 --> 00:59:49.820
<v Speaker 3>he described these characters who for </v>
<v Speaker 3>whom,</v>

1022
00:59:49.821 --> 00:59:54.821
<v Speaker 3>that everything has been taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he also notes that in each of them I</v>

1023
00:59:56.991 --> 01:00:01.991
<v Speaker 3>can find the spark of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something which Janacek repeated when he</v>

1024
01:00:03.081 --> 01:00:03.914
<v Speaker 3>made this into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that wonderful Libretto for his </v>

1025
01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:11.350
<v Speaker 3>opera and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Yana check tractor show in music.</v>

1026
01:00:11.571 --> 01:00:15.830
<v Speaker 3>How these derelict characters will </v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly shine with that,</v>

1027
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:16.723
<v Speaker 3>with that light from another source that</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't come just from what they are in </v>

1028
01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.990
<v Speaker 3>those circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from something higher.</v>

1029
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.280
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1030
01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:29.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say one is always obliged to use</v>

1031
01:00:29.721 --> 01:00:33.810
<v Speaker 3>metaphors when we get to this point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is true that,</v>

1032
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:35.083
<v Speaker 3>that you can find in someone even in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most deprived and desolate </v>

1033
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:43.810
<v Speaker 3>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that home which you can blow to co two,</v>

1034
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.930
<v Speaker 3>caused a spark once again to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to light up inside him.</v>

1035
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:51.890
<v Speaker 3>And that is as far as we get to meeting </v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

1036
01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.233
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1037
01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:58.160
<v Speaker 3>there is no reason to think that we need</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get any further in my view.</v>

1038
01:00:58.310 --> 01:00:59.143
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what everybody saw in Maximilian </v>

1039
01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:06.190
<v Speaker 3>Colby when he offered himself in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1040
01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:08.210
<v Speaker 3>in Auschwitz for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1041
01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:11.880
<v Speaker 3>to sacrifice why he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1042
01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:16.370
<v Speaker 3>a canonized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly you see that there is something</v>

1043
01:01:16.371 --> 01:01:21.290
<v Speaker 3>else in all of us in which in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances,</v>

1044
01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:22.124
<v Speaker 3>however severe and deprived will will </v>
<v Speaker 3>shine from with a different light and </v>

1045
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:31.630
<v Speaker 3>make those circumstances worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they produced that light.</v>

1046
01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:32.643
<v Speaker 3>It couldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some sense the mercy of God that </v>

1047
01:01:34.461 --> 01:01:39.461
<v Speaker 3>keeps him hidden from us because if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that your sacred duty is to blow</v>

1048
01:01:40.911 --> 01:01:41.744
<v Speaker 3>on those embers that you described,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even among people who are in desolate </v>

1049
01:01:45.441 --> 01:01:46.274
<v Speaker 3>straights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then every time you fail to take that </v>

1050
01:01:49.161 --> 01:01:49.994
<v Speaker 3>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you tell things badly towards what </v>

1051
01:01:52.551 --> 01:01:54.020
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't be tilted towards.</v>

1052
01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.033
<v Speaker 3>And it could be that the revelation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your inadequacy in the face of that </v>

1053
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:59.743
<v Speaker 3>moral duty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would be in some sense equivalent </v>

1054
01:02:02.061 --> 01:02:05.840
<v Speaker 3>to an encounter with God would be enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>to tear you into pieces.</v>

1055
01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:09.230
<v Speaker 3>And so maybe you get glimpses of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>now and then because that's,</v>

1056
01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:14.150
<v Speaker 3>that's all you in your current depraved </v>
<v Speaker 3>moral state could stand of seeing of the</v>

1057
01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:14.984
<v Speaker 3>face of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's something to that </v>

1058
01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:21.090
<v Speaker 3>that's similar and says things to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>

1059
01:02:21.091 --> 01:02:21.990
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1060
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:23.600
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1061
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:24.443
<v Speaker 3>So I often heard in the old communist </v>
<v Speaker 3>days when I used to travel around </v>

1062
01:02:27.991 --> 01:02:28.824
<v Speaker 3>Eastern Europe and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and meet people who are in really dire </v>

1063
01:02:31.561 --> 01:02:32.311
<v Speaker 3>straits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe,</v>

1064
01:02:32.311 --> 01:02:33.840
<v Speaker 3>said similar things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1065
01:02:33.841 --> 01:02:34.890
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1066
01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:38.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that God would reveal himself.</v>

1067
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:40.200
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1068
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.033
<v Speaker 3>in these circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the revelation will be something too </v>

1069
01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:45.010
<v Speaker 3>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I could bear.</v>

1070
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.300
<v Speaker 4>That's a beautiful image you've given </v>
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

1071
01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.193
<v Speaker 4>Roger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of blowing on the embers within blowing </v>

1072
01:02:54.531 --> 01:02:56.900
<v Speaker 4>on the embers of transcendence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1073
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:58.543
<v Speaker 4>I'd ask you both about the forms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture and institutional life that </v>

1074
01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.340
<v Speaker 4>produce that blowing on the embers in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the individual.</v>

1075
01:03:07.341 --> 01:03:08.174
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me both of you have a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>deep sense of the dignity of the human </v>

1076
01:03:12.501 --> 01:03:13.334
<v Speaker 4>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the individual's connection to the </v>

1077
01:03:16.581 --> 01:03:20.990
<v Speaker 4>transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the grounding fact of our existence.</v>

1078
01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:26.620
<v Speaker 4>What would be the forms of culture that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we would say to be necessary or most,</v>

1079
01:03:27.590 --> 01:03:28.423
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most inclined to foster in the </v>

1080
01:03:31.191 --> 01:03:36.191
<v Speaker 4>individual that blowing of the flame?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the most accessible form for,</v>

1081
01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:40.803
<v Speaker 4>for most people is music and music to me</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the most representational form of </v>

1082
01:03:45.501 --> 01:03:46.334
<v Speaker 4>art.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I think that the world is made </v>

1083
01:03:47.931 --> 01:03:52.010
<v Speaker 4>out of patterns and we perceive some </v>
<v Speaker 4>patterns as objects,</v>

1084
01:03:52.011 --> 01:03:52.844
<v Speaker 4>but fundamentally it's patterns and what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want is all the patterns of the </v>

1085
01:03:56.781 --> 01:03:57.614
<v Speaker 4>world to interact harmoniously in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in something where every element is </v>

1086
01:04:01.311 --> 01:04:03.620
<v Speaker 4>related,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligibly to every other element.</v>

1087
01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.930
<v Speaker 4>And I think that when your life is in </v>
<v Speaker 4>harmony,</v>

1088
01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.093
<v Speaker 4>that you can feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you're dancing to beautiful </v>

1089
01:04:09.321 --> 01:04:10.790
<v Speaker 4>music,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're acting that out.</v>

1090
01:04:10.791 --> 01:04:13.040
<v Speaker 4>It's the music is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the,</v>

1091
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.963
<v Speaker 4>is the music of the spheres,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're participating in the </v>

1092
01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.010
<v Speaker 4>powdering of your being in accordance </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that structure.</v>

1093
01:04:19.011 --> 01:04:22.340
<v Speaker 4>And that gives you an intimation of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of transcendence.</v>

1094
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.160
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not criticizable.</v>

1095
01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:26.780
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing that's so lovely about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1096
01:04:26.781 --> 01:04:27.614
<v Speaker 4>is even as our society has become more </v>
<v Speaker 4>cynical and more self destructive and </v>

1097
01:04:31.551 --> 01:04:32.384
<v Speaker 4>more deconstructionist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the power of music has in fact grown </v>

1098
01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:35.804
<v Speaker 4>because it speaks to that eternal </v>
<v Speaker 4>harmony and the reality of that eternal </v>

1099
01:04:39.891 --> 01:04:43.730
<v Speaker 4>harmony in a way that mere intellect </v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot deny.</v>

1100
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.500
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've was always amused.</v>

1101
01:04:45.501 --> 01:04:46.770
<v Speaker 4>I went to this show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1102
01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.340
<v Speaker 4>the ramones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a punk band from New York.</v>

1103
01:04:49.341 --> 01:04:50.174
<v Speaker 4>It was the loudest concert I'd ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>heard by by a good factor of 10 in my </v>

1104
01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:58.850
<v Speaker 4>ears rang for like three days afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there were all these like nihilistic</v>

1105
01:04:58.851 --> 01:05:02.180
<v Speaker 4>punk rockers all crammed into this </v>
<v Speaker 4>theater and below me.</v>

1106
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:05.300
<v Speaker 4>There was a mosh pit and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>ants on a frying pan.</v>

1107
01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:09.950
<v Speaker 4>They were just smashing into each other </v>
<v Speaker 4>and throwing people around up above them</v>

1108
01:05:09.951 --> 01:05:10.784
<v Speaker 4>and it was quite rough and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 4>having this beautifully transcendent </v>

1109
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.983
<v Speaker 4>musical experience which belied all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nihilism and it was and they absolutely </v>

1110
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:21.590
<v Speaker 4>thrived on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

1111
01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:24.160
<v Speaker 4>and even the lyrics were harsh and </v>
<v Speaker 4>nihilistic,</v>

1112
01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:27.130
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't matter because the music,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's rough,</v>

1113
01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:27.993
<v Speaker 4>even if it's in its rough form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was something that united them in the </v>

1114
01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:36.061
<v Speaker 4>sense of this like pattern beauty and </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought them together and so exposure to</v>

1115
01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:40.690
<v Speaker 4>music that's people die without music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like music is everything.</v>

1116
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not everything but I beg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's everything about the beauty of this</v>

1117
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:47.260
<v Speaker 4>particular experience</v>

1118
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:54.080
<v Speaker 3>I think actually don't see it as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely important phenomenon.</v>

1119
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:59.400
<v Speaker 3>It partly because traditionally dancing </v>
<v Speaker 3>was dancing with someone.</v>

1120
01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:05.050
<v Speaker 3>The width has been taken out of dancing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1121
01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:05.923
<v Speaker 3>the head bashing and so on that goes on </v>
<v Speaker 3>with heavy metal and the right is </v>

1122
01:06:09.721 --> 01:06:12.370
<v Speaker 3>dancing against someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1123
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:14.370
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wideness of the dancers.</v>

1124
01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.233
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We see it in Scottish reels and things </v>

1125
01:06:17.881 --> 01:06:21.510
<v Speaker 3>like that where the whole community is </v>
<v Speaker 3>dancing in an orderly way,</v>

1126
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:26.750
<v Speaker 3>recognizing that their need for law and </v>
<v Speaker 3>order and taking pleasure in it.</v>

1127
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:27.693
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that a very near to a </v>

1128
01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:31.920
<v Speaker 3>transcendent experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1129
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:33.023
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel a kind of narcissism has crept </v>

1130
01:06:34.621 --> 01:06:39.180
<v Speaker 3>into the dance with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through recent forms of dance music,</v>

1131
01:06:39.181 --> 01:06:41.370
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my old geezer</v>

1132
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.000
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1133
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:43.511
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1134
01:06:43.511 --> 01:06:45.190
<v Speaker 2>or his or his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1135
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.530
<v Speaker 2>or is it simply to say that there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1136
01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:54.280
<v Speaker 2>that the principle itself is sovereign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It everyone thinks about the logic,</v>

1137
01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:55.050
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1138
01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:56.890
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Dante's inferno,</v>

1139
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:58.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1140
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:02.620
<v Speaker 2>which has ever more degraded forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing and loving,</v>

1141
01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1142
01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

1143
01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:09.243
<v Speaker 2>the mechanism of the nature of you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the nature of the soul is the same </v>

1144
01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:18.070
<v Speaker 2>at the top of paradise as it is at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the bottom of inferno,</v>

1145
01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:22.990
<v Speaker 2>but it has all these infinite gradations</v>
<v Speaker 2>of wholeness.</v>

1146
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.940
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't think we have to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1147
01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:25.803
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

1148
01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:28.040
<v Speaker 2>the mosh pit is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1149
01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:28.620
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1150
01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:29.220
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1151
01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:31.690
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is equivalent as a work of art to,</v>

1152
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.650
<v Speaker 2>to Beethoven or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Palestrina or Janacek,</v>

1153
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:39.460
<v Speaker 2>but rather than perhaps what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1154
01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.730
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that is nonetheless a longing for the</v>

1155
01:07:42.731 --> 01:07:46.070
<v Speaker 2>pattern and the recognition of the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you,</v>

1156
01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.093
<v Speaker 2>you say</v>

1157
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:48.263
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your original question was how do </v>

1158
01:07:49.891 --> 01:07:51.390
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we,</v>

1159
01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:52.563
<v Speaker 3>a coax people back into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a life which is based on the </v>

1160
01:07:57.121 --> 01:08:00.270
<v Speaker 3>recognition of the other rather than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gratification of the self.</v>

1161
01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.840
<v Speaker 3>Because that's essentially what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about with the</v>

1162
01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.240
<v Speaker 3>today at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1163
01:08:06.290 --> 01:08:11.290
<v Speaker 3>I would say teaching people how to help </v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

1164
01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:14.160
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the role of the teacher,</v>

1165
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:15.583
<v Speaker 3>is it very dignified one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's only so if the teacher actually </v>

1166
01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:22.063
<v Speaker 3>thinks that he is helping the pupil to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>body of knowledge that he has access to </v>

1167
01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:32.300
<v Speaker 3>and that sense of helping other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a very rare thing and it's,</v>

1168
01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:33.203
<v Speaker 3>it's made more rare by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the welfare state and the ready </v>

1169
01:08:36.711 --> 01:08:37.544
<v Speaker 3>availability of subsidies for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsidized life without leaning on any </v>

1170
01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:46.220
<v Speaker 3>particular person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1171
01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>

1172
01:08:47.271 --> 01:08:48.104
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relations of dependence are actually </v>

1173
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.900
<v Speaker 3>very positive if they're accepted on </v>
<v Speaker 3>both sides,</v>

1174
01:08:53.901 --> 01:08:54.734
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>

1175
01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:55.803
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that we don't teach the boys </v>

1176
01:08:57.841 --> 01:08:58.674
<v Speaker 3>scouts movement and all that they used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to teach a young people these things </v>

1177
01:09:02.331 --> 01:09:03.164
<v Speaker 3>teach people how to go out and help </v>
<v Speaker 3>those who needed them and how to make </v>

1178
01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:10.130
<v Speaker 3>those little day to day sacrifices.</v>

1179
01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.053
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and eventually through the process of </v>

1180
01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 3>imitation and imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a character grows based on that.</v>

1181
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:22.700
<v Speaker 3>I feel that there isn't any obstacle to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1182
01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.240
<v Speaker 3>It's a very simple form of education.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of us can do it.</v>

1183
01:09:26.241 --> 01:09:27.074
<v Speaker 3>And all of us who have children do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure Jordan does it with his </v>

1184
01:09:31.461 --> 01:09:33.610
<v Speaker 3>children the same as I with mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1185
01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're always disappointed.</v>

1186
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:39.130
<v Speaker 3>They always go away into the corner with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1187
01:09:39.690 --> 01:09:42.290
<v Speaker 3>with their wretched little iphones and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so on.</v>

1188
01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:44.180
<v Speaker 3>But nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1189
01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.360
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it rubs off and you know,</v>

1190
01:09:47.361 --> 01:09:52.280
<v Speaker 3>that in the long run they will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>capable not just of finding love,</v>

1191
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:57.110
<v Speaker 3>but also of offering forgiveness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>working for rick reconciliation.</v>

1192
01:09:57.710 --> 01:10:02.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't think in a sort of narcissistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture which is propagated by the media</v>

1193
01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:07.340
<v Speaker 3>and by the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1194
01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:08.243
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1195
01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:10.460
<v Speaker 3>that they're being pointed in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

1196
01:10:10.461 --> 01:10:11.294
<v Speaker 3>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then it's up to us to point them in </v>

1197
01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:15.020
<v Speaker 3>another direction.</v>

1198
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:19.700
<v Speaker 4>I think as an academic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talked already about that place where</v>

1199
01:10:19.701 --> 01:10:20.534
<v Speaker 4>the meaning and the fact are conjoined </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the proper place to lecture </v>

1200
01:10:24.141 --> 01:10:24.974
<v Speaker 4>from because people who lecture </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly make the presumption that </v>

1201
01:10:30.561 --> 01:10:34.970
<v Speaker 4>they're there to deliver a set of facts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's an infinite set of facts.</v>

1202
01:10:34.971 --> 01:10:38.240
<v Speaker 4>And so at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to select the facts and there's</v>

1203
01:10:38.241 --> 01:10:40.700
<v Speaker 4>a mechanism that selects the facts and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1204
01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:45.930
<v Speaker 4>what you want to do as an academic is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is tell your students through,</v>

1205
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.233
<v Speaker 4>through direct discourse and also </v>
<v Speaker 4>through action about something that </v>

1206
01:10:50.781 --> 01:10:54.650
<v Speaker 4>you've encountered that you've fallen in</v>
<v Speaker 4>love with and to,</v>

1207
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:57.080
<v Speaker 4>and to communicate the love that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have for that,</v>

1208
01:10:57.081 --> 01:10:59.060
<v Speaker 4>the love for literature and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not to say,</v>

1209
01:10:59.061 --> 01:11:00.650
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should read this book,</v>

1210
01:11:00.651 --> 01:11:01.520
<v Speaker 4>but to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1211
01:11:01.521 --> 01:11:02.354
<v Speaker 4>here's this book and here's what it can </v>
<v Speaker 4>open up for you and this is how it does </v>

1212
01:11:05.631 --> 01:11:05.810
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1213
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:08.330
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is what you'll gain from it.</v>

1214
01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:11.090
<v Speaker 4>It's an inestimable gain and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>some struggle in it.</v>

1215
01:11:11.091 --> 01:11:12.470
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a,</v>

1216
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.000
<v Speaker 4>there's something it that's of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1217
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.610
<v Speaker 4>of unbelievable utility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have to believe that in order to</v>

1218
01:11:17.611 --> 01:11:19.380
<v Speaker 4>communicate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that's.</v>

1219
01:11:19.381 --> 01:11:21.350
<v Speaker 4>So that opens one of those doors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1220
01:11:21.351 --> 01:11:23.220
<v Speaker 4>and maybe some students will step </v>
<v Speaker 4>through that and think,</v>

1221
01:11:23.221 --> 01:11:25.410
<v Speaker 4>well maybe that sounds like something I </v>
<v Speaker 4>need.</v>

1222
01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:27.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm in this dire situation and I need </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1223
01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:30.300
<v Speaker 4>I need a life raft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to.</v>

1224
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:32.840
<v Speaker 4>It needs something to boy me upward and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna.</v>

1225
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:33.683
<v Speaker 4>Take some effort obviously because </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing worthwhile comes without effort </v>

1226
01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.710
<v Speaker 4>to communicate that commitment you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to these two,</v>

1227
01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:42.530
<v Speaker 4>these two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these phenomena,</v>

1228
01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:43.364
<v Speaker 4>the phenomena that we already talked </v>
<v Speaker 4>about to beauty and truth and to </v>

1229
01:11:45.391 --> 01:11:48.480
<v Speaker 4>literature and entered the classics in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the humanities.</v>

1230
01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.170
<v Speaker 4>It isn't enough to to say what they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>and to transmit them.</v>

1231
01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:53.003
<v Speaker 4>It's to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's to manifest yourself as a living </v>

1232
01:11:55.471 --> 01:11:56.304
<v Speaker 4>part of that tradition and to end to </v>
<v Speaker 4>show yourself thereby as a model for </v>

1233
01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:05.160
<v Speaker 4>living out as much as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what that tradition represents,</v>

1234
01:12:05.161 --> 01:12:05.994
<v Speaker 4>and to show that that's so much better </v>
<v Speaker 4>than like a short term pleasure seeking </v>

1235
01:12:10.321 --> 01:12:11.154
<v Speaker 4>nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're not even in the same </v>

1236
01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:16.260
<v Speaker 4>conceptual universe and people are far </v>
<v Speaker 4>more open to that.</v>

1237
01:12:16.261 --> 01:12:17.850
<v Speaker 4>They know already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People know,</v>

1238
01:12:17.851 --> 01:12:22.851
<v Speaker 4>especially when they're hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know that happiness is fleeting and</v>

1239
01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:25.680
<v Speaker 4>that suffering requires a sustaining </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning.</v>

1240
01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.070
<v Speaker 4>Everyone who's lived knows that and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>to say,</v>

1241
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:29.904
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's some bomb for the suffering and </v>

1242
01:12:31.861 --> 01:12:35.940
<v Speaker 4>it's profound and deep and and here's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it's meant to me and here's how you</v>

1243
01:12:35.941 --> 01:12:39.960
<v Speaker 4>can incorporate it into your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like people are absolutely starving</v>

1244
01:12:39.961 --> 01:12:41.990
<v Speaker 4>for that or dying of thirst for them.</v>

1245
01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:46.960
<v Speaker 3>This connects with what you earlier said</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the curriculum,</v>

1246
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:48.083
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the old way of teaching the </v>

1247
01:12:50.081 --> 01:12:53.310
<v Speaker 3>humanities was in that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1248
01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.233
<v Speaker 3>as objects of love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I have loved what previous </v>

1249
01:12:57.251 --> 01:12:59.530
<v Speaker 3>generations have loved to and handed </v>
<v Speaker 3>onto me.</v>

1250
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try it out and you will love it too.</v>

1251
01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:08.260
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the postmodern curriculum is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>curriculum of hatred.</v>

1252
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:09.281
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1253
01:13:09.281 --> 01:13:12.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>directed against a cultural inheritance.</v>

1254
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:15.510
<v Speaker 3>One after another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The work separated before us,</v>

1255
01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:18.130
<v Speaker 3>stripped naked and thrashed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1256
01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:18.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1257
01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by what,</v>

1258
01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.273
<v Speaker 3>by revealing whatever ideology will </v>
<v Speaker 3>power structure is being concealed </v>

1259
01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:26.320
<v Speaker 3>within them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1260
01:13:26.321 --> 01:13:27.154
<v Speaker 3>of course there's not why they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>written and it's not how they should be </v>

1261
01:13:29.051 --> 01:13:29.720
<v Speaker 3>understood.</v>

1262
01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.110
<v Speaker 4>It's not why they survived.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly either.</v>

1263
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:36.970
<v Speaker 4>But like this is the best that the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>of us could produce and it's nothing.</v>

1264
01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.520
<v Speaker 4>Why should you bother?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1265
01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:39.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1266
01:13:39.731 --> 01:13:40.564
<v Speaker 3>And it means that students who go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through that curriculum come out with a </v>

1267
01:13:44.381 --> 01:13:45.214
<v Speaker 3>sentence of the hopelessness of </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and thus are successfully </v>

1268
01:13:49.421 --> 01:13:51.970
<v Speaker 3>educated by postmodernist standards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1269
01:13:51.971 --> 01:13:53.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose that's right.</v>

1270
01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.393
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1271
01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason why one should,</v>

1272
01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:59.230
<v Speaker 3>one should accept this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1273
01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:02.840
<v Speaker 3>all good things begin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1274
01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:06.040
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in small areas because,</v>

1275
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:08.430
<v Speaker 3>because two or three people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1276
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:09.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1277
01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:13.660
<v Speaker 3>it's Christ said two or three are </v>
<v Speaker 3>gathered my name there am I with you,</v>

1278
01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:18.130
<v Speaker 3>but at the same as it is an old couch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right activities,</v>

1279
01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:21.620
<v Speaker 3>it's perhaps a friendship will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

1280
01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:22.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will be gay.</v>

1281
01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.500
<v Speaker 3>It will start up a reading group and </v>
<v Speaker 3>after that reading group,</v>

1282
01:14:26.501 --> 01:14:31.240
<v Speaker 3>there'll be others come in gradually if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's founded on love of the thing that's</v>

1283
01:14:31.241 --> 01:14:32.074
<v Speaker 3>being studied and offered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he will always try and fit in the long </v>

1284
01:14:34.511 --> 01:14:35.344
<v Speaker 3>run over this negativity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the negativity is </v>

1285
01:14:38.291 --> 01:14:39.124
<v Speaker 3>subsidized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's subsidized by universities who are </v>

1286
01:14:41.531 --> 01:14:45.370
<v Speaker 3>paid for by governments who are paid for</v>
<v Speaker 3>by tax payers and so on.</v>

1287
01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.870
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1288
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:50.260
<v Speaker 3>the answer is to take away those </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsidies and,</v>

1289
01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:51.123
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and deprived of education completely of </v>

1290
01:14:52.871 --> 01:14:55.690
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it will be back with us again.</v>

1291
01:14:57.190 --> 01:14:58.023
<v Speaker 4>I suppose I suggested something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in public in Canada not so long </v>

1292
01:15:01.871 --> 01:15:02.704
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to cut the budgets of the universities </v>

1293
01:15:03.731 --> 01:15:07.810
<v Speaker 4>across the board by 25 percent and let </v>
<v Speaker 4>them sort themselves out because,</v>

1294
01:15:07.811 --> 01:15:08.644
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the no subsidy idea at least forces </v>

1295
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.273
<v Speaker 4>those who provide education to do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>purely on its merits and the fact that </v>

1296
01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:17.344
<v Speaker 4>these counterproductive disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say have been subsidized for so </v>

1297
01:15:21.341 --> 01:15:23.710
<v Speaker 4>long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has given them a power that's far,</v>

1298
01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.633
<v Speaker 4>far outstrips their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their credibility and their </v>

1299
01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:27.620
<v Speaker 4>attractiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right</v>

1300
01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.570
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to,</v>

1301
01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:33.530
<v Speaker 2>to</v>
<v Speaker 2>point out a,</v>

1302
01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.371
<v Speaker 2>it will this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1303
01:15:34.371 --> 01:15:35.204
<v Speaker 2>this chat may be seen by a few people </v>
<v Speaker 2>online at some point and draw attention </v>

1304
01:15:39.811 --> 01:15:42.410
<v Speaker 2>to the vet that we're all wearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>poppies to,</v>

1305
01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.333
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

1306
01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.541
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

1307
01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:49.541
<v Speaker 2>is a symbol of respect and memory for an</v>
<v Speaker 2>inheritance of our own past,</v>

1308
01:15:51.370 --> 01:15:52.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

1309
01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.013
<v Speaker 2>the suffering</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has given us or at least protected </v>

1310
01:15:59.541 --> 01:16:00.374
<v Speaker 2>and given us so much that we hold dear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to ask you both about memory </v>

1311
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:07.663
<v Speaker 2>and the inheritance of the past and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what it means to have a pedagogy of </v>

1312
01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.890
<v Speaker 2>what it means to have a pedagogy of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent,</v>

1313
01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:21.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in relation to our past.</v>

1314
01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.860
<v Speaker 2>How do you open open those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1315
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:27.050
<v Speaker 2>those doorways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps,</v>

1316
01:16:27.051 --> 01:16:28.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1317
01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:31.970
<v Speaker 2>if the spirit moves you to a speak about</v>
<v Speaker 2>works that you love,</v>

1318
01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.940
<v Speaker 2>that you've been able to open up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

1319
01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.393
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons for remembering in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that we remember the armistice </v>

1320
01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:44.380
<v Speaker 3>in the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons is,</v>

1321
01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.440
<v Speaker 3>is gratitude and gratitude is in short </v>
<v Speaker 3>supply in our societies today.</v>

1322
01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:51.453
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1323
01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:55.000
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the greatest gift that we can offer</v>

1324
01:16:55.001 --> 01:16:57.400
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of people who are dead because,</v>

1325
01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else can we do,</v>

1326
01:16:59.390 --> 01:17:00.223
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except to acknowledge what their </v>

1327
01:17:01.151 --> 01:17:02.650
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1328
01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:03.693
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that gratitude is a fundamental </v>

1329
01:17:05.351 --> 01:17:07.640
<v Speaker 3>part of memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1330
01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:09.130
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1331
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:12.850
<v Speaker 3>accumulations of guilts and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1332
01:17:12.851 --> 01:17:17.150
<v Speaker 3>and those are being emphasized all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time in the postmodern and curriculum,</v>

1333
01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.253
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the ways in which we are not </v>

1334
01:17:19.281 --> 01:17:23.060
<v Speaker 3>entitled to our inheritance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think in the face at that,</v>

1335
01:17:23.061 --> 01:17:27.110
<v Speaker 3>we have to insist on the ways that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>are entitled to that inheritance.</v>

1336
01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.650
<v Speaker 3>If people have died for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1337
01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:30.753
<v Speaker 3>for our sake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know that isn't a fantastic title that </v>

1338
01:17:34.131 --> 01:17:38.330
<v Speaker 3>we enjoy and we should feel grateful to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them for that.</v>

1339
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.373
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to actual works of art or </v>

1340
01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:48.410
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which have opened the sense of the depth</v>

1341
01:17:48.411 --> 01:17:49.244
<v Speaker 3>of one's own inheritance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That I think is a very interesting </v>

1342
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:55.520
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many of them,</v>

1343
01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:58.820
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just to mention only one,</v>

1344
01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:03.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm the Bach B minor mass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

1345
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:05.090
<v Speaker 3>that's a door into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the,</v>

1346
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:07.790
<v Speaker 3>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1347
01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:12.680
<v Speaker 3>the whole European inheritance going </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the crucifixion.</v>

1348
01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.541
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There,</v>

1349
01:18:13.541 --> 01:18:14.374
<v Speaker 3>it all is encapsulated in music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>music of celebrating the universal </v>

1350
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.940
<v Speaker 3>claims or the Roman Catholic church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but written by a Protestant,</v>

1351
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:24.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's,</v>

1352
01:18:24.451 --> 01:18:28.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and offered as a gift to mankind,</v>

1353
01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:33.580
<v Speaker 3>narratives and those such things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So transcend any,</v>

1354
01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.950
<v Speaker 3>any minor historical details,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1355
01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.030
<v Speaker 3>that to unrecognized is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is what the past really is for one,</v>

1356
01:18:41.031 --> 01:18:43.220
<v Speaker 3>that great depth of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1357
01:18:43.221 --> 01:18:47.060
<v Speaker 3>of inheritance that can't be enumerated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just enjoy it.</v>

1358
01:18:47.530 --> 01:18:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Just to follow up before we turn to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan.</v>

1359
01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:50.973
<v Speaker 2>Roger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning you talked about how </v>

1360
01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:53.613
<v Speaker 2>great literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great writing is writing in which the </v>

1361
01:18:56.231 --> 01:19:00.250
<v Speaker 2>reader finds himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finds herself.</v>

1362
01:19:00.730 --> 01:19:05.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking box mass in b minor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1363
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:08.680
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've spoken about the unfolding of the</v>

1364
01:19:08.681 --> 01:19:13.600
<v Speaker 2>self that is found in these great works </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the reflection of the self,</v>

1365
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least I think you've written about</v>

1366
01:19:17.891 --> 01:19:20.040
<v Speaker 2>the unfolding of the theme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1367
01:19:20.290 --> 01:19:20.890
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1368
01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:23.440
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in of that mass in particular,</v>

1369
01:19:23.441 --> 01:19:25.360
<v Speaker 2>but certainly in other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other of your writings,</v>

1370
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:30.130
<v Speaker 2>the unfolding of the theme and music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you say something about the.</v>

1371
01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:31.793
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a huge question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way in which the unfolding of </v>

1372
01:19:36.041 --> 01:19:40.540
<v Speaker 2>the theme in music is an unfolding of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the self.</v>

1373
01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:42.950
<v Speaker 3>So really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1374
01:19:43.650 --> 01:19:44.483
<v Speaker 3>provocative way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is true that when you listen to a </v>

1375
01:19:48.061 --> 01:19:49.730
<v Speaker 3>theme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1376
01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:50.963
<v Speaker 3>in music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are not listening to a sequence of </v>

1377
01:19:53.401 --> 01:19:54.234
<v Speaker 3>notes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something begins in that first note and </v>

1378
01:19:57.921 --> 01:20:02.640
<v Speaker 3>injures to the final node and it goes on</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the way through,</v>

1379
01:20:02.641 --> 01:20:03.474
<v Speaker 3>even though there are spells of silence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still going on in the silence so </v>

1380
01:20:07.621 --> 01:20:08.454
<v Speaker 3>that our ability to hear something as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>theme is already a contribution that we </v>

1381
01:20:14.281 --> 01:20:16.200
<v Speaker 3>make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes out of us.</v>

1382
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:19.440
<v Speaker 3>So we've identified with that movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That movement is,</v>

1383
01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.960
<v Speaker 3>it's there in the world because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>there in us,</v>

1384
01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:24.660
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in so many ways,</v>

1385
01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:29.840
<v Speaker 3>all our inner life is interrupted and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfulfilled and it's full of things that</v>

1386
01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.650
<v Speaker 3>start up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Peter around,</v>

1387
01:20:35.050 --> 01:20:35.883
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that is one of the </v>

1388
01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:38.213
<v Speaker 3>fundamental experiences of human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's an inner disorder that </v>

1389
01:20:41.161 --> 01:20:43.500
<v Speaker 3>things never actually come to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion.</v>

1390
01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:48.470
<v Speaker 3>But here uniquely movements begin and </v>
<v Speaker 3>come to a conclusion.</v>

1391
01:20:48.471 --> 01:20:50.940
<v Speaker 3>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that conclusion is,</v>

1392
01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:54.050
<v Speaker 3>is complete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that satisfaction of,</v>

1393
01:20:54.051 --> 01:20:54.521
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1394
01:20:54.521 --> 01:20:55.440
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1395
01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:56.723
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsaturated nature of the movement of </v>

1396
01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.190
<v Speaker 3>the first beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1397
01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:03.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's an,</v>

1398
01:21:03.570 --> 01:21:04.370
<v Speaker 3>an experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1399
01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:06.710
<v Speaker 3>why do we value that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we value,</v>

1400
01:21:06.711 --> 01:21:07.544
<v Speaker 3>I value it in the same way as you battle</v>
<v Speaker 3>your tragedy because it gives </v>

1401
01:21:10.710 --> 01:21:11.543
<v Speaker 3>completion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And closure to things that otherwise </v>

1402
01:21:14.281 --> 01:21:15.420
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't ever have them</v>

1403
01:21:16.050 --> 01:21:16.883
<v Speaker 4>and things that are transient as well </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it does have a beginning and an </v>

1404
01:21:19.531 --> 01:21:22.830
<v Speaker 4>end and the end doesn't invalidate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>utility of the,</v>

1405
01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:24.690
<v Speaker 4>of the entity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1406
01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.860
<v Speaker 4>So in the gratitude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was the,</v>

1407
01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:31.770
<v Speaker 4>that was exactly the theme that sprung </v>
<v Speaker 4>to mind for me as soon as you asked that</v>

1408
01:21:31.771 --> 01:21:32.604
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1409
01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:37.760
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I find profoundly</v>
<v Speaker 4>disquieting about the modern radical.</v>

1410
01:21:38.770 --> 01:21:39.620
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1411
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:42.390
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>An ideology that is so.</v>

1412
01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:43.483
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so unfortunately dominant on campuses </v>

1413
01:21:46.381 --> 01:21:49.290
<v Speaker 4>among young people is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably ungrateful.</v>

1414
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:50.783
<v Speaker 4>And when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I walk outside and there's not a </v>

1415
01:21:53.371 --> 01:21:57.450
<v Speaker 4>riot and death in the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm having a good day.</v>

1416
01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:58.853
<v Speaker 4>That's my sense of history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm constantly staggered by </v>

1417
01:22:03.061 --> 01:22:06.210
<v Speaker 4>the fact that so much works all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1418
01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:07.463
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met this guy a while back and he'd </v>

1419
01:22:10.981 --> 01:22:12.390
<v Speaker 4>been in a motorcycle accident.</v>

1420
01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:13.860
<v Speaker 4>He really got hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1421
01:22:13.861 --> 01:22:16.770
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was pretty much half destroyed and he</v>

1422
01:22:16.771 --> 01:22:17.604
<v Speaker 4>worked as a telephone lineman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He worked with this guy who had </v>

1423
01:22:19.741 --> 01:22:20.574
<v Speaker 4>Parkinson's disease who had was equally </v>
<v Speaker 4>destroyed in a slightly different way </v>

1424
01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:25.373
<v Speaker 4>and the two of them together could climb</v>
<v Speaker 4>up a telephone pole and continue their </v>

1425
01:22:28.021 --> 01:22:28.854
<v Speaker 4>job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I thought this unbelievable </v>

1426
01:22:30.331 --> 01:22:31.164
<v Speaker 4>infrastructure we have that is just an </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolute bloody ongoing ongoing miracle </v>

1427
01:22:35.610 --> 01:22:38.220
<v Speaker 4>is sustained by people exactly like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1428
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:39.083
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're having very difficult lives and </v>

1429
01:22:40.951 --> 01:22:41.784
<v Speaker 4>a country like Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go out in the middle of the bloody </v>

1430
01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:45.023
<v Speaker 4>winter where you die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's frigid and something breaks and </v>

1431
01:22:48.181 --> 01:22:49.014
<v Speaker 4>they fix it and the lights are on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lights are on all the time and I </v>

1432
01:22:51.871 --> 01:22:52.704
<v Speaker 4>come to somewhere like Europe and to me </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an absolutely overwhelming </v>

1433
01:22:58.231 --> 01:23:01.740
<v Speaker 4>experience to see king's chapel today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to wander around the city.</v>

1434
01:23:01.741 --> 01:23:02.574
<v Speaker 4>I'm just staggered that people produce </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and so amazed that we could do it </v>

1435
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:10.450
<v Speaker 4>and so grateful that it exists.</v>

1436
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:11.383
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about king's chapel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people who started didn't live to </v>

1437
01:23:14.501 --> 01:23:15.910
<v Speaker 4>see its completion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were.</v>

1438
01:23:16.150 --> 01:23:16.983
<v Speaker 4>They were driven by this nobility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcendent vision and they produce </v>

1439
01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:24.850
<v Speaker 4>these enduring forms and out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bloody misery of history.</v>

1440
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:25.833
<v Speaker 4>We've erected all this spectacular </v>
<v Speaker 4>infrastructure that we're so fortunate </v>

1441
01:23:30.401 --> 01:23:31.234
<v Speaker 4>to be part of and there none of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>gratitude is taught and it's partly not </v>

1442
01:23:35.261 --> 01:23:40.261
<v Speaker 4>taught because people have no sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the absolute catastrophe of history.</v>

1443
01:23:40.690 --> 01:23:43.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean for me the hobbs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like nasty,</v>

1444
01:23:43.901 --> 01:23:48.901
<v Speaker 4>brutish and short that the simplest and </v>
<v Speaker 4>most likely social circumstances,</v>

1445
01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:50.793
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe punctuated by hell and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>see that not happening in a sustained </v>

1446
01:23:55.871 --> 01:23:56.704
<v Speaker 4>manner constantly and to see things </v>
<v Speaker 4>improving around us and and to be </v>

1447
01:24:00.551 --> 01:24:03.940
<v Speaker 4>reliable in that manner and then not to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be grateful for that.</v>

1448
01:24:03.941 --> 01:24:04.774
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's an unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 4>combination of ignorance and willful </v>

1449
01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.193
<v Speaker 4>ignorance in gratitude and willful </v>
<v Speaker 4>blindness and it does no one soul any </v>

1450
01:24:11.501 --> 01:24:14.650
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so good to walk down the streets of</v>

1451
01:24:14.651 --> 01:24:18.730
<v Speaker 4>a beautiful town like this and to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>open mouth in northern Iran,</v>

1452
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
<v Speaker 4>amazement at what's here and so and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>not instill that sense and young people,</v>

1453
01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:26.403
<v Speaker 4>for them to understand that they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing on the bones of generations of </v>

1454
01:24:30.431 --> 01:24:31.264
<v Speaker 4>people who suffered to make this </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible despite all their errors and </v>

1455
01:24:34.031 --> 01:24:35.710
<v Speaker 4>have brought this forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1456
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:37.783
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1457
01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:41.210
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a very a salutary lesson.</v>

1458
01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.073
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he did look into the abyss and </v>

1459
01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:49.630
<v Speaker 3>stepped back from it and reported on it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as did shows,</v>

1460
01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:51.403
<v Speaker 3>it's in and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we postwar baby boomers to haven't had </v>

1461
01:24:57.741 --> 01:24:58.574
<v Speaker 3>that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a little glimpse of it in the old </v>

1462
01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:03.830
<v Speaker 3>communist days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we only saw the edge of it then,</v>

1463
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:05.143
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1464
01:25:05.210 --> 01:25:06.043
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1465
01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:08.870
<v Speaker 3>still the sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sense that it is,</v>

1466
01:25:08.871 --> 01:25:11.800
<v Speaker 3>they're always beneath your feet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1467
01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:16.900
<v Speaker 3>and the crust is thin as it can be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain places.</v>

1468
01:25:16.941 --> 01:25:17.774
<v Speaker 3>That I think is something that young </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do need to be taught without </v>

1469
01:25:20.481 --> 01:25:25.250
<v Speaker 3>making them get gloomy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to recognize that they're lucky.</v>

1470
01:25:25.251 --> 01:25:26.084
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1471
01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Last question before we open up for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few questions here.</v>

1472
01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:35.140
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that the backward looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've talked about,</v>

1473
01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:35.993
<v Speaker 2>or you had a wonderful phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wide eyed open mouthed at non-ironic </v>

1474
01:25:39.650 --> 01:25:40.483
<v Speaker 2>in amazement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you said walking around this </v>

1475
01:25:43.570 --> 01:25:46.450
<v Speaker 2>transcendently beautiful town of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cambridge,</v>

1476
01:25:46.451 --> 01:25:50.650
<v Speaker 2>which houses this August and ancient and</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful institution.</v>

1477
01:25:51.170 --> 01:25:53.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1478
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.273
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing the king's chapel earlier </v>

1479
01:25:56.770 --> 01:25:57.603
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that those who started the work knew </v>

1480
01:26:01.181 --> 01:26:02.014
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't be those who would finish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those who finished knew they had </v>

1481
01:26:04.341 --> 01:26:07.700
<v Speaker 2>inherited to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had not themselves begun.</v>

1482
01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:10.580
<v Speaker 2>And so I suppose I want to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1483
01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:11.630
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1484
01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.473
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the necessity to turn back with </v>

1485
01:26:13.761 --> 01:26:17.650
<v Speaker 2>gratitude to the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to our inherited a past.</v>

1486
01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:20.060
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk also about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of,</v>

1487
01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.650
<v Speaker 2>of building and a creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1488
01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:25.670
<v Speaker 2>these chapels and buildings were built </v>
<v Speaker 2>at some time.</v>

1489
01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:27.500
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself are a composer.</v>

1490
01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Both of you are authors of books that </v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

1491
01:26:30.891 --> 01:26:32.570
<v Speaker 2>many people have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1492
01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:35.660
<v Speaker 2>found depth and truth in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I want to,</v>

1493
01:26:35.661 --> 01:26:37.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to ask about,</v>

1494
01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibilities for,</v>

1495
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:41.660
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for renaissance,</v>

1496
01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:46.690
<v Speaker 2>for rebuilding or building a new and new</v>
<v Speaker 2>buildings and new forms of community,</v>

1497
01:26:48.591 --> 01:26:49.424
<v Speaker 2>new forms of art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps new buildings have old forms of </v>

1498
01:26:51.891 --> 01:26:54.740
<v Speaker 2>architecture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new colleges and universities,</v>

1499
01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:59.360
<v Speaker 2>a new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more healthy and beautiful forms of,</v>

1500
01:26:59.630 --> 01:27:00.463
<v Speaker 2>of courtship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new forms of a flourishing arts and </v>

1501
01:27:03.861 --> 01:27:05.060
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1502
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:06.883
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me so important that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we not lose sight of the fact that </v>

1503
01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:15.160
<v Speaker 2>precisely the abiding truth of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent in us,</v>

1504
01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:20.780
<v Speaker 2>it gives us hope to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to answer that call.</v>

1505
01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must be the case that when,</v>

1506
01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:27.850
<v Speaker 3>when describing our cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>inheritance,</v>

1507
01:27:28.210 --> 01:27:31.120
<v Speaker 3>we're not just describing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's gone,</v>

1508
01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:36.310
<v Speaker 3>we must be describing something of which</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are still a part a and which,</v>

1509
01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:40.450
<v Speaker 3>which has to changed as we are changing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to accommodate us.</v>

1510
01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:44.800
<v Speaker 3>And all this was said by Elliot in </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition and the individual talent,</v>

1511
01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:45.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1512
01:27:45.311 --> 01:27:46.144
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the artist must be constantly </v>

1513
01:27:48.941 --> 01:27:53.380
<v Speaker 3>trying to say that new thing that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>came into the world to say,</v>

1514
01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:57.820
<v Speaker 3>but he can only say it if he adapts his </v>
<v Speaker 3>style to the,</v>

1515
01:27:58.420 --> 01:27:59.253
<v Speaker 3>the inheritance of the tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thereby transforming the tradition and </v>

1516
01:28:03.041 --> 01:28:03.874
<v Speaker 3>transforming himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we all were there and there is no </v>

1517
01:28:06.911 --> 01:28:07.744
<v Speaker 3>formula for doing this because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>formula is precisely what destroys the </v>

1518
01:28:10.931 --> 01:28:11.764
<v Speaker 3>creative act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we have to assume that new things </v>

1519
01:28:16.961 --> 01:28:19.750
<v Speaker 3>will come and they will come through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1520
01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:20.673
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they always did in the past through </v>

1521
01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:27.840
<v Speaker 3>fasting and prayer</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the occasional glass of wine.</v>

1522
01:28:28.530 --> 01:28:29.363
<v Speaker 2>My kids,</v>

1523
01:28:32.290 --> 01:28:34.660
<v Speaker 4>Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1524
01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:36.880
<v Speaker 4>we could concentrate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suppose,</v>

1525
01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:40.030
<v Speaker 4>on building the future instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticizing the past.</v>

1526
01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:41.613
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's necessary to decompose to </v>

1527
01:28:43.901 --> 01:28:47.410
<v Speaker 4>reconstruct those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those acts can't be separated,</v>

1528
01:28:47.411 --> 01:28:48.244
<v Speaker 4>but the decomposition is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>prerequisite for the reconstruction and </v>

1529
01:28:51.930 --> 01:28:52.763
<v Speaker 4>you know what I've been recommending to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people is that they start on whatever </v>

1530
01:28:56.321 --> 01:28:57.154
<v Speaker 4>scale they can start on with whatever's </v>
<v Speaker 4>in front of them because they have more </v>

1531
01:28:59.771 --> 01:29:01.920
<v Speaker 4>in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they think these,</v>

1532
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:02.993
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

1533
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:03.833
<v Speaker 4>these circumscribed areas that these </v>
<v Speaker 4>small places that people can call their </v>

1534
01:29:06.991 --> 01:29:08.790
<v Speaker 4>own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's only their room,</v>

1535
01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:11.970
<v Speaker 4>you can start to do something creative </v>
<v Speaker 4>and beautiful there.</v>

1536
01:29:11.971 --> 01:29:14.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've suggested to people that they start</v>

1537
01:29:14.551 --> 01:29:17.610
<v Speaker 4>by putting the room in order and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that implies a purpose.</v>

1538
01:29:17.611 --> 01:29:18.420
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1539
01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:20.360
<v Speaker 4>your room is somewhere that you exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1540
01:29:20.361 --> 01:29:22.140
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a place that surrounds you,</v>

1541
01:29:22.141 --> 01:29:22.974
<v Speaker 4>that tells you how to be is put it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order so at least it isn't screaming </v>

1542
01:29:27.450 --> 01:29:30.720
<v Speaker 4>chaos at you in a soul destroying </v>
<v Speaker 4>manner.</v>

1543
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:32.770
<v Speaker 4>Make it pristine and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1544
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:33.703
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and orderly and in a fashion that suits </v>

1545
01:29:35.641 --> 01:29:36.474
<v Speaker 4>what you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So have an aim and then this is perhaps </v>

1546
01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:41.190
<v Speaker 4>a chapter in my next book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1547
01:29:41.191 --> 01:29:45.060
<v Speaker 4>maybe you start by putting your room in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order and then you make it beautiful and</v>

1548
01:29:45.061 --> 01:29:45.894
<v Speaker 4>then you learn how to make something </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful and to make something </v>

1549
01:29:47.821 --> 01:29:51.600
<v Speaker 4>beautiful is to make it worthwhile and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to participate in that transcendent,</v>

1550
01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:54.120
<v Speaker 4>in that transcendence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you need one</v>

1551
01:29:55.650 --> 01:29:58.980
<v Speaker 4>certainly and for your future self,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is also others.</v>

1552
01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this idea that people are fat even of,</v>

1553
01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:02.670
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1554
01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:03.503
<v Speaker 4>of self gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say as an antidote to nihilism </v>

1555
01:30:06.331 --> 01:30:07.164
<v Speaker 4>will take your pleasure in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't even work for you because </v>

1556
01:30:10.201 --> 01:30:11.034
<v Speaker 4>you're stuck with you tomorrow and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>next week and so even to treat yourself </v>

1557
01:30:14.851 --> 01:30:17.850
<v Speaker 4>properly is to treat yourself as part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>an ongoing community.</v>

1558
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:22.500
<v Speaker 4>But I would say start by you start in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

1559
01:30:22.770 --> 01:30:23.603
<v Speaker 4>If you have some wisdom and some </v>
<v Speaker 4>humility by taking the potential that </v>

1560
01:30:29.161 --> 01:30:29.994
<v Speaker 4>lies dormant in front of you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>interacting with it in the logos like </v>

1561
01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:35.694
<v Speaker 4>manner with truth and with love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and by transforming that potential into </v>

1562
01:30:39.690 --> 01:30:43.710
<v Speaker 4>whatever you can create out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's good and and even if it's,</v>

1563
01:30:43.770 --> 01:30:45.810
<v Speaker 4>it won't be small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you do that,</v>

1564
01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.810
<v Speaker 4>you can transform your whole household </v>
<v Speaker 4>by transforming your room.</v>

1565
01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:49.793
<v Speaker 4>You can transform your whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood by transforming your house </v>

1566
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.903
<v Speaker 4>like these things spread very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very rapidly and that is right there in </v>

1567
01:30:55.921 --> 01:30:57.270
<v Speaker 4>front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1568
01:30:57.271 --> 01:31:01.560
<v Speaker 4>and people think they're impoverished </v>
<v Speaker 4>now that they don't have any opportunity</v>

1569
01:31:01.630 --> 01:31:04.560
<v Speaker 4>and that opportunity is hidden from them</v>
<v Speaker 4>by their,</v>

1570
01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:07.800
<v Speaker 4>by their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by their unwillingness to take the steps</v>

1571
01:31:07.801 --> 01:31:12.330
<v Speaker 4>that are necessary to put what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>could put in front of them in order and,</v>

1572
01:31:12.331 --> 01:31:13.530
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to,</v>

1573
01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.770
<v Speaker 4>and to produce the beauty instead of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ugliness where they could do that.</v>

1574
01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:20.550
<v Speaker 4>And I don't think there is anything more</v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful than that that works.</v>

1575
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:23.250
<v Speaker 4>I've had thousands of people tell me </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it works.</v>

1576
01:31:23.251 --> 01:31:25.770
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>personally come and talk to me every day</v>

1577
01:31:25.771 --> 01:31:28.950
<v Speaker 4>now on the street and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my life was in terrible disorder.</v>

1578
01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:31.620
<v Speaker 4>I had no vision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't abiding by the truth.</v>

1579
01:31:31.621 --> 01:31:32.454
<v Speaker 4>My relationships were fragmented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've decided to make something of </v>

1580
01:31:35.551 --> 01:31:37.140
<v Speaker 4>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever that might be.</v>

1581
01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:38.093
<v Speaker 4>I've decided to adopt more </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility to tell the truth and </v>

1582
01:31:40.321 --> 01:31:44.520
<v Speaker 4>things are in comparatively better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's,</v>

1583
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:48.360
<v Speaker 4>that's there for everyone to take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and regardless of your circumstances,</v>

1584
01:31:48.361 --> 01:31:49.194
<v Speaker 4>and I know that some people have what </v>
<v Speaker 4>appeared to be larger opportunities and </v>

1585
01:31:53.071 --> 01:31:53.904
<v Speaker 4>more privileged in front of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that also makes their commensurate </v>

1586
01:31:56.581 --> 01:32:00.400
<v Speaker 4>moral responsibility larger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's certain balancing</v>

1587
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.233
<v Speaker 2>that's a natural consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now recognizing the nature of the </v>

1588
01:32:05.681 --> 01:32:06.514
<v Speaker 2>finite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a train one of us needs to </v>

1589
01:32:08.291 --> 01:32:09.124
<v Speaker 2>catch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to have to draw this </v>

1590
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.500
<v Speaker 2>conversation to a close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not before.</v>

1591
01:32:11.501 --> 01:32:12.334
<v Speaker 2>We've all had a chance to thank both of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you for everything you do to fan the </v>

1592
01:32:17.561 --> 01:32:20.080
<v Speaker 2>flames of the transcendent for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>readers,</v>

1593
01:32:20.110 --> 01:32:21.910
<v Speaker 2>for your listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for all of us.</v>

1594
01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of you.</v>
