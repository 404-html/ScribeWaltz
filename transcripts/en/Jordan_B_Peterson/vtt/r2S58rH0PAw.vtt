00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Hello and welcome to this special </v>
<v Speaker 1>edition of under the skin with me </v>

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Russell brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be talking to doctor professor Dr </v>

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spoken to him before,</v>

4
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>but this special commemorative was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really a commemorative chat.</v>

5
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not a tea towel for the royal </v>
<v Speaker 1>wedding between Meghan Markle and Prince</v>

6
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Harry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a to celebrate the release on paper</v>

7
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>back of my book recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look at it now on Amazon.</v>

8
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>It's six pound 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think might be six pound,</v>

9
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>47.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talk about that book recovery.</v>

10
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>We talked about the principles of </v>
<v Speaker 1>recovery is a road to enlightenment.</v>

11
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:40.761
<v Speaker 1>We talk about Dr Peterson's book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life is an interesting </v>

12
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:41.460
<v Speaker 1>chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking about myth.</v>

13
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:45.500
<v Speaker 1>We do of course go through some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>main stays of Professor Peterson's,</v>

14
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a water cannon of ideas that you </v>

15
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>commonly talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also I think we really get to the </v>

16
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>heart of it and discover some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.720
<v Speaker 1>some people think there is an exclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of warmth that I think sometimes when </v>

18
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.741
<v Speaker 1>talking about and his ideas and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>insistent on individual culpability and </v>

19
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get into that stuff quite deeply.</v>

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a great chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those you don't know who Jordan Peterson</v>

21
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>is yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're.</v>

22
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Have you been obviously not watching him</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the Hammersmith Apollo with 5,000</v>

23
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

24
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>we're talking to Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm amber skin.</v>

25
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for joining me and do check out </v>
<v Speaker 1>my book recovery on paperback.</v>

26
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Thank you</v>

27
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Dr Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for coming on under the skin.</v>

28
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Speaker 2>It's lovely to see you again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good to see you too.</v>

29
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:35.320
<v Speaker 2>It's nice to meet in London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different,</v>

30
00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:40.321
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're both of us were exiled in Los </v>

31
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Angeles in our last conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I enjoyed it very much.</v>

32
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I've got a lot from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to talk to you on.</v>

33
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.110
<v Speaker 2>This is very much home turf for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

34
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.620
<v Speaker 2>We're in London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a publishing office.</v>

35
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 2>You've been promoting your book </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>

36
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.130
<v Speaker 2>That's why you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of public lectures.</v>

37
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 2>How do you find that now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you finding what I thought in a </v>

38
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 2>way I've been comparing you to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>British opposition leader,</v>

39
00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:08.431
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Corbyn in that you've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this for ages and now you're </v>

40
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:09.890
<v Speaker 2>experiencing a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

41
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.680
<v Speaker 2>an almost perhaps unprecedented level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>

42
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.790
<v Speaker 2>but I'm assuming that your skill set is </v>
<v Speaker 2>applicable.</v>

43
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 2>You're a lecturer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a clinical psycho analyst,</v>

44
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.250
<v Speaker 2>so it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

45
00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:25.610
<v Speaker 2>there's cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

46
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

47
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

48
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 2>the large scale lectures aren't doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't that much different in kind from </v>

49
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 2>the lectures I was doing at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

50
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean the venues are larger and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.040
<v Speaker 2>But the Hammersmith Apollo 3000 seats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe there were.</v>

52
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were 5,000</v>

53
00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:41.590
<v Speaker 2>at the Apollo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

54
00:02:41.591 --> 00:02:46.591
<v Speaker 2>that's where you're not nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as nervous doing that as I am </v>

55
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:51.481
<v Speaker 2>often going to talk to journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual journalists because like the </v>

56
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:56.041
<v Speaker 2>thing about those venues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a variety of things about them </v>

57
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:56.041
<v Speaker 2>that work in my favor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

58
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:57.310
<v Speaker 2>I like talking to crowds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

59
00:02:57.311 --> 00:03:02.311
<v Speaker 2>I've always enjoyed lecturing and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>lecturing to several thousand people </v>

60
00:03:02.311 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 2>isn't much different than lecturing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>several hundred people.</v>

61
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 2>But I also know that the people who've </v>
<v Speaker 2>come are there happy to be there,</v>

62
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 2>like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

63
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking to a welcoming crowd and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

64
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 2>and it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the details are essentially under</v>

65
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 2>my control.</v>

66
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not,</v>

67
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.270
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

68
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually enjoying it quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm apprehensive beforehand </v>

69
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.070
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

70
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 2>because you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.130
<v Speaker 2>I want to do a good job and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure things go well and I want to </v>

72
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 2>get through the material properly and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

73
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.550
<v Speaker 2>and get a little farther in my thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>than I have been in and I'm trying to </v>

74
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 2>make each time I lecture better than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last time and I don't obviously,</v>

75
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 2>I always don't succeed at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

76
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 2>But it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm enjoying it.</v>

77
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 2>And my wife is very good travel </v>
<v Speaker 2>companion.</v>

78
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:53.371
<v Speaker 2>She's very stable and she helps me plan </v>
<v Speaker 2>my days and so we've got it down to a </v>

79
00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:57.571
<v Speaker 2>bit of a routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say Tammy is in the room with </v>

80
00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:00.901
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have already met previously in Los </v>

81
00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:00.901
<v Speaker 2>Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be on my,</v>

82
00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:05.490
<v Speaker 2>there isn't my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just in case listeners are </v>

83
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 2>wondering why perhaps they might be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to detect my voice.</v>

84
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm occasionally glancing towards the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spouse.</v>

85
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.420
<v Speaker 2>The reason is because I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

86
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing these lectures,</v>

87
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.980
<v Speaker 2>is there not a performance component?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you not feel?</v>

88
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

89
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Well sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lecture theater is a theater.</v>

90
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.700
<v Speaker 2>You and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and lecture is a form of theater now.</v>

91
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a serious form of theater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but theater can be serious.</v>

92
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.930
<v Speaker 2>No one and there's a seat because partly</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing is I'm presenting ideas </v>

93
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.370
<v Speaker 2>to an audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also modeling the act of </v>

94
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.050
<v Speaker 2>engaging with ideas and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theatrical at end of it and I don't give</v>

95
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 2>the same talk twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have my stories and I have my </v>

96
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 2>collection of things I know and I talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

97
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 2>but I try to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to do two things.</v>

98
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.010
<v Speaker 2>I try to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always talking to specific </v>

99
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.341
<v Speaker 2>individuals in the audience and so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a conversation with the audience </v>

100
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:06.451
<v Speaker 2>and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the dynamic element of </v>

101
00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:06.451
<v Speaker 2>the performance.</v>

102
00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:10.080
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing I'm trying to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to further my thinking on the topics </v>

103
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 2>that I'm addressing and there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>theatrical element to that because it's,</v>

104
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the closest thing really that it</v>

105
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:20.011
<v Speaker 2>compares to is probably stand up comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I think the routines that </v>

106
00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:24.901
<v Speaker 2>comedians have are probably more well </v>
<v Speaker 2>and formally practiced than the ones </v>

107
00:05:24.901 --> 00:05:24.901
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

108
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

109
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.340
<v Speaker 2>than the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the talks that I,</v>

110
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 2>that I engage in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really think of it as delivering</v>

111
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:35.851
<v Speaker 2>a lecture to an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think about complicated </v>

112
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:39.661
<v Speaker 2>things in real time with an audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to participate and to use the </v>

113
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:45.001
<v Speaker 2>audience as an indicator of whether what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying is gripping and </v>

114
00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 2>comprehensible you apprehension and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

115
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understandable Adrenalin prior to going </v>

116
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.470
<v Speaker 2>on stage doesn't lead you to lean into </v>
<v Speaker 2>stick in it,</v>

117
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.220
<v Speaker 2>which would be the opposite of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're describing.</v>

118
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to remain</v>

119
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>engaged in a kind of dialectic process </v>
<v Speaker 1>of discovery.</v>

120
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Because I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously I am a comedian.</v>

121
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>So like for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us,</v>

122
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:11.651
<v Speaker 1>I would argue there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a distinction between </v>

123
00:06:11.651 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>performing for before 200 people or </v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>

124
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>people around 200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm very relaxed,</v>

125
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:21.341
<v Speaker 1>I'm comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I've got a lot of space in </v>

126
00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:21.341
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A $5,000</v>

127
00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:26.040
<v Speaker 1>like sharpen up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got no room particularly </v>

128
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>because the other crucial difference is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there needs to be a laugh every 20,</v>

129
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.190
<v Speaker 1>30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there isn't,</v>

130
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.370
<v Speaker 1>it gets pretty frosty up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>

131
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 1>it is appealing to me as a comedian </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interested in interested in </v>

132
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.480
<v Speaker 1>furthering intellectual debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the new intersections between</v>

133
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 1>politics and spirituality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps they've always been there.</v>

134
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 1>These are some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these evaporating context.</v>

135
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.820
<v Speaker 1>The emergence of new ideas perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps best exemplified by your own </v>

136
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.511
<v Speaker 1>particular trajectory is interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that that these spaces are now </v>

137
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:03.671
<v Speaker 1>becoming available for forms of types of</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance that aren't so contingent.</v>

138
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.830
<v Speaker 1>It is on rapture and planner.</v>

139
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it is a very strange thing and </v>

140
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what to make of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

141
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.140
<v Speaker 2>you see Sam Harris doing something quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar.</v>

142
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dawkins is doing something quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar and,</v>

143
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.970
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

144
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was thinking because I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to conceptualize this and,</v>

145
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:27.140
<v Speaker 2>and one one comparable audience or one </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparable situation is probably that </v>

146
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.290
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of standup comedians.</v>

147
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Another I suspect are traveling </v>
<v Speaker 2>evangelists eventually it evangelical </v>

148
00:07:34.051 --> 00:07:34.960
<v Speaker 2>type.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

149
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.980
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there.</v>

150
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.910
<v Speaker 2>But of course what they're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>explicitly religious.</v>

151
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.480
<v Speaker 2>This is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has elements of both of those.</v>

152
00:07:42.481 --> 00:07:47.481
<v Speaker 2>And what's emerging that's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting is that there's a clear </v>

153
00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:51.171
<v Speaker 2>public appetite for high level </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual conversation.</v>

154
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.540
<v Speaker 2>If it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's dynamic and I don't know what,</v>

155
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.900
<v Speaker 2>what's accounting for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden maybe it's because these</v>

156
00:07:57.901 --> 00:08:02.901
<v Speaker 2>sorts of discussions aren't taking place</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they should in the classical media </v>

157
00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:04.050
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

158
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.040
<v Speaker 1>You might be right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

159
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean to slightly mangle to slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>mangled the young quote that you use in </v>

160
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.690
<v Speaker 1>your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 12 rules.</v>

161
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm really enjoying actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

162
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>like the one could infer motivation from</v>
<v Speaker 1>results perhaps is that the political </v>

163
00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:28.741
<v Speaker 1>discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social discourse has become superficial </v>

164
00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:30.730
<v Speaker 1>and detached from meaning from purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from experience.</v>

165
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.910
<v Speaker 1>That there is an opening appetite for </v>
<v Speaker 1>substance that people are starting to.</v>

166
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.050
<v Speaker 1>What you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

167
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.860
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you said about theater before,</v>

168
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:44.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the origins of theater and the origins </v>

169
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.851
<v Speaker 1>of religion are closely connected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>both of them still our debt or at least </v>

170
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.420
<v Speaker 1>functionally must relate to meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>

171
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 1>giving us stories that help illuminate</v>

172
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.950
<v Speaker 2>the path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that.</v>

173
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

174
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.130
<v Speaker 2>that's there's something about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's profoundly correct.</v>

175
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:07.131
<v Speaker 2>I think that know that the New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>Times has recently written about the </v>

176
00:09:07.131 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 2>rise of the so called intellectual dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>web,</v>

177
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 2>which is a term that Eric Weinstein so </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliantly coined,</v>

178
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

179
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 2>and very thoughtfully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

180
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:20.630
<v Speaker 2>I think that the thing that unites the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are loosely grouped into that</v>

181
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:25.701
<v Speaker 2>collection is that they are having </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious conversations with an audience </v>

182
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 2>that they respect and they're very </v>
<v Speaker 2>diverse range of people.</v>

183
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:34.221
<v Speaker 2>They don't certainly don't like salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris and I disagree about many </v>

184
00:09:34.221 --> 00:09:35.280
<v Speaker 2>things for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

185
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.490
<v Speaker 2>but Sam respects his audiences and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's engaging them in extremely </v>

186
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:45.651
<v Speaker 2>serious discourse about very deep topics</v>
<v Speaker 2>now about the structure of reality </v>

187
00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 2>actually and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the relationship between science and</v>

188
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:49.710
<v Speaker 2>religion and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

189
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.580
<v Speaker 2>and the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it is a consequence of the </v>

190
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:55.580
<v Speaker 2>fact that not only has our public </v>
<v Speaker 2>discourse,</v>

191
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 2>let's say in the media and in politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>become shallow.</v>

192
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 2>I think it's become unbearably shallow </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the universities.</v>

193
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.060
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

194
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 2>because it's become so ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

195
00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 2>and it's just not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

196
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I was interviewed by a New York Times </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalist last week.</v>

197
00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:15.701
<v Speaker 2>A Nelly was her name and she's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>publish this on Sunday and she did a </v>

198
00:10:15.701 --> 00:10:20.481
<v Speaker 2>literature degree at Columbia and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>told me that she was quite appalled </v>

199
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:22.440
<v Speaker 2>actually by her degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

200
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.650
<v Speaker 2>especially in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

201
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:28.730
<v Speaker 2>in hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she told me that she didn't know until </v>

202
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.060
<v Speaker 2>she graduated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was any other way of reading </v>

203
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:32.670
<v Speaker 2>great literature than through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern lense.</v>

204
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:37.050
<v Speaker 2>And the postmodern lens takes a book and</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically you take a book,</v>

205
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.000
<v Speaker 2>whatever it happens to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you decide which power hierarchy the</v>

206
00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:47.001
<v Speaker 2>author was serving and who is he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who he or she has excluded from </v>

207
00:10:47.001 --> 00:10:51.201
<v Speaker 2>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's completely read through a </v>

208
00:10:51.201 --> 00:10:53.481
<v Speaker 2>political lens as if the book is nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a tool of political and economic </v>

209
00:10:53.481 --> 00:10:54.600
<v Speaker 2>domination essentially.</v>

210
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.140
<v Speaker 2>And that's the assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

211
00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.460
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's contaminated by politics </v>

212
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:01.460
<v Speaker 2>and power to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

213
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:06.590
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to art and literature except in </v>

214
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.880
<v Speaker 2>service of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like group domination.</v>

215
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.950
<v Speaker 2>It's an appalling way of looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

216
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.090
<v Speaker 2>It would be an extraordinary bias to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring to Jane.</v>

217
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Eyre is difficult to sort of make sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it through that Lens.</v>

218
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Then of course in economics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>

219
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.680
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

220
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.630
<v Speaker 2>of course important themes are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be present in great works of art,</v>

221
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:25.710
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

222
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still great works of art.</v>

223
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

224
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even even with something as transient as</v>

225
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:37.311
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say mean you can't reduce comedy </v>

226
00:11:37.311 --> 00:11:37.940
<v Speaker 2>to the political or the economic and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

227
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.130
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and comics who become too ideological,</v>

228
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.280
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like musicians who become too </v>

229
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:46.280
<v Speaker 2>ideological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just not funny anymore.</v>

230
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.000
<v Speaker 2>You have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

231
00:11:48.001 --> 00:11:50.010
<v Speaker 2>you can have your viewpoint left or </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

232
00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:55.011
<v Speaker 2>that's fine and people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to be able to transcend </v>

233
00:11:55.011 --> 00:11:58.501
<v Speaker 2>that viewpoint continually and you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to criticize it because </v>

234
00:11:58.501 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you're not a music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just become a demagogue of sorts.</v>

235
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would agree that once there's a rubric</v>

236
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 2>to which you</v>

237
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.040
<v Speaker 1>come in slave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a dogmatic then,</v>

238
00:12:08.041 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 1>then there's no room for nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for hypocrisy.</v>

239
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Humor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transcendent Mirth,</v>

240
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.210
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These forces need to be unleashed.</v>

241
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 2>There's also things you can no longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh about because you're,</v>

242
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:23.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so committed to your axioms.</v>

243
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.290
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

244
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.260
<v Speaker 2>you dare not transgress against them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if that's deadly,</v>

245
00:12:27.261 --> 00:12:30.020
<v Speaker 2>if you're a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the rule for comedy would be,</v>

246
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.380
<v Speaker 2>and this is something I like about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Sarah Silverman for example,</v>

247
00:12:33.381 --> 00:12:36.440
<v Speaker 2>is she will say anything if she thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>

248
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.550
<v Speaker 2>She's very daring in that manner and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've heard her tell jokes that,</v>

249
00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:42.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really would curl your hair,</v>

250
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can tell by watching or </v>

251
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:47.930
<v Speaker 2>something will pop into her head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of her golf,</v>

252
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.611
<v Speaker 2>tennis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I should say this and </v>

253
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:53.180
<v Speaker 2>then she'll say it and it's often like </v>
<v Speaker 2>horribly funny and horribly funny.</v>

254
00:12:53.181 --> 00:12:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Is a good kind of funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

255
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.940
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's daring and,</v>

256
00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.870
<v Speaker 2>and it's something I really admire about</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians too,</v>

257
00:12:59.871 --> 00:13:02.660
<v Speaker 2>is that they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll take that risk and,</v>

258
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:08.230
<v Speaker 2>and it's something also that I've found </v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbing about with regards to the </v>

259
00:13:10.941 --> 00:13:15.941
<v Speaker 2>many things I find disturbing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>university campuses is that so many </v>

260
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:19.151
<v Speaker 2>comedians won't go perform on university</v>
<v Speaker 2>campuses anymore because they can't be </v>

261
00:13:19.971 --> 00:13:23.230
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get offended and it's a false.</v>

262
00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:24.800
<v Speaker 2>So fan of offended.</v>

263
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's like a kind of Simon</v>

264
00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:30.900
<v Speaker 1>says type of a like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know that game?</v>

265
00:13:30.901 --> 00:13:35.901
<v Speaker 1>Do you have that game in your language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like are there certain things that </v>

266
00:13:35.901 --> 00:13:38.751
<v Speaker 1>we know we're not allowed to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain things that we know </v>

267
00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:39.480
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a kind of a,</v>

268
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.140
<v Speaker 1>a kind of form you like Donald's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>courtly behavior,</v>

269
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:48.230
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it referred to as that we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant to pay homage to a particular type</v>

270
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:54.540
<v Speaker 1>of set of protocols and manners and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily anchored to a real.</v>

271
00:13:54.541 --> 00:13:59.541
<v Speaker 1>Morality is not anchored to a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of spirit to a sense of love or </v>

272
00:13:59.551 --> 00:14:02.910
<v Speaker 1>kindness is about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the rules that we abide by.</v>

273
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you a bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

274
00:14:05.131 --> 00:14:10.131
<v Speaker 1>the 12 steps and the model for handling </v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction that I've written about myself</v>

275
00:14:10.261 --> 00:14:15.261
<v Speaker 1>in my book recovery because I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see what you think of it like so like </v>

276
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.780
<v Speaker 1>the 12 steps have anonymous fellowships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>

277
00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:23.781
<v Speaker 1>if I were to belong to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be able to say I belong to </v>

278
00:14:23.781 --> 00:14:23.850
<v Speaker 1>them without breaching their code of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymity.</v>

279
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.080
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

280
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.240
<v Speaker 1>what's positive about this approach to </v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction is a,</v>

281
00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 1>as we have discussed off Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vet,</v>

282
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.770
<v Speaker 1>it creates community like the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that I've got a similar endeavor.</v>

283
00:14:34.771 --> 00:14:38.000
<v Speaker 1>And in fact it was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the identified this,</v>

284
00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.010
<v Speaker 1>this solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that like,</v>

285
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.490
<v Speaker 1>people that have got chronic addiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction issues will struggle to change</v>

286
00:14:44.491 --> 00:14:49.491
<v Speaker 1>unless they have a spiritual realization</v>
<v Speaker 1>of some kind on the support for </v>

287
00:14:49.491 --> 00:14:49.491
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

288
00:14:49.491 --> 00:14:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the spiritual realization component </v>

289
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:53.830
<v Speaker 1>that's supported by</v>

290
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.010
<v Speaker 3>the relevant addiction literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the classic cures for addiction </v>

291
00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.151
<v Speaker 3>is spiritual transformation and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hardcore scientists have laid that out </v>

292
00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:05.621
<v Speaker 3>as as a reality in the addiction </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature degree because the ease more </v>

293
00:15:05.621 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 3>secular language around that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual transformation could just be a</v>

294
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:12.521
<v Speaker 3>change of perspective or a renewal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a radical change of perspective from an </v>

295
00:15:12.671 --> 00:15:16.400
<v Speaker 3>a and it typically in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's from a self centered view of self</v>

296
00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:21.401
<v Speaker 3>obsessive view about gain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own needs met a solid cystic </v>

297
00:15:21.401 --> 00:15:25.930
<v Speaker 3>narcissistic perspective of low life is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just an adventure where I go </v>

298
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.160
<v Speaker 3>around trying to accumulate and accrue </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

299
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to be of service.</v>

300
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.800
<v Speaker 3>That's of the transition in right </v>
<v Speaker 3>microscopically,</v>

301
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:39.310
<v Speaker 3>but in addition to a community like </v>
<v Speaker 3>having connections between one another,</v>

302
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.440
<v Speaker 3>the 12 steps themselves I think are an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting model for transformation and</v>

303
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:51.130
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be overlooked and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what my book was about is could that </v>

304
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.000
<v Speaker 3>method be transposed to anybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in change?</v>

305
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.610
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted to talk to you about that to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your perspective on them.</v>

306
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
<v Speaker 3>The first step is acknowledging that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were powerless over our addiction in </v>

307
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.200
<v Speaker 3>your life has become unmanageable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just admitted this,</v>

308
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be in this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

309
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:08.870
<v Speaker 3>so there's two parts to that admission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A one is that you're in trouble.</v>

310
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I guess there's three.</v>

311
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:16.540
<v Speaker 3>You're in trouble and it's serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things could be better and you don't </v>

312
00:16:16.881 --> 00:16:18.980
<v Speaker 3>have the wherewithal at the moment to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make them better.</v>

313
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:24.430
<v Speaker 3>So the thing that's interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is there's a kind of radical </v>

314
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.340
<v Speaker 3>humiliation and humility that goes along</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that because you say,</v>

315
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 3>I have a problem and what I know at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment isn't sufficient to solve it.</v>

316
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because now you've opened yourself up to</v>

317
00:16:32.331 --> 00:16:34.520
<v Speaker 3>the possibility of learning something as</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

318
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:35.180
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

319
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't know enough to fix this.</v>

320
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.280
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

321
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:42.430
<v Speaker 3>well you could learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that's so </v>

322
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.270
<v Speaker 3>interesting about people is that if they</v>
<v Speaker 3>decide they have a problem and they also</v>

323
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:49.271
<v Speaker 3>noticed that they could learn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the probability that they will learn </v>

324
00:16:49.271 --> 00:16:50.150
<v Speaker 3>goes way up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very interesting.</v>

325
00:16:50.151 --> 00:16:55.151
<v Speaker 3>You've actually conflated the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>three steps there in your analysis of </v>

326
00:16:55.151 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 3>the first one because the first one is </v>
<v Speaker 3>admission that there's a problem.</v>

327
00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:03.251
<v Speaker 3>The second one is recognizing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>things could improve like counter </v>

328
00:17:03.251 --> 00:17:04.250
<v Speaker 3>believe that power greater than </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves could restore us to sanity and</v>

329
00:17:04.251 --> 00:17:09.251
<v Speaker 3>the third one is made a decision to turn</v>
<v Speaker 3>our life and our will over to the care </v>

330
00:17:09.251 --> 00:17:09.690
<v Speaker 3>of God as we understood God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

331
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:10.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

332
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.680
<v Speaker 3>We could talk about that from a secular </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes back.</v>

333
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could talk about that from a secular </v>

334
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:17.740
<v Speaker 3>perspective and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

335
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.920
<v Speaker 3>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a higher order moral principle </v>

336
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.260
<v Speaker 3>that needs to be brought into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation and you sort of described that</v>

337
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.330
<v Speaker 3>right at the beginning of the question </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you said,</v>

338
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.470
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

339
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Partly what you do when you move from an</v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted state,</v>

340
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.640
<v Speaker 3>from a psychological perspective is </v>
<v Speaker 3>moved from a viewpoint of the </v>

341
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.461
<v Speaker 3>gratification of immediate desire and </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe the accumulation of things as </v>

342
00:17:36.461 --> 00:17:38.210
<v Speaker 3>a marker of success to the notion that </v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

343
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:43.211
<v Speaker 3>you actually have a higher purpose and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that higher purpose might involve being </v>

344
00:17:43.211 --> 00:17:44.690
<v Speaker 3>of service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could be of service to yourself,</v>

345
00:17:44.691 --> 00:17:46.310
<v Speaker 3>which means you wouldn't be addicted </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

346
00:17:46.311 --> 00:17:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Because that's not a good way of being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of service to yourself.</v>

347
00:17:48.621 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 3>But I've serviced to yourself and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>broader community,</v>

348
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:56.571
<v Speaker 3>however you might define that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher order purpose and can integrate </v>

349
00:17:56.571 --> 00:18:00.980
<v Speaker 3>your motivations at at a level that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't leave you at the whim of </v>

350
00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.821
<v Speaker 3>impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the purpose of a higher order </v>

351
00:18:04.821 --> 00:18:04.821
<v Speaker 3>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>

352
00:18:04.821 --> 00:18:06.130
<v Speaker 3>so we've got three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He asked that.</v>

353
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:11.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the first phase to get you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that position where you're willing to </v>

354
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:11.400
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in the possibility of change and</v>

355
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:13.290
<v Speaker 3>accept help in order to achieve that </v>
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

356
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.960
<v Speaker 3>The fourth and fifth steps are about </v>
<v Speaker 3>inventorying.</v>

357
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Get like this is where the 12 step </v>
<v Speaker 3>program becomes a fusion of spirituality</v>

358
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:26.001
<v Speaker 3>and psychoanalysis because the fourth </v>
<v Speaker 3>step is like a a four column method </v>

359
00:18:26.001 --> 00:18:30.231
<v Speaker 3>where you write down a list of all your </v>
<v Speaker 3>resentments in your life and childhood </v>

360
00:18:30.231 --> 00:18:31.110
<v Speaker 3>resentments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have resentments against the government,</v>

361
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.360
<v Speaker 3>people you work with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you write it all down,</v>

362
00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:38.361
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a diagnostic tool where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you identify what it is in you that </v>

363
00:18:38.361 --> 00:18:42.590
<v Speaker 3>doesn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and also interestingly in a in 12 </v>

364
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:47.790
<v Speaker 3>step theology that's called it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says that anything,</v>

365
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.820
<v Speaker 3>anytime that you are personally </v>
<v Speaker 3>disturbed there is you have to take </v>

366
00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.190
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To a degree,</v>

367
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:55.000
<v Speaker 3>there is something in you that's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective.</v>

368
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.030
<v Speaker 3>It should at least ask yourself that </v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

369
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.270
<v Speaker 3>Is it me or is it the world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

370
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's consider first the possibility </v>

371
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:04.550
<v Speaker 3>that it might be.</v>

372
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.550
<v Speaker 3>I wrote about that in the sixth rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

373
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.620
<v Speaker 3>Put Your assault how?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say around the house.</v>

374
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.390
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

375
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.160
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got our two Ra,</v>

376
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:15.170
<v Speaker 3>like my idea to truncate it and somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 3>more as a linguistically explicit </v>

377
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.920
<v Speaker 3>explosive Laden version of the 12 steps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've got your 12 rules for life here</v>

378
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.690
<v Speaker 3>and they don't necessarily correlate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

379
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:29.810
<v Speaker 3>because like you say your first one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up straight with your shoulders </v>

380
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.810
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I that.</v>

381
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:30.080
<v Speaker 3>So a great chapter I think I love about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

382
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.250
<v Speaker 3>the lobster staff and they sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

383
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.170
<v Speaker 3>the ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>timeless,</v>

384
00:19:34.171 --> 00:19:39.171
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most roots of hierarchies and the </v>

385
00:19:39.171 --> 00:19:39.300
<v Speaker 3>chemicals that are at play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's happening when you're,</v>

386
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.040
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that play?</v>

387
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:43.920
<v Speaker 3>When we talk about self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

388
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:49.070
<v Speaker 3>and this year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sixth one set your own house in </v>

389
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.901
<v Speaker 3>perfect order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said before you criticize the world </v>

390
00:19:50.901 --> 00:19:51.120
<v Speaker 3>steps four and five in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a 12 step program,</v>

391
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.890
<v Speaker 3>deal with that inventory.</v>

392
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.890
<v Speaker 3>What's going on in your life inventory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what your baggage is in your own </v>

393
00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:01.161
<v Speaker 3>personal opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very practical that it's </v>

394
00:20:01.161 --> 00:20:01.161
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

395
00:20:01.161 --> 00:20:03.891
<v Speaker 3>let's say you want to fix up your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is actually quite a lot like </v>

396
00:20:03.891 --> 00:20:05.490
<v Speaker 3>fixing yourself up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a very common dream metaphor.</v>

397
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing you want to do is go </v>

398
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:10.940
<v Speaker 3>look around and see what needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>fixed.</v>

399
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:10.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

400
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.540
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the interesting thing about that,</v>

401
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.890
<v Speaker 3>this is akin to what comedians do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that as soon as you're willing to </v>

402
00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.710
<v Speaker 3>admit Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at a problem and then rise above it</v>

403
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:24.711
<v Speaker 3>right away and make a joke about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as soon as you're willing to admit </v>

404
00:20:24.711 --> 00:20:28.010
<v Speaker 3>that you have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're immediately contacted the </v>

405
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.540
<v Speaker 3>part of yourself that's at least strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to admit that you have a problem.</v>

406
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.930
<v Speaker 3>And so as soon as the act of admitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is actually the first step </v>

407
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.930
<v Speaker 3>to solving it.</v>

408
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:36.390
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

409
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.450
<v Speaker 3>and it it's an optimistic step because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>

410
00:20:39.451 --> 00:20:44.451
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't admit to that I have a problem </v>

411
00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:44.550
<v Speaker 3>because what if I can't solve it or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

412
00:20:44.551 --> 00:20:47.650
<v Speaker 3>So then maybe you won't admit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do to it,</v>

413
00:20:47.651 --> 00:20:52.651
<v Speaker 3>you're simultaneously admitting to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility that you could solve it and </v>

414
00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:54.460
<v Speaker 3>then it can actually become something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's optimistic.</v>

415
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:55.060
<v Speaker 3>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

416
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:56.560
<v Speaker 3>my life is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

417
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:59.380
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm doing 50 things wrong.</v>

418
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.750
<v Speaker 3>Well Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can fix those things and then maybe it</v>

419
00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:06.751
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be so horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It demonstrated the admission itself </v>

420
00:21:06.751 --> 00:21:07.480
<v Speaker 3>demonstrates progression and possibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>for further progression.</v>

421
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.660
<v Speaker 3>I think it relates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why humility is always stressed </v>

422
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:12.660
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

423
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.960
<v Speaker 3>in great religious traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humility is precisely that.</v>

424
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have to look at why you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so good.</v>

425
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:23.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and you know that that has to break </v>

426
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:23.970
<v Speaker 3>down your pride to some degree in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrogance.</v>

427
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:28.740
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's great because if you break </v>

428
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.391
<v Speaker 3>down your pride and your arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're primed to learn and you can </v>

429
00:21:30.391 --> 00:21:30.430
<v Speaker 3>solve your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's nothing in that.</v>

430
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit crushing to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you might think,</v>

431
00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:38.131
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's really a lot of things wrong </v>

432
00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:40.261
<v Speaker 3>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least then you're on the on the </v>

433
00:21:40.261 --> 00:21:40.720
<v Speaker 3>road to fixing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My personal journey of recovery has been</v>

434
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.900
<v Speaker 3>like a kind of death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a light,</v>

435
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I was 27 it was like the death</v>

436
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Speaker 3>of the drug addict self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy does funny because I told Tammy</v>

437
00:21:49.061 --> 00:21:51.850
<v Speaker 3>when we were coming here today that when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were 27,</v>

438
00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:56.851
<v Speaker 3>you made the decision to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was 27 because that's when </v>

439
00:21:56.851 --> 00:21:57.880
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say like you,</v>

440
00:21:57.881 --> 00:21:59.530
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrities who,</v>

441
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.460
<v Speaker 3>who are sort of on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they die all the time at 27 because they</v>

442
00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:04.450
<v Speaker 3>don't make that decision.</v>

443
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.660
<v Speaker 3>They decided that they don't decide that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to take that final step </v>

444
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.800
<v Speaker 3>into maturation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to hold onto that Peter Pan </v>

445
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:13.800
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

446
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.790
<v Speaker 3>that pause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You bet you exactly that.</v>

447
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:20.770
<v Speaker 3>They want to hold onto that and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't hold onto that and live yes,</v>

448
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:25.830
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a further death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm noticing now in my early forties so </v>

449
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.260
<v Speaker 3>that are now at the midway point have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been made in that sort of Dante,</v>

450
00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.300
<v Speaker 3>esquire and now I'm moving towards the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grave and now I'm like,</v>

451
00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.190
<v Speaker 3>there's a different kind of alertness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and merging and back to this step,</v>

452
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.380
<v Speaker 3>four and five minutes in this process of</v>
<v Speaker 3>inventorying.</v>

453
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.070
<v Speaker 3>After you've might an imagery and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

454
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:48.260
<v Speaker 3>you've correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've honestly and openly put down </v>

455
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:48.700
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incidents of child abuse,</v>

456
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.340
<v Speaker 3>things that you've said to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that your shame.</v>

457
00:22:51.341 --> 00:22:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Once you've been willing to inscribe </v>
<v Speaker 3>your shame,</v>

458
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.400
<v Speaker 3>then you tell another person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person that you trust.</v>

459
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.100
<v Speaker 3>In the original literature it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

460
00:23:00.101 --> 00:23:01.690
<v Speaker 3>it could be a cleric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a doctor,</v>

461
00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:05.410
<v Speaker 3>or wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It typically in a 12 step structures.</v>

462
00:23:05.411 --> 00:23:07.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like a mentor figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that has the.</v>

463
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:12.620
<v Speaker 3>That's the role of confession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which obviously a huge part of </v>

464
00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:12.620
<v Speaker 3>psychoanalysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point in your book,</v>

465
00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.210
<v Speaker 3>I think this pertains to is when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>took like the Dragon and the dragon gave</v>

466
00:23:15.211 --> 00:23:20.211
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said there was that Kid's book that </v>

467
00:23:20.211 --> 00:23:20.211
<v Speaker 3>you read where it talks about the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting bigger and bigger.</v>

468
00:23:20.211 --> 00:23:23.701
<v Speaker 3>If it's not identified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think four and five are somewhat like </v>

469
00:23:23.701 --> 00:23:23.701
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

470
00:23:23.701 --> 00:23:27.961
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in part of the point of that kid's book </v>

471
00:23:27.961 --> 00:23:27.961
<v Speaker 3>is that as soon as you turn around and </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at something,</v>

472
00:23:27.961 --> 00:23:32.130
<v Speaker 3>it tends to shrink and that's partly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because imagine that you have a memory </v>

473
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.940
<v Speaker 3>that you won't confront.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

474
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.040
<v Speaker 3>there's something in that memory that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifying,</v>

475
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:41.610
<v Speaker 3>but and that means it's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with everything else that's </v>

476
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:41.610
<v Speaker 3>terrifying and so it's horror.</v>

477
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:46.370
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then when you turn around and look </v>

478
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.370
<v Speaker 3>at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

479
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.370
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible,</v>

480
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.590
<v Speaker 3>but it's horrible in this precise and </v>
<v Speaker 3>defined way,</v>

481
00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 3>and that takes it away from all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other potential horrors of it.</v>

482
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:57.610
<v Speaker 3>It starts to shrink it right away and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also makes you into the thing that can </v>

483
00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:58.520
<v Speaker 3>turn around and look at the horror,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a real,</v>

484
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.430
<v Speaker 3>real positive transformation lacked on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your part.</v>

485
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:06.870
<v Speaker 3>So it's true that somehow in the being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being prescriptive and being specific,</v>

486
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.610
<v Speaker 3>the problem becomes manageable because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's limitless,</v>

487
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.660
<v Speaker 3>not fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes a apocalyptic in the end.</v>

488
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.360
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the worst thing that Kevin is?</v>

489
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.760
<v Speaker 3>I could be destroyed and everyone I love</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be destroyed itself,</v>

490
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 3>could be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And until you say,</v>

491
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.590
<v Speaker 3>well actually know what this is is you </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel inadequate because you weren't role</v>

492
00:24:25.591 --> 00:24:26.370
<v Speaker 3>multiple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

493
00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:28.730
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I can maybe take care of that.</v>

494
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.690
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still bad,</v>

495
00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:31.160
<v Speaker 3>but it's not everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you,</v>

496
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.240
<v Speaker 3>you phrased that exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that without that attentive </v>

497
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:36.820
<v Speaker 3>delimiting it becomes apocalyptic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

498
00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:38.960
<v Speaker 3>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very old idea.</v>

499
00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:42.290
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that happens in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>

500
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Enuma elish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the gods are created.</v>

501
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.150
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the,</v>

502
00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:51.180
<v Speaker 3>they're the offspring of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of thinking about it </v>

503
00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.880
<v Speaker 3>and they become very careless and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroy their category system.</v>

504
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:56.210
<v Speaker 3>They destroy their father essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>and chaos comes flooding back.</v>

505
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:01.810
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happens to people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't looking at things and delimiting </v>

506
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.710
<v Speaker 3>them properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They become up apocalyptic and do the </v>

507
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:05.710
<v Speaker 3>mint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

508
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:09.490
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes in a mythology there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the positive too,</v>

509
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.250
<v Speaker 3>confronting confronting of the God age </v>
<v Speaker 3>promethium.</v>

510
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.010
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes we need to steal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steal the fire.</v>

511
00:25:16.011 --> 00:25:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes we need to challenge these </v>
<v Speaker 3>orthodoxies,</v>

512
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.220
<v Speaker 3>don't we?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes sir.</v>

513
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.590
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

514
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.680
<v Speaker 3>part part of the well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the death that you're describing</v>

515
00:25:24.681 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 3>is actually the confrontation with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>form of tyrant,</v>

516
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:32.500
<v Speaker 3>like your previously addicted self was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tyrant over your emergent self.</v>

517
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:38.710
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's an internal tyrant and you </v>

518
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.710
<v Speaker 3>said it was predicated on a false value </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

519
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.270
<v Speaker 3>That's a false set of gods essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you had to confront that.</v>

520
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:46.271
<v Speaker 3>That is a kind of death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think that some the addiction or </v>

521
00:25:46.271 --> 00:25:49.631
<v Speaker 3>addictive tendencies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't mean as severe as chemical </v>

522
00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:51.971
<v Speaker 3>dependency or forms of addiction </v>
<v Speaker 3>addiction or a kind of self constructed </v>

523
00:25:51.971 --> 00:25:53.990
<v Speaker 3>formaldehyde to preserve you in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>state of trauma,</v>

524
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:59.110
<v Speaker 3>but trauma is acknowledged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No means to navigate trauma are present </v>

525
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 3>because of the isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have no mentor,</v>

526
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.800
<v Speaker 3>you have no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no doctrine,</v>

527
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.010
<v Speaker 3>you have no community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so addiction steps in,</v>

528
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.070
<v Speaker 3>this is how our preserved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how I will not die.</v>

529
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:14.960
<v Speaker 3>I will find this notice that is a habit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a repeated pattern to sustain you,</v>

530
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:19.100
<v Speaker 3>a holding pattern so that you don't die </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there is no way out.</v>

531
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:20.620
<v Speaker 3>There's no guide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no path.</v>

532
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.420
<v Speaker 3>You're just in the forest and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't a way out,</v>

533
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:28.570
<v Speaker 3>so I thought that addiction for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal experience in that I hope and </v>

534
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:32.201
<v Speaker 3>suspect more broadly is a means for sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of status for preservation after trauma.</v>

535
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:38.720
<v Speaker 3>The rupture occurs is not addressed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a means for survival emerges in the form</v>

536
00:26:38.721 --> 00:26:43.721
<v Speaker 3>of addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Addiction is not your nemesis is your </v>

537
00:26:43.721 --> 00:26:43.721
<v Speaker 3>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least while you're in,</v>

538
00:26:43.721 --> 00:26:47.291
<v Speaker 3>whilst you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's certainly a literature on </v>

539
00:26:47.291 --> 00:26:49.611
<v Speaker 3>addiction that indicates that many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people use addictive substances as a </v>

540
00:26:49.611 --> 00:26:51.870
<v Speaker 3>form of self medication and they tend to</v>
<v Speaker 3>find the drug that best,</v>

541
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 3>best medicates them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

542
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 3>And for different people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's different.</v>

543
00:26:55.801 --> 00:26:58.010
<v Speaker 3>Drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alcohol,</v>

544
00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:58.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

545
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Now say one of the other things that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>proposing in my book is to use one of </v>

546
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.230
<v Speaker 3>the grandiose terminology is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

547
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:12.310
<v Speaker 3>they template for a recovery from </v>
<v Speaker 3>obvious forms of addiction could be </v>

548
00:27:13.051 --> 00:27:16.620
<v Speaker 3>applicable to less evident forms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>addiction,</v>

549
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:22.160
<v Speaker 3>just patterns and habits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because so far the things that </v>

550
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.760
<v Speaker 3>you've laid out would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be in keeping with that idea.</v>

551
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you admit to the problem.</v>

552
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:30.730
<v Speaker 3>I really also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea of laying out your </v>

553
00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:34.431
<v Speaker 3>resentments is unbelievably useful </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's also a way of dealing </v>

554
00:27:34.431 --> 00:27:37.911
<v Speaker 3>with the malevolence within you that </v>
<v Speaker 3>might interfere with your own recovery </v>

555
00:27:37.911 --> 00:27:40.560
<v Speaker 3>because you're angry at yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're angry at your parents,</v>

556
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:45.561
<v Speaker 3>if you're angry at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the probability that you're going to be </v>

557
00:27:45.561 --> 00:27:46.560
<v Speaker 3>in the mental state that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>allow you to chart a positive course for</v>

558
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:47.910
<v Speaker 3>yourself is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very low.</v>

559
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:52.970
<v Speaker 3>How can you have a clear and authentic </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with your wife if you've </v>

560
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:54.210
<v Speaker 3>not correctly understood what you feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>about your own mother?</v>

561
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.970
<v Speaker 3>If you feel like that you are enmeshed </v>
<v Speaker 3>or trapped in some way?</v>

562
00:27:56.971 --> 00:28:00.720
<v Speaker 3>How am I supposed to have or have not </v>
<v Speaker 3>understood that if I've not gained a new</v>

563
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:03.020
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I've not transcended it by sharing is</v>

564
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:06.750
<v Speaker 3>another person that in in the sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>beauty story and the Disney story,</v>

565
00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:09.300
<v Speaker 3>when the prince is encapsulated in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>castle,</v>

566
00:28:09.301 --> 00:28:12.720
<v Speaker 3>in the dungeon at the end and before he </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes and rescues sleeping,</v>

567
00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 3>beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has to confront his terrible mother.</v>

568
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.700
<v Speaker 3>She turns into the dragon of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

569
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.250
<v Speaker 3>He has to use honesty and truth to </v>
<v Speaker 3>confront her,</v>

570
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.130
<v Speaker 3>and until he does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't free the maiden from her sleep.</v>

571
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's called the,</v>

572
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:30.290
<v Speaker 3>that's called the freeing of the anima </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the negative mother archetype and </v>

573
00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:30.330
<v Speaker 3>union psychology.</v>

574
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:35.330
<v Speaker 3>It's precisely that and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that negative feminine will be </v>

575
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.541
<v Speaker 3>overlaid on your partner unless you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're able to clarify it and </v>

576
00:28:38.541 --> 00:28:42.741
<v Speaker 3>clarify your relationship with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that could be something like </v>

577
00:28:42.741 --> 00:28:42.741
<v Speaker 3>overprotection or it could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

578
00:28:42.741 --> 00:28:44.970
<v Speaker 3>in your past or it could be neglect for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that matter,</v>

579
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.480
<v Speaker 3>or it could be the rejection at many at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hands of many,</v>

580
00:28:48.481 --> 00:28:53.481
<v Speaker 3>many women before you encountered this </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman that you were going to bring that </v>

581
00:28:53.481 --> 00:28:54.600
<v Speaker 3>bitterness forward as a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>projection.</v>

582
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:58.080
<v Speaker 3>If we are unwilling to undertake this </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of excavation,</v>

583
00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.640
<v Speaker 3>then we asked them to continually have </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships that are cutaneous.</v>

584
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Just a superficial coordinates will </v>
<v Speaker 3>govern our experience in relationships.</v>

585
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's the repetition compulsion from</v>

586
00:29:10.051 --> 00:29:14.070
<v Speaker 3>a Freudian perspective is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that isn't how Freud explained it.</v>

587
00:29:14.071 --> 00:29:15.930
<v Speaker 3>That's how I would explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

588
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.140
<v Speaker 3>but the simple explanation of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

589
00:29:19.141 --> 00:29:24.141
<v Speaker 3>if you bring the same set of priests </v>
<v Speaker 3>unexamined presuppositions to every </v>

590
00:29:24.141 --> 00:29:26.010
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same fate will play out.</v>

591
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:27.000
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

592
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.380
<v Speaker 3>those women are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

593
00:29:28.381 --> 00:29:33.381
<v Speaker 3>well actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the part of the part of them that </v>

594
00:29:33.381 --> 00:29:35.940
<v Speaker 3>you're able to make contact with acts </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same every time.</v>

595
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.010
<v Speaker 3>That's a very different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>

596
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:43.040
<v Speaker 3>And this is where six and seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next steps are chronologically </v>

597
00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:43.040
<v Speaker 3>occur,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

598
00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:43.900
<v Speaker 1>there's six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having done this inventory,</v>

599
00:29:43.901 --> 00:29:47.020
<v Speaker 1>you recognize what patterns have been at</v>
<v Speaker 1>play in your life,</v>

600
00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:51.370
<v Speaker 1>which particular in the lexicon of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>recovery defects of character,</v>

601
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:55.910
<v Speaker 1>of governed you often pride wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control other people's perspective,</v>

602
00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:57.400
<v Speaker 1>self pity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self centeredness,</v>

603
00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:58.320
<v Speaker 1>intolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inpatients,</v>

604
00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:59.890
<v Speaker 1>green jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>envy,</v>

605
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:04.891
<v Speaker 1>lost slope for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Identify the seven deadly sins and how </v>

606
00:30:04.891 --> 00:30:05.970
<v Speaker 1>they play out in your life essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

607
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:11.100
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you become in step six is about </v>

608
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.260
<v Speaker 1>becoming willing to live differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The saying,</v>

609
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:16.060
<v Speaker 1>are you actually willing to let go of </v>
<v Speaker 1>last?</v>

610
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Are you or do you like lost when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to it,</v>

611
00:30:18.731 --> 00:30:21.670
<v Speaker 1>do you like being impatient?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it serve you in some way?</v>

612
00:30:21.671 --> 00:30:23.270
<v Speaker 1>To be slothful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

613
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.340
<v Speaker 1>It's highly probable that it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

614
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:25.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

615
00:30:25.801 --> 00:30:26.950
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy.</v>

616
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:29.200
<v Speaker 1>It's gratifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's powerful,</v>

617
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.380
<v Speaker 1>it's pleasurable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the short term like </v>

618
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.110
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are reasons that people are </v>

619
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.110
<v Speaker 1>tempted by by the seven deadly sins.</v>

620
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Gloria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gloria,</v>

621
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:45.020
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a dark romantic and you really </v>

622
00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.530
<v Speaker 1>see that in the depths of celebrities </v>
<v Speaker 1>around 27 is they.</v>

623
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.740
<v Speaker 1>They fall in love with the allure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of have that romantic death </v>

624
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.030
<v Speaker 1>and he does the men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the Anti Libido,</v>

625
00:30:55.031 --> 00:30:57.160
<v Speaker 1>that dark libido,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that death force,</v>

626
00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.860
<v Speaker 1>so with the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you have diagnosed,</v>

627
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:04.861
<v Speaker 1>which particular defects of character </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been most prominent in your path </v>

628
00:31:04.861 --> 00:31:08.701
<v Speaker 1>and become willing to let go of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This step seven is making a concerted </v>

629
00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:14.460
<v Speaker 1>and real effort to live without them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it kind of comes down to </v>

630
00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.480
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what are you willing to sacrifice</v>

631
00:31:16.481 --> 00:31:21.481
<v Speaker 1>in order to move forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to give up something that you </v>

632
00:31:21.481 --> 00:31:21.481
<v Speaker 1>love and you may have to give up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you love the best.</v>

633
00:31:21.481 --> 00:31:23.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental sacrificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>motif.</v>

634
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Sacrifices and the unattractive idea in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our self.</v>

635
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.220
<v Speaker 1>In in our society that's based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>consuming and indulgence and this is not</v>

636
00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:32.020
<v Speaker 1>something that I would like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is again,</v>

637
00:31:32.021 --> 00:31:34.630
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you were you a nice I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What differ is that I would not,</v>

638
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:40.020
<v Speaker 1>whilst this will not change about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual's engagement or kind of step </v>

639
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:40.150
<v Speaker 1>one and acknowledgement that needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

640
00:31:40.151 --> 00:31:42.520
<v Speaker 1>This is where I say there is a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

641
00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:47.730
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason our society has </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a manifestation of these darker </v>

642
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.330
<v Speaker 1>impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the prevalent forces,</v>

643
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:51.790
<v Speaker 1>at least in the kind of society I live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

644
00:31:51.791 --> 00:31:53.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like to live in China or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya.</v>

645
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying like in London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

646
00:31:56.861 --> 00:31:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Your emphasis on immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>gratification,</v>

647
00:31:59.361 --> 00:32:04.361
<v Speaker 1>too much emphasis on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because immediate gratification is a </v>

648
00:32:04.361 --> 00:32:04.361
<v Speaker 1>tool of consumerism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would be my argument.</v>

649
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.720
<v Speaker 1>So like I it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at this point in the program,</v>

650
00:32:07.721 --> 00:32:12.721
<v Speaker 1>it's where the spirituality becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find personally undeniable.</v>

651
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.460
<v Speaker 1>But you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

652
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:20.080
<v Speaker 1>you have to call to something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to in a sense,</v>

653
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:25.110
<v Speaker 1>be lay yourself open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of prayer becomes quite </v>

654
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.380
<v Speaker 1>important now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>

655
00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:32.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a union idea there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the union self is the thing that </v>

656
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:35.830
<v Speaker 1>guides the ego through transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine the ego,</v>

657
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:40.831
<v Speaker 1>which is what you think you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the thing about the ego is the ego </v>

658
00:32:40.831 --> 00:32:40.831
<v Speaker 1>can be wrong</v>

659
00:32:40.831 --> 00:32:45.430
<v Speaker 3>and the ego can die and be reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what that indicates is that there's </v>

660
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:49.360
<v Speaker 3>something underneath the Eagle can guide</v>
<v Speaker 3>that process of transformation and </v>

661
00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:53.570
<v Speaker 3>partly what you're calling on when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>call on this higher power is at least </v>

662
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:57.911
<v Speaker 3>from a psychological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a decision to rely on that thing </v>

663
00:32:57.911 --> 00:32:58.580
<v Speaker 3>that can guide you through </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>

664
00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.010
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because surely as we said in relation to</v>

665
00:33:01.011 --> 00:33:06.011
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are likely relate into a set of </v>

666
00:33:06.011 --> 00:33:06.380
<v Speaker 3>coordinates that we impose on info </v>
<v Speaker 3>commerce.</v>

667
00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:11.390
<v Speaker 3>The female.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same would be true of the cell that </v>

668
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.981
<v Speaker 3>we have created an impression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an egoic impression we've constructed </v>

669
00:33:14.981 --> 00:33:19.270
<v Speaker 3>and our official self.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But beneath it there is our higher self </v>

670
00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.540
<v Speaker 3>or an exterior self that comes often </v>
<v Speaker 3>composed of.</v>

671
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:24.920
<v Speaker 3>It's often composed of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>refuse to or we're willing to develop.</v>

672
00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:26.810
<v Speaker 3>And so when young talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

673
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:31.811
<v Speaker 3>the incorporation of the shadow is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've constructed a Nigo and there's </v>

674
00:33:31.811 --> 00:33:35.441
<v Speaker 3>things it can do and can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's allowed to do and it isn't </v>

675
00:33:35.441 --> 00:33:38.561
<v Speaker 3>allowed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a shadow domain that </v>

676
00:33:38.561 --> 00:33:38.600
<v Speaker 3>would consist of those things that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could do but haven't.</v>

677
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.840
<v Speaker 3>And some of that's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of it's what you need to break </v>

678
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:43.840
<v Speaker 3>free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a,</v>

679
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.810
<v Speaker 3>a infinite variety in the shadow or are </v>
<v Speaker 3>there sort of templates there?</v>

680
00:33:47.811 --> 00:33:52.811
<v Speaker 3>Would you say that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a common component of the last </v>

681
00:33:52.811 --> 00:33:54.440
<v Speaker 3>aggression aggression because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most.</v>

682
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.210
<v Speaker 3>The mobilized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

683
00:33:56.211 --> 00:34:01.211
<v Speaker 3>They're the two that are most difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>to integrate into the ego because </v>

684
00:34:01.211 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 3>aggression destroys and of course lost </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsumes.</v>

685
00:34:01.641 --> 00:34:03.350
<v Speaker 3>The individual to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

686
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.660
<v Speaker 3>to well to sexual sexual desire is such </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lust,</v>

687
00:34:06.661 --> 00:34:08.840
<v Speaker 3>isn't identified as a very powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>self.</v>

688
00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:10.190
<v Speaker 3>It can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can subsume.</v>

689
00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:15.191
<v Speaker 3>So I suppose that's why a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>theological doctrines focus on the </v>

690
00:34:15.191 --> 00:34:17.450
<v Speaker 3>control of last another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>

691
00:34:17.451 --> 00:34:19.280
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a disruptive force,</v>

692
00:34:19.281 --> 00:34:20.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because for example,</v>

693
00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:25.691
<v Speaker 3>if you make a medium to longterm </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with someone in new </v>

694
00:34:25.691 --> 00:34:28.460
<v Speaker 3>negotiate that that provides you with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stable structure that can operate across</v>

695
00:34:28.461 --> 00:34:30.110
<v Speaker 3>your entire life is good for you.</v>

696
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.850
<v Speaker 3>It's good for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good for your kids,</v>

697
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:36.900
<v Speaker 3>it's good for society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then if you're really attracted to </v>

698
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.430
<v Speaker 3>someone momentarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be driven to act on that and and</v>

699
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:40.310
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the rest of that can burn up.</v>

700
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:45.640
<v Speaker 3>It's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's no wonder that it's viewed </v>

701
00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.311
<v Speaker 3>as a force of tremendous disruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's also a force of tremendous </v>

702
00:34:48.311 --> 00:34:49.010
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

703
00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:51.170
<v Speaker 3>Because you want to be attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

704
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.730
<v Speaker 3>You want to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

705
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:57.170
<v Speaker 3>that vital libido as part of part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's driving you forward,</v>

706
00:34:57.171 --> 00:35:00.350
<v Speaker 3>but hopefully it's on your side and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>working against you.</v>

707
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:05.650
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're successful and you've put </v>

708
00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:05.650
<v Speaker 3>yourself together and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>disciplined,</v>

709
00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:08.180
<v Speaker 3>you should still be maximally sexually </v>
<v Speaker 3>attractive,</v>

710
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.490
<v Speaker 3>but it should be under your control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not a,</v>

711
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.830
<v Speaker 3>you're not the puppet of that force </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

712
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:16.010
<v Speaker 3>It's integrated into you and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>much better way to manage it.</v>

713
00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.430
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your understanding,</v>

714
00:35:19.431 --> 00:35:22.330
<v Speaker 3>how is the shadow incorporated?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What rituals,</v>

715
00:35:22.331 --> 00:35:27.331
<v Speaker 3>what ceremonies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what behaviors successfully incorporate </v>

716
00:35:27.331 --> 00:35:28.830
<v Speaker 3>the shadow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say in using the example of last week,</v>

717
00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:33.890
<v Speaker 3>what's a way back in for the sort of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's been disembodied or repressed </v>

718
00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 3>or it's a safe way for it back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there one?</v>

719
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think part of it is to,</v>

720
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.910
<v Speaker 3>is to admit to your desires within your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own relationship,</v>

721
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you might say,</v>

722
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:46.960
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

723
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

724
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:49.500
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

725
00:35:49.501 --> 00:35:54.501
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're tired of the games that </v>

726
00:35:54.501 --> 00:35:54.501
<v Speaker 3>you're intelligent enough to play with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your wife,</v>

727
00:35:54.501 --> 00:35:56.550
<v Speaker 3>but she's as plurry potential as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

728
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:59.040
<v Speaker 3>and so you have to admit to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>desires,</v>

729
00:35:59.041 --> 00:36:04.041
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you have to make them </v>

730
00:36:04.041 --> 00:36:04.580
<v Speaker 3>consciously manifest within your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship and then you know,</v>

731
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.960
<v Speaker 3>when people can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do that by,</v>

732
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.050
<v Speaker 3>by dressing up or by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by playing sexually,</v>

733
00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:10.530
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>

734
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:11.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>play.</v>

735
00:36:11.941 --> 00:36:16.941
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That plays a transformative element and </v>

736
00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:16.941
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

737
00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:18.640
<v Speaker 3>and it might be that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable with the idea of,</v>

738
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:23.890
<v Speaker 3>of your wife as sexual play thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you think that a woman who's </v>

739
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.190
<v Speaker 3>married should be proper and Prim and </v>
<v Speaker 3>should only behave sexually in a certain</v>

740
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:27.510
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which case,</v>

741
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:32.600
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that becomes stale and dull and you're </v>

742
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:32.600
<v Speaker 3>more likely to be tempted by something </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the outside.</v>

743
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:37.160
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very obvious example of how </v>

744
00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.251
<v Speaker 3>habitualized thinking is prohibitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>even without reaching the extremes of </v>

745
00:36:41.371 --> 00:36:43.380
<v Speaker 3>self destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>addictive tendencies.</v>

746
00:36:43.381 --> 00:36:47.040
<v Speaker 3>If I have a habit of regarding my wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

747
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:50.490
<v Speaker 3>as object day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if that's not a objectification,</v>

748
00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:54.210
<v Speaker 3>is we're typically take care by limiting</v>
<v Speaker 3>beliefs about my wife,</v>

749
00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.170
<v Speaker 3>that the tools that breakdown addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

750
00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:01.140
<v Speaker 3>thought patterns could be used to create</v>
<v Speaker 3>new terrains,</v>

751
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.210
<v Speaker 3>new liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new play.</v>

752
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

753
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.930
<v Speaker 3>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so once you've done up to step seven,</v>

754
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:08.520
<v Speaker 3>which is essentially a step seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>

755
00:37:08.521 --> 00:37:11.570
<v Speaker 3>it's a sacrifice of the old self and </v>
<v Speaker 3>handing over to the,</v>

756
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.860
<v Speaker 3>some kind of sublime divine self.</v>

757
00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

758
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.880
<v Speaker 3>the step eight is you make a list of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you have harmed and become </v>

759
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.660
<v Speaker 3>willing to make amends to them as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>look back at your part and go,</v>

760
00:37:21.661 --> 00:37:22.860
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have stolen that.</v>

761
00:37:22.861 --> 00:37:24.780
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I treated that person badly.</v>

762
00:37:24.781 --> 00:37:25.980
<v Speaker 3>That was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lied.</v>

763
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.000
<v Speaker 3>So it's moral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes quite real repentance,</v>

764
00:37:30.001 --> 00:37:30.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Atonement,</v>

765
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:36.170
<v Speaker 3>atonement is at one meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're carrying transgressions </v>

766
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.800
<v Speaker 3>that you regard as transcriptions now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your life,</v>

767
00:37:37.801 --> 00:37:40.610
<v Speaker 3>then you don't want to carry those for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to,</v>

768
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:43.230
<v Speaker 3>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to step forward in life without</v>

769
00:37:43.231 --> 00:37:46.170
<v Speaker 3>that moral burden because you will have </v>
<v Speaker 3>contempt for yourself otherwise,</v>

770
00:37:46.171 --> 00:37:47.970
<v Speaker 3>and you won't take care of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also,</v>

771
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:53.790
<v Speaker 3>in a sense what you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about allowing lust backend incorporate </v>

772
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.150
<v Speaker 3>in last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>

773
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a more,</v>

774
00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.890
<v Speaker 3>a broader method for incorporating </v>
<v Speaker 3>annexed aspects of the self.</v>

775
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

776
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.860
<v Speaker 3>how can you fully love?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can I fully love myself?</v>

777
00:38:04.861 --> 00:38:07.890
<v Speaker 3>I know I treated that person abominably </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

778
00:38:07.891 --> 00:38:11.220
<v Speaker 3>if I go back and say that was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did you wrong.</v>

779
00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.140
<v Speaker 3>I owe you an amends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

780
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:18.350
<v Speaker 3>you invite that part of your life in you</v>
<v Speaker 3>amended your path through life as well </v>

781
00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:19.770
<v Speaker 3>as teaching yourself that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is not the way we proceed anymore.</v>

782
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.990
<v Speaker 3>That step pay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that's a real.</v>

783
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:27.010
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's taking our real action in the </v>

784
00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:27.010
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a hypothetical at that point,</v>

785
00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:31.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like telling people what </v>

786
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.670
<v Speaker 3>you've written down about your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

787
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:32.550
<v Speaker 3>about your faults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

788
00:38:32.551 --> 00:38:33.780
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it makes it real.</v>

789
00:38:33.781 --> 00:38:38.781
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're acting it out with someone </v>

790
00:38:38.781 --> 00:38:40.741
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not only a mental thing at that </v>

791
00:38:40.741 --> 00:38:42.391
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Furthermore indicates step by step a is </v>

792
00:38:42.391 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 3>done separate from the step eight is </v>
<v Speaker 3>right up the list of people.</v>

793
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 3>Step nine is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go through it.</v>

794
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.020
<v Speaker 3>It makes the distinction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

795
00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:48.720
<v Speaker 3>to create a space for you where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

796
00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.100
<v Speaker 3>where you're not continually thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not fucking doing that.</v>

797
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was abused by them.</v>

798
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did as much wrong as I did not.</v>

799
00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.070
<v Speaker 3>The point is not the point and also I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think they might've done more wrong than</v>

800
00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:00.870
<v Speaker 3>you did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

801
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.360
<v Speaker 3>but you're still stuck with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you did something wrong.</v>

802
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.660
<v Speaker 3>That's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not good,</v>

803
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:09.360
<v Speaker 3>and if you refuse to surmount the </v>
<v Speaker 3>obstacle of like inner,</v>

804
00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.640
<v Speaker 3>some arbitrary measure of who is more </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

805
00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.600
<v Speaker 3>then you continue to cast yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 3>victim hood.</v>

806
00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:19.790
<v Speaker 3>That's you have no personal autonomy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I choose to go for it.</v>

807
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:25.140
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter if you're only five </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent at fault and it also doesn't </v>

808
00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:25.140
<v Speaker 3>matter if the other person apologizes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

809
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:25.960
<v Speaker 3>they should.</v>

810
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:28.990
<v Speaker 3>It would be better for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might make things lay out.</v>

811
00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:34.020
<v Speaker 3>That's not the point and this perhaps is</v>
<v Speaker 3>where what I think is significant that </v>

812
00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.711
<v Speaker 3>now your life has become not negotiation</v>
<v Speaker 3>between you and other be beings as they </v>

813
00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:43.411
<v Speaker 3>materially present themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but between yourself and this higher </v>

814
00:39:43.411 --> 00:39:45.870
<v Speaker 3>purpose that has been declared earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you are now operating on the common</v>

815
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.970
<v Speaker 3>spiritual plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are no longer about.</v>

816
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.180
<v Speaker 3>If I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get that.</v>

817
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.490
<v Speaker 3>It precisely doesn't matter if a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

818
00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:56.491
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if you apologize or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Religious language that would be </v>

819
00:39:56.491 --> 00:39:59.050
<v Speaker 3>expressed as the discovery of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>father in heaven instead of your earthly</v>

820
00:39:59.051 --> 00:40:04.051
<v Speaker 3>father because your father in heaven </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be the higher spiritual authority </v>

821
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:08.320
<v Speaker 3>to which you owe allegiance and and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can think about that either in religious</v>

822
00:40:08.321 --> 00:40:13.321
<v Speaker 3>terms or a nonreligious terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what you've done is you've been </v>

823
00:40:13.321 --> 00:40:16.450
<v Speaker 3>in some sense as you've abstracted the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of a higher authority and a </v>

824
00:40:16.841 --> 00:40:19.480
<v Speaker 3>higher purpose and you've decided to </v>
<v Speaker 3>devote yourself to that.</v>

825
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:24.630
<v Speaker 3>That's a religious app and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>precisely antithetical to postmodernism </v>

826
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:25.000
<v Speaker 3>is saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

827
00:40:25.001 --> 00:40:25.330
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

828
00:40:25.331 --> 00:40:26.530
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is an essence.</v>

829
00:40:26.531 --> 00:40:28.480
<v Speaker 3>There is a country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a way.</v>

830
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.800
<v Speaker 3>There is a trust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

831
00:40:29.801 --> 00:40:30.340
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

832
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 3>that's what is precisely antithetical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

833
00:40:33.161 --> 00:40:38.161
<v Speaker 3>because the postmodern claim is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are multiple ways of looking at </v>

834
00:40:38.161 --> 00:40:38.560
<v Speaker 3>the world many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's true,</v>

835
00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:44.460
<v Speaker 3>but the antithesis of that is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because there's multiple ways of </v>

836
00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.821
<v Speaker 3>looking at the world doesn't mean there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are multiple proper ways of looking at </v>

837
00:40:47.821 --> 00:40:47.821
<v Speaker 3>the wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

838
00:40:47.821 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 3>there's a very narrow range of proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways of looking at the world.</v>

839
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:55.260
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my concern with atheism has always been </v>

840
00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.610
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of easy affiliation with </v>
<v Speaker 3>nihilism or why don't we just wondering </v>

841
00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:00.670
<v Speaker 3>is fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that sort of like,</v>

842
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:03.070
<v Speaker 3>that's like that's where my mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately goes,</v>

843
00:41:03.071 --> 00:41:08.071
<v Speaker 3>if there is not an order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not just smash everything to </v>

844
00:41:08.071 --> 00:41:11.031
<v Speaker 3>smithereens and you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologically that is what's happening </v>

845
00:41:11.031 --> 00:41:14.640
<v Speaker 3>ideologically with deconstructing God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're the deconstructing morality with </v>

846
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:18.031
<v Speaker 3>an agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're deconstructing and that was the </v>

847
00:41:18.031 --> 00:41:18.250
<v Speaker 3>danger that both both nature and dusty </v>
<v Speaker 3>Esq pointed to clearly.</v>

848
00:41:18.251 --> 00:41:23.251
<v Speaker 3>It's like you dispense with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent principle and you open up </v>

849
00:41:23.251 --> 00:41:25.120
<v Speaker 3>the landscape for impulsive nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are they responding to?</v>

850
00:41:25.121 --> 00:41:30.121
<v Speaker 3>Post enlightenment rationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what does the ski in nature or </v>

851
00:41:30.121 --> 00:41:33.391
<v Speaker 3>responding to why they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>responding essentially to the idea of </v>

852
00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 3>the death of God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both of them and that</v>

853
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.120
<v Speaker 1>explicitly and is an enlightenment idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where is there,</v>

854
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:41.030
<v Speaker 1>where is death of God happening at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hair should be at the hands of a,</v>

855
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:45.170
<v Speaker 1>of a kind of arrogant and narrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalism and the materialism.</v>

856
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the exposition of the exponentially.</v>

857
00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:51.650
<v Speaker 1>That has led us to where we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

858
00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:56.651
<v Speaker 1>which is that kind of okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of digging the earth from beneath </v>

859
00:41:56.651 --> 00:41:57.740
<v Speaker 1>our feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting us to the base.</v>

860
00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.160
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

861
00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:01.160
<v Speaker 1>that's the hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>

862
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.140
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>

863
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:08.170
<v Speaker 1>The last three steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step 10 is a like a continued to make </v>

864
00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:12.671
<v Speaker 1>inventory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like let this process continued for </v>

865
00:42:12.671 --> 00:42:16.151
<v Speaker 1>me in psycho analytic terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll see a therapist obviously like a </v>

866
00:42:16.151 --> 00:42:20.021
<v Speaker 1>lot is when like when there's a moment I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know any spike in my energy if I go,</v>

867
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.080
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt so.</v>

868
00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:26.110
<v Speaker 1>That was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt jealous there or I felt I felt </v>

869
00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:26.110
<v Speaker 1>small in that moment.</v>

870
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.980
<v Speaker 1>These are the moments I know and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

871
00:42:27.981 --> 00:42:32.981
<v Speaker 1>how was I participate in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What belief of mine was being </v>

872
00:42:32.981 --> 00:42:32.981
<v Speaker 1>challenged?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a helpful belief?</v>

873
00:42:32.981 --> 00:42:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Belief being a thought that I like </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a at 11,</v>

874
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.870
<v Speaker 1>that's a kind of consciousness is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

875
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:40.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make mistakes.</v>

876
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep an eye out for when I </v>

877
00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:46.640
<v Speaker 1>do make mistakes and I'm going to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>them conscious and then I'm going to try</v>

878
00:42:46.641 --> 00:42:50.450
<v Speaker 1>to work on them bringing them into into </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness because my fear,</v>

879
00:42:50.451 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 1>my number one fear on a personal level </v>
<v Speaker 1>and possibly on a social level,</v>

880
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:58.571
<v Speaker 1>I don't know quite how to extrapolate or</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflate those two notions is </v>

881
00:42:58.571 --> 00:43:02.411
<v Speaker 1>unconsciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get very afraid when I'm dealing with </v>

882
00:43:02.411 --> 00:43:04.370
<v Speaker 1>unconscious individually when I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't know why they're doing what</v>

883
00:43:04.371 --> 00:43:09.371
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He may see this in sort of violent rage </v>

884
00:43:09.371 --> 00:43:11.270
<v Speaker 1>or even in less dramatic theatrical </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors feel.</v>

885
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:16.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a great idea that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the bottom of the Christian </v>

886
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.441
<v Speaker 1>mythological tradition is that a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of consciousness destroyed the </v>

887
00:43:20.441 --> 00:43:25.151
<v Speaker 1>original paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We became conscious enough to be aware </v>

888
00:43:25.151 --> 00:43:27.851
<v Speaker 1>of our own mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cure for that is way more </v>

889
00:43:27.851 --> 00:43:28.220
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a return to unconsciousness.</v>

890
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no going back.</v>

891
00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:33.080
<v Speaker 1>There's no going back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes think the plethora of Zombie</v>

892
00:43:33.081 --> 00:43:38.081
<v Speaker 1>movies is they don't know they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>already dead and like so like that.</v>

893
00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.380
<v Speaker 1>That danger of the Zombie is the danger </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the desire for unconsciousness as a,</v>

894
00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:45.140
<v Speaker 1>as a solution to life's problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that this is again something</v>

895
00:43:45.141 --> 00:43:50.141
<v Speaker 1>we're being invited to participate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>for consumerism that live your life </v>

896
00:43:50.141 --> 00:43:51.590
<v Speaker 1>continually on the frequency of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious energy,</v>

897
00:43:51.591 --> 00:43:53.930
<v Speaker 1>such a desire and fear that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

898
00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.810
<v Speaker 1>We're not being invited to participate </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the level of consciousness,</v>

899
00:43:56.811 --> 00:43:58.910
<v Speaker 1>conscious interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presence in the moment.</v>

900
00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:03.940
<v Speaker 1>While you could make the case if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>made the case that consumerism promotes </v>

901
00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.780
<v Speaker 1>the gratification of immediate desires </v>
<v Speaker 1>above all else.</v>

902
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my,</v>

903
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:09.280
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm pushing for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

904
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:11.470
<v Speaker 1>with this original sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

905
00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:13.160
<v Speaker 1>so a little bit of consciousness as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous thing.</v>

906
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:14.930
<v Speaker 1>We become with our vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our mortality,</v>

907
00:44:14.931 --> 00:44:19.931
<v Speaker 1>our nakedness and corporate real nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the solution to this is to become </v>

908
00:44:20.481 --> 00:44:22.630
<v Speaker 1>more conscious to we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

909
00:44:22.631 --> 00:44:23.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

910
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:26.090
<v Speaker 1>how was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bible?</v>

911
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that get resolved?</v>

912
00:44:30.201 --> 00:44:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Normally they get kicked out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden.</v>

913
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Part of part of what happens in in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the redemptive story is if you think </v>

914
00:44:38.291 --> 00:44:43.291
<v Speaker 3>about Christ as a symbolic figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say is symbolic of the process of </v>

915
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:44.560
<v Speaker 3>transformation that we just described is</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the.</v>

916
00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:49.650
<v Speaker 3>One of the morals of the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>passion is that you need to radically </v>

917
00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:53.860
<v Speaker 3>accept your limitations and so part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this keeping your sins before your eyes,</v>

918
00:44:53.861 --> 00:44:56.800
<v Speaker 3>which you just described.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's all the ways that I fall short of</v>

919
00:44:56.801 --> 00:44:58.360
<v Speaker 3>the glory of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say,</v>

920
00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.880
<v Speaker 3>you know I make this mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I make this mistake,</v>

921
00:45:00.881 --> 00:45:05.881
<v Speaker 3>I make this mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all consciousness and it's </v>

922
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:05.881
<v Speaker 3>painful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

923
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

924
00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:11.850
<v Speaker 3>you become more conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this glorious process of </v>

925
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:13.600
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment and overall it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the details are exactly this.</v>

926
00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:17.020
<v Speaker 3>The things you need to become </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness conscious of are precisely</v>

927
00:45:17.021 --> 00:45:20.740
<v Speaker 3>those things that you least want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become conscious of and that this is the</v>

928
00:45:20.741 --> 00:45:25.741
<v Speaker 3>motif that you identified in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>alchemical tradition because the </v>

929
00:45:25.741 --> 00:45:26.800
<v Speaker 3>chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chemical model,</v>

930
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:31.950
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that which you most need to be </v>

931
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:31.950
<v Speaker 3>found.</v>

932
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:33.490
<v Speaker 3>That which you most need to find will be</v>
<v Speaker 3>found where you least want to look.</v>

933
00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

934
00:45:35.561 --> 00:45:38.380
<v Speaker 3>And everyone knows that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you tell someone that they go,</v>

935
00:45:38.381 --> 00:45:39.130
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

936
00:45:39.131 --> 00:45:39.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

937
00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:40.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that's true.</v>

938
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:46.200
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's also the greatest barrier to </v>

939
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:46.200
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment because if a night moon </v>
<v Speaker 3>was all,</v>

940
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tulips in sunshine,</v>

941
00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:50.110
<v Speaker 3>then everyone would be enlightened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>

942
00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:54.910
<v Speaker 3>it's this continual bringing before </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself all your proclivity for,</v>

943
00:45:55.180 --> 00:46:00.180
<v Speaker 3>for transgression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's that and that obviously </v>

944
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.180
<v Speaker 3>because how are you going to solve your </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems if you're not aware of them?</v>

945
00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:04.330
<v Speaker 3>He wouldn't want to be old discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did a jeweled Jordan.</v>

946
00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:05.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not surprising,</v>

947
00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.250
<v Speaker 3>but the alternative is far worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

948
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.400
<v Speaker 3>And that is the district.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I was very curious.</v>

949
00:46:12.401 --> 00:46:13.780
<v Speaker 3>I was very curious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

950
00:46:13.781 --> 00:46:15.490
<v Speaker 3>I talked about this with Tammy when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were coming here.</v>

951
00:46:15.491 --> 00:46:18.580
<v Speaker 3>I thought Russell decided to live when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was 27.</v>

952
00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:20.020
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to know why.</v>

953
00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.490
<v Speaker 3>So why did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did you make the decision to,</v>

954
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.000
<v Speaker 3>to not allow what was consuming you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill you?</v>

955
00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:33.450
<v Speaker 1>In a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was taken out of my hands for the </v>

956
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:36.091
<v Speaker 1>first time I encountered positive or </v>
<v Speaker 1>mail or 40 figures who curiously like,</v>

957
00:46:36.371 --> 00:46:39.430
<v Speaker 1>or at least that we're able to address </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in particular,</v>

958
00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I was sent to a treatment center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had free mumps.</v>

959
00:46:42.281 --> 00:46:44.830
<v Speaker 1>I had time to think I timed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

960
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I passed from childhood directly into </v>

961
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:50.720
<v Speaker 1>addictive behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

962
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.471
<v Speaker 1>those addicted babies were already </v>
<v Speaker 1>present in childhood in less toxic form </v>

963
00:46:55.471 --> 00:46:56.110
<v Speaker 1>in my relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In retrospect,</v>

964
00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:01.120
<v Speaker 1>fruit chocolate was addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My relationship with pornography as an </v>

965
00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.560
<v Speaker 1>adolescent addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was using it to,</v>

966
00:47:02.561 --> 00:47:06.160
<v Speaker 1>for medical medical purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

967
00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:10.000
<v Speaker 1>so when substances became an option in </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescence,</v>

968
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:13.700
<v Speaker 1>it was seamless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that meant that my emotional,</v>

969
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.840
<v Speaker 1>my emotional growth was arrested at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

970
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:19.310
<v Speaker 1>The reason I was able to stop it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>inadvertent,</v>

971
00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.040
<v Speaker 1>I was offered help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

972
00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.490
<v Speaker 1>I was given help our people that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>management company that was working with</v>

973
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.550
<v Speaker 1>say your serious drug addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should go away.</v>

974
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So partly that meant that they re,</v>

975
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.280
<v Speaker 3>they regarded</v>

976
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.130
<v Speaker 1>you as the sort of valuable commodity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was worth preserving.</v>

977
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a degree of that.</v>

978
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

979
00:47:35.651 --> 00:47:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

980
00:47:35.891 --> 00:47:38.380
<v Speaker 1>but that's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean regardless of.</v>

981
00:47:38.381 --> 00:47:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's purely an economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest,</v>

982
00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:42.400
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to that.</v>

983
00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and so then you went into treatment </v>

984
00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:47.610
<v Speaker 1>and you find some people say the place </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I went,</v>

985
00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:50.260
<v Speaker 1>it's run by an atheist chip summers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the 12 step principles,</v>

986
00:47:50.261 --> 00:47:52.540
<v Speaker 1>you can't unpick it from the Oxford </v>
<v Speaker 1>Group,</v>

987
00:47:52.541 --> 00:47:57.541
<v Speaker 1>first century Christian Group there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me is more appealing when you talk </v>

988
00:47:58.211 --> 00:48:01.390
<v Speaker 1>about it in terms of though I have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with the sublime and the divine.</v>

989
00:48:01.391 --> 00:48:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I live for that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

990
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.340
<v Speaker 1>like I was always trying to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my head off my face.</v>

991
00:48:06.341 --> 00:48:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Those were the things I want it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sublime experience experience of what is</v>

992
00:48:10.571 --> 00:48:12.760
<v Speaker 1>beyond the material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to know.</v>

993
00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:18.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once I was in that environment and </v>

994
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.750
<v Speaker 1>given drugs to help where I was addicted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to opiates,</v>

995
00:48:19.751 --> 00:48:24.340
<v Speaker 1>so I called subutex then and sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>pills because I couldn't sleep.</v>

996
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:29.610
<v Speaker 1>And during that time I suppose in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't fully address the issue of </v>

997
00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:33.871
<v Speaker 1>addiction because my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really promiscuous for about a </v>

998
00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.370
<v Speaker 1>decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I that,</v>

999
00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.740
<v Speaker 1>that behavior was transplant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of effortlessly,</v>

1000
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:43.741
<v Speaker 1>but I do remember a kind of moment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>epiphany if apifany his revelation of </v>

1001
00:48:43.741 --> 00:48:47.440
<v Speaker 1>previously concealed to truth when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>first occurred to me,</v>

1002
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:52.520
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you don't have to take drugs </v>

1003
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.661
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that thought entering and it </v>

1004
00:48:54.661 --> 00:48:54.661
<v Speaker 1>being sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1005
00:48:54.661 --> 00:48:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about that because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd found a solution.</v>

1006
00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.610
<v Speaker 1>It worked and worked as a way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>managing pain,</v>

1007
00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:04.960
<v Speaker 1>prevent infoview mental investigation or</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery of conclusions that would have</v>

1008
00:49:04.961 --> 00:49:07.600
<v Speaker 1>been unhelpful and that wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been able to deal with.</v>

1009
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.940
<v Speaker 1>I think in a lot of cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure there's many,</v>

1010
00:49:09.941 --> 00:49:11.270
<v Speaker 1>many variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1011
00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:11.940
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1012
00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:16.960
<v Speaker 1>that actually chemical dependency is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful technique for preventing </v>

1013
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.630
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is just,</v>

1014
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:23.800
<v Speaker 1>this is a holding pattern to stop me </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something more dramatic and band.</v>

1015
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Unless people have access to an ideology</v>
<v Speaker 1>of structure and support that will help </v>

1016
00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:29.410
<v Speaker 1>them through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1017
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:34.500
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was fortunate in that I was </v>

1018
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.410
<v Speaker 1>granted that and then grant it this </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1019
00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:37.540
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as I've been working it,</v>

1020
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I've come to the conclusion that it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly universal,</v>

1021
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:45.010
<v Speaker 1>not because I think it's derived from </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal ideas.</v>

1022
00:49:45.011 --> 00:49:50.011
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think young I've made that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the identified some,</v>

1023
00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.470
<v Speaker 1>like if there's a spiritual experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the support of community,</v>

1024
00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:56.980
<v Speaker 1>that's how someone could be stopped from</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking,</v>

1025
00:49:56.981 --> 00:50:00.610
<v Speaker 1>continually alcoholic drinking and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they took this process.</v>

1026
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.890
<v Speaker 1>They were 12 original 12 step </v>
<v Speaker 1>fellowships,</v>

1027
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:08.190
<v Speaker 1>took the Oxford Group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a program of a sort of redemption </v>

1028
00:50:08.561 --> 00:50:10.980
<v Speaker 1>and restitution and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like it,</v>

1029
00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.860
<v Speaker 1>it seems initially in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in a materialistic society,</v>

1030
00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:19.970
<v Speaker 1>counterintuitive to think that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to addiction is going to be </v>

1031
00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:21.220
<v Speaker 1>spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual awakening.</v>

1032
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:23.320
<v Speaker 1>But that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

1033
00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 1>the final steps are stay connected once </v>
<v Speaker 1>you like your continual inventorying for</v>

1034
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think,</v>

1035
00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:32.981
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt something there that you want to </v>

1036
00:50:32.981 --> 00:50:36.020
<v Speaker 1>be in the moment connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have to notice if I,</v>

1037
00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.360
<v Speaker 1>if someone makes me feel inferior or if </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

1038
00:50:38.361 --> 00:50:43.361
<v Speaker 1>if I'm sexually attracted to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the most obvious examples of </v>

1039
00:50:43.361 --> 00:50:44.030
<v Speaker 1>something that will take me out of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

1040
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:47.330
<v Speaker 1>And then the final step is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1041
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:52.760
<v Speaker 1>made a hell puffers and remain awake for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1042
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:58.870
<v Speaker 2>The Hero's journey is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you go into the darkness and find </v>

1043
00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:02.081
<v Speaker 2>something of value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next thing to do is to distribute </v>

1044
00:51:02.081 --> 00:51:02.900
<v Speaker 2>into distributed within the community to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it back and distributed within the</v>

1045
00:51:02.901 --> 00:51:03.410
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

1046
00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Now Jordan d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it like it would be difficult for me </v>

1047
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:13.301
<v Speaker 1>to accept that you've not been a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally affected and are not </v>

1048
00:51:13.301 --> 00:51:15.600
<v Speaker 1>personally angry rather than just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1049
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:20.990
<v Speaker 1>objectively because your personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectory I suppose in the public eye </v>

1050
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:25.301
<v Speaker 1>at least began with the situation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada with a sort of forced speech or </v>

1051
00:51:25.821 --> 00:51:28.940
<v Speaker 1>however it is termed now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like that.</v>

1052
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Are you able to distinguish between your</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of sense of personal irritation?</v>

1053
00:51:32.691 --> 00:51:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Because I think for most people telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>me what were,</v>

1054
00:51:35.361 --> 00:51:36.540
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you think that he's right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1055
00:51:36.541 --> 00:51:41.541
<v Speaker 1>Academia seems like I'm an and celery </v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

1056
00:51:41.931 --> 00:51:44.870
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem mainstream to most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>

1057
00:51:44.871 --> 00:51:46.850
<v Speaker 1>but to you it seems as though so very </v>
<v Speaker 1>vital,</v>

1058
00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:48.010
<v Speaker 1>but you are an academic.</v>

1059
00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1060
00:51:48.881 --> 00:51:50.410
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two things there.</v>

1061
00:51:50.411 --> 00:51:54.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people regard academia as ancillary,</v>

1062
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:59.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason it's not is because the </v>

1063
00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:04.740
<v Speaker 2>universities train the people who run </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and so whatever's mainstream in </v>

1064
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:09.451
<v Speaker 2>the universities right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's separate from society </v>

1065
00:52:09.451 --> 00:52:11.980
<v Speaker 2>is going to be mainstream everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>five years down the road.</v>

1066
00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:13.600
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big.</v>

1067
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Is the vanguard academically?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1068
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:16.370
<v Speaker 2>there no doubt.</v>

1069
00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you think what's happening now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of a media and politics?</v>

1070
00:52:19.581 --> 00:52:20.100
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1071
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:25.180
<v Speaker 1>could say you could preemptively if </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed that from what's happening </v>

1072
00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:25.180
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years years I</v>

1073
00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:25.180
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1074
00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:30.101
<v Speaker 2>I think that in some sense I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>preemptively diagnosing it because I've </v>

1075
00:52:30.101 --> 00:52:33.830
<v Speaker 2>been watching the politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern types for quite a long time.</v>

1076
00:52:33.831 --> 00:52:38.831
<v Speaker 2>And one of the C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I noticed about five </v>

1077
00:52:38.831 --> 00:52:38.831
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years ago,</v>

1078
00:52:38.831 --> 00:52:40.610
<v Speaker 2>there were two things that I noticed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I really didn't like.</v>

1079
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:44.450
<v Speaker 2>The first is that because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality psychologist,</v>

1080
00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.490
<v Speaker 2>as a researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as a clinician,</v>

1081
00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:51.491
<v Speaker 2>but as a researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the literature on gender </v>

1082
00:52:51.491 --> 00:52:54.851
<v Speaker 2>differences in personality because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of my field and I could tell that I</v>

1083
00:52:55.551 --> 00:53:00.551
<v Speaker 2>was starting to have some reluctance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver the lecture on gender </v>

1084
00:53:00.551 --> 00:53:02.840
<v Speaker 2>differences and now I didn't stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I felt,</v>

1085
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:07.930
<v Speaker 2>I felt that I was treading on thin ice </v>
<v Speaker 2>by delivering those lectures and I </v>

1086
00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:08.540
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1087
00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:11.450
<v Speaker 2>that's not good because I'm like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian.</v>

1088
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:14.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty much willing to say anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think is true and,</v>

1089
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:19.630
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of the consequences in some </v>

1090
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.630
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'd rather take the consequences</v>

1091
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.730
<v Speaker 2>of what's true.</v>

1092
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.480
<v Speaker 2>And I thought this isn't good because if</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like me who's,</v>

1093
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:27.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather uncontrollably mouthy let's say,</v>

1094
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:32.480
<v Speaker 2>is starting to have second thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 2>about teaching what's a very serious </v>

1095
00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:32.820
<v Speaker 2>topic and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and something about which there's a very</v>

1096
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:37.880
<v Speaker 2>well developed science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then how much are other people starting </v>

1097
00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 2>to censor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time,</v>

1098
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:40.560
<v Speaker 2>my students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of whom were female,</v>

1099
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:45.770
<v Speaker 2>were telling me that they were really </v>
<v Speaker 2>hesitant to talk about gender </v>

1100
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:47.340
<v Speaker 2>differences in any of the courses they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were running.</v>

1101
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:48.270
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1102
00:53:48.271 --> 00:53:50.490
<v Speaker 2>this is not good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is seriously not good.</v>

1103
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.530
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's certainly the case that,</v>

1104
00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:58.720
<v Speaker 2>that my colleagues censor themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly on campus with regards to </v>

1105
00:53:58.831 --> 00:54:01.170
<v Speaker 2>the topics they're willing to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's subtle,</v>

1106
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:06.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because imagine in a given lecture I </v>

1107
00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.730
<v Speaker 2>could discuss any of 10 things and three</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them are taboo.</v>

1108
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just won't discuss those.</v>

1109
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:15.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of invisible censorship.</v>

1110
00:54:15.391 --> 00:54:16.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I'll get up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1111
00:54:16.801 --> 00:54:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I could have talked to you about gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences in personality,</v>

1112
00:54:19.771 --> 00:54:24.771
<v Speaker 2>but I won't because I'm afraid I'll just</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick another topic because there's lots </v>

1113
00:54:24.771 --> 00:54:29.031
<v Speaker 2>of topics to choose from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that means there's going to be a </v>

1114
00:54:29.031 --> 00:54:32.121
<v Speaker 2>bunch of topics that are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important because actually the issue of </v>

1115
00:54:32.121 --> 00:54:35.451
<v Speaker 2>sex differences in personality happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be really important that people just </v>

1116
00:54:35.451 --> 00:54:39.471
<v Speaker 2>won't talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that's so annoying </v>

1117
00:54:39.471 --> 00:54:42.471
<v Speaker 2>about this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with regards to sex </v>

1118
00:54:42.471 --> 00:54:42.471
<v Speaker 2>differences in personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1119
00:54:42.471 --> 00:54:45.390
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say that you're firmly on the side</v>

1120
00:54:45.391 --> 00:54:47.220
<v Speaker 2>of women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for the sake of argument.</v>

1121
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you admit to or deny the existence of</v>

1122
00:54:51.511 --> 00:54:54.270
<v Speaker 2>sex differences in personality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's better for women?</v>

1123
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1124
00:54:55.771 --> 00:54:57.480
<v Speaker 2>the radical leftist basically say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1125
00:54:57.481 --> 00:54:59.610
<v Speaker 2>well those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you talk about sex differences,</v>

1126
00:54:59.611 --> 00:55:04.611
<v Speaker 2>then you're part of the oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy and you're attributing to </v>

1127
00:55:04.611 --> 00:55:08.331
<v Speaker 2>women a different kinds of temperament </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the attempt to continue the </v>

1128
00:55:08.331 --> 00:55:08.331
<v Speaker 2>suppression.</v>

1129
00:55:08.331 --> 00:55:10.050
<v Speaker 2>But I could just as easily say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1130
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:10.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>

1131
00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:13.860
<v Speaker 2>like if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to,</v>

1132
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:18.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give the individual the greatest degree </v>

1133
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:18.910
<v Speaker 2>of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

1134
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:19.580
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1135
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:24.620
<v Speaker 2>you're different from another person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're different on the basis of a </v>

1136
00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:28.101
<v Speaker 2>variety of your characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sex being one of them that's going to </v>

1137
00:55:28.101 --> 00:55:30.150
<v Speaker 2>have some effect on what sort of choices</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to make in your life.</v>

1138
00:55:30.151 --> 00:55:35.151
<v Speaker 2>It's like go ahead and make whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>choices you want as far as their direct </v>

1139
00:55:35.151 --> 00:55:39.650
<v Speaker 2>expression of your being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you deny the existence of </v>

1140
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:41.420
<v Speaker 2>these sex differences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which no one knows,</v>

1141
00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:44.670
<v Speaker 2>serious commentator in the psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>

1142
00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:47.340
<v Speaker 2>in the personality domain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are the people that know about</v>

1143
00:55:47.341 --> 00:55:52.341
<v Speaker 2>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody debates whether or not sex </v>

1144
00:55:52.341 --> 00:55:54.240
<v Speaker 2>differences in personality exist or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a biological component.</v>

1145
00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:59.670
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's also interesting about that </v>

1146
00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:00.450
<v Speaker 2>is that none of those people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives.</v>

1147
00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:05.900
<v Speaker 2>There are no conservative psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>researchers to speak up there in a tiny </v>

1148
00:56:06.211 --> 00:56:11.211
<v Speaker 2>minority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the people that have done the </v>

1149
00:56:11.211 --> 00:56:13.461
<v Speaker 2>research indicating that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences between the sexes and </v>

1150
00:56:13.461 --> 00:56:15.570
<v Speaker 2>personality and that those differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a biological,</v>

1151
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:19.860
<v Speaker 2>in part a biological component.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are liberal and left leaning.</v>

1152
00:56:19.861 --> 00:56:23.010
<v Speaker 2>People who've drawn those conclusions </v>
<v Speaker 2>despite their,</v>

1153
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:28.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite what their ideological </v>

1154
00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:28.020
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions might have suggested to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to begin with.</v>

1155
00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1156
00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:31.040
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1157
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to say about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>except that it's all appalling.</v>

1158
00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:40.040
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the fear must be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference will ultimately be used for</v>

1159
00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:45.200
<v Speaker 2>leverage for status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a reasonable fear,</v>

1160
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:50.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because because anything can be </v>

1161
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.870
<v Speaker 2>manipulated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1162
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:54.140
<v Speaker 2>but claims of identity can have identity</v>
<v Speaker 2>of claims that,</v>

1163
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:58.740
<v Speaker 2>that people are identical in some way </v>
<v Speaker 2>can also be used for the same reason.</v>

1164
00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:02.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I insist that everyone is exactly the</v>

1165
00:57:02.641 --> 00:57:07.641
<v Speaker 2>same on all dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just as much of a totalitarian </v>

1166
00:57:07.641 --> 00:57:08.640
<v Speaker 2>threat lurking in there as there is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat lurking,</v>

1167
00:57:08.641 --> 00:57:13.641
<v Speaker 2>that we'll use differences as an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're also not having a serious </v>

1168
00:57:13.641 --> 00:57:14.250
<v Speaker 2>discussion about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1169
00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:17.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are men are overrepresented at the</v>

1170
00:57:17.281 --> 00:57:19.710
<v Speaker 2>top of the economic apex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1171
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a small minority of men by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly not men in general,</v>

1172
00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:28.370
<v Speaker 2>but there are radically underrepresented</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the Bard overrepresented at the </v>

1173
00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:28.370
<v Speaker 2>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>

1174
00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:33.201
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nobody cares about men who are </v>

1175
00:57:33.201 --> 00:57:34.500
<v Speaker 2>failures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are like off the bloody radar.</v>

1176
00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.300
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1177
00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:37.680
<v Speaker 2>and there's no sympathy for men who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>failures.</v>

1178
00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:41.160
<v Speaker 2>So men stack up at the top and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom and,</v>

1179
00:57:41.161 --> 00:57:46.161
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we don't have a discussion about </v>

1180
00:57:46.161 --> 00:57:48.381
<v Speaker 2>that and we don't have a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that women are radically </v>

1181
00:57:48.381 --> 00:57:52.071
<v Speaker 2>underrepresented in dangerous jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although they are or in or in or in in </v>

1182
00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:57.060
<v Speaker 2>trades that require like brutal physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>labor,</v>

1183
00:57:57.150 --> 00:58:01.020
<v Speaker 2>women are radically underrepresented or </v>
<v Speaker 2>in or in jobs outside.</v>

1184
00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Women are radically underrepresented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the complaint is always,</v>

1185
00:58:04.891 --> 00:58:09.891
<v Speaker 2>well if you look at the top one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there are more men than there </v>

1186
00:58:09.891 --> 00:58:10.530
<v Speaker 2>should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1187
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:12.360
<v Speaker 2>by pure sex division.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1188
00:58:12.361 --> 00:58:13.740
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the bottom,</v>

1189
00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:19.100
<v Speaker 2>the reverse is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we're gonna have the discussion </v>

1190
00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:23.690
<v Speaker 2>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't really necessarily think we </v>

1191
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:25.701
<v Speaker 2>should have that discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we're going to have the </v>

1192
00:58:25.701 --> 00:58:25.980
<v Speaker 2>discussion then we should look across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire economic spectrum.</v>

1193
00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of this debate is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being governed by unconscious forces.</v>

1194
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing is a manifestation of a va </v>

1195
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:43.200
<v Speaker 1>on a well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're cartography has not yet been a lot</v>

1196
00:58:44.161 --> 00:58:45.840
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you thinking about?</v>

1197
00:58:45.841 --> 00:58:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Any particular part of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I feel like is that the reason that</v>

1198
00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:56.550
<v Speaker 1>I say imagine that you are arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are based on research are so </v>

1199
00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:59.751
<v Speaker 1>successful is because people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing feelings as opposed to cogent</v>

1200
00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:06.560
<v Speaker 1>and researched arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like there is a powerful,</v>

1201
00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:12.260
<v Speaker 1>dominant patriarchy and no one can deny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that there is power there such a </v>

1202
00:59:12.451 --> 00:59:17.451
<v Speaker 1>thing as power and there are people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit from structures being as they </v>

1203
00:59:17.451 --> 00:59:19.900
<v Speaker 1>are horse of class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point of those structures being the,</v>

1204
00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:25.010
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've observed is that </v>

1205
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:28.240
<v Speaker 1>whenever change is discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my tendency has always been to be </v>

1206
00:59:29.391 --> 00:59:34.391
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic towards movements that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>about change or empowerment of what </v>

1207
00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:37.670
<v Speaker 1>might be termed disadvantaged groups.</v>

1208
00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the change is that when you are curious </v>

1209
00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:46.751
<v Speaker 1>about the resistance of change or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulties that you face when trying </v>

1210
00:59:46.751 --> 00:59:50.021
<v Speaker 1>to bring about change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at who would be negatively </v>

1211
00:59:50.021 --> 00:59:50.021
<v Speaker 1>impacted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where that changed to be bought about.</v>

1212
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Usually that means that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people for conservatism make sense to a </v>

1213
00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:59.780
<v Speaker 1>particular group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that I felt when I'm reading a</v>

1214
00:59:59.781 --> 01:00:01.140
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas the,</v>

1215
01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

1216
01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:07.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think you're coming from a </v>

1217
01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:07.660
<v Speaker 1>perspective of psychoanalysis and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>rings very.</v>

1218
01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>The language rings true and the analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>rings true.</v>

1219
01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:13.310
<v Speaker 1>That what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I feel.</v>

1220
01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.760
<v Speaker 1>One question I was keen to bring to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>is when you talked about skateboarders </v>

1221
01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I think it's the last but one chapter</v>

1222
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.850
<v Speaker 1>and that spirit of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1223
01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:24.590
<v Speaker 1>a young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1224
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:29.650
<v Speaker 1>courage and a willingness to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous things and push forward and I </v>

1225
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>wonder how that sits with the idea of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an earlier passage in the book where you</v>

1226
01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1227
01:00:35.761 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>the gratitude that we should feel for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1228
01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>having time to read a book and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to read a book and sort of </v>

1229
01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>respect for the establishment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that have been set up from which</v>

1230
01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>we all benefit.</v>

1231
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Because when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1232
01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:52.811
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't find it difficult to dispute </v>

1233
01:00:52.811 --> 01:00:56.410
<v Speaker 1>your opinion about sort of churlish what</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been in the lexicon of the </v>

1234
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:59.870
<v Speaker 1>day social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warriors and that kind of</v>

1235
01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>somewhat rootless unresearched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1236
01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1237
01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1238
01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:10.691
<v Speaker 1>I identify what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people that can't keep their </v>

1239
01:01:10.691 --> 01:01:13.571
<v Speaker 1>bedrooms tidy will be careful before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them organize an economic system.</v>

1240
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:14.870
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1241
01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>but similarly like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1242
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>where is change going to come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are,</v>

1243
01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:20.900
<v Speaker 1>who is going to challenge them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge</v>

1244
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:25.910
<v Speaker 2>tyranny is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the sorts of twin forces that </v>

1245
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:27.530
<v Speaker 2>we have to contend with across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political spectrum,</v>

1246
01:01:27.531 --> 01:01:31.850
<v Speaker 2>so I could run through something quickly</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put the things that you just that you</v>

1247
01:01:31.851 --> 01:01:33.380
<v Speaker 2>just brought up in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1248
01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:34.850
<v Speaker 2>in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say.</v>

1249
01:01:34.851 --> 01:01:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the first thing is,</v>

1250
01:01:36.201 --> 01:01:41.201
<v Speaker 2>is that hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to value some things </v>

1251
01:01:41.201 --> 01:01:46.181
<v Speaker 2>more than others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then hierarchies are inevitable and you </v>

1252
01:01:46.181 --> 01:01:47.910
<v Speaker 2>have to value some things more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>others or you don't have anything.</v>

1253
01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.060
<v Speaker 2>You all strength for something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1254
01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:52.460
<v Speaker 2>what competence or shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1255
01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:55.010
<v Speaker 2>whatever it happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ability to play the flute,</v>

1256
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:57.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter why on my list.</v>

1257
01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1258
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.920
<v Speaker 2>What you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously if you value music,</v>

1259
01:02:00.921 --> 01:02:05.921
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to value some </v>
<v Speaker 2>musicians more than others because some </v>

1260
01:02:05.921 --> 01:02:08.591
<v Speaker 2>are better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's and so you have to value things </v>

1261
01:02:08.591 --> 01:02:11.621
<v Speaker 2>in order to move forward in life and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to value things in order to have </v>

1262
01:02:11.621 --> 01:02:11.621
<v Speaker 2>something valuable to produce.</v>

1263
01:02:11.621 --> 01:02:13.790
<v Speaker 2>But if you play out the value and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social landscape,</v>

1264
01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:18.791
<v Speaker 2>you're going to produce a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with producing a </v>

1265
01:02:18.791 --> 01:02:21.551
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy is that a small number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to be successful than </v>

1266
01:02:21.551 --> 01:02:25.191
<v Speaker 2>the majority and a very large number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people aren't going to be successful at </v>

1267
01:02:25.191 --> 01:02:26.130
<v Speaker 2>all at at that particular thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's inevitable.</v>

1268
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.540
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1269
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.890
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would say,</v>

1270
01:02:28.891 --> 01:02:32.160
<v Speaker 2>well we have to put up with that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to pursue things of value.</v>

1271
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

1272
01:02:33.421 --> 01:02:37.260
<v Speaker 2>So that's the right wing perspective is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the hierarchy's are justifiable,</v>

1273
01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:39.660
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the left wing perspective is,</v>

1274
01:02:39.661 --> 01:02:40.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wait a minute.</v>

1275
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:45.950
<v Speaker 2>The problem with hierarchies is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people stock up at the bottom and that </v>

1276
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:47.790
<v Speaker 2>they tilt towards tyranny across time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also true.</v>

1277
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:53.090
<v Speaker 2>And so you need that dialectic in </v>
<v Speaker 2>society between the right wing that </v>

1278
01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:53.090
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1279
01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:58.130
<v Speaker 2>we need the hierarchies and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful and you should be grateful for </v>

1280
01:02:58.130 --> 01:02:59.700
<v Speaker 2>them and they structure you and give you</v>
<v Speaker 2>form and provide value.</v>

1281
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:01.020
<v Speaker 2>And the left that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1282
01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:05.160
<v Speaker 2>but they exclude people and people stock</v>
<v Speaker 2>up at the bottom and that's dangerous to</v>

1283
01:03:05.161 --> 01:03:07.110
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

1284
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.360
<v Speaker 2>it means that people might not have </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>

1285
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.420
<v Speaker 2>And you have to say yes to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem comes,</v>

1286
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:16.860
<v Speaker 2>and this is the situation we're in right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now where the radical leftists,</v>

1287
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:20.730
<v Speaker 2>and this is mostly a problem that really</v>
<v Speaker 2>permeates the universities.</v>

1288
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:22.650
<v Speaker 2>The radical left is say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1289
01:03:22.651 --> 01:03:25.080
<v Speaker 2>but all hierarchies are just tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

1290
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:25.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

1291
01:03:25.891 --> 01:03:28.950
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hierarchies are based on competence in a</v>

1292
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.280
<v Speaker 2>functioning society and mostly our </v>
<v Speaker 2>society functions,</v>

1293
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:35.580
<v Speaker 2>so you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't go that far.</v>

1294
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't mean that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy's don't tilt towards self </v>

1295
01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:43.290
<v Speaker 2>interest and tyranny across time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a bad thing.</v>

1296
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:47.790
<v Speaker 2>It's even a bad thing from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative perspective so well,</v>

1297
01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:52.970
<v Speaker 2>so there's room for the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's room for the left because the </v>

1298
01:03:53.401 --> 01:03:58.401
<v Speaker 2>poor will always be with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason that there's room for </v>

1299
01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:01.941
<v Speaker 2>the left and that the dispossessed need </v>
<v Speaker 2>a voice not least because there are </v>

1300
01:04:01.941 --> 01:04:04.170
<v Speaker 2>talented people among the dispossessed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if they're stuck at zero,</v>

1301
01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.050
<v Speaker 2>everyone suffers because we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>access to their talents.</v>

1302
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.960
<v Speaker 2>It's bad use of resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the right it's like,</v>

1303
01:04:09.961 --> 01:04:14.961
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need the damn value hierarchies and </v>

1304
01:04:14.961 --> 01:04:17.111
<v Speaker 2>we need to be grateful for our </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions and our structures because </v>

1305
01:04:17.111 --> 01:04:20.030
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stop us from degenerating into </v>

1306
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.030
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

1307
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so across the society,</v>

1308
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>numerous hierarchies emerge and at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point decisions are being made about </v>

1309
01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:28.271
<v Speaker 1>which thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy being a brilliant flutist or </v>

1310
01:04:28.271 --> 01:04:31.901
<v Speaker 1>brilliant at tennis or brilliant owning </v>
<v Speaker 1>land or controlling energy resources or </v>

1311
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>dominate in financial systems which are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchies that are most important </v>

1312
01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:43.090
<v Speaker 1>and also the what because it's the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that resources are designated and </v>

1313
01:04:46.221 --> 01:04:49.550
<v Speaker 1>challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those hierarchies seems to become,</v>

1314
01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:52.490
<v Speaker 1>well almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1315
01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.790
<v Speaker 1>when I was leaving the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that brilliant hospital,</v>

1316
01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:58.400
<v Speaker 1>they've been taken care of my mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

1317
01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:04.010
<v Speaker 1>the window at the level of crisis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma and tragedy there.</v>

1318
01:05:04.011 --> 01:05:09.011
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got the sort of best doctors </v>

1319
01:05:09.011 --> 01:05:10.220
<v Speaker 1>that guy might in griffith that operated</v>
<v Speaker 1>on her bow.</v>

1320
01:05:10.221 --> 01:05:14.570
<v Speaker 1>He's like a fantastic surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is in fact him that trump was quoting</v>

1321
01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:19.600
<v Speaker 1>when he talks about European hospitals </v>
<v Speaker 1>with blood spatter flows from knife </v>

1322
01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.221
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a sort of a mangling of a quote </v>

1323
01:05:23.221 --> 01:05:23.221
<v Speaker 1>that this might in griffith a given and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then sort of like,</v>

1324
01:05:23.221 --> 01:05:27.941
<v Speaker 1>I step outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm driving along along white </v>

1325
01:05:27.941 --> 01:05:30.661
<v Speaker 1>chapel road and there are um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic advertising boards and the,</v>

1326
01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:31.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1327
01:05:31.581 --> 01:05:34.320
<v Speaker 1>that require energy to tell me to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1328
01:05:34.321 --> 01:05:37.390
<v Speaker 1>sort of Mcdonald's or kit kats or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1329
01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>and there's so much poverty on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

1330
01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:44.110
<v Speaker 1>There always has been in that part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eastland and terrible poverty and I feel</v>

1331
01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:49.680
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are moments when I helicopter out </v>

1332
01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.890
<v Speaker 1>to the macro perspective that no </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual can long hold or wait,</v>

1333
01:05:50.891 --> 01:05:53.740
<v Speaker 1>that can't be long born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in that moment I think,</v>

1334
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:58.950
<v Speaker 1>why is this hospital struggling for </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources when we can afford to run </v>

1335
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:06.240
<v Speaker 1>electronic adverts for Mcdonald's?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gets to decide how collectively and </v>

1336
01:06:07.961 --> 01:06:12.961
<v Speaker 1>individually do we determine where </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources and where power both in terms </v>

1337
01:06:12.961 --> 01:06:14.850
<v Speaker 1>of energy but also in terms of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>power and up.</v>

1338
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:18.310
<v Speaker 1>How were these decisions made?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you say,</v>

1339
01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:20.950
<v Speaker 1>among the dispossessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>

1340
01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:22.660
<v Speaker 1>there are great resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great talent.</v>

1341
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:26.440
<v Speaker 1>One would imagine if the research were </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to the exact same degree.</v>

1342
01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Is there is power and talent and among </v>
<v Speaker 1>the possessed,</v>

1343
01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:34.350
<v Speaker 1>because it's normally an accident of </v>
<v Speaker 1>birth that decrease in reading about </v>

1344
01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:38.071
<v Speaker 1>your early life in Canada in a blue </v>
<v Speaker 1>collar community and this sort of the </v>

1345
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:41.920
<v Speaker 1>mental health issues and the anger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>agitation that grows there.</v>

1346
01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:47.040
<v Speaker 1>So much of that is about resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dispossession of the native people </v>

1347
01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.820
<v Speaker 1>of that area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mental health issues.</v>

1348
01:06:48.821 --> 01:06:51.490
<v Speaker 1>If your friend Chris like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

1349
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:57.150
<v Speaker 1>we are rising through these hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We that have experiences of both side of</v>

1350
01:06:58.391 --> 01:06:59.170
<v Speaker 1>that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1351
01:06:59.171 --> 01:07:02.050
<v Speaker 1>we are now challenging this evolutionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

1352
01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:05.140
<v Speaker 1>We are now in a position to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these hierarchies,</v>

1353
01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:10.290
<v Speaker 1>how they're ordered and how they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized and whether there is room for </v>

1354
01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:10.600
<v Speaker 1>negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1355
01:07:10.601 --> 01:07:15.460
<v Speaker 1>it's up to us to do that because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a risk in conservatism is saying,</v>

1356
01:07:15.461 --> 01:07:17.110
<v Speaker 1>well this is how the cards have fallen.</v>

1357
01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.800
<v Speaker 3>Of course there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the risk and conservatism,</v>

1358
01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:22.580
<v Speaker 3>so how do we use confront that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While the risk is the,</v>

1359
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:23.360
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1360
01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:28.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hierarchies ossified and turn to </v>

1361
01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:29.250
<v Speaker 3>stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's no mobility and and the</v>

1362
01:07:29.251 --> 01:07:34.251
<v Speaker 3>idea that that things can turn to stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they become tyrannical is an </v>

1363
01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:34.500
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

1364
01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:36.810
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the story of Exodus,</v>

1365
01:07:36.811 --> 01:07:39.060
<v Speaker 3>the story of Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the Egyptian,</v>

1366
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:44.390
<v Speaker 3>the Egyptians are portrayed in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>story as tyrannical conservatives </v>

1367
01:07:44.491 --> 01:07:45.690
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1368
01:07:45.691 --> 01:07:50.691
<v Speaker 3>And they're masters of stone and Moses </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a master of water and water is the </v>

1369
01:07:50.691 --> 01:07:54.891
<v Speaker 3>thing that dissolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that drama's being played out in </v>

1370
01:07:54.891 --> 01:07:56.010
<v Speaker 3>these stories that are thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>years old and in the Egyptian story,</v>

1371
01:07:56.011 --> 01:08:01.011
<v Speaker 3>the ancient Egyptian story of Osiris and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horus ocirus is the old king who becomes</v>

1372
01:08:01.741 --> 01:08:04.290
<v Speaker 3>too rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what happens to him is that he's,</v>

1373
01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:06.060
<v Speaker 3>he's dismembered by evil.</v>

1374
01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:11.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so even the Egyptians long ago knew </v>

1375
01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:14.061
<v Speaker 3>that the danger of hierarchies as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>become static and corrupt and tyrannical</v>

1376
01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:18.050
<v Speaker 3>and part of what we do in our ongoing </v>
<v Speaker 3>political dialogue and,</v>

1377
01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when it's genuine dialogue is to </v>

1378
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

1379
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:23.450
<v Speaker 3>are these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do these systems have it?</v>

1380
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:25.640
<v Speaker 3>We need them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're there not avoidable,</v>

1381
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:27.950
<v Speaker 3>but do they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they functioning properly?</v>

1382
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:30.680
<v Speaker 3>Are they loose enough so that people can</v>
<v Speaker 3>move?</v>

1383
01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:35.681
<v Speaker 3>Are they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they serving the broader good or </v>

1384
01:08:35.681 --> 01:08:38.520
<v Speaker 3>have they degenerated into something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's too tyrannical now you know you.</v>

1385
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:43.600
<v Speaker 3>You kind of pointed to both of those in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you formulated that question </v>

1386
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:43.600
<v Speaker 3>because you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1387
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.441
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mum was in the hospital and she </v>

1388
01:08:47.441 --> 01:08:50.051
<v Speaker 3>needed care and so and I found a surgeon</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was an excellent surgeon and so.</v>

1389
01:08:50.201 --> 01:08:55.201
<v Speaker 3>So what you did there basically was take</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bow to the you bowed before the </v>

1390
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:58.700
<v Speaker 3>functional hierarchy of the hospital and</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1391
01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:03.701
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest surgeon actually rose to </v>

1392
01:09:03.701 --> 01:09:03.701
<v Speaker 3>the top and thank God for that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise my mother would be dead.</v>

1393
01:09:03.701 --> 01:09:04.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1394
01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:08.690
<v Speaker 3>that's our competency hierarchy and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be contaminated by tyranny.</v>

1395
01:09:08.691 --> 01:09:13.691
<v Speaker 3>In which case it would be the brother of</v>
<v Speaker 3>some powerful person who ended up with </v>

1396
01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:14.090
<v Speaker 3>the surgical position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1397
01:09:14.091 --> 01:09:16.490
<v Speaker 3>And then everyone dies and that does </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen in many,</v>

1398
01:09:16.491 --> 01:09:21.491
<v Speaker 3>many cultures where nepotism or </v>
<v Speaker 3>connections define your position on </v>

1399
01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:22.580
<v Speaker 3>every axis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you said,</v>

1400
01:09:22.581 --> 01:09:24.680
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I went out of the hospital and I was</v>

1401
01:09:24.681 --> 01:09:29.681
<v Speaker 3>driving down the road and I saw what </v>
<v Speaker 3>appeared to be a misallocation of </v>

1402
01:09:29.681 --> 01:09:33.371
<v Speaker 3>resources and what we have to do about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is have have a discussion about it </v>

1403
01:09:33.371 --> 01:09:33.371
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1404
01:09:33.371 --> 01:09:36.470
<v Speaker 3>are we allocating resources to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate place?</v>

1405
01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:41.980
<v Speaker 3>Now the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other lurking problem there is to </v>

1406
01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:46.931
<v Speaker 3>what degree do we decide about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>allocation of resources by voluntary </v>

1407
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:48.760
<v Speaker 3>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

1408
01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:53.820
<v Speaker 3>by planning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to what degree do we let the market </v>

1409
01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:56.591
<v Speaker 3>take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's also something that </v>

1410
01:09:56.591 --> 01:09:56.591
<v Speaker 3>continually requires negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That</v>

1411
01:09:56.591 --> 01:09:57.360
<v Speaker 1>market mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't trust that.</v>

1412
01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>

1413
01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:01.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the question is people talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it like it's a neutral thing,</v>

1414
01:10:01.951 --> 01:10:05.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a conglomeration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest of the powerful.</v>

1415
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1416
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:07.830
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bunch of things.</v>

1417
01:10:07.831 --> 01:10:12.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's that it can be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be the way that we </v>

1418
01:10:12.831 --> 01:10:12.990
<v Speaker 1>collectively value things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1419
01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.060
<v Speaker 1>let me give you an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our collective values,</v>

1420
01:10:15.061 --> 01:10:16.930
<v Speaker 1>and I'll just quickly say I heard this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1421
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:21.950
<v Speaker 1>and in Sweden they a contract regulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and control access to alcohol at a state</v>

1422
01:10:22.711 --> 01:10:24.840
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like off licenses or liquor stores.</v>

1423
01:10:24.841 --> 01:10:28.350
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of socially run and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not allowed to be advertised</v>

1424
01:10:28.351 --> 01:10:29.490
<v Speaker 1>in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>

1425
01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:32.390
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's one of those havens of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might go.</v>

1426
01:10:32.391 --> 01:10:37.391
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what your views are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden by see a lot of stories about </v>

1427
01:10:37.391 --> 01:10:37.391
<v Speaker 1>Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem a bit like a,</v>

1428
01:10:37.391 --> 01:10:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we swayed and comes across as this.</v>

1429
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:44.270
<v Speaker 1>I guess I sort of this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodern democracy almost in some </v>

1430
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.270
<v Speaker 1>respects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyhow.</v>

1431
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

1432
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was curious that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>control alcohol in that manner and I am </v>

1433
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:51.600
<v Speaker 1>envisaged the sort of breweries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquor distributors would say,</v>

1434
01:10:51.601 --> 01:10:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not free market.</v>

1435
01:10:53.011 --> 01:10:58.011
<v Speaker 1>You're controlling access to people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>access to alcohol as if somehow the free</v>

1436
01:10:59.401 --> 01:11:02.610
<v Speaker 1>market was neutral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is no neutral.</v>

1437
01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.760
<v Speaker 1>If the market is what has the power of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's desires will be overly </v>

1438
01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.480
<v Speaker 1>stimulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People in people like if people are have</v>

1439
01:11:09.481 --> 01:11:11.640
<v Speaker 1>McDonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertise that they're more alcohol,</v>

1440
01:11:11.641 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 1>advertise that them people bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>McDonald's</v>

1441
01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:19.380
<v Speaker 3>and alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has to be some more realizing </v>

1442
01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.990
<v Speaker 3>force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has to be something that's not </v>

1443
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:24.081
<v Speaker 3>economically lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the manifestation of greed </v>

1444
01:11:24.081 --> 01:11:27.710
<v Speaker 3>that's in the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone in a secular society where there</v>

1445
01:11:27.721 --> 01:11:32.721
<v Speaker 3>is no reasonable or trusted voice of God</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be able to say don't drink too </v>

1446
01:11:33.691 --> 01:11:36.570
<v Speaker 3>much alcohol or Mcdonald's because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people will.</v>

1447
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:37.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1448
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:38.700
<v Speaker 3>So see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1449
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:44.120
<v Speaker 3>I think the most effective solution to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that problem is to have the economic </v>

1450
01:11:45.361 --> 01:11:49.740
<v Speaker 3>system run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say by distributed individuals who</v>

1451
01:11:49.741 --> 01:11:53.570
<v Speaker 3>are themselves aiming at a higher good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think the way that you,</v>

1452
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.400
<v Speaker 3>the most effective way of regulating the</v>
<v Speaker 3>market so to speak,</v>

1453
01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:01.700
<v Speaker 3>is to improve the moral character of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who make up the market rather </v>

1454
01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:05.361
<v Speaker 3>than directly regulating the market and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not that the market doesn't necessarily </v>

1455
01:12:05.371 --> 01:12:07.710
<v Speaker 3>need some regulation because you might </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1456
01:12:07.711 --> 01:12:11.850
<v Speaker 3>well how about we don't devote alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 3>advertising to children under 10?</v>

1457
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Most people would agree that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable perspective.</v>

1458
01:12:15.181 --> 01:12:18.570
<v Speaker 3>And so that is limitation on market </v>
<v Speaker 3>forces and there are places that you can</v>

1459
01:12:18.571 --> 01:12:19.840
<v Speaker 3>find that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1460
01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:22.950
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that limitation being accepted by almost</v>

1461
01:12:22.951 --> 01:12:24.000
<v Speaker 3>anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1462
01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:29.240
<v Speaker 3>but part of what you're pointing to is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if the only thing that's governing </v>

1463
01:12:29.851 --> 01:12:32.880
<v Speaker 3>the market is concerned for pure market </v>
<v Speaker 3>success,</v>

1464
01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.310
<v Speaker 3>than the market can produce all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>excesses.</v>

1465
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:37.680
<v Speaker 3>But I think what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want,</v>

1466
01:12:37.681 --> 01:12:42.180
<v Speaker 3>what you want is to help orient people </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards a transcendent good.</v>

1467
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:44.590
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1468
01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:48.060
<v Speaker 3>that's over and above market interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>

1469
01:12:48.061 --> 01:12:53.061
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what interests should you serve as </v>

1470
01:12:53.061 --> 01:12:54.921
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to be successful as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian in while you're trying to make </v>

1471
01:12:54.921 --> 01:12:56.550
<v Speaker 3>a living as a comedian say you might </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to make sure that you're conducting</v>

1472
01:12:56.551 --> 01:12:58.500
<v Speaker 3>yourself appropriately in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>marketplace.</v>

1473
01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.560
<v Speaker 3>You're concerned about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also your future selves because you </v>

1474
01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:03.560
<v Speaker 3>have to take.</v>

1475
01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:04.920
<v Speaker 3>And that's partly why addiction is such </v>
<v Speaker 3>a catastrophe,</v>

1476
01:13:04.921 --> 01:13:06.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's great in the short term,</v>

1477
01:13:06.451 --> 01:13:08.640
<v Speaker 3>but it's not so good in the medium to </v>
<v Speaker 3>long run.</v>

1478
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:11.070
<v Speaker 3>So you have to take care of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1479
01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:13.680
<v Speaker 3>and your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your iterations through the future.</v>

1480
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:18.980
<v Speaker 3>You have to take care of yourself in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that you're taking care of your </v>

1481
01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.381
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to take care of yourself and </v>

1482
01:13:21.381 --> 01:13:21.750
<v Speaker 3>your family in a way that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefiting the community and that should</v>

1483
01:13:21.751 --> 01:13:26.751
<v Speaker 3>be foremost in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then when you start to make economic </v>

1484
01:13:26.751 --> 01:13:26.751
<v Speaker 3>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in your business,</v>

1485
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.750
<v Speaker 3>you're not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1486
01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do whatever I can to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>as much money as I can.</v>

1487
01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:35.540
<v Speaker 3>You're going to say I'm going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever I can to make as much money as </v>

1488
01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.850
<v Speaker 3>I can while also making sure that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking care of myself and my future self</v>

1489
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.880
<v Speaker 3>and my family and my community and being</v>
<v Speaker 3>like greg grateful for all of that and </v>

1490
01:13:44.101 --> 01:13:49.101
<v Speaker 3>serving it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I think the market can work </v>

1491
01:13:49.101 --> 01:13:49.800
<v Speaker 3>more effectively but still might require</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

1492
01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:52.200
<v Speaker 3>some discussion around the edges because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1493
01:13:52.201 --> 01:13:54.150
<v Speaker 3>nothing is simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

1494
01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:58.290
<v Speaker 3>the reason that I'm concentrating on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual and individual development is</v>

1495
01:13:58.291 --> 01:14:00.960
<v Speaker 3>because I think that's the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that regulation.</v>

1496
01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.930
<v Speaker 3>I think that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's non negotiable.</v>

1497
01:14:03.931 --> 01:14:08.931
<v Speaker 3>I think it's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also believe that if you have a </v>

1498
01:14:08.931 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 3>society that's predicated on the some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst aspects of human</v>

1499
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:14.800
<v Speaker 1>behavior and it lost the desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>

1500
01:14:14.801 --> 01:14:18.070
<v Speaker 1>if last fear and desire are so high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mix,</v>

1501
01:14:18.071 --> 01:14:22.960
<v Speaker 1>if you're continually being prompted </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards own in Islam and consuming,</v>

1502
01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the individual improvement </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be insufficient.</v>

1503
01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I I feel that your success is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know it was based on,</v>

1504
01:14:32.561 --> 01:14:34.930
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like to a degree you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>contacted people and oh yeah,</v>

1505
01:14:34.931 --> 01:14:39.931
<v Speaker 1>I can improve my own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can have a bit of personal authority </v>

1506
01:14:39.931 --> 01:14:39.931
<v Speaker 1>and autonomy and I think that's hugely </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>

1507
01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:42.360
<v Speaker 1>but if every time you step out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>house every.</v>

1508
01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.400
<v Speaker 1>If every time you interface with society</v>
<v Speaker 1>or pick up your phone or look at a </v>

1509
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.641
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aspect of yourself that's being </v>

1510
01:14:50.641 --> 01:14:52.921
<v Speaker 1>nurtured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's being invited to participate on </v>

1511
01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:56.080
<v Speaker 1>the lower aspects of your nature because</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the most successful routes to </v>

1512
01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.731
<v Speaker 1>a person's decision making impulses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's difficult to exceed.</v>

1513
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's difficult for these </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual projects to to succeed.</v>

1514
01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I think that your know certain people </v>
<v Speaker 1>will have that,</v>

1515
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:09.130
<v Speaker 1>that message will take hold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but others it won't,</v>

1516
01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:14.140
<v Speaker 1>so on to some degree we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I am a big fan of </v>

1517
01:15:14.951 --> 01:15:19.951
<v Speaker 1>regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand your irritation about </v>

1518
01:15:19.951 --> 01:15:23.611
<v Speaker 1>what's being like this sort of a post </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern deconstruction analyst argument </v>

1519
01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:27.250
<v Speaker 1>of that destroy God that has destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 1>all categories.</v>

1520
01:15:27.251 --> 01:15:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

1521
01:15:27.911 --> 01:15:30.340
<v Speaker 1>none of it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in essence,</v>

1522
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:32.020
<v Speaker 1>the humors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deities,</v>

1523
01:15:32.021 --> 01:15:34.570
<v Speaker 1>the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel these things are present,</v>

1524
01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:37.190
<v Speaker 1>but I feel that we're already being </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

1525
01:15:37.191 --> 01:15:42.191
<v Speaker 1>We're kind of invisible tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's already happening and I don't </v>

1526
01:15:42.191 --> 01:15:44.910
<v Speaker 1>think it's happening as a result of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical theory postmarks.</v>

1527
01:15:44.911 --> 01:15:49.911
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that that's not where power </v>

1528
01:15:49.911 --> 01:15:49.911
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it feels like it's sort of.</v>

1529
01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:52.790
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel like it's just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

1530
01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Was Glaxo Klein or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1531
01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:59.200
<v Speaker 1>it's not as powerful as a Halliburton or</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1532
01:15:59.201 --> 01:15:59.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>

1533
01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:04.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm interested is power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real power and how power is functioning </v>

1534
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:09.820
<v Speaker 1>and how power is negatively impacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary people.</v>

1535
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's perfectly reasonable to </v>

1536
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:17.611
<v Speaker 1>point out that there might be multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that people experience tyrannical </v>

1537
01:16:17.611 --> 01:16:22.420
<v Speaker 1>oppression now because every hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to tilt towards tyrannical form</v>

1538
01:16:22.421 --> 01:16:27.421
<v Speaker 1>in its own particular way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I've been concerned about what's </v>

1539
01:16:27.421 --> 01:16:29.020
<v Speaker 1>happening in the university on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical left and your concern,</v>

1540
01:16:29.021 --> 01:16:34.021
<v Speaker 1>the concern that you just brought up is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like a overwhelming large </v>

1541
01:16:34.301 --> 01:16:39.301
<v Speaker 1>scale corporate dominance and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also a reasonable set of </v>

1542
01:16:39.301 --> 01:16:39.420
<v Speaker 1>concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1543
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.620
<v Speaker 1>it might not be for the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1544
01:16:41.621 --> 01:16:44.800
<v Speaker 1>that all of our communication is </v>
<v Speaker 1>filtered through google.</v>

1545
01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:49.060
<v Speaker 1>That might be a bit too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

1546
01:16:50.150 --> 01:16:52.300
<v Speaker 1>the question always is what we can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

1547
01:16:52.301 --> 01:16:54.490
<v Speaker 1>and I think the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is an answer to that.</v>

1548
01:16:54.491 --> 01:16:59.491
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is we can lead people's </v>

1549
01:16:59.491 --> 01:17:03.841
<v Speaker 1>ability to communicate untrammeled and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's why I'm an advocate of free </v>

1550
01:17:03.841 --> 01:17:07.651
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can leave people's ability to </v>

1551
01:17:07.651 --> 01:17:08.830
<v Speaker 1>communicate untrammeled so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have intelligent discussions about those</v>

1552
01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 1>as they emerge</v>

1553
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.040
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully work towards solutions </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we can't just generate a </v>

1554
01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:15.110
<v Speaker 3>structure rules that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1555
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:20.530
<v Speaker 3>here's the 10 rules that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal without complex situation because </v>

1556
01:17:20.530 --> 01:17:23.450
<v Speaker 3>things change too rapidly for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that freedom of speech as</v>

1557
01:17:23.451 --> 01:17:25.700
<v Speaker 3>far as I'm concerned is the paramount </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom,</v>

1558
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:26.690
<v Speaker 3>the paramount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1559
01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:31.280
<v Speaker 3>Also the paramount moral obligation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's through the,</v>

1560
01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:33.550
<v Speaker 3>it's through our ability to exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1561
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.780
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1562
01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:39.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to exchange honest opinions that we </v>

1563
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:44.140
<v Speaker 3>participate in the process that enables </v>
<v Speaker 3>us to keep tyranny of the sort that you </v>

1564
01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:45.260
<v Speaker 3>described and the sort that I described </v>
<v Speaker 3>at bay.</v>

1565
01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:50.980
<v Speaker 3>And so part of the reason that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken the tack I have politically is </v>

1566
01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:54.101
<v Speaker 3>because while my government had the gall</v>
<v Speaker 3>to implement compelled speech </v>

1567
01:17:54.101 --> 01:17:57.110
<v Speaker 3>legislation without noticing what it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were interfering with,</v>

1568
01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:58.660
<v Speaker 3>because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1569
01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:01.130
<v Speaker 3>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty much the end of it.</v>

1570
01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.290
<v Speaker 3>How do you keep tyranny at bay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Free?</v>

1571
01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:08.480
<v Speaker 3>The x?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The proper exchange of ideas between </v>

1572
01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.770
<v Speaker 3>free individuals keeps tyranny at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best we've got.</v>

1573
01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:14.980
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work perfectly and it's also </v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a gift that England and in in </v>

1574
01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:18.911
<v Speaker 3>large part has given to the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world to formalize and codify that to </v>

1575
01:18:18.911 --> 01:18:22.991
<v Speaker 3>put it into a body of law to erect </v>
<v Speaker 3>governmental structures that are really </v>

1576
01:18:22.991 --> 01:18:26.411
<v Speaker 3>predicated on that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a remarkable achievement and it's </v>

1577
01:18:26.411 --> 01:18:27.110
<v Speaker 3>something we should be profoundly </v>
<v Speaker 3>grateful for.</v>

1578
01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you about the taking </v>

1579
01:18:32.610 --> 01:18:32.650
<v Speaker 1>that accepting praise on the behalf of </v>
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>

1580
01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:37.680
<v Speaker 1>There as an English person accept that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two dragons.</v>

1581
01:18:38.321 --> 01:18:43.321
<v Speaker 1>Then there is the inner and the at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>until we've reached some non-dualistic </v>

1582
01:18:43.321 --> 01:18:48.150
<v Speaker 1>utopia where everything is one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is the inner dragon of our own </v>

1583
01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:53.071
<v Speaker 1>desires and fears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suppose like when we're talking </v>

1584
01:18:53.071 --> 01:18:56.971
<v Speaker 1>about management of resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a phrase that we came up </v>

1585
01:18:56.971 --> 01:19:00.750
<v Speaker 1>earlier?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the where where does the attention </v>

1586
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:01.640
<v Speaker 1>need to go and it's difficult like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know me,</v>

1587
01:19:01.690 --> 01:19:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I suppose there's something about my </v>
<v Speaker 1>background that has led me to identify </v>

1588
01:19:06.690 --> 01:19:06.700
<v Speaker 1>as the Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1589
01:19:06.730 --> 01:19:10.030
<v Speaker 1>is consumerism is turning people into </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumers because obviously as an addict</v>

1590
01:19:10.031 --> 01:19:15.031
<v Speaker 1>that's what I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a consumer and a truck and Cima and it </v>

1591
01:19:15.031 --> 01:19:18.750
<v Speaker 1>seems that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your background in academia are </v>

1592
01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:21.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a neo Marxist post because like when I </v>

1593
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:23.710
<v Speaker 1>sort of like think about aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>

1594
01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:24.840
<v Speaker 1>egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1595
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:27.820
<v Speaker 1>people are working to artist only work </v>
<v Speaker 1>four hours a day.</v>

1596
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:30.130
<v Speaker 1>They should be time for fishing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoon,</v>

1597
01:19:30.131 --> 01:19:33.640
<v Speaker 1>which I think is in Das capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talks about fishing in the afternoon.</v>

1598
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me that seems like a very beautiful </v>

1599
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:42.030
<v Speaker 1>and fair and just idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also I don't see them like,</v>

1600
01:19:43.241 --> 01:19:45.250
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine that they're irritating on</v>

1601
01:19:45.251 --> 01:19:49.460
<v Speaker 1>a campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particularly for somebody who's research</v>

1602
01:19:49.461 --> 01:19:53.470
<v Speaker 1>such a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see them as powerful.</v>

1603
01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:56.950
<v Speaker 1>That's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of my intrigue.</v>

1604
01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it's comparable to when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to Sam Harris,</v>

1605
01:20:00.191 --> 01:20:01.900
<v Speaker 1>another post who I admired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who am I going?</v>

1606
01:20:01.901 --> 01:20:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like,</v>

1607
01:20:03.041 --> 01:20:08.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I'm talking to Sam Harris </v>

1608
01:20:08.041 --> 01:20:08.041
<v Speaker 1>about Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when like where's,</v>

1609
01:20:08.041 --> 01:20:08.041
<v Speaker 1>how</v>

1610
01:20:08.041 --> 01:20:13.040
<v Speaker 3>is Islam and gonna be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like even if he's aware of Saudi </v>

1611
01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Arabia and Wahhabism like Saudi Arabia </v>
<v Speaker 3>as an economic entity then on Islamic </v>

1612
01:20:17.401 --> 01:20:19.800
<v Speaker 3>entity in terms of race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go do some Islam.</v>

1613
01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:21.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like they go do some business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1614
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:25.890
<v Speaker 3>and so I suppose here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well my,</v>

1615
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:31.310
<v Speaker 3>when I'm concerned mostly I'm concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly with the emphasis on,</v>

1616
01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:34.860
<v Speaker 3>on the collective identity rather than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the individual identity.</v>

1617
01:20:34.861 --> 01:20:37.440
<v Speaker 3>Like the process that you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>described,</v>

1618
01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:42.860
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the answer to the question </v>

1619
01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:45.501
<v Speaker 3>that you posed at the beginning of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation is is there something </v>

1620
01:20:45.501 --> 01:20:45.501
<v Speaker 3>universal about the process that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>laid out?</v>

1621
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:50.310
<v Speaker 3>And I think there is and I think it's at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the core of individual development and I</v>

1622
01:20:50.311 --> 01:20:55.311
<v Speaker 3>think it's the most powerful of forces </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I think that the individual </v>

1623
01:20:55.311 --> 01:20:57.360
<v Speaker 3>should be regarded as the proper locus </v>
<v Speaker 3>of evaluation.</v>

1624
01:20:57.450 --> 01:21:00.210
<v Speaker 3>And the problem I have with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodern new Marxists types,</v>

1625
01:21:00.211 --> 01:21:03.720
<v Speaker 3>apart from the fact that their analysis </v>
<v Speaker 3>tends to lead to a kind of nihilism,</v>

1626
01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:08.730
<v Speaker 3>is that because they're making the group</v>
<v Speaker 3>the paramount level of analysis,</v>

1627
01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.410
<v Speaker 3>this sort of thing gets ignored.</v>

1628
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:15.980
<v Speaker 3>And I what I'm trying to do in my work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a program called the self </v>

1629
01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:19.971
<v Speaker 3>authoring program that kind of steps </v>
<v Speaker 3>people through these 12 steps that you </v>

1630
01:21:19.971 --> 01:21:23.421
<v Speaker 3>just described.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing that people do is write </v>

1631
01:21:23.421 --> 01:21:23.421
<v Speaker 3>about their past all the emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

1632
01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:26.520
<v Speaker 3>The second thing they do is take an </v>
<v Speaker 3>inventory of their personality,</v>

1633
01:21:26.521 --> 01:21:30.450
<v Speaker 3>faults and virtues so that they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>rectify the faults and capitalize on the</v>

1634
01:21:30.451 --> 01:21:35.451
<v Speaker 3>virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the third thing they do is chart a </v>

1635
01:21:35.451 --> 01:21:37.170
<v Speaker 3>course for the future that takes them </v>
<v Speaker 3>into account and others.</v>

1636
01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:42.620
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I see it as a reflection of this </v>

1637
01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:42.620
<v Speaker 3>universal process that you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>described it.</v>

1638
01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:46.290
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the most powerful form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation,</v>

1639
01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:51.620
<v Speaker 3>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think it's the one that risks </v>

1640
01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:54.741
<v Speaker 3>doing the least harm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it hasn't hurt anybody that you've </v>

1641
01:21:54.741 --> 01:21:55.680
<v Speaker 3>put yourself together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just good.</v>

1642
01:21:55.930 --> 01:21:57.120
<v Speaker 3>Writing is good for you.</v>

1643
01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:00.390
<v Speaker 3>It's good for the people that know you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing about it and it's.</v>

1644
01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:05.540
<v Speaker 3>It's the right level of humility because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you took what you knew to be wrong in </v>

1645
01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:09.750
<v Speaker 3>your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You took personal responsibility for it.</v>

1646
01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:13.770
<v Speaker 3>You made changes for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't go around pointing the finger</v>

1647
01:22:13.771 --> 01:22:17.040
<v Speaker 3>at what was wrong with the external </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and trying to fix it.</v>

1648
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:22.070
<v Speaker 3>Now look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could easily be that once you have </v>

1649
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:25.131
<v Speaker 3>your act together or maybe even before </v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be doing some things to </v>

1650
01:22:25.131 --> 01:22:27.120
<v Speaker 3>adjust political systems or sociological</v>
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>

1651
01:22:27.121 --> 01:22:30.810
<v Speaker 3>but the problem with that is what makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think you can trust yourself?</v>

1652
01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>

1653
01:22:32.431 --> 01:22:33.490
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm compassionate.</v>

1654
01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:38.540
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe maybe you're also envious of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the successful and the probability of </v>

1655
01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:42.981
<v Speaker 3>that is pretty damn high by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you better know before you </v>

1656
01:22:42.981 --> 01:22:44.670
<v Speaker 3>express that compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the political domain,</v>

1657
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:49.790
<v Speaker 3>whether or not that is contaminated by </v>
<v Speaker 3>things about yourself that you haven't </v>

1658
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.790
<v Speaker 3>contended with.</v>

1659
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Do you think a declaration or along </v>
<v Speaker 3>those lines,</v>

1660
01:22:53.341 --> 01:22:57.360
<v Speaker 3>I'll specifically that in the political </v>
<v Speaker 3>field would be refreshing?</v>

1661
01:22:57.450 --> 01:22:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you one of the.</v>

1662
01:22:58.710 --> 01:23:00.840
<v Speaker 3>This is a very funny thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the ancient,</v>

1663
01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:06.410
<v Speaker 3>the emperor of Ancient Mesopotamia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is some of the earliest </v>

1664
01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:06.490
<v Speaker 3>political we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>

1665
01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.320
<v Speaker 3>Here's what they used to do to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emperor.</v>

1666
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:13.470
<v Speaker 3>Every new year's Day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would take them outside the walls </v>

1667
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:16.861
<v Speaker 3>of the city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he was responsible for everything </v>

1668
01:23:16.861 --> 01:23:17.440
<v Speaker 3>within the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outside was chaos on the unknown.</v>

1669
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:22.680
<v Speaker 3>They'd take them outside the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd strip him of all his emperor </v>

1670
01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:23.110
<v Speaker 3>garb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's no longer emperor.</v>

1671
01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:25.480
<v Speaker 3>They'd make them Neil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd humiliate him.</v>

1672
01:23:25.481 --> 01:23:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>

1673
01:23:26.921 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 3>the priest would hit them with a glove </v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

1674
01:23:29.321 --> 01:23:31.270
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the last year,</v>

1675
01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:36.540
<v Speaker 3>how name all the ways that you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>embody Marduk Marduk was the god of the </v>

1676
01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Mesopotamians.</v>

1677
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Marduk was the thing that took on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>great dragon of chaos,</v>

1678
01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:45.280
<v Speaker 3>and so it was the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the responsibility of the emperor</v>

1679
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:50.310
<v Speaker 3>is to kneel down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's all the ways that I haven't been </v>

1680
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:54.540
<v Speaker 3>acting out my proper self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it brought the kingdom into </v>

1681
01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:55.270
<v Speaker 3>disarray,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he will be forgiven.</v>

1682
01:23:55.271 --> 01:23:57.670
<v Speaker 3>They would act out the reconstruction of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cosmos.</v>

1683
01:23:57.671 --> 01:24:02.671
<v Speaker 3>That was the New Year's celebration and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then he'd go in and try to be a good </v>

1684
01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:02.671
<v Speaker 3>king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like so.</v>

1685
01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1686
01:24:02.921 --> 01:24:04.180
<v Speaker 3>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1687
01:24:04.181 --> 01:24:09.181
<v Speaker 3>It's like the confession of the emperor </v>
<v Speaker 3>is this the way I haven't been good at </v>

1688
01:24:09.181 --> 01:24:09.181
<v Speaker 3>anything</v>

1689
01:24:09.181 --> 01:24:13.860
<v Speaker 1>comparable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A the powerful held up to that kind of </v>

1690
01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:16.000
<v Speaker 1>evaluation in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have rituals for that.</v>

1691
01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose we don't acknowledge the </v>

1692
01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:23.071
<v Speaker 1>emergence of order from chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a a merge or acknowledge </v>

1693
01:24:23.071 --> 01:24:24.630
<v Speaker 1>divine principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the powerful light,</v>

1694
01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.820
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is possibly because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumed meritocracy,</v>

1695
01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.590
<v Speaker 1>but people that are in positions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

1696
01:24:29.591 --> 01:24:34.591
<v Speaker 1>they're there for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to start stripping him </v>

1697
01:24:34.591 --> 01:24:34.591
<v Speaker 1>naked and take them outside the city and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa.</v>

1698
01:24:34.591 --> 01:24:37.060
<v Speaker 1>How often did you rank in that Oval </v>
<v Speaker 1>Office everyday get out.</v>

1699
01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1700
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:42.130
<v Speaker 3>I think there might be something to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the danger of pride that goes</v>

1701
01:24:42.131 --> 01:24:43.990
<v Speaker 3>along with ascension and a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1702
01:24:43.991 --> 01:24:46.240
<v Speaker 3>because I'm here in this position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I must deserve it.</v>

1703
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1704
01:24:46.991 --> 01:24:51.991
<v Speaker 3>but there should still be something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're bowing down to and that might be </v>

1705
01:24:51.991 --> 01:24:53.530
<v Speaker 3>the abstract idea of sovereign authority</v>
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

1706
01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.480
<v Speaker 3>If you think about it only </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically,</v>

1707
01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.600
<v Speaker 3>that's a figure that essentially has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a touch of divinity about it because </v>

1708
01:25:00.731 --> 01:25:00.840
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

1709
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:03.270
<v Speaker 1>be on a key right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harm.</v>

1710
01:25:03.271 --> 01:25:06.710
<v Speaker 1>So that's the Queen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anointed and appointed monique,</v>

1711
01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.840
<v Speaker 1>she represents so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I suppose in a post secular nation </v>

1712
01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.450
<v Speaker 1>she becomes the emblem of Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robin,</v>

1713
01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:14.830
<v Speaker 1>the emblem of God on right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1714
01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it actually functions to some </v>

1715
01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:19.860
<v Speaker 1>degree in the same way as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think so because the queen</v>

1716
01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:22.770
<v Speaker 3>your queen in particular our queen as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well because I'm Canadian.</v>

1717
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:23.440
<v Speaker 3>Aiden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1718
01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:26.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Elizabeth has been a,</v>

1719
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:29.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an embodiment of moral virtue.</v>

1720
01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:34.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's done a remarkable job over the </v>

1721
01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:34.820
<v Speaker 3>last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>

1722
01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:37.341
<v Speaker 3>75 years now she's held herself to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly high moral standard and I </v>

1723
01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:39.720
<v Speaker 3>think she does sit in the background as </v>
<v Speaker 3>emblematic of what</v>

1724
01:25:40.190 --> 01:25:45.190
<v Speaker 1>sovereign authority might look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you're a postmodernist and </v>

1725
01:25:45.190 --> 01:25:46.340
<v Speaker 1>this is an area where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm English and I can't get away</v>

1726
01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:51.341
<v Speaker 1>from the love of the Queen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would also say that she is an </v>

1727
01:25:51.341 --> 01:25:54.461
<v Speaker 1>emblem of authority and of power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth and land owners shit,</v>

1728
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:58.970
<v Speaker 1>and there is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an order that will be respected</v>

1729
01:25:58.971 --> 01:26:01.700
<v Speaker 1>and can't be challenged every so often </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country,</v>

1730
01:26:01.701 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>sort of toys with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>republicanism that always</v>

1731
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.380
<v Speaker 3>grateful when there's a wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1732
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:07.400
<v Speaker 3>There is this week so that no one has to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1733
01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:12.580
<v Speaker 3>is this right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we paying for these bizarre </v>

1734
01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:12.580
<v Speaker 3>spectacle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:12.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it.</v>

1736
01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:15.170
<v Speaker 3>But it is useful to think about it in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolic sense.</v>

1737
01:26:15.171 --> 01:26:20.171
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that constantly </v>

1738
01:26:20.171 --> 01:26:20.171
<v Speaker 3>threatens the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there should be four branches of</v>

1739
01:26:20.171 --> 01:26:21.770
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>legislative,</v>

1740
01:26:21.771 --> 01:26:24.710
<v Speaker 3>judicial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>executive,</v>

1741
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:28.130
<v Speaker 3>and symbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the problem in the United States</v>

1742
01:26:28.131 --> 01:26:30.440
<v Speaker 3>is the president keeps tilting towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>king,</v>

1743
01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:32.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Americans like the idea of the first</v>

1744
01:26:32.781 --> 01:26:34.730
<v Speaker 3>family and the first lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1745
01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1746
01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:37.580
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1747
01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:42.600
<v Speaker 3>and kind of tilts towards a dynasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've seen that happen with the </v>

1748
01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.030
<v Speaker 3>bushes and the Clintons and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a good thing,</v>

1749
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:48.440
<v Speaker 3>and it might be nice to have someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>take the symbolic load off the president</v>

1750
01:26:48.441 --> 01:26:53.441
<v Speaker 3>and just act that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your queen does that very nicely </v>

1751
01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:56.620
<v Speaker 3>because all of the pomp and circumstance</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the state and all the drama and </v>

1752
01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:59.240
<v Speaker 3>ritual of the sovereign can be played </v>
<v Speaker 3>out in that sort of dramatic space.</v>

1753
01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:02.360
<v Speaker 3>And your legislature and executive </v>
<v Speaker 3>branches can go off and do.</v>

1754
01:27:02.361 --> 01:27:04.490
<v Speaker 3>The administration is interesting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1755
01:27:04.491 --> 01:27:05.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1756
01:27:05.241 --> 01:27:08.630
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dentist steeze exert themselves in a</v>

1757
01:27:08.631 --> 01:27:13.631
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a demonstration of your argument </v>

1758
01:27:13.631 --> 01:27:16.391
<v Speaker 3>that there are certain hierarchy systems</v>
<v Speaker 3>that find their way into fruition </v>

1759
01:27:16.391 --> 01:27:19.481
<v Speaker 3>regardless of regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I suppose there's rational </v>

1760
01:27:19.481 --> 01:27:22.511
<v Speaker 3>reasons they would have the resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the experiences that can make the </v>

1761
01:27:22.511 --> 01:27:22.511
<v Speaker 3>connections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easier for them.</v>

1762
01:27:22.511 --> 01:27:26.741
<v Speaker 3>But that's also the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a danger to a republic is the </v>

1763
01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:29.411
<v Speaker 3>fact that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's part of the potential </v>

1764
01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:31.541
<v Speaker 3>corruption of the state is that while </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easier for the children of those </v>

1765
01:27:31.541 --> 01:27:35.831
<v Speaker 3>who have authority to have power and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want people attaining the pinnacle</v>

1766
01:27:36.291 --> 01:27:41.291
<v Speaker 3>of achievement because of power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wants to attending the pinnacle of </v>

1767
01:27:41.291 --> 01:27:41.500
<v Speaker 3>achievement because of competence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1768
01:27:41.610 --> 01:27:43.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those things always struggle.</v>

1769
01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:44.540
<v Speaker 3>They all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1770
01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:45.020
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1771
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:50.050
<v Speaker 3>it takes a society that's very awake to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop the hierarchies from degenerating </v>

1772
01:27:50.050 --> 01:27:54.060
<v Speaker 3>into hierarchies of power because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation is the tendency chirp.</v>

1773
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:55.840
<v Speaker 3>While it's easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easy.</v>

1774
01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.580
<v Speaker 3>Wba Pam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1775
01:27:57.710 --> 01:28:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Fearsome and terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1776
01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:02.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the full cannot pallium well,</v>

1777
01:28:02.630 --> 01:28:07.460
<v Speaker 3>and people have recognized that it's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>proclivity of hierarchies to,</v>

1778
01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:08.930
<v Speaker 3>towards tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1779
01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:10.580
<v Speaker 3>for really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for thousands of years,</v>

1780
01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:14.690
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that as a fundamental danger </v>
<v Speaker 3>to proper adaptation.</v>

1781
01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:16.580
<v Speaker 3>We need hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1782
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:20.580
<v Speaker 3>But they degenerate into tyranny and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they unfairly oppressed.</v>

1783
01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:21.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1784
01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:26.860
<v Speaker 3>we have to be on guard against that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that we call all </v>

1785
01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:28.040
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies tyrannies because that's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>helpful.</v>

1786
01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Or we call all productive activity </v>
<v Speaker 3>service in the,</v>

1787
01:28:31.810 --> 01:28:36.810
<v Speaker 3>in the service to the oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy because that's seriously not </v>

1788
01:28:36.810 --> 01:28:41.591
<v Speaker 3>how helpful and we don't dispense with </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies because then people don't </v>

1789
01:28:41.591 --> 01:28:41.591
<v Speaker 3>have anything to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1790
01:28:41.591 --> 01:28:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I see.</v>

1791
01:28:42.721 --> 01:28:46.550
<v Speaker 3>I get the beam out your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say if the individual is tuned,</v>

1792
01:28:46.551 --> 01:28:51.551
<v Speaker 3>if the individual is I channel that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a prayer of Saint Francis,</v>

1793
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:53.360
<v Speaker 3>I like.</v>

1794
01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.360
<v Speaker 3>It is a multiple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The invites us to find the reverse of a </v>

1795
01:28:58.850 --> 01:29:01.010
<v Speaker 3>h,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a defective characteristic.</v>

1796
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:06.110
<v Speaker 3>We all seen that we might be living out </v>
<v Speaker 3>to become a channel of some inherent </v>

1797
01:29:07.021 --> 01:29:09.430
<v Speaker 3>goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1798
01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:14.540
<v Speaker 3>the thing that's one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting rolled out or two </v>

1799
01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:17.421
<v Speaker 3>things actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first is the word sin means to miss </v>

1800
01:29:17.421 --> 01:29:17.421
<v Speaker 3>the target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an archery term.</v>

1801
01:29:17.610 --> 01:29:22.610
<v Speaker 3>So that's quite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very interesting way of </v>

1802
01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:22.610
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it because it means that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a target,</v>

1803
01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:23.700
<v Speaker 3>there is a target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing,</v>

1804
01:29:23.701 --> 01:29:26.460
<v Speaker 3>but the next thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this comes right out of that,</v>

1805
01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:31.440
<v Speaker 3>is it's very useful to become aware of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your faults because as soon as you pause</v>

1806
01:29:31.441 --> 01:29:36.441
<v Speaker 3>it a fault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pause it the opposite by merely </v>

1807
01:29:36.441 --> 01:29:36.441
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1808
01:29:36.441 --> 01:29:36.750
<v Speaker 3>that's a fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying implicitly,</v>

1809
01:29:36.751 --> 01:29:38.490
<v Speaker 3>while there's something that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite of that,</v>

1810
01:29:38.491 --> 01:29:43.491
<v Speaker 3>so out of your recognition of faults </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately some clarity of virtue </v>

1811
01:29:43.491 --> 01:29:44.940
<v Speaker 3>develops because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1812
01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.500
<v Speaker 3>this is a fault and I really know it.</v>

1813
01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:47.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

1814
01:29:47.131 --> 01:29:50.940
<v Speaker 3>You've got some bedrock there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the opposite of that fault is,</v>

1815
01:29:51.150 --> 01:29:56.150
<v Speaker 3>you might not know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever the opposite of that fault </v>

1816
01:29:56.150 --> 01:29:56.580
<v Speaker 3>is is a virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you might say,</v>

1817
01:29:56.581 --> 01:29:57.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have 20 faults.</v>

1818
01:29:57.991 --> 01:30:01.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The opposite of the personality that has</v>

1819
01:30:01.561 --> 01:30:05.850
<v Speaker 3>all those 20 faults is the virtuous you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that might happen to be,</v>

1820
01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:06.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

1821
01:30:06.571 --> 01:30:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Then you've then you've conjured out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the devil.</v>

1822
01:30:09.450 --> 01:30:11.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm a redeemer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>

1823
01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:17.210
<v Speaker 3>I like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'm down to play both in terms </v>

1824
01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:22.460
<v Speaker 3>of cosmology and fleeting morality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is chaos,</v>

1825
01:30:22.711 --> 01:30:26.250
<v Speaker 3>there is vastness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are also patterns.</v>

1826
01:30:26.251 --> 01:30:31.251
<v Speaker 3>There are patterns that emerge and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you call that pattern mail or </v>

1827
01:30:31.251 --> 01:30:35.720
<v Speaker 3>love or beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are various patterns and I feel </v>

1828
01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:37.710
<v Speaker 3>that there is something to get in </v>
<v Speaker 3>alignment with.</v>

1829
01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.990
<v Speaker 3>There is a tune,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is harmony,</v>

1830
01:30:39.991 --> 01:30:42.800
<v Speaker 3>there is melody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is grace would not.</v>

1831
01:30:43.530 --> 01:30:46.640
<v Speaker 3>And all you're using their musical </v>
<v Speaker 3>musical.</v>

1832
01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:48.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you call analogies,</v>

1833
01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:54.260
<v Speaker 3>presentations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what music expresses is to have </v>

1834
01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:55.320
<v Speaker 3>all of that in harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>live music because of that,</v>

1835
01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:56.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in those patterns,</v>

1836
01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:58.440
<v Speaker 3>because music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about music,</v>

1837
01:30:58.441 --> 01:31:03.441
<v Speaker 3>it is the harmonious interaction of </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns and you just described all </v>

1838
01:31:03.441 --> 01:31:04.440
<v Speaker 3>those positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1839
01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:05.760
<v Speaker 3>what would you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spirits.</v>

1840
01:31:05.761 --> 01:31:08.010
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>as patterns.</v>

1841
01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:13.130
<v Speaker 3>While they are patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you might think that there's a </v>

1842
01:31:13.130 --> 01:31:13.130
<v Speaker 3>pattern that's composed of all of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns.</v>

1843
01:31:13.130 --> 01:31:14.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're after.</v>

1844
01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:17.040
<v Speaker 3>You're after the pattern that's composed</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all those patterns.</v>

1845
01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:18.330
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1846
01:31:18.331 --> 01:31:19.950
<v Speaker 3>And you want to put yourself in harmony </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>

1847
01:31:19.951 --> 01:31:21.960
<v Speaker 3>And that is a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real thing.</v>

1848
01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:26.130
<v Speaker 3>You can feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's what keeps you alive essentially</v>

1849
01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:28.890
<v Speaker 3>when you're trying to become conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1850
01:31:28.891 --> 01:31:29.730
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1851
01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:31.380
<v Speaker 3>There is something important happening.</v>

1852
01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:36.680
<v Speaker 3>I feel like what we were saying before </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the acknowledgement of difference </v>

1853
01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:41.330
<v Speaker 3>need an infor inferiority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is something that is definitely not</v>

1854
01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:43.300
<v Speaker 3>what we should be actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1855
01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:48.360
<v Speaker 3>this is part of what the radical leftist</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps saying is what we should celebrate</v>

1856
01:31:48.481 --> 01:31:49.380
<v Speaker 3>diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1857
01:31:49.381 --> 01:31:54.381
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what that means first is the </v>

1858
01:31:54.381 --> 01:31:56.070
<v Speaker 3>admission that people actually differ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have diversity.</v>

1859
01:31:56.250 --> 01:31:58.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad there are conservatives.</v>

1860
01:31:58.290 --> 01:32:02.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad there are leftists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The conservatives run things.</v>

1861
01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:07.770
<v Speaker 3>The leftists invent them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like good and they're really </v>

1862
01:32:07.770 --> 01:32:08.320
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people like you know,</v>

1863
01:32:08.530 --> 01:32:11.290
<v Speaker 3>if you have a group that's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives and they're going down the</v>

1864
01:32:11.291 --> 01:32:16.291
<v Speaker 3>right path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to go down that path </v>

1865
01:32:16.291 --> 01:32:18.061
<v Speaker 3>really fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they're going down the wrong </v>

1866
01:32:18.061 --> 01:32:20.131
<v Speaker 3>path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to be able to think </v>

1867
01:32:20.131 --> 01:32:20.131
<v Speaker 3>laterally and figuring out how to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of it.</v>

1868
01:32:20.131 --> 01:32:21.700
<v Speaker 3>If you have a group of of left leaning </v>
<v Speaker 3>creative types,</v>

1869
01:32:21.701 --> 01:32:23.890
<v Speaker 3>it's like they're going to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>100 ideas,</v>

1870
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:29.340
<v Speaker 3>but the probability that they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>organize in a stable hierarchy and </v>

1871
01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:30.610
<v Speaker 3>implement those effectively is zero.</v>

1872
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:32.830
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have to call over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives.</v>

1873
01:32:32.831 --> 01:32:33.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look guys,</v>

1874
01:32:33.970 --> 01:32:38.970
<v Speaker 3>we finally got a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have one idea because you're </v>

1875
01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:42.480
<v Speaker 3>conservatives run with it and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can all run with it and so it's really </v>

1876
01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:46.621
<v Speaker 3>good that we have people who are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that on both sides of the distribution </v>

1877
01:32:46.621 --> 01:32:50.551
<v Speaker 3>because otherwise the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the creative types and sit around and </v>

1878
01:32:50.551 --> 01:32:53.980
<v Speaker 3>come up with new ideas until they starve</v>
<v Speaker 3>to death in squalor and the are.</v>

1879
01:32:54.130 --> 01:32:54.880
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1880
01:32:54.881 --> 01:32:57.610
<v Speaker 3>And the Conservatives would just ossify </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1881
01:32:57.670 --> 01:33:02.670
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>run down a road that got narrower and </v>

1882
01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:06.031
<v Speaker 3>narrower and narrower and they'd all end</v>
<v Speaker 3>up stuck between two cliffs and that'd </v>

1883
01:33:06.031 --> 01:33:06.640
<v Speaker 3>be the end of it for both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thesis,</v>

1884
01:33:06.641 --> 01:33:08.530
<v Speaker 3>antithesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>synthesis.</v>

1885
01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:13.890
<v Speaker 3>We require synthesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how does the interplay of </v>

1886
01:33:13.890 --> 01:33:13.890
<v Speaker 3>opposites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actual opposites.</v>

1887
01:33:13.890 --> 01:33:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1888
01:33:14.321 --> 01:33:19.321
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They Yin-yang that over the s there </v>

1889
01:33:19.321 --> 01:33:19.321
<v Speaker 3>needs to be necessarily collusion </v>
<v Speaker 3>between distinction,</v>

1890
01:33:19.321 --> 01:33:24.151
<v Speaker 3>but for that to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that needs to be acknowledgement and </v>

1891
01:33:24.151 --> 01:33:24.310
<v Speaker 3>recognition of difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in a,</v>

1892
01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:29.360
<v Speaker 3>trying to achieve a quality with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>annihilation of category is no </v>

1893
01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.150
<v Speaker 3>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>

1894
01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:34.060
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a successful route.</v>

1895
01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:38.170
<v Speaker 3>Thank you doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Professor Jordan,</v>

1897

<v Speaker 3>That was great.</v>

1898
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:42.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was really good.</v>

1899
01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
