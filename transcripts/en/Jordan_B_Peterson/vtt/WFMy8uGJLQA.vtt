<v Speaker 1>Uncut version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any</v>

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>say</v>

3
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.633
<v Speaker 1>that takes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people come in and do it on a computer </v>

4
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:33.921
<v Speaker 1>instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you read his book?</v>

5
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.703
<v Speaker 2>Were there before anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there time outs of feminine figure </v>

6
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:49.024
<v Speaker 2>because she's the wife of absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also a dragon and it is the </v>

7
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:54.814
<v Speaker 2>case in the ecology that the figure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the terrible mother and mother in </v>

8
00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:03.170
<v Speaker 2>general is often contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Figure dragging.</v>

9
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't exactly know</v>
<v Speaker 2>why it is that mythological.</v>

10
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most mythological stories described this</v>

11
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.570
<v Speaker 2>creation of the world out of one of two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

12
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 2>It's either the body of a giant or it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the body of a serpent.</v>

13
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.703
<v Speaker 2>I don't exactly know why it's the body </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the serpent or wall or a giant for </v>

14
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.270
<v Speaker 2>that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to tell.</v>

15
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.940
<v Speaker 2>It's in part because the serpent is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>serpent that eats its own tail.</v>

16
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.793
<v Speaker 2>That's the era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've been reading about and it's a </v>

17
00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:41.200
<v Speaker 2>symbol of the union of opposites and </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the mythological perspective,</v>

18
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was that the universe is </v>
<v Speaker 2>made out of.</v>

19
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.223
<v Speaker 2>Before it was discriminatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>law objects was everything that's now </v>

20
00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:47.854
<v Speaker 2>discriminative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all combined into one thing and the </v>

21
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:54.051
<v Speaker 2>assembles that myth uses to the symbols </v>
<v Speaker 2>that myth uses to represent that state,</v>

22
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:57.460
<v Speaker 2>which by definition can't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented,</v>

23
00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.643
<v Speaker 2>circulate around attempts to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to represent the union of paradoxical </v>

24
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:04.894
<v Speaker 2>opposites.</v>

25
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.900
<v Speaker 2>apple fest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

27
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:11.734
<v Speaker 2>the Egyptian serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the serpent that eats the sun every </v>

28
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:16.210
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the serpent that Ray,</v>

29
00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:18.830
<v Speaker 2>who's the son God kills every morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he,</v>

30
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.530
<v Speaker 2>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he rises again,</v>

31
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 2>raised the god of the Egyptian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pharaoh is assimilated to apple.</v>

32
00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:26.344
<v Speaker 2>FIS for the Egyptians was the god that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was there at before time began and the </v>

33
00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:31.474
<v Speaker 2>same God that will be there after time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not known at the beginning of time or </v>

34
00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 2>the head of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but outside of time,</v>

35
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.393
<v Speaker 2>entirely something that surrounds time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what these fingers are </v>

36
00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:40.294
<v Speaker 2>attempting these fingers here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting them to represent the same sort </v>

37
00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:47.080
<v Speaker 2>of idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is from Ben and in Nigeria,</v>

38
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:47.914
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain design here in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>serpents in closing the world on a </v>

39
00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 2>breast shield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a Mexican calendar stolen within</v>

40
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.860
<v Speaker 2>encircling serpents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serpents,</v>

41
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 2>head up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the world.</v>

42
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is the reason the serpent is a</v>

43
00:03:02.371 --> 00:03:07.371
<v Speaker 2>road a year because the year is also the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world mythological language tends to mix</v>

44
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.251
<v Speaker 2>things up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

45
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:10.084
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

46
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.423
<v Speaker 2>it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very frequent for cultures to </v>

47
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.543
<v Speaker 2>regard the creation of the new year as </v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent to the creation of the new </v>

48
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why again as in Sumeria,</v>

49
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 2>and that's an extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>widespread,</v>

50
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 2>a ritual that the day that the dragon is</v>
<v Speaker 2>dispatched and her parts pulled apart to</v>

51
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is also New Year's Day and the</v>

52
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 2>day that the state is renewed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>state is equivalent to the world.</v>

53
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.743
<v Speaker 2>From a mythological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state is where order rules as </v>

54
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 2>opposed to chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chaos has two symbols,</v>

55
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.500
<v Speaker 2>one being the serpent and the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>being the great mother.</v>

56
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 2>The serpent is the most primordial form </v>
<v Speaker 2>of chaos.</v>

57
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos from which everything else is</v>
<v Speaker 2>engendered.</v>

58
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 2>So you could say there's two types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

59
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 2>There's chaos that preceded the division</v>
<v Speaker 2>of order</v>

60
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.793
<v Speaker 2>and disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's the chaos that stands for </v>

61
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:15.901
<v Speaker 2>disorder as opposed to order</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Samaritan Inn.</v>

62
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 2>The earliest Sumerian creation </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythology.</v>

63
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>world parents arise from the body of the</v>

64
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 2>serpent worth parents on the sky and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

65
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 2>The earth is assimilated to the female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Female stands for chaos,</v>

66
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 2>but you have to understand that</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you've circumscribed an area,</v>

67
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.783
<v Speaker 2>say like a state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the area outside of that state is </v>

68
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 2>conceived of as chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's where anomaly roles.</v>

69
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 2>It's where novelty rules was a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>different form of chaos that the kind of</v>

70
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 2>cast that proceeded the establishment of</v>
<v Speaker 2>any order whatsoever.</v>

71
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.833
<v Speaker 2>You can see that's kind of a subtle </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction and I think that's part of </v>

72
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:56.854
<v Speaker 2>the reason why the figure of the serpent</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the figure of the great mother get </v>

73
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:04.351
<v Speaker 2>contaminated so easily is the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother is novelty from the standpoint of</v>

74
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:05.374
<v Speaker 2>ordered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The serpent is novelty before there was </v>

75
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 2>any division between order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

76
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 2>so see if we can take a look at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>representations here.</v>

77
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Here's two more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is from Babylonian.</v>

78
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.113
<v Speaker 2>As the ocean ringing world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't see much of worlds in the </v>

79
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:29.284
<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The oceans around the side and there's </v>

80
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:31.764
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just see the edges of the </v>

81
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 2>serpent's tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is not much left of them,</v>

82
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 2>there's not much left of the tablet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then this is from Italy.</v>

83
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 2>In the 17th century is the four corners </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

84
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.221
<v Speaker 2>The world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

85
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:43.054
<v Speaker 2>is often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is also very difficult to </v>

86
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:45.574
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world of orders generally </v>

87
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 2>represented by a symbol that looks like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

88
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.800
<v Speaker 2>That's the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a Mandela.</v>

89
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:51.634
<v Speaker 2>It's a circle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is divided into four parts like </v>

90
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:55.570
<v Speaker 2>paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The paradise in Genesys has exactly that</v>

91
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:56.404
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not phone from which for Rivers </v>

92
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.263
<v Speaker 2>Flow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fountains right in the center where </v>

93
00:05:59.521 --> 00:06:00.354
<v Speaker 2>the four rivers divided up into four </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts and it's a circle and that's a </v>

94
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 2>model for Jerusalem and Jerusalem is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavenly city,</v>

95
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.130
<v Speaker 2>and the heavenly city of Jerusalem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the archetype of log,</v>

96
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.993
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upon which all actual cities are </v>

97
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 2>predicated.</v>

98
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 2>So they're always built in an attempt to</v>
<v Speaker 2>imitate and having a city.</v>

99
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 2>And that's common model for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for city construction.</v>

100
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:21.974
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be more or less distributed </v>

101
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.690
<v Speaker 2>all around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

102
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 2>the funny thing is my daughter started </v>
<v Speaker 2>drawing the world,</v>

103
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 2>hear about it about three weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

104
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.413
<v Speaker 2>she drew a finger exactly like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the world she draws and divided </v>

105
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.370
<v Speaker 2>one line with divided and not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

106
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.813
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to ask them why a </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of a chaos before I was </v>

107
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.123
<v Speaker 2>the unknown and the unknown is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>important and why there's such drive to </v>

108
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.083
<v Speaker 2>since from the time when I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation as possible in the world </v>

109
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 2>would already have been divided into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown and the unknown.</v>

110
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

111
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because</v>

112
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.773
<v Speaker 2>the argument that are trying to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth in the next few chapters in this </v>

113
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:11.320
<v Speaker 2>book is that the thing you need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of all,</v>

114
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 2>if you think of a story as a map of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>

115
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.133
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a description of behavioral </v>

116
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 2>patterns that are designed to help you </v>
<v Speaker 2>make order out of chaos.</v>

117
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.923
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In order to generate a story that has </v>

118
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:26.564
<v Speaker 2>generalized validity instead of one </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just relevant for a given </v>

119
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:34.520
<v Speaker 2>occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may know how to do one thing and you</v>

120
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:35.354
<v Speaker 2>can teach someone how to do that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But knowing how to do one thing is </v>

121
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:40.154
<v Speaker 2>nowhere near as useful as knowing how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>generate patterns of knowing things and </v>

122
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I think part of the drive to represent </v>
<v Speaker 2>the unknown per se,</v>

123
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.830
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the overall attempt to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a representation of the domain,</v>

124
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:55.634
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the always present unknown know your </v>

125
00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:02.960
<v Speaker 2>question is why try supposed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why</v>

126
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.433
<v Speaker 2>is it necessary to generate an image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say like the serpent rather than an </v>

127
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:10.010
<v Speaker 2>image of the great mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just normally.</v>

128
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't even know if</v>

129
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.303
<v Speaker 2>all I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I can say is that as far as I've </v>

130
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.403
<v Speaker 2>been able to determine what people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>done is attempt to represent the source </v>

131
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:23.144
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean we still do that obviously </v>

132
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:30.470
<v Speaker 2>scientifically people are more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to speculate about the origin of</v>

133
00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:31.304
<v Speaker 2>things previous to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the potential established with a </v>

134
00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 2>baby or even could have experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me,</v>

135
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.033
<v Speaker 2>well it seems to be just a side effect </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a direct effect of our general </v>

136
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:48.521
<v Speaker 2>curiosity about everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>

137
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.823
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So could you say that once we've been </v>

138
00:08:52.941 --> 00:08:53.774
<v Speaker 2>able to define ourselves in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to have an explanation for all </v>

139
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say when it also maybe like,</v>

140
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.703
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this like I find this stuff very </v>

141
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:05.454
<v Speaker 2>compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it seems to me that things </v>

142
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:13.560
<v Speaker 2>aren't necessarily just attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe the unknown there right there.</v>

143
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 2>The representations to me seemed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate.</v>

144
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where they came from or how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they developed their approximations that</v>

145
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 2>have taken place over thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>

146
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't exactly know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As such as represented as a circuit,</v>

147
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 2>it has something to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conjunction of opposites.</v>

148
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 2>A serpent is something that's wind and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that's on the ground,</v>

149
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.793
<v Speaker 2>so it's a niche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an image of the Union of whatever </v>

150
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:43.194
<v Speaker 2>it is that's represented by spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is usually something like </v>

151
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:48.100
<v Speaker 2>consciousness or the domain that </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness hysterical.</v>

152
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.870
<v Speaker 2>That's the masculine will be at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythologically speaking.</v>

153
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.460
<v Speaker 2>The fact that the serpent crawls on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground gives the feminine aspect because</v>

154
00:09:56.461 --> 00:09:57.294
<v Speaker 2>it's tied to matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can also shed its skin so it can </v>

155
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:00.384
<v Speaker 2>trips for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the mythological symbol is trying to </v>

156
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:03.264
<v Speaker 2>say that don known as such with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that combined opposites that </v>

157
00:10:05.931 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 2>are generally viewed as separate bowl </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that can transform itself.</v>

158
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.770
<v Speaker 2>He can't say anything about it like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

159
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird category because.</v>

160
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.023
<v Speaker 2>Well loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you attempted to to describe it in </v>

161
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:19.224
<v Speaker 2>this bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now something formless he had complete </v>

162
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 2>that existed before heaven and earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>without sound,</v>

163
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 2>without substance dependent on nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unchanging.</v>

164
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:25.883
<v Speaker 2>What may think of it as the mother of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all things under heaven has doubt </v>

165
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.270
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the,</v>

166
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.163
<v Speaker 2>it's the source of everything from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of Chinese mythology and he </v>

167
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 2>points out that as soon as you talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

168
00:10:36.991 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 2>you're not talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because as soon as you categorize it,</v>

169
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 2>it's not an attempt to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>purposefully obscure.</v>

170
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.450
<v Speaker 2>The point that is being made biopsy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

171
00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:52.590
<v Speaker 2>is that as soon as you try to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's uncategorizable,</v>

172
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:54.750
<v Speaker 2>you've already categorized it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've already got away from it.</v>

173
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.003
<v Speaker 2>So we're in a problematic position here </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're trying to come up with a </v>

174
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:00.624
<v Speaker 2>representation of something that existed</v>
<v Speaker 2>before any representations were even </v>

175
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:04.044
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all I can tell you about her just to </v>

176
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.283
<v Speaker 2>see what the representations are now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the purpose of them was because </v>

177
00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:15.150
<v Speaker 2>we've been attempting to generate a Meta</v>
<v Speaker 2>story as a species,</v>

178
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Speaker 2>and the story is how to adapt to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that the result unknown territory.</v>

179
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Remember the dragon has other attributes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

180
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.343
<v Speaker 2>I read a book called Grendel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a novel published in the </v>

181
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.770
<v Speaker 2>seventies recently that the debt or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon in there,</v>

182
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.930
<v Speaker 2>there's a mythological character named </v>
<v Speaker 2>Grendel who eats people</v>

183
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.870
<v Speaker 2>and he's constantly attacking this one </v>
<v Speaker 2>king</v>

184
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.243
<v Speaker 2>from deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a little Scandinavian and it's </v>

185
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:45.464
<v Speaker 2>written from the perspective of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster instead of perspective </v>

186
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.750
<v Speaker 2>perspective of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

187
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:50.623
<v Speaker 2>Grendel is this monster eats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He keeps attacking this kingdom and </v>

188
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:59.131
<v Speaker 2>eating people and he's completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dragon has made him invulnerable.</v>

189
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.453
<v Speaker 2>You can't be defeated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the consequences of his repeated </v>

190
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 2>attacks on this kingdom is the kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to fortify itself very,</v>

191
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:08.050
<v Speaker 2>very heavily because it's always being </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacked.</v>

192
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.750
<v Speaker 2>It as a consequence of spreads his </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominion everywhere.</v>

193
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.030
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

194
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a morality play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that sense.</v>

195
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.560
<v Speaker 2>It says that one of the functions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>constant death,</v>

196
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.113
<v Speaker 2>threat of death is to produce a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of power in response </v>

197
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:22.780
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

198
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 2>there was one point in the book where </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandma goes and talks to the dragon.</v>

199
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 2>This dragon can see the beginning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of time.</v>

200
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 2>He's also involved in vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sits on gold.</v>

201
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.840
<v Speaker 2>That's another attribute of the dragging</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

202
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:35.674
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need classic hero mythology that you </v>

203
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 2>hear those optic to go through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon,</v>

204
00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:40.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as he,</v>

205
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.983
<v Speaker 2>soon as he faces the Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets the gold that the dragon has </v>

206
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.440
<v Speaker 2>drinks back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another.</v>

207
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.590
<v Speaker 2>That's another indication of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>juxtaposition of opposites.</v>

208
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.410
<v Speaker 2>The story is basically telling you what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dragon is,</v>

209
00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:52.870
<v Speaker 2>something that can devour you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathes fire.</v>

210
00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:55.270
<v Speaker 2>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very potent transformative agent.</v>

211
00:12:55.271 --> 00:12:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Annotate eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you face it,</v>

212
00:12:57.311 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Speaker 2>sits on a treasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

213
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.360
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>

214
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.530
<v Speaker 2>If you face the dragons voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the story of the myth anyways.</v>

215
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.050
<v Speaker 2>If you face the dragon voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can get the treasure.</v>

216
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Will you bring the treasure back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community that it's changed?</v>

217
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.403
<v Speaker 2>That's a story mode adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why those dragons stories pop up </v>

218
00:13:14.051 --> 00:13:16.280
<v Speaker 2>over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always sitting on Treasury,</v>

219
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.180
<v Speaker 2>so it's another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see there how that image sort of</v>

220
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.160
<v Speaker 2>blends into the image of the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother and it's positive on one hand,</v>

221
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.930
<v Speaker 2>negative on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a story,</v>

222
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.793
<v Speaker 2>not a habituation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but exploration generated that </v>

223
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.623
<v Speaker 2>application in many taken another very </v>
<v Speaker 2>archaic notion and that's the notion of </v>

224
00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:35.734
<v Speaker 2>human sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I talked to you a little bit </v>

225
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:39.820
<v Speaker 2>about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you dig down into most cultures,</v>

226
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.280
<v Speaker 2>if you get down to a sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 2>archaic layer,</v>

227
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:43.114
<v Speaker 2>you could find a strategy and time </v>
<v Speaker 2>during which that culture practice team </v>

228
00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:52.030
<v Speaker 2>and sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sufficiently peculiar practice so</v>

229
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.950
<v Speaker 2>that Arthur Kessler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he wrote,</v>

230
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.873
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a book called the machine that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was quite famous back in the early </v>

231
00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:58.780
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

232
00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.613
<v Speaker 2>the fact that human beings practice </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice at virtually all levels of </v>

233
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.990
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our culture,</v>

234
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:04.893
<v Speaker 2>all cultures so far identified was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>indication that there was something </v>

235
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:08.980
<v Speaker 2>really biologically wrong with us.</v>

236
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.250
<v Speaker 2>That was such an insane thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what?</v>

237
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:13.323
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those cultures that were practicing </v>

238
00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:16.480
<v Speaker 2>ritualistic sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as I can tell,</v>

239
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:20.830
<v Speaker 2>what they were doing was acting out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that the thing that was valued most</v>

240
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:21.813
<v Speaker 2>had to be sacrificed to the unknown in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order for constant adaptation to </v>

241
00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:27.604
<v Speaker 2>continue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was either like the sacrificial </v>

242
00:14:30.281 --> 00:14:33.640
<v Speaker 2>victim was either you could feel him as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a hero because that was often the case,</v>

243
00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:34.474
<v Speaker 2>so he was a hero who who would be killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that his body would be distributed </v>

244
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.850
<v Speaker 2>among the crowd and they'd eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one ritual of it.</v>

245
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just like the Christian mass by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

246
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.140
<v Speaker 2>is exactly the same idea and the notion </v>
<v Speaker 2>was that to to move towards divinity,</v>

247
00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:47.974
<v Speaker 2>it was necessary to incorporate because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the most concrete way of putting </v>

248
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:52.454
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorporate the body or the essence of </v>

249
00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:57.220
<v Speaker 2>this thing that's constantly being </v>
<v Speaker 2>offered up to the unknown.</v>

250
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:58.423
<v Speaker 2>That was the only way that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue insuring that constant </v>

251
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.053
<v Speaker 2>adaptation was going to take place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the sacrificial aspect of the </v>

252
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:05.264
<v Speaker 2>hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also the sacrificial </v>

253
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Speaker 2>aspect of the king and those two things </v>
<v Speaker 2>get confused as well.</v>

254
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.660
<v Speaker 2>The king isn't a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The king is the fonder of the hero,</v>

255
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 2>or he's the thing that hero generates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can look at it either way.</v>

256
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.370
<v Speaker 2>The king is also something that has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be sacrificed,</v>

257
00:15:21.371 --> 00:15:22.204
<v Speaker 2>that Kenya is the embodiment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral patterns that had adaptive </v>

258
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:26.444
<v Speaker 2>significance in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also schemas of representation and </v>

259
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:32.090
<v Speaker 2>they're useful for guiding adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if the environment shifts suddenly,</v>

260
00:15:32.091 --> 00:15:32.924
<v Speaker 2>then they have to be changed and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only way they can be changed as well </v>

261
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.160
<v Speaker 2>from the mythological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if their sacrifice,</v>

262
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.103
<v Speaker 2>that's what those rituals were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>act out now as you can check around in </v>

263
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:43.604
<v Speaker 2>the literature to two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two year old to satisfy your own </v>

264
00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:47.960
<v Speaker 2>curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as I can tell,</v>

265
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 2>I've never been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never found an explanation.</v>

266
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:54.080
<v Speaker 2>If you sacrificial ritual that was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prehensile,</v>

267
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.483
<v Speaker 2>that didn't make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't fit along that theoretical </v>

268
00:15:58.731 --> 00:15:59.564
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>

269
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:00.973
<v Speaker 2>So if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could accept the argument that </v>

270
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:06.410
<v Speaker 2>people acted out ideas before they </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood that.</v>

271
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:08.743
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was trying to explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of that neural psychological </v>

272
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:12.860
<v Speaker 2>chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say evolutionary pressures,</v>

273
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:15.620
<v Speaker 2>select our behavioral patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't invent them all.</v>

274
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:16.643
<v Speaker 2>If we experiment a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some behavioral patterns last and some </v>

275
00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:20.720
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think we get.</v>

276
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.823
<v Speaker 2>We get behavioral patterns that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>established as a consequence of </v>

277
00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:24.734
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary pressures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're established long before we can </v>

278
00:16:26.571 --> 00:16:29.150
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we get the behavioral pattern down.</v>

279
00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Then we started watching what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing and when we're watching what we're</v>

280
00:16:32.151 --> 00:16:34.670
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tell stories and the stories reflect</v>

281
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.033
<v Speaker 2>their first order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>representations of behavioral patterns </v>

282
00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:44.231
<v Speaker 2>that that work so people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's that survived were able to give</v>

283
00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:47.750
<v Speaker 2>up the thing that was most important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them when it was necessary,</v>

284
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:48.853
<v Speaker 2>and over the course of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say hundreds of thousands of </v>

285
00:16:50.991 --> 00:16:51.824
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gathered enough observations about </v>

286
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:57.350
<v Speaker 2>success to draw some general conclusions</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what it meant.</v>

287
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 2>We know already in this and obtain by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mesopotamian times,</v>

288
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.143
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was that Martech represented</v>
<v Speaker 2>was already positive as necessarily </v>

289
00:17:05.511 --> 00:17:09.380
<v Speaker 2>occupying the highest position in the in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dominance hierarchy of gods.</v>

290
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.960
<v Speaker 2>So that's already established 5,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

291
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:12.794
<v Speaker 2>By the time people could write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We knew that story and it's debatable </v>

292
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.400
<v Speaker 2>whether or not we knew what it meant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you have to ask yourself,</v>

293
00:17:19.401 --> 00:17:21.530
<v Speaker 2>when you say that you know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>something means,</v>

294
00:17:21.531 --> 00:17:22.364
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you say in one thing you're </v>

295
00:17:24.051 --> 00:17:27.770
<v Speaker 2>saying is like if you know something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can act it out and the fact that you</v>

296
00:17:27.771 --> 00:17:31.280
<v Speaker 2>can act on does not necessarily mean you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an accurate representation of it or</v>

297
00:17:31.281 --> 00:17:32.114
<v Speaker 2>that you can say anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>words that are or that it was </v>

298
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:35.684
<v Speaker 2>constructed as a consequence of word </v>
<v Speaker 2>verbally and thinking that it was </v>

299
00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:40.424
<v Speaker 2>rational or any of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing something is acting it out and </v>

300
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:47.800
<v Speaker 2>that's wasted and it's images of wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 2>are collected in mythology.</v>

301
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you have to come up with it.</v>

302
00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can try,</v>

303
00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.790
<v Speaker 2>try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try as you want,</v>

304
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.073
<v Speaker 2>come up with an alternate explanation </v>
<v Speaker 2>for things that on the face of it seems </v>

305
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.250
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sacrificial rituals.</v>

306
00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.770
<v Speaker 2>You have to realize these things have </v>
<v Speaker 2>lasted long time.</v>

307
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.200
<v Speaker 2>When I made allusion to the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass,</v>

308
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.510
<v Speaker 2>that that's direct light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you eat the way for that represents</v>

309
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:10.344
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the sacrificial victim and the </v>

310
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:12.864
<v Speaker 2>incorporation of that way for it's made </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of wheat because wheat is it dying </v>

311
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:20.541
<v Speaker 2>and resurrecting a plant by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot of vegetation going,</v>

312
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.890
<v Speaker 2>symbolism that it is assimilated into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we host.</v>

313
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.203
<v Speaker 2>When you meet that notion is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to incorporate whatever is at </v>

314
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:34.761
<v Speaker 2>the essence of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People still do that and so it's a.</v>

315
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.103
<v Speaker 2>it's a symbolic representation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrificial ritual and it's supposed to </v>

316
00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:43.590
<v Speaker 2>produce an effect.</v>

317
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.793
<v Speaker 2>It's got more and more abstract as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can tell people no actually engage in </v>

318
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.900
<v Speaker 2>sacrificial rituals anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although we kind of do that and we still</v>

319
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:55.890
<v Speaker 2>do their new year's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say you make your resolutions,</v>

320
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.753
<v Speaker 2>the notion there is the death of the old</v>
<v Speaker 2>self and the birth of the new self and </v>

321
00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.230
<v Speaker 2>you see they're still symbols that hang </v>
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>

322
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.113
<v Speaker 2>The culture from from archaic terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the New Year to kind of the old </v>

323
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.030
<v Speaker 2>year who's hobbling along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's killed off to make room for the new</v>

324
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:12.863
<v Speaker 2>year and that's when you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>formulate your resolutions because </v>

325
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:17.720
<v Speaker 2>that's a time when you can scrap your </v>
<v Speaker 2>pastor Vernon,</v>

326
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.830
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and give rise to a new self.</v>

327
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.180
<v Speaker 2>No sorts of those sorts of rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those sorts of ideas are very useful.</v>

328
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.180
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult for people to escape</v>
<v Speaker 2>often from the weight of their past.</v>

329
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.043
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of their accumulative habits</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the way that they construe the world </v>

330
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:36.360
<v Speaker 2>like there's certain utility and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because God you as far as you as you are</v>

331
00:19:36.361 --> 00:19:37.194
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a tremendous amount of </v>

332
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:39.540
<v Speaker 2>weight so I can.</v>

333
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.680
<v Speaker 2>I can remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

334
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.263
<v Speaker 2>I'm from a very small town and the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>about being from a small town perhaps </v>

335
00:19:45.241 --> 00:19:47.640
<v Speaker 2>it's not so much different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The city is that everyone knows you.</v>

336
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:48.853
<v Speaker 2>When everyone knows you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trapped by your social </v>

337
00:19:51.451 --> 00:19:52.284
<v Speaker 2>representations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's very difficult not to stay who </v>

338
00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:56.214
<v Speaker 2>you were because your behavior is always</v>
<v Speaker 2>modified by those around you into a </v>

339
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.270
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can predict.</v>

340
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Even if you want to change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you leave a place like that.</v>

341
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.433
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime you leave anywhere that's the </v>

342
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:07.920
<v Speaker 2>changing of your world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a chance to,</v>

343
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.190
<v Speaker 2>to abandon your old personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop a new one.</v>

344
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.003
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me show you some of these </v>

345
00:20:16.531 --> 00:20:20.070
<v Speaker 2>representations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way you can get a feel,</v>

346
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:23.340
<v Speaker 2>I think for this sort of thing is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else am I thinking about it?</v>

347
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.920
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

348
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>how</v>

349
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:38.190
<v Speaker 2>new year got so far Easter</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Easter shift.</v>

350
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

351
00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:45.390
<v Speaker 2>Well Christmas isn't very far with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>place from the new year and the thing is</v>

352
00:20:45.391 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 2>is that the son is born on the 21st of </v>
<v Speaker 2>December.</v>

353
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.073
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why Christmas Day is so close to </v>

354
00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:54.310
<v Speaker 2>the 21st of December.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because the days start getting longer</v>

355
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:55.144
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess that's part of the answer is </v>

356
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:58.483
<v Speaker 2>that the Christian ceremony of Christ's </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth was assimilated to the rebirth of </v>

357
00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:04.354
<v Speaker 2>the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so kind of occupied that space in the </v>

358
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:07.440
<v Speaker 2>calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the.</v>

359
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 2>That was the first part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

360
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

361
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:11.260
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

362
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.093
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the answer to that </v>

363
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:13.363
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know that's why there are rabbits </v>

364
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 2>and eggs at Easter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

365
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.020
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

366
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

367
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is,</v>

368
00:21:30.851 --> 00:21:33.550
<v Speaker 2>why is why is in eastern in December.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>

369
00:21:33.551 --> 00:21:35.200
<v Speaker 2>why isn't the first day of the year?</v>

370
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

371
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:40.560
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

372
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.570
<v Speaker 2>I knew you could speculate that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>tension between the two dates.</v>

373
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Rabbit's hole when Easter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

374
00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:49.804
<v Speaker 2>they're symbols of rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Takeaway rabbits are symbols of </v>

375
00:21:51.821 --> 00:21:56.800
<v Speaker 2>fertility and ate eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easter bunny.</v>

376
00:21:56.801 --> 00:21:58.660
<v Speaker 2>What do you think these things come from</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere?</v>

377
00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:00.703
<v Speaker 2>The vast unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I just told you like five minutes </v>

378
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:05.200
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we do all sorts of things.</v>

379
00:22:05.201 --> 00:22:08.170
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We act out things we don't understand.</v>

380
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.213
<v Speaker 2>So I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Easter bunny meetings and everyone </v>

381
00:22:10.781 --> 00:22:11.614
<v Speaker 2>laughs because everyone knows about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Easter bunny and no one has a clue what </v>

382
00:22:13.781 --> 00:22:16.990
<v Speaker 2>it means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a perfect example of how these</v>

383
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 2>sort of archaic ideas can continue to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

384
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.830
<v Speaker 2>People are absolutely so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious of the meeting,</v>

385
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.340
<v Speaker 2>which basically means you act them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know what you're doing.</v>

386
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.010
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of something that</v>

387
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:35.703
<v Speaker 2>represents rebirth because it's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of an archetype or an example of </v>

388
00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.510
<v Speaker 2>something that represents me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>

389
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:44.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

390
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a fertility symbol and it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pagan.</v>

391
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.890
<v Speaker 2>It was a pagan symbol of fertility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>as as far as I know,</v>

392
00:22:50.891 --> 00:22:51.724
<v Speaker 2>it just got it just got assimilated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Christian festival of eastern hung </v>

393
00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.410
<v Speaker 2>long hung around long width and so we </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak and the.</v>

394
00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Are they sort to re re chosen as symbols</v>
<v Speaker 2>that chaos that proceeded in division or</v>

395
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:10.853
<v Speaker 2>or or are they ancient temples that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>simply been pretty simple that we have </v>

396
00:23:17.801 --> 00:23:19.150
<v Speaker 2>today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

397
00:23:19.151 --> 00:23:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to show you a bunch of videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know the answer to that.</v>

398
00:23:22.481 --> 00:23:23.314
<v Speaker 2>I think personally I think that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people start thinking about those sorts </v>

399
00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:29.854
<v Speaker 2>of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those symbols naturally come to mind </v>

400
00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.360
<v Speaker 2>regardless of whether they're passed </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

401
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Although they are also passed now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I can't understand why they keep</v>

402
00:23:39.071 --> 00:23:40.570
<v Speaker 2>popping up everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise.</v>

403
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.920
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is this is an argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>that human too.</v>

404
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.960
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

405
00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:46.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbols won't for a long time to listen.</v>

406
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Particularly Apropos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

407
00:23:48.771 --> 00:23:53.600
<v Speaker 2>They happen to match some aid priority </v>
<v Speaker 2>concept in psychology,</v>

408
00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:54.434
<v Speaker 2>academic psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't give much credence to the </v>

409
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:57.830
<v Speaker 2>notion of the archetypes of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective unconscious,</v>

410
00:23:57.831 --> 00:23:59.360
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's observed.</v>

411
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.493
<v Speaker 2>That's because that is because we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably ignorant historically in </v>

412
00:24:03.831 --> 00:24:06.230
<v Speaker 2>psychology here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example.</v>

413
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:07.900
<v Speaker 2>I was reading with and let the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

414
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:08.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the Spaniards came to the new </v>

415
00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:11.800
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were looking for gold for elder out</v>

416
00:24:11.801 --> 00:24:12.920
<v Speaker 2>of the city of gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

417
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:17.000
<v Speaker 2>That's an analog of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're also looking for the fountain of</v>

418
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:17.834
<v Speaker 2>Youth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason that they ended up </v>

419
00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:20.024
<v Speaker 2>going up north on their trips was </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they met abandoned wandering </v>

420
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Indians who were looking for the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

421
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.293
<v Speaker 2>The Indians told them a whole set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories about where this paradise might </v>

422
00:24:29.181 --> 00:24:30.810
<v Speaker 2>make and away they went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

423
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.710
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

424
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:34.330
<v Speaker 2>it's an hour.</v>

425
00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I can give you the reference for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an these book,</v>

426
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.510
<v Speaker 2>the sacred and the profane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

427
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:43.511
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to account for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't account for it by by a while.</v>

428
00:24:43.911 --> 00:24:47.000
<v Speaker 2>You could say both ideas came from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>single source,</v>

429
00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:47.834
<v Speaker 2>some tens of thousands of years previous</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like 17,000 years because I </v>

430
00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:53.324
<v Speaker 2>think between 10 and 17,000 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think that's when the native </v>

431
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Americans crossed the land bridge into </v>
<v Speaker 2>North America,</v>

432
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:59.443
<v Speaker 2>but then you have to explain why those </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas hung around for at least 10,000 </v>

433
00:25:03.051 --> 00:25:03.884
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's a difference between </v>

434
00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:09.731
<v Speaker 2>saying that</v>
<v Speaker 2>or that that determines the shape of our</v>

435
00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:12.770
<v Speaker 2>culture and those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

436
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

437
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I think what happens is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

438
00:25:15.561 --> 00:25:17.720
<v Speaker 2>let's take another take the notion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the snake,</v>

439
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:18.554
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we know that we know that novel </v>

440
00:25:22.371 --> 00:25:23.204
<v Speaker 2>phenomena have the capacity to grip your</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention so then you could say that </v>

441
00:25:27.771 --> 00:25:28.604
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that has the capacity to grip </v>

442
00:25:30.951 --> 00:25:31.784
<v Speaker 2>your intention would be a useful symbol </v>
<v Speaker 2>for novelty and it's certainly the case </v>

443
00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:38.900
<v Speaker 2>that snakes have the capacity to grip </v>
<v Speaker 2>your attention.</v>

444
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.943
<v Speaker 2>So that might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be the process by which the </v>

445
00:25:42.771 --> 00:25:46.730
<v Speaker 2>symbol's not only originally generated </v>
<v Speaker 2>but renewed when it has to be renewed.</v>

446
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:51.210
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you a picture of Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it in the manuscript and anyways,</v>

447
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.193
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is the case that innate like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the domain of the novel always appears </v>

448
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:04.340
<v Speaker 2>to us as simultaneously threatening and </v>
<v Speaker 2>promising with threat having the initial</v>

449
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:06.850
<v Speaker 2>operation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the phenomena is up sufficiently,</v>

450
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.250
<v Speaker 2>have sufficient novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's in board,</v>

451
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.533
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's part of the structure of </v>

452
00:26:12.531 --> 00:26:14.460
<v Speaker 2>our nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our capacity oriented,</v>

453
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.040
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

454
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:19.993
<v Speaker 2>it's also the case that we seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to generate an effect to things </v>

455
00:26:23.241 --> 00:26:26.600
<v Speaker 2>like snakes easier than we can do things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like electric outlet,</v>

456
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:30.680
<v Speaker 2>even though the environmental danger of </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps being reversed,</v>

457
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.830
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's at least a kind of a tendency in</v>

458
00:26:33.831 --> 00:26:34.664
<v Speaker 2>our nervous system to acquire fear to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiders and to bare teeth and to snakes </v>

459
00:26:39.921 --> 00:26:42.470
<v Speaker 2>and to fire easier than other objects.</v>

460
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.303
<v Speaker 2>So perhaps you don't need much of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an underlying biological knowledge to </v>

461
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:52.020
<v Speaker 2>ensure that a certain class of symbols </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly gets regenerated.</v>

462
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.550
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know the not the novel,</v>

463
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:57.503
<v Speaker 2>the domain of the novel has the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>attributes that Rudolf Otto wrote a </v>

464
00:27:01.951 --> 00:27:05.580
<v Speaker 2>seminal book in 1946 called the nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Holy Spirit.</v>

465
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.050
<v Speaker 2>The holy phenomena is newness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a word you coined.</v>

466
00:27:10.051 --> 00:27:10.884
<v Speaker 2>It has two aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fascinating aspect and the terrifying </v>

467
00:27:13.891 --> 00:27:14.730
<v Speaker 2>aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

468
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:18.430
<v Speaker 2>I think he's really relating to he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>describing the same sort of phenomenon,</v>

469
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:19.663
<v Speaker 2>is that we're innately compelled to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Orient and Tan and to consider on </v>

470
00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:26.244
<v Speaker 2>inspiring for that matter any </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently dramatic manifestation of </v>

471
00:27:29.221 --> 00:27:30.054
<v Speaker 2>the novel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the case that it's perfectly </v>

472
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:33.714
<v Speaker 2>reasonable to make the presumption that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is generated as a consequence </v>

473
00:27:38.341 --> 00:27:41.760
<v Speaker 2>of our contact with with anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 2>information because it is.</v>

474
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.810
<v Speaker 2>That is the place where we generate </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that we take for granted,</v>

475
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:46.883
<v Speaker 2>including ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it strikes me that this is a </v>

476
00:27:49.081 --> 00:27:49.914
<v Speaker 2>relatively mythological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it seems to me to be a completely </v>

477
00:27:53.911 --> 00:27:56.520
<v Speaker 2>coherent viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now people say,</v>

478
00:27:56.521 --> 00:27:57.354
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that something's coherent </v>

479
00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make its true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it true,</v>

480
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.850
<v Speaker 2>and that's certainly the case because </v>
<v Speaker 2>paranoid delusions or coherent,</v>

481
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.890
<v Speaker 2>but theoretically they're not true.</v>

482
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Then you have to figure out what do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need in addition to coherency?</v>

483
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.513
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a tougher.</v>

484
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.353
<v Speaker 2>That's a tougher question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you act the story out and your </v>

485
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.583
<v Speaker 2>emotions are arranged in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you find better subjectively than they </v>

486
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:24.324
<v Speaker 2>were before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you say that that would be </v>

487
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:27.750
<v Speaker 2>evidence for the efficiency of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

488
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:32.600
<v Speaker 2>the efficacy of the story for its truth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you just define shoot?</v>

489
00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.373
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just wondering like one of the </v>

490
00:28:36.271 --> 00:28:37.104
<v Speaker 2>things I wondered about constantly when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was teaching my personality class for </v>

491
00:28:39.331 --> 00:28:40.164
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is these constant panoply of different </v>

492
00:28:42.571 --> 00:28:44.730
<v Speaker 2>personality theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all predicated.</v>

493
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:45.853
<v Speaker 2>They have certain elements in common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them being a necessity to face </v>

494
00:28:49.111 --> 00:28:49.944
<v Speaker 2>those bits of your experience that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>really can't comprehend very well to </v>

495
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.053
<v Speaker 2>face novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that's really core to </v>

496
00:28:55.471 --> 00:28:56.304
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they vary a lot and in the clinical </v>

497
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:01.740
<v Speaker 2>literature there's a fair amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence that</v>

498
00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.163
<v Speaker 2>there isn't much difference between one </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic approach and another in </v>

499
00:29:06.721 --> 00:29:08.610
<v Speaker 2>terms of their efficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all pretty good.</v>

500
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.213
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's kind of known for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure is that if you're an eclectic </v>

501
00:29:13.081 --> 00:29:15.120
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapist and you sort of pick and</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose,</v>

502
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.240
<v Speaker 2>you don't do as well as you do if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>committed to one particular law,</v>

503
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:19.860
<v Speaker 2>even though it doesn't matter what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>model is.</v>

504
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.083
<v Speaker 2>So then it struck me that while perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason for this is that if you go </v>

505
00:29:23.761 --> 00:29:25.710
<v Speaker 2>into therapy and have an incoherent </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

506
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.410
<v Speaker 2>which basically means you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what direction to go in,</v>

507
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.393
<v Speaker 2>your goals aren't set very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a good definition of </v>

508
00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:32.274
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means you're emotions are </v>

509
00:29:33.241 --> 00:29:36.180
<v Speaker 2>dysregulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I give you a story that's coherent,</v>

510
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:37.223
<v Speaker 2>that's an improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the fact that it's coherent is an </v>

511
00:29:39.931 --> 00:29:43.500
<v Speaker 2>improvement over your incoherence story </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe there's other the other.</v>

512
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.513
<v Speaker 2>Then the next thing to do what he does </v>
<v Speaker 2>specify what else you need from a story </v>

513
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 2>other than coherence.</v>

514
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.103
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm trying to do with this </v>

515
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:51.664
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm wondering is like we would </v>

516
00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:54.844
<v Speaker 2>say that therapy is effective when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>client says I'm better and when the or </v>

517
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:02.860
<v Speaker 2>when the therapist says you're better or</v>
<v Speaker 2>when both due or when.</v>

518
00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Some other people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is it's still,</v>

519
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.670
<v Speaker 2>it's still based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

520
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:08.523
<v Speaker 2>when a client says I'm better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually what they mean is I'm not going </v>

521
00:30:11.681 --> 00:30:13.870
<v Speaker 2>to commit suicide now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to have depressed.</v>

522
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:15.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may be somewhat anxious,</v>

523
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:19.180
<v Speaker 2>but I think I can handle it or and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>nowhere near as anxious as I used to be.</v>

524
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.670
<v Speaker 2>So negative emotion has been brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>under control.</v>

525
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm hopeful about the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

526
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:26.710
<v Speaker 2>and I can see that life might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfied.</v>

527
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:27.993
<v Speaker 2>That means their emotions of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulated and that's what a coherent </v>

528
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:30.904
<v Speaker 2>story does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since stories are about patterns of </v>

529
00:30:33.671 --> 00:30:36.550
<v Speaker 2>action that are adaptive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that make well,</v>

530
00:30:36.551 --> 00:30:37.384
<v Speaker 2>that makes a certain amount of sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>because when we're acting on the </v>

531
00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:39.994
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're trying to do is to transform </v>

532
00:30:41.891 --> 00:30:45.040
<v Speaker 2>it into a place where our emotions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimally balanced,</v>

533
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.040
<v Speaker 2>where we're not subjected to pain or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>

534
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.173
<v Speaker 2>where we have hope for the future and </v>
<v Speaker 2>with how we view life is satisfied in </v>

535
00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:55.040
<v Speaker 2>addition to being coherent.</v>

536
00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Story should also be relatively stable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

537
00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:03.220
<v Speaker 2>it has to have two aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be stable,</v>

538
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:04.383
<v Speaker 2>but it also has the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to have the capacity to update </v>

539
00:31:06.011 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Speaker 2>itself with stability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

540
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:08.733
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the best story is a story about how </v>

541
00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:13.210
<v Speaker 2>the update stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that's necessary,</v>

542
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.710
<v Speaker 2>and that's the story that hero and wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

543
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.770
<v Speaker 2>clients</v>
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>

544
00:31:22.771 --> 00:31:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't suggest that.</v>

545
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:26.023
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say actually the to the degree </v>

546
00:31:27.161 --> 00:31:31.750
<v Speaker 2>that a therapy is effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it acts that out because for example,</v>

547
00:31:31.751 --> 00:31:35.530
<v Speaker 2>in one of the most effective behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy techniques is exposure,</v>

548
00:31:35.531 --> 00:31:36.364
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's what exposure is supposed to </v>

549
00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:40.990
<v Speaker 2>do is is producing situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is wrong.</v>

550
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.400
<v Speaker 2>That isn't what exposure does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you like.</v>

551
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.450
<v Speaker 2>If someone's afraid of getting into an </v>
<v Speaker 2>elevator,</v>

552
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:47.703
<v Speaker 2>what you do is teach them behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategies to transform and elevate it </v>

553
00:31:51.831 --> 00:31:53.050
<v Speaker 2>into something that's positive.</v>

554
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.153
<v Speaker 2>It looks like habituation because </v>
<v Speaker 2>because mostly what they do is model </v>

555
00:31:57.791 --> 00:32:00.370
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's still what you do it like you</v>

556
00:32:00.371 --> 00:32:03.460
<v Speaker 2>don't have to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even habituate to the unknown.</v>

557
00:32:03.461 --> 00:32:05.240
<v Speaker 2>What you do is explore it and classify </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

558
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.980
<v Speaker 2>It's just that our experiment procedures</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been really poorly constraint.</v>

559
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.540
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're trivial to fight.</v>

560
00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:16.330
<v Speaker 2>If you're in the lab and I pay you 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>tones that are the same,</v>

561
00:32:16.331 --> 00:32:17.164
<v Speaker 2>and then the nonvolatile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll orient to that and if I keep </v>

562
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:23.440
<v Speaker 2>playing it over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're orienting response to go away and</v>

563
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:24.221
<v Speaker 2>then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

564
00:32:24.221 --> 00:32:26.200
<v Speaker 2>you've habituated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

565
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.183
<v Speaker 2>What you've done is classify that tone </v>
<v Speaker 2>as meaningless through exploration of </v>

566
00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:32.074
<v Speaker 2>its properties and you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting there so your exploration is </v>

567
00:32:34.241 --> 00:32:36.310
<v Speaker 2>really constrained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's still what you're doing.</v>

568
00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:39.243
<v Speaker 2>So I would say like an answer to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>question is to the degree that a </v>

569
00:32:41.901 --> 00:32:46.901
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic doctrine is implicitly or </v>
<v Speaker 2>explicitly modeled on this story,</v>

570
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.140
<v Speaker 2>it works to the degree that it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

571
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:52.483
<v Speaker 2>We know like what are the major factors </v>
<v Speaker 2>in promoting therapeutic improvement is </v>

572
00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.520
<v Speaker 2>exposure to threatening or an almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

573
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:07.100
<v Speaker 2>So Freud thought something terrible has </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to you in the past.</v>

574
00:33:07.101 --> 00:33:08.150
<v Speaker 2>That's trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

575
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.550
<v Speaker 2>So that's an event that you can't make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of for,</v>

576
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to define trauma,</v>

577
00:33:12.951 --> 00:33:13.784
<v Speaker 2>but we'll just leave it at that for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud originally thought that all you </v>

578
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:18.740
<v Speaker 2>have to do is bring that traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience up into consciousness.</v>

579
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.633
<v Speaker 2>That was catharsis cured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he knew by the end of his life that </v>

580
00:33:22.481 --> 00:33:24.650
<v Speaker 2>that didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Behavior therapists have said,</v>

581
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:24.981
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

582
00:33:24.981 --> 00:33:28.070
<v Speaker 2>You have to warn them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to adjust someone's actions.</v>

583
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's the things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If what a therapist,</v>

584
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:32.423
<v Speaker 2>a therapeutic system does is expose you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to enormous or threatening information </v>

585
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.243
<v Speaker 2>and make you readjust your behavior as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence to the degree that you did </v>

586
00:33:39.971 --> 00:33:40.970
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're cured.</v>

587
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.020
<v Speaker 2>If you won't do it here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

588
00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:46.863
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand how situation isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you just described as exploring it </v>

589
00:33:51.741 --> 00:33:53.230
<v Speaker 2>and getting used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

590
00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.430
<v Speaker 2>habits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well habituation usually means something</v>

591
00:33:55.431 --> 00:33:56.264
<v Speaker 2>like getting used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time when you </v>

592
00:33:57.651 --> 00:33:58.484
<v Speaker 2>encountered like you don't just </v>
<v Speaker 2>habituate to a normalist or threatening </v>

593
00:34:01.311 --> 00:34:02.144
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're getting pounded flat everyday </v>

594
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.650
<v Speaker 2>you go to school saying you're a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did not habituate to that.</v>

595
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.290
<v Speaker 2>The only way that you can get used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

596
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:13.980
<v Speaker 2>so to speak is to alter your behaviors </v>
<v Speaker 2>or your scheme of representation so that</v>

597
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.060
<v Speaker 2>bullying is no longer pounding on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means you might have to.</v>

598
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you have to do?</v>

599
00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:19.423
<v Speaker 2>Take karate lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weightlift get a new group of tougher </v>

600
00:34:22.251 --> 00:34:23.900
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring a knife to school,</v>

601
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.793
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but until you transformed the source of </v>

602
00:34:26.811 --> 00:34:28.960
<v Speaker 2>the threat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what?</v>

603
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:31.010
<v Speaker 2>You're not going habitually because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get used to it.</v>

604
00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.350
<v Speaker 2>You'd like to turn it into something </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>

605
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:35.470
<v Speaker 2>but certainly turn into something </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

606
00:34:35.471 --> 00:34:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Could you could turn into something </v>
<v Speaker 2>neutral.</v>

607
00:34:36.801 --> 00:34:39.140
<v Speaker 2>And if you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it stays negative.</v>

608
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neutral is not so bad,</v>

609
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:45.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as good as positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're really successful,</v>

610
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.153
<v Speaker 2>it's when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's one thing to chase the dragon </v>

611
00:34:47.421 --> 00:34:49.370
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's another thing to give the gold.</v>

612
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:50.523
<v Speaker 2>If you're really successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the goal of chasing the dragon </v>

613
00:34:52.971 --> 00:34:54.200
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not so bad.</v>

614
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:56.060
<v Speaker 2>That's usually what we do.</v>

615
00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:02.540
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>patients with dreams where patient</v>

616
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.920
<v Speaker 1>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patient dream,</v>

617
00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be the patient</v>

618
00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.113
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was his interpretation of </v>

619
00:35:20.401 --> 00:35:21.234
<v Speaker 2>transference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said because he thought that he thought </v>

620
00:35:23.581 --> 00:35:27.270
<v Speaker 2>in fact the therapy was the ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first,</v>

621
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.550
<v Speaker 2>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

622
00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.330
<v Speaker 2>he thought that what therapy did was </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically initiate</v>

623
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.293
<v Speaker 2>a sequence of activities that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically predicated and that our </v>

624
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:45.310
<v Speaker 2>capacity to hero worship was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that lead our,</v>

625
00:35:45.311 --> 00:35:47.670
<v Speaker 2>an outpatient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think you think about this,</v>

626
00:35:47.671 --> 00:35:48.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

627
00:35:48.061 --> 00:35:49.710
<v Speaker 2>the children will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will hear a worship,</v>

628
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.710
<v Speaker 2>they'll imitate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imitate their parents,</v>

629
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 2>or they'll pick us child who's slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>older and act them out,</v>

630
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.530
<v Speaker 2>literally follow them around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>duplicate their actions.</v>

631
00:35:58.770 --> 00:35:59.603
<v Speaker 2>Say they their capacity for all drives </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ability to move behavioral </v>

632
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:06.414
<v Speaker 2>information from one place to another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you just thought he reactivated that </v>

633
00:36:09.331 --> 00:36:13.830
<v Speaker 2>in therapy so that the person would </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard the therapist as well.</v>

634
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.080
<v Speaker 2>For all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

635
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.230
<v Speaker 2>that was all right in a sense because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

636
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.273
<v Speaker 2>it provided some emotional dynamism to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the therapy going forward in the </v>

637
00:36:24.781 --> 00:36:26.820
<v Speaker 2>face of the tremendous amount of threat.</v>

638
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:27.683
<v Speaker 2>Because you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need something that you didn't </v>

639
00:36:31.351 --> 00:36:35.070
<v Speaker 2>already have to overcome the threats </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you couldn't cope with before.</v>

640
00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:37.410
<v Speaker 2>And then you would presume that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

641
00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.253
<v Speaker 2>once he died in the dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that meant that the thing that the </v>

642
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:45.360
<v Speaker 2>therapist thought he was had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

643
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.033
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the person so the person knew what </v>

644
00:36:48.781 --> 00:36:51.080
<v Speaker 2>they had put out there was actually an </v>
<v Speaker 2>attribute themselves,</v>

645
00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.810
<v Speaker 2>but know them personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of humanity in general,</v>

646
00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:00.080
<v Speaker 2>when he's in front of a therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>provides a story and the therapist would</v>

647
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.333
<v Speaker 2>be story in there for the king and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing process would result in the </v>

648
00:37:06.271 --> 00:37:07.104
<v Speaker 2>death of the king as being the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crush story followed by the </v>

649
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:15.460
<v Speaker 2>possibility of taking on the role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crunch store.</v>

650
00:37:15.461 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 2>You mean to get to get you through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story just provides.</v>

651
00:37:18.511 --> 00:37:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So initially,</v>

652
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.090
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

653
00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:21.924
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's so the dreams is a </v>

654

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

657
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to.</v>

658
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to show you some images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better to show this in images.</v>

<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

<v Speaker 2>feminine,</v>

663
00:37:44.071 --> 00:37:45.690
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Green Tara from that.</v>

664
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.310
<v Speaker 2>This is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

665
00:37:47.311 --> 00:37:49.680
<v Speaker 2>That's not very focused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a Mandela.</v>

666
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.400
<v Speaker 2>You have to take my word for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seeing from the side instead of from the</v>

667
00:37:53.401 --> 00:37:55.350
<v Speaker 2>top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually go to Mandela is.</v>

668
00:37:55.351 --> 00:37:56.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a square that has a circle </v>
<v Speaker 2>inscribed.</v>

669
00:37:56.971 --> 00:37:59.360
<v Speaker 2>It's divided into four parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them in wallpaper and on.</v>

670
00:37:59.361 --> 00:38:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Unranked isn't all over the place </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

671
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.370
<v Speaker 2>This is one that if you look from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top,</v>

672
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.250
<v Speaker 2>it would be a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can see the square here,</v>

673
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.163
<v Speaker 2>circle there.</v>

674
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Tara.</v>

675
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.730
<v Speaker 2>She's a positive image of the feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's in this thing of in here.</v>

676
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.730
<v Speaker 2>That's trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

677
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.033
<v Speaker 2>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that's interesting about that </v>

678
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:23.720
<v Speaker 2>is that there's a whole creation myth </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this little in this little lot,</v>

679
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.700
<v Speaker 2>this little statue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a turtle.</v>

680
00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.540
<v Speaker 2>The turtle on which there are threats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Out of that comes these two dragons.</v>

681
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.473
<v Speaker 2>We should know a little bit about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to see how that </v>

682
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.210
<v Speaker 2>relates to creation mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

683
00:38:37.211 --> 00:38:38.044
<v Speaker 2>she pops out at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's an image of higher consciousness </v>

684
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:43.480
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

685
00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:46.320
<v Speaker 2>the thing or what did he keep in mind is</v>
<v Speaker 2>keys to certain to certain,</v>

686
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.223
<v Speaker 2>like things that accompany your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you some Disney </v>

687
00:38:49.511 --> 00:38:50.370
<v Speaker 2>animation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

688
00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:55.120
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm Mrs Partly Dancer for to address</v>
<v Speaker 2>your question in part.</v>

689
00:38:55.121 --> 00:38:56.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

690
00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.800
<v Speaker 2>did these images pop up or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmitted?</v>

691
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a clue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll show you some of them.</v>

692
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.010
<v Speaker 2>This is a really funny one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is from the rescuers.</v>

693
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:09.773
<v Speaker 2>This horrible female gets this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl out of the orphanage and she wants </v>

694
00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:15.904
<v Speaker 2>to lower down a well and in the whale </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's diamond in a skull which has no </v>

695
00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:25.891
<v Speaker 2>chemical image by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She lives in a swamp in a row boat.</v>

696
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:29.223
<v Speaker 2>The swamp is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a favorite place for creatures </v>

697
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:32.854
<v Speaker 2>of the night in fairy tales and myths </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's because the swamp is a place </v>

698
00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:38.570
<v Speaker 2>where death is transformed into life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Straight.</v>

699
00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Swamp is eerie because things are dying </v>
<v Speaker 2>rocking here all the time,</v>

700
00:39:41.621 --> 00:39:43.690
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a place where there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of action.</v>

701
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.540
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's in the swamp.</v>

702
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:49.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to show you a very short brief</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this.</v>

703
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.380
<v Speaker 2>This is more comical than anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

704
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:09.260
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these little avenues.</v>

705
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where the horrible.</v>

706
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:27.570
<v Speaker 3>If you would try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me my KDP or</v>

707
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:39.060
<v Speaker 3>teddy goes with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those were her values.</v>

708
00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:45.580
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just do your whole list</v>

709
00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:01.620
<v Speaker 3>on the steering wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No hurry.</v>

710
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Girls and boys that have a real life</v>
<v Speaker 3>character with this creature</v>

711
00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.653
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>

712
00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:36.120
<v Speaker 2>and so she plays the role to here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

713
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.170
<v Speaker 2>which basically means when a human being</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in its infancy,</v>

714
00:43:40.171 --> 00:43:41.620
<v Speaker 2>he has her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her infancy there,</v>

715
00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.910
<v Speaker 2>obviously very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very vulnerable to all sorts of external</v>

716
00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.470
<v Speaker 2>forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

717
00:43:46.471 --> 00:43:48.570
<v Speaker 2>that's basically all that's making </v>
<v Speaker 2>reference to.</v>

718
00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.060
<v Speaker 2>You see this pop up in all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird ways.</v>

719
00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Superman in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The comment,</v>

720
00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.720
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that became very,</v>

721
00:43:54.721 --> 00:43:59.721
<v Speaker 2>very popular during the depression and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Superman's birth was endangered,</v>

722
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His planet was going to blow up and uh,</v>

723
00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:06.090
<v Speaker 2>he crashed earth and have two sets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents as well.</v>

724
00:44:06.091 --> 00:44:09.250
<v Speaker 2>He has the cans who has normal parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>and jewelry.</v>

725
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.093
<v Speaker 2>Hell and all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are his celestial parents and he's </v>

726
00:44:12.931 --> 00:44:13.411
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

727
00:44:13.411 --> 00:44:16.400
<v Speaker 2>he's a hero obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy,</v>

728
00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:17.923
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the story of Orphan Annie </v>

729
00:44:20.461 --> 00:44:22.830
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has.</v>

730
00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.600
<v Speaker 2>She's an from the dingy as daddy </v>
<v Speaker 2>warbucks.</v>

731
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:25.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

732
00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.430
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

733
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.440
<v Speaker 2>That's very typical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty typical.</v>

734
00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 2>So that's making reference to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents by the way,</v>

735
00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:34.950
<v Speaker 2>and the divine parents from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological perspective,</v>

736
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 2>our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the masculine domain in nature.</v>

737
00:44:38.491 --> 00:44:42.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the feminine domain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You could say the predictable hip and</v>

738
00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.320
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those.</v>

739
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.273
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two things that give birth</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the hero and the hero is the symbol </v>

740
00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:51.950
<v Speaker 2>of wealth is one of the symbols of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual human being.</v>

741
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.940
<v Speaker 2>The fight over the teddy bear seemed </v>
<v Speaker 2>like with the diamond inside seemed like</v>

742
00:44:56.941 --> 00:45:01.650
<v Speaker 2>the sun bug or a newman talks about in </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

743
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I getting too far gone?</v>

744
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:04.901
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

745
00:45:04.901 --> 00:45:05.550
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

746
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.530
<v Speaker 2>I didn't pay much attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jewel.</v>

747
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:08.543
<v Speaker 2>The jewel plays a big role in here </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the jewels in the little teddy </v>

748
00:45:10.381 --> 00:45:13.320
<v Speaker 2>bear that's hers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fight over that.</v>

749
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

750
00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:15.363
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny because you see the girl </v>

751
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:17.964
<v Speaker 2>winds who.</v>

752
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Let me see if I can remember the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

753
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

754
00:45:24.031 --> 00:45:26.340
<v Speaker 2>the girl has to go into a dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well to get this diamond,</v>

755
00:45:26.341 --> 00:45:27.174
<v Speaker 2>it's inside the skull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she has to recover fears to get it </v>

756
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:31.710
<v Speaker 2>and she's getting it for this horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

757
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:32.544
<v Speaker 2>Now the woman has the diamond confused </v>
<v Speaker 2>with what it represents and that's why </v>

758
00:45:35.041 --> 00:45:35.874
<v Speaker 2>she's after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a parable about materialism </v>

759
00:45:37.681 --> 00:45:40.620
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when you get the diamond confused</v>

760
00:45:40.621 --> 00:45:41.454
<v Speaker 2>with what it represents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The little girl actually wins the </v>

761
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:44.550
<v Speaker 2>diamond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

762
00:45:44.551 --> 00:45:47.430
<v Speaker 2>because she overcomes the great mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>and at the end of the second,</v>

763
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:49.470
<v Speaker 2>of course the story that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>because she's a hero.</v>

764
00:45:49.471 --> 00:45:52.470
<v Speaker 2>She does end up with a family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's turned into a real person.</v>

765
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.560
<v Speaker 2>That's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's basically the moral of the story.</v>

766
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:57.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on that note,</v>

767
00:45:57.541 --> 00:45:58.620
<v Speaker 2>let me show you this one.</v>

768
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Pinocchio.</v>

769
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.330
<v Speaker 2>And Nokia is a hero myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

770
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.513
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has all the elements of the hero </v>

771
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:07.314
<v Speaker 2>myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Nokia was not real at the beginning </v>

772
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 2>of the story is made out of what will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blue fairy comes down and says,</v>

773
00:46:10.981 --> 00:46:12.570
<v Speaker 2>if you're good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're good,</v>

774
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.730
<v Speaker 2>you can become a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real boy.</v>

775
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:16.103
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then he goes on a series of </v>

776
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:21.740
<v Speaker 2>adventures and the adventures culminate </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this scene and he,</v>

777
00:46:21.741 --> 00:46:25.060
<v Speaker 2>he's accompanied by this cricket given </v>
<v Speaker 2>crickets.</v>

778
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's his conscience.</v>

779
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.370
<v Speaker 2>He plays the same role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

780
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:30.223
<v Speaker 2>this little cartoon face scenes you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's an angel on one shoulder </v>

781
00:46:32.371 --> 00:46:33.540
<v Speaker 2>and a devil on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

782
00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:37.230
<v Speaker 2>Jimminy cricket is the angelic aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience and I've always,</v>

783
00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:38.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

784
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know this and this is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that popped into my,</v>

785
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:41.843
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

786
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:43.463
<v Speaker 2>my imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his initials are jc and I don't </v>

787
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:49.440
<v Speaker 2>think that's a flute</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

788
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:52.531
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

789
00:46:52.531 --> 00:46:53.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's fallen in with bad company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

791
00:46:55.081 --> 00:46:55.914
<v Speaker 1>On his adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's out in the world and it's just </v>

792
00:47:00.061 --> 00:47:00.894
<v Speaker 1>checking.</v>

793
00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:16.721
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

794
00:47:16.721 --> 00:47:21.720
<v Speaker 2>you get the picture there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where he's almost identical story</v>

795
00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:26.530
<v Speaker 2>of the horse and the cirrus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why that's the case.</v>

796
00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the history of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular story.</v>

797
00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you just a couple of</v>

798
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.440
<v Speaker 2>overheads here.</v>

799
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:44.043
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

800
00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.940
<v Speaker 4>Just one other comment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the edited version,</v>

801
00:47:47.941 --> 00:47:51.180
<v Speaker 4>the 19 eighties version,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the original Disney version.</v>

802
00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.910
<v Speaker 4>When they were inside the belly of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beast,</v>

803
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.790
<v Speaker 4>they they decided they were going to eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fish,</v>

804
00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.080
<v Speaker 4>the little fish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cleo,</v>

805
00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.720
<v Speaker 4>to stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was edited out.</v>

806
00:48:00.721 --> 00:48:03.570
<v Speaker 4>That might have some sacrificial.</v>

807
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:04.771
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

808
00:48:04.771 --> 00:48:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

809
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:15.330
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting image that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant</v>

810
00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:24.520
<v Speaker 2>in the jaws of hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so detail,</v>

811
00:48:24.521 --> 00:48:29.521
<v Speaker 2>but wouldn't acquire stolen friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

812
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:37.260
<v Speaker 2>so that's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Relevant image,</v>

813
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:43.750
<v Speaker 2>these</v>
<v Speaker 2>images.</v>

814
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Sixth Century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the cauldron of transformation by</v>

815
00:48:50.071 --> 00:48:53.970
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the blue angel therapy and that was</v>

816
00:48:53.971 --> 00:48:56.610
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a symbol of the positive aspect of</v>

817
00:48:56.611 --> 00:48:58.970
<v Speaker 2>the feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No positive aspect of novelty.</v>

818
00:48:58.980 --> 00:48:59.813
<v Speaker 2>Basically it was released as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of his voluntary represents </v>

819
00:49:04.081 --> 00:49:04.914
<v Speaker 2>the dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember Marta curves the world of </v>

820
00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:08.700
<v Speaker 2>timeout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Timeouts.</v>

821
00:49:08.701 --> 00:49:10.740
<v Speaker 2>This dragon that lives at the bottom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean.</v>

822
00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Same thing happens in the Hebrew Bible </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it's varied.</v>

823
00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.010
<v Speaker 2>It refers to a much more archaic </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition.</v>

824
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:18.103
<v Speaker 2>You have a three makes the world out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it as a consequence of dabbled with the </v>

825
00:49:21.151 --> 00:49:24.510
<v Speaker 2>monster that's variously known as ray </v>
<v Speaker 2>habit and Leviathan.</v>

826
00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:29.550
<v Speaker 2>How if I have the hair of this section </v>
<v Speaker 2>is written down,</v>

827
00:49:29.551 --> 00:49:30.384
<v Speaker 2>but my computer crashed today and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't bring them in so I can get you </v>

828
00:49:33.391 --> 00:49:37.500
<v Speaker 2>the references if you want for </v>
<v Speaker 2>references and various places</v>

829
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:42.870
<v Speaker 2>in the old testament while there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly in the old testament.</v>

830
00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the case.</v>

831
00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:50.100
<v Speaker 2>This is interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is when Jehovah threatens to lay various</v>

832
00:49:50.101 --> 00:49:51.210
<v Speaker 2>territories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waste,</v>

833
00:49:51.211 --> 00:49:53.670
<v Speaker 2>which he does with certain mode of </v>
<v Speaker 2>regularity,</v>

834
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.833
<v Speaker 2>he always describes the territory that </v>
<v Speaker 2>will remain after everything's </v>

835
00:49:57.121 --> 00:50:00.000
<v Speaker 2>devastated as fit habitation for </v>
<v Speaker 2>serpents.</v>

836
00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.653
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts the story of the reduction of </v>

837
00:50:03.641 --> 00:50:08.280
<v Speaker 2>the order flakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chaos and chaos is the place that's fit,</v>

838
00:50:08.281 --> 00:50:12.540
<v Speaker 2>habitation for surface and anything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives there is assimilated to a circle.</v>

839
00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:17.400
<v Speaker 2>So I'll get you the quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I collected them all last two weeks ago.</v>

840
00:50:17.401 --> 00:50:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the King James Bible on CD role,</v>

841
00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.383
<v Speaker 2>which is really useful because you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>put in whatever your word is and it </v>

842
00:50:24.541 --> 00:50:26.730
<v Speaker 2>gives you every single reference to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole text,</v>

843
00:50:26.731 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 2>so there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

844
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:30.223
<v Speaker 2>he collected a whole sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>references from various cultures that </v>

845
00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:38.660
<v Speaker 2>will bring them in and show you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is an interest in</v>

846
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:46.930
<v Speaker 2>reverification of the sacrifice ram</v>

847
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:56.070
<v Speaker 2>baptism imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was what Pinocchio,</v>

848
00:50:56.071 --> 00:50:57.660
<v Speaker 2>just on your way and the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can say,</v>

849
00:50:57.661 --> 00:51:00.630
<v Speaker 2>well back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The baptism rituals we have now,</v>

850
00:51:00.631 --> 00:51:02.670
<v Speaker 2>which are pretty trivial Christian ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

851
00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.513
<v Speaker 2>a pretty jovial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in some some sex in the southern us </v>

852
00:51:07.291 --> 00:51:10.170
<v Speaker 2>in particular dip people completely into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intuit river,</v>

853
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:13.950
<v Speaker 2>signifying your second birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally just sprinkled with water,</v>

854
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:15.263
<v Speaker 2>but what that is is a very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a remnant from a ritual that was </v>

855
00:51:20.221 --> 00:51:21.054
<v Speaker 2>much harder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more dramatic that his finger went </v>

856
00:51:24.901 --> 00:51:27.780
<v Speaker 2>through in the Disney cartoon by two </v>
<v Speaker 2>year old son.</v>

857
00:51:27.781 --> 00:51:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Watched that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

858
00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:29.493
<v Speaker 2>he was quite impressed with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll be talking about that for a good </v>

859
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:34.343
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started out about a month and a half </v>

860
00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:39.900
<v Speaker 2>ago and he still talks about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll set the bottom of the ocean.</v>

861
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:45.190
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can remember too from from bio,</v>

862
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.810
<v Speaker 2>he chose the image of the inside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whale.</v>

863
00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:52.230
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like a cathedral that stuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me,</v>

864
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:53.880
<v Speaker 2>if I can remember that when I watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

865
00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:59.090
<v Speaker 2>So that's the second rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's voluntary.</v>

866
00:51:59.091 --> 00:52:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the reason that Nokia was turning</v>

867
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:01.784
<v Speaker 2>into a boy when you hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was well on his way to becoming </v>

868
00:52:04.891 --> 00:52:07.410
<v Speaker 2>a jackass was because he decided </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily,</v>

869
00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.290
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to jump into the ocean and the ocean.</v>

870
00:52:10.291 --> 00:52:13.860
<v Speaker 2>That's another symbol of the chaos that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of precedes creation.</v>

871
00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.680
<v Speaker 2>He is a great symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is where life came from.</v>

872
00:52:16.681 --> 00:52:19.170
<v Speaker 2>After all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's one from Peru,</v>

873
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.753
<v Speaker 2>dragon fight heroes there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the dragons got fish like </v>

874
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:29.030
<v Speaker 2>features here as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human Nature.</v>

875
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The respirators.</v>

876
00:52:40.061 --> 00:52:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Why did they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why were,</v>

877
00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.800
<v Speaker 2>why were there two alligators?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also the,</v>

878
00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:44.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

879
00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:47.970
<v Speaker 2>reference to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to is,</v>

880
00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.013
<v Speaker 2>is the reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a reference to the world parents </v>

881
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:54.640
<v Speaker 2>set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The serpent separates into two things,</v>

882
00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:57.310
<v Speaker 2>order in chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't exactly.</v>

883
00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.160
<v Speaker 2>That's about the best I can give to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

884
00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:01.083
<v Speaker 2>The negative mother often appears </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with a serpent time for mass </v>

885
00:53:06.101 --> 00:53:07.810
<v Speaker 2>because as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell,</v>

886
00:53:07.811 --> 00:53:10.990
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to puzzle this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because the.</v>

887
00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:12.753
<v Speaker 2>It's not that easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy to distinguish the chaos that </v>

888
00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:18.880
<v Speaker 2>existed opposition from order to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos that proceeds over the division of</v>

889
00:53:18.881 --> 00:53:21.220
<v Speaker 2>order and chaos again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get mixed together.</v>

890
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

891
00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:23.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great.</v>

892
00:53:23.271 --> 00:53:24.104
<v Speaker 2>That's a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great picture on the night </v>

893
00:53:27.511 --> 00:53:28.344
<v Speaker 2>scene journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's assimilated to the sun because </v>

894
00:53:30.181 --> 00:53:32.810
<v Speaker 2>it's the son that goes through the night</v>
<v Speaker 2>seizure every office.</v>

895
00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:34.080
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the myth of system.</v>

896
00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:34.933
<v Speaker 2>This is all being assimilated to the sun</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you remember that diagram I showed </v>

897
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:39.384
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things descending into chaos and then </v>

898
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.670
<v Speaker 2>being reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

899
00:53:41.671 --> 00:53:43.980
<v Speaker 2>that's a solar imagery as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

900
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.530
<v Speaker 2>this is a great emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

901
00:53:46.531 --> 00:53:48.450
<v Speaker 2>so he's out there in the night in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>cauldron.</v>

902
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:52.790
<v Speaker 2>He's wearing the skin of a line or lines</v>
<v Speaker 2>of solar beast for all these reasons.</v>

903
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.600
<v Speaker 2>It's yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in Africa called or study.</v>

904
00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:00.900
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of upstarting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>typical masculine characteristics.</v>

905
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:01.734
<v Speaker 2>Even though it turns out that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>female lines to actually do most of the </v>

906
00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:06.990
<v Speaker 2>other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in reality,</v>

907
00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:08.550
<v Speaker 2>he's carrying a club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

908
00:54:08.551 --> 00:54:10.660
<v Speaker 2>That's his weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His eyes were very wide open.</v>

909
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:11.543
<v Speaker 2>He's conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fully coded signals was doing see the </v>

910
00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.970
<v Speaker 2>club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things on the club.</v>

911
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.863
<v Speaker 2>Those are our eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's more for symbolism of </v>

912
00:54:20.821 --> 00:54:25.170
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's up to defeat the monster that it</v>

913
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.033
<v Speaker 2>inhabits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unexplored territory territory before </v>

914
00:54:27.841 --> 00:54:31.770
<v Speaker 2>it's being transformed into the place </v>
<v Speaker 2>where real human beings can live.</v>

915
00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:34.530
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

916
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.230
<v Speaker 2>let me show you some others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we looked at the rescuers,</v>

917
00:54:37.231 --> 00:54:39.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

918
00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:49.350
<v Speaker 2>But then he rides from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was from Australia,</v>

919
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:52.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives kind of scary.</v>

920
00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:55.200
<v Speaker 2>So by that time it's more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable.</v>

921
00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:58.890
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tries to give it away so it's funny.</v>

922
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:01.080
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what to make of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

923
00:55:01.081 --> 00:55:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Accepted by that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too late to turn back.</v>

924
00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:04.973
<v Speaker 2>It's funny too because his conscience is</v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less warning them against the </v>

925
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Jenny Craig is warning them against </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>

926
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:15.030
<v Speaker 2>but it also helps them tie the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a real cute touch.</v>

927
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:17.530
<v Speaker 2>So let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have,</v>

928
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:18.683
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

929
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:22.643
<v Speaker 2>well maybe we'll do this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of you have seen the sleeping </v>

930
00:55:25.201 --> 00:55:26.250
<v Speaker 2>beauty clip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used it,</v>

931
00:55:26.251 --> 00:55:29.090
<v Speaker 2>my personality class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll do the little mermaid instead.</v>

932
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.310
<v Speaker 2>So you can see the assimilation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminine character.</v>

933
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:37.333
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

934
00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Ariel wants to become a real human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

935
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Same sort of same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's also a like to to surface.</v>

936
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:54.700
<v Speaker 2>They're not hurt their personally</v>
<v Speaker 2>eels.</v>

937
00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Look at the structure she goes into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very interesting.</v>

938
00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:03.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a portal portal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagery defines the border between chaos</v>

939
00:56:03.721 --> 00:56:04.554
<v Speaker 2>and order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another reason why the feminine </v>

940
00:56:06.091 --> 00:56:10.980
<v Speaker 2>is often used to symbolize the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the female is the border between</v>

941
00:56:10.981 --> 00:56:13.590
<v Speaker 2>the place that creation takes place and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the real world.</v>

942
00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:16.500
<v Speaker 2>That's the most fundamental reason of </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroes.</v>

943
00:56:16.501 --> 00:56:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Often climate in the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the value of the feminine,</v>

944
00:56:20.081 --> 00:56:21.240
<v Speaker 2>the Feminine Needs.</v>

945
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

946
00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.280
<v Speaker 2>those are soils that the negative mother</v>
<v Speaker 2>was gone.</v>

947
00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be in social personality</v>

948
00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:50.933
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>

949
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:54.143
<v Speaker 2>The same thing happen to them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to the boys that were turned </v>

950
00:56:55.961 --> 00:57:00.961
<v Speaker 2>into donkey says</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've made errors.</v>

951
00:57:01.291 --> 00:57:02.200
<v Speaker 2>These choices</v>

952
00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:10.670
<v Speaker 1>is the fitting room.</v>

953
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.823
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna stop this for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of our students last year asked me </v>

954
00:57:14.561 --> 00:57:15.394
<v Speaker 2>why ask me some questions about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative feminine new images and why </v>

955
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:24.140
<v Speaker 2>they were often sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in Disney movies then occurs.</v>

956
00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:26.430
<v Speaker 2>They're very concerned with beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example though,</v>

957
00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.090
<v Speaker 2>she's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's kind of grotesque,</v>

958
00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 2>but figure out a snow white's mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sleeping,</v>

959
00:57:32.951 --> 00:57:33.784
<v Speaker 2>but they're usually older child the </v>
<v Speaker 2>swimming and I read that as a symbol of </v>

960
00:57:38.531 --> 00:57:42.490
<v Speaker 2>the sacrifice of the child to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintenance of youthful.</v>

961
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:46.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what childless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what child listens.</v>

962
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Representative needs in these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

963
00:57:50.111 --> 00:57:50.944
<v Speaker 2>Snow White's mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very concerned that she's the most </v>

964
00:57:52.541 --> 00:57:54.580
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the stepmother.</v>

965
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.500
<v Speaker 2>She's never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's never.</v>

966
00:57:57.370 --> 00:57:59.920
<v Speaker 2>She's never had children and the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that myth dot reeves,</v>

967
00:57:59.921 --> 00:58:00.754
<v Speaker 2>that basically as far as I can tell us </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's equivalent to the devouring </v>

968
00:58:04.121 --> 00:58:06.660
<v Speaker 2>of children who sacrifice of children </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

969
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:08.620
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what makes these fingers sort</v>

970
00:58:08.621 --> 00:58:11.830
<v Speaker 2>of both beautiful and and horrifying at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>

971
00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:15.670
<v Speaker 2>They're attempting to hold on to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>domain that's,</v>

972
00:58:15.671 --> 00:58:20.671
<v Speaker 2>I guess not right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

973
00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:32.790
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's clearly assimilated to conserve.</v>

974
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:36.890
<v Speaker 2>That becomes even more clear later time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's going to,</v>

975
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:38.550
<v Speaker 2>she's offering area of bargains.</v>

976
00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:49.100
<v Speaker 1>What</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

977
00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:57.940
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately have</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one else did</v>

978
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:08.030
<v Speaker 1>in the past</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they called me.</v>

979
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays I've mended all my ways.</v>

980
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Repentance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is handy.</v>

981
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I always have to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use it on behalf of the</v>

982
00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:40.580
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to get the girl and do</v>

983
00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:49.423
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's happened once or twice the </v>

984
01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:07.880
<v Speaker 1>price and I'm afraid I have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put all the whole life of</v>

985
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>for three days.</v>

986
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get derailed.</v>

987
01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:43.510
<v Speaker 1>He's got to kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kiss,</v>

988
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kiss you.</v>

989
01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:55.840
<v Speaker 1>You remain human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't</v>

990
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.320
<v Speaker 1>give</v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

991
01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>a</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

992
01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't discussed this.</v>

993
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:44.270
<v Speaker 1>This is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I bought from your way is</v>

994
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:52.450
<v Speaker 1>sweet cakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more talking,</v>

995
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>singing</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice,</v>

996
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:04.090
<v Speaker 1>and don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get fired</v>

997
01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.010
<v Speaker 1>for ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to say a word on that.</v>

998
01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>He</v>
<v Speaker 1>was withdrawn and she.</v>

999
01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>
<v Speaker 1>bosses.</v>

1000
01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:29.350
<v Speaker 2>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing about this movie is this</v>

1001
01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:34.000
<v Speaker 2>know she's pretty horrible character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is.</v>

1002
01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:35.883
<v Speaker 2>It is because of her in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>assists that Ariel does get what she </v>

1003
01:03:38.591 --> 01:03:43.591
<v Speaker 2>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants to.</v>

1004
01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:46.360
<v Speaker 2>She wants to be human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1005
01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you.</v>

1006
01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.960
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1007
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:52.140
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not really.</v>

1008
01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:54.910
<v Speaker 2>She's a subterranean creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't</v>

1009
01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:59.810
<v Speaker 2>know what the equivalent is for being in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean.</v>

1010
01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:02.390
<v Speaker 2>She's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she's.</v>

1011
01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:05.140
<v Speaker 2>She wants to be transformed into </v>
<v Speaker 2>actuality.</v>

1012
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:05.993
<v Speaker 2>I guess just going to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it seem like she has to </v>

1013
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:11.330
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice something to get what she </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants.</v>

1014
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.433
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have to sacrifice something </v>

1015
01:04:14.511 --> 01:04:19.511
<v Speaker 2>to get you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

1016
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:23.360
<v Speaker 2>That's the sacrificial motif in part </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1017
01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing she values most,</v>

1018
01:04:24.901 --> 01:04:27.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is their voice in this particular.</v>

1019
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:32.990
<v Speaker 2>In this particular scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking,</v>

1020
01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:36.890
<v Speaker 2>walking legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that each step?</v>

1021
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Does she get her voice back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1022
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:10.743
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for me to tell exactly where </v>
<v Speaker 2>to start this because of this machine </v>

1023
01:05:13.811 --> 01:05:18.120
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have any place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have</v>

1024
01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make</v>

1025
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:36.150
<v Speaker 1>some</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty serious boats.</v>

1026
01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Married the wrong woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she has Ariel's voice.</v>

1027
01:05:52.310 --> 01:05:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun set?</v>

1028
01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Remember that's her domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1029
01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Because she's the creature that eats the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sun.</v>

1030
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Some dogs are</v>
<v Speaker 1>very precious</v>

1031
01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.770
<v Speaker 1>exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone</v>

1032
01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:33.760
<v Speaker 1>lost her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once</v>

1033
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:37.863
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1034
01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:15.390
<v Speaker 2>monster bites the dust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1035
01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.440
<v Speaker 2>the king is released.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1036
01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:23.520
<v Speaker 2>this is typically goes into the belly of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beast.</v>

1037
01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:24.653
<v Speaker 2>He freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people were there and basically </v>

1038
01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:27.624
<v Speaker 2>what that means is that he's established</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new pattern of behavior or an </v>

1039
01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.153
<v Speaker 2>adaptation or a new frame of reference </v>
<v Speaker 2>that enabled people will be defeated by </v>

1040
01:12:36.031 --> 01:12:36.864
<v Speaker 2>the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatening I know to well to start </v>

1041
01:12:41.221 --> 01:12:42.054
<v Speaker 2>their life again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have to remember that the </v>

1042
01:12:45.271 --> 01:12:46.104
<v Speaker 2>nature of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say the nature of your </v>

1043
01:12:48.661 --> 01:12:53.170
<v Speaker 2>experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>is absolutely dependent on how you are.</v>

1044
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1045
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:59.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll lead to the age of 63,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>

1046
01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:01.260
<v Speaker 2>3:00.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1047
01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:05.400
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to show you all those things so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you go through the next couple</v>

1048
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.233
<v Speaker 2>of chapters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of building up a storehouse </v>

1049
01:13:07.561 --> 01:13:08.394
<v Speaker 2>of images too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the only way you can understand </v>

1050
01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:13.140
<v Speaker 2>this stuff is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the images down basically.</v>

1051
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:18.720
<v Speaker 2>So you're also reading a great mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1052
01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.730
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a union vote.</v>

1053
01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our students both young and none of them</v>

1054
01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:26.773
<v Speaker 2>believed that the great mother was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of the collective </v>

1055
01:13:29.341 --> 01:13:32.610
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're wrong in a sense.</v>

1056
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:34.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a great mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a representation of novelty,</v>

1057
01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:36.533
<v Speaker 2>is just so happens that the phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>that young subsumed under the rubric of </v>

1058
01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:42.750
<v Speaker 2>the collective unconscious are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

1059
01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:43.584
<v Speaker 2>or the first r is the first line of </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense that people erect against the </v>

1060
01:13:48.271 --> 01:13:49.104
<v Speaker 2>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically to say that if </v>

1061
01:13:50.341 --> 01:13:54.540
<v Speaker 2>something unexpected happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start imagining what it might be.</v>

1062
01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.033
<v Speaker 2>So the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we would normally refer to as the </v>

1063
01:13:59.041 --> 01:14:01.250
<v Speaker 2>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its constituent elements.</v>

1064
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:04.350
<v Speaker 2>That's what you identified as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective unconscious.</v>

1065
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:09.330
<v Speaker 2>So all I'm saying basically is that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>something unexpected happened to you,</v>

1066
01:14:09.630 --> 01:14:14.020
<v Speaker 2>it always occurs into some form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>

1067
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:15.703
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's that form of representation </v>

1068
01:14:17.891 --> 01:14:20.320
<v Speaker 2>that you identified as the collective </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>

1069
01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:25.270
<v Speaker 2>So he would say novelty as such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would adopt the aspect of Kelly,</v>

1070
01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:26.133
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

1071
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the book makes more sense.</v>

1072
01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:44.270
<v Speaker 2>The theory makes more sense in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you understand the great mothers,</v>

1073
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:45.143
<v Speaker 2>the archetype of novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown territory behind your sits the </v>

1074
01:14:50.211 --> 01:14:52.660
<v Speaker 2>dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's true.</v>

1075
01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1076
01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I just was looking in the book the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other day and I saw the euro burst.</v>

1077
01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Describe as a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

1078
01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:03.953
<v Speaker 2>How do you think that that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the consciousness comes out of </v>

1079
01:15:06.771 --> 01:15:08.040
<v Speaker 2>the finger that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1080
01:15:08.190 --> 01:15:12.160
<v Speaker 2>the thing is the reverse is the source </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the subject and it's not.</v>

1081
01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.780
<v Speaker 2>It's not a symbol for consciousness per </v>
<v Speaker 2>se.</v>

1082
01:15:14.781 --> 01:15:17.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a symbol for the origins of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

1083
01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.360
<v Speaker 2>The place that it comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1084
01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.233
<v Speaker 2>I was just looking through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His book is called the Silverware </v>

1085
01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:24.013
<v Speaker 2>University,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but well people take liberties with the </v>

1086
01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:27.363
<v Speaker 2>symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem is that they do tend </v>

1087
01:15:28.701 --> 01:15:29.534
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do tend to mail and across </v>

1088
01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.273
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not because they have fuzzy </v>

1089
01:15:33.261 --> 01:15:35.420
<v Speaker 2>borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do tend to blend into one another.</v>

1090
01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Not knowing anything else about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

1091
01:15:40.611 --> 01:15:41.444
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that the statement that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the of burroughs is the symbol for </v>

1092
01:15:43.521 --> 01:15:44.750
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is wrong.</v>

1093
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:48.370
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1094
01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:55.110
<v Speaker 1>what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the father representing consciousness.</v>

1095
01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just for the record,</v>

1096
01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.760
<v Speaker 2>before the represents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

1097
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:04.670
<v Speaker 2>There's two domains of masculine </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolism and mythology.</v>

1098
01:16:04.671 --> 01:16:09.230
<v Speaker 2>Once the hero wins the father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before that gives rise to the hero,</v>

1099
01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:11.510
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that you're a product of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your culture,</v>

1100
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:13.760
<v Speaker 2>but the hearing also gives rise to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>farther,</v>

1101
01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:14.653
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that culture is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>product of the activity of the </v>

1102
01:16:16.971 --> 01:16:20.300
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in Pinocchio,</v>

1103
01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I would still say that Japan was </v>
<v Speaker 2>assembled,</v>

1104
01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:25.003
<v Speaker 2>symbolize more what we would consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>the domain of the state or culture and </v>

1105
01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Nokia with the forest that revivified</v>

1106
01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:32.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Jimminy cricket.</v>

1107
01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:36.723
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's kind of like consciousness is </v>

1108
01:16:41.941 --> 01:16:42.774
<v Speaker 1>referring to</v>
<v Speaker 1>save his consciousness and what he's </v>

1109
01:16:47.431 --> 01:16:48.264
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He referred to him as the son in the </v>

1110
01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:53.163
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

1111
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:56.000
<v Speaker 2>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1112
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1113
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:58.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not saving his consciousness to see</v>

1114
01:16:58.761 --> 01:17:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Japan and notion tells him to save </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

1115
01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:05.720
<v Speaker 2>So like Pinocchio takes the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult route,</v>

1116
01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:06.554
<v Speaker 2>which is the simultaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say from a mythological </v>

1117
01:17:08.661 --> 01:17:09.494
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the simultaneous regeneration of </v>

1118
01:17:11.271 --> 01:17:12.104
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are the things that you all </v>

1119
01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:14.983
<v Speaker 2>pointed out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there any personal problem that's </v>

1120
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:18.074
<v Speaker 2>taken far enough in terms of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem and if you do a thorough job of </v>

1121
01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:25.820
<v Speaker 2>solving your personal problem because </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people share that problem with you.</v>

1122
01:17:25.821 --> 01:17:26.654
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's very rare that you'll have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>broad mix you so unique to you that </v>

1123
01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:30.083
<v Speaker 2>doesn't also affect that whole a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>sequence of people who live at the same </v>

1124
01:17:33.921 --> 01:17:34.754
<v Speaker 2>time as you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really solved that problem </v>

1125
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.633
<v Speaker 2>symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasy or update your culture and </v>

1126
01:17:39.291 --> 01:17:42.110
<v Speaker 2>that's what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that story was referring to.</v>

1127
01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:42.973
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1128
01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:48.080
<v Speaker 2>that was a sufficiently heroic endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Pinocchio got awarded by becoming</v>

1129
01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:48.914
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't just do the thing that was </v>

1130
01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.213
<v Speaker 2>best for himself in the narrow sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also did the thing that revivified </v>

1131
01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:56.503
<v Speaker 2>his father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that made him like literally </v>

1132
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.020
<v Speaker 2>an obedient because he was made out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wood better was a master craftsman.</v>

1133
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:05.070
<v Speaker 2>So Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1134
01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.710
<v Speaker 2>stands for accumulated wisdom basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1135
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.833
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can become stultified but is </v>

1136
01:18:12.981 --> 01:18:15.470
<v Speaker 2>nonetheless necessary to sort of drag </v>
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>

1137
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:18.410
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it depended on the positive aspect of</v>

1138
01:18:18.411 --> 01:18:19.790
<v Speaker 2>the known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1139
01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.290
<v Speaker 2>And the in that particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1140
01:18:21.291 --> 01:18:24.200
<v Speaker 2>He's the guy who forgot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember his name,</v>

1141
01:18:24.201 --> 01:18:29.200
<v Speaker 2>but the one who ran the pleasure alum or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boys that the negative aspects.</v>

1142
01:18:29.201 --> 01:18:30.040
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1143
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:33.320
<v Speaker 2>See a name that the boys who misbehave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who didn't follow,</v>

1144
01:18:33.321 --> 01:18:37.010
<v Speaker 2>the coaches who were abandoned by their </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious never no longer spoke to them.</v>

1145
01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:39.860
<v Speaker 2>They were transformative to jackasses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and became slaves.</v>

1146
01:18:39.861 --> 01:18:42.670
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the negative aspect of culture.</v>

1147
01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:48.680
<v Speaker 2>So the euro is transformed by flooding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're both transformed,</v>

1148
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:50.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While to hear.</v>

1149
01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a process of mutual transformation.</v>

1150
01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:57.780
<v Speaker 2>You see in the Cirrus Horace Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the myth that IED,</v>

1151
01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:58.693
<v Speaker 2>the Egyptian Pharaoh for Onyx stape was </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated on is the pharaoh is both </v>

1152
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Osiris and horus simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's because the pharaoh,</v>

1153
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:08.143
<v Speaker 2>if like the Dan Pharaoh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pharaoh just died instantly </v>

1154
01:19:10.521 --> 01:19:13.910
<v Speaker 2>assimilated to ocirus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the live feral,</v>

1155
01:19:13.911 --> 01:19:16.310
<v Speaker 2>that's horace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's both though horace and ocirus.</v>

1156
01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Simultaneously I take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1157
01:19:17.781 --> 01:19:19.980
<v Speaker 2>that's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the dead pharaohs ocirus.</v>

1158
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:22.250
<v Speaker 2>How can the live feral deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Sound Horace,</v>

1159
01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:24.950
<v Speaker 2>but those cirrus is the wisdom of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>

1160
01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.113
<v Speaker 2>and horace is the process that faces the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown and constantly updates the </v>

1161
01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:31.304
<v Speaker 2>wisdom of the past and both of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>together make the Pharaoh and that </v>

1162
01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.090
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1163
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.923
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Egyptians had it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's an act that the state is an </v>

1164
01:19:38.961 --> 01:19:39.794
<v Speaker 2>active process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus the accumulation of knowledge and </v>

1165
01:19:43.161 --> 01:19:46.370
<v Speaker 2>the process is adaptation in the face of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unknown,</v>

1166
01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:47.503
<v Speaker 2>adaptation to the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was symbolized by these </v>

1167
01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:50.534
<v Speaker 2>monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that key necessary monsters that keep </v>

1168
01:19:53.721 --> 01:19:56.330
<v Speaker 2>popping up for the law and these stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we looked at today.</v>

1169
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Who is the nicest</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean?</v>

1170
01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does she?</v>

1171
01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.860
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She probably just don't remember what it</v>

1172
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:04.591
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1173
01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:07.490
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's the one who reassembles cirrus.</v>

1174
01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.040
<v Speaker 2>Once he's cut apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if I remember correctly,</v>

1175
01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:14.130
<v Speaker 2>said seth capsule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Warner was conflict with seth,</v>

1176
01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:20.070
<v Speaker 2>but isis scatters up his pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's a,</v>

1177
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:21.840
<v Speaker 2>she's an image of the closet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminine.</v>

1178
01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember her developmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

1179
01:20:24.031 --> 01:20:25.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who she is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assimilated.</v>

1180
01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:32.540
<v Speaker 2>So she's an aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1181
01:20:37.431 --> 01:20:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Isis is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isis is</v>

1182
01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:45.600
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1183
01:20:46.810 --> 01:20:47.643
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
