1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.943
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I suggested to you last class that </v>

3
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.160
<v Speaker 2>human beings world as a place of action </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the lens of their social,</v>

4
00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:22.520
<v Speaker 2>cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological,</v>

5
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.800
<v Speaker 2>substructure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I made that argument on the basis of</v>

6
00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:28.634
<v Speaker 2>the supposition that our primary </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment was actually other people </v>

7
00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:36.044
<v Speaker 2>and I mentioned to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that those other people are </v>

8
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:44.291
<v Speaker 2>arranged in hierarchies of influence and</v>
<v Speaker 2>authority or power or dominance,</v>

9
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:46.904
<v Speaker 2>which is often how it's construed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the dominance hierarchy as a </v>

10
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:53.210
<v Speaker 2>structure is at least 300 million years </v>
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

11
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.793
<v Speaker 2>which makes it older than trees and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that reason that you share the same </v>

12
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.273
<v Speaker 2>neurobiology to govern your observations</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your position in the hierarchy as </v>

13
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.730
<v Speaker 2>lobsters do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a remarkable fact.</v>

14
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:11.564
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's remarkable that the lobster uses </v>

15
00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:14.534
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has the mechanism to adjudicate it </v>

16
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:18.174
<v Speaker 2>status position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that modifying the Serotonin </v>

17
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.490
<v Speaker 2>function in the lobster can produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes in its behavior,</v>

18
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.533
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can overhead the lobster overcome </v>

19
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 2>defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

20
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.553
<v Speaker 2>Which is very much equivalent to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to a human being when they take </v>

21
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.740
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

22
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:37.574
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

23
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 2>it's a good example of the conservation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of biological structure by evolution and</v>

24
00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good illustration of the continuity of</v>

25
00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:47.870
<v Speaker 2>life on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really amazing.</v>

26
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:50.420
<v Speaker 2>But the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a testament to his,</v>

27
00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:53.780
<v Speaker 2>the ancient nature of the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

28
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:54.614
<v Speaker 2>Now we tend to think of the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure as something other than </v>

29
00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:58.670
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

30
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Because society is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose mythologically opposed opposed</v>

31
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 2>in a narrative way culture as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

32
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.153
<v Speaker 2>It's the town in the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the town has been around a long </v>

33
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:12.920
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

34
00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:13.754
<v Speaker 2>And the structure of the town is also </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of nature in the dominance </v>

35
00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy is part of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because it's so ancient,</v>

36
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:22.004
<v Speaker 2>you have to consider it as part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism that has played the role of </v>

37
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 2>selection in the process of natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection.</v>

38
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.160
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

39
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.653
<v Speaker 2>roughly see what seems to happen is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a plethora of dominance </v>

40
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.313
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in complex human communities </v>

41
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.153
<v Speaker 2>and many of them are masculine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure in that their dominance </v>

42
00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:51.590
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies that primarily men compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>in or that has been the historical norm.</v>

43
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.963
<v Speaker 2>And that some men rise to the top based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on whatever the dominance hierarchy is </v>

44
00:02:57.291 --> 00:02:58.124
<v Speaker 2>based on and they make their </v>
<v Speaker 2>preferential mates and it's a good </v>

45
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:08.071
<v Speaker 2>strategy for women to engage in because </v>
<v Speaker 2>why and and many sorts of female animals</v>

46
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 2>do precisely this is they let the males </v>
<v Speaker 2>battle it out and then pick from the top</v>

47
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.883
<v Speaker 2>and or often the dominant males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no choice on the part of the </v>

48
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.274
<v Speaker 2>females.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the dominant males just chasing </v>

49
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:23.704
<v Speaker 2>away the subordinate males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with humans it's usually the case </v>

50
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 2>that the females have the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do at least some choosing.</v>

51
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 2>And so we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about that,</v>

52
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.614
<v Speaker 2>what that implies is that we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved to climb up dominance </v>

53
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:40.714
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies and then I would say it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not exactly that even because there are </v>

54
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:45.634
<v Speaker 2>many different dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the skills that you might use to </v>

55
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:50.284
<v Speaker 2>climb up one might not be necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same skills that you would use to </v>

56
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:54.034
<v Speaker 2>climb up another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then I would say what we evolve </v>

57
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.400
<v Speaker 2>evolve for instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

58
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 2>and I'm still speaking mostly on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculine edge of things.</v>

59
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.293
<v Speaker 2>Historically speaking is the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>climb up the set of all possible </v>

60
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

61
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different idea.</v>

62
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:14.914
<v Speaker 2>It's like the average hierarchy across </v>
<v Speaker 2>vast spans of time and I think it's for </v>

63
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:20.314
<v Speaker 2>that reason that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>among others that we evolve general </v>

64
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:24.394
<v Speaker 2>intelligence because general </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence is a general problem </v>

65
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 2>solving mechanism and it seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation independent,</v>

66
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

67
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.663
<v Speaker 2>And of course there's been an arms race </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the development of intelligence </v>

68
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:41.840
<v Speaker 2>between men and women because each </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender has to keep up with the other and</v>

69
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 2>women have their own dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>

70
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.153
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course now men and women more </v>

71
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:50.494
<v Speaker 2>increasingly compete within the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies and we don't exactly know </v>

72
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 2>how to sort that out yet because it's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily new phenomena.</v>

73
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 2>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the,</v>

74
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.113
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the permanence of the dominance </v>

75
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:04.084
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has come to be represented in </v>

76
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 2>fundamental narratives because human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>

77
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that we share </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

78
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing the Wall Street bankers </v>
<v Speaker 2>shares with,</v>

79
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

80
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.034
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kelly Harry Kung bushmen who are among </v>

81
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:23.734
<v Speaker 2>the genetically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they seem to be very close to what the </v>

82
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.194
<v Speaker 2>original,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most original human beings were like in </v>

83
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Africa before the Diaspora for about </v>
<v Speaker 2>50,000 years ago.</v>

84
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.903
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.773
<v Speaker 2>both of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite their vast differences live in </v>

86
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 2>communities that have a hierarchical </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure</v>

87
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 2>that are composed of individuals that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are embedded in a natural world,</v>

88
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world outside of the dominant </v>

89
00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:52.254
<v Speaker 2>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the standard human </v>

90
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:54.904
<v Speaker 2>environment I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so stories that rely on the </v>

91
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:58.274
<v Speaker 2>representations of those environments </v>
<v Speaker 2>and their interactions are what you </v>

92
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:07.721
<v Speaker 2>might describe as universal stories and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why people can understand them.</v>

93
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:09.044
<v Speaker 2>And I would say further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is drawing substantially on </v>

94
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.583
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>derivations of the work of Carl young </v>

95
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 2>because I think he delved into this more</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply than anyone else.</v>

96
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of this stuff is quite union in</v>
<v Speaker 2>its,</v>

97
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 2>in its origins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

98
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

99
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 2>the commonality between human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

100
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:30.554
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have commonalities in order </v>

101
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 2>to communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

102
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Axiomatic commonalities because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you have to explain everything</v>

103
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.803
<v Speaker 2>and so there's many things that human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings don't have to explain to one </v>

104
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:42.020
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

105
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to explain anger when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to explain jealousy.</v>

106
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to explain fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to explain pain,</v>

107
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to explain joy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to explain love,</v>

108
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.533
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are built into us and so their </v>

109
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:57.044
<v Speaker 2>predicates of being human and you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that those human predicates and the </v>

110
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:02.864
<v Speaker 2>standard human environment produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard narratives and then you could </v>

111
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:09.050
<v Speaker 2>say even further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is more of a leap,</v>

112
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:09.884
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that those who act out the role of </v>

113
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:15.134
<v Speaker 2>the victor in those standard narratives </v>
<v Speaker 2>are precisely the people who attain </v>

114
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:20.114
<v Speaker 2>victory in life on and I would say </v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically defined in that they make </v>

115
00:07:25.191 --> 00:07:26.024
<v Speaker 2>more attractive partners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also I believe that there's an </v>

116
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:29.504
<v Speaker 2>alignment between human wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very weak word and </v>

117
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.550
<v Speaker 2>participation in these metanarratives </v>
<v Speaker 2>that drive success because,</v>

118
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.423
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to be a failure or a </v>

119
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 2>success?</v>

120
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.783
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to be a success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to adopt a lot of </v>

122
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:46.184
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and so you might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to take your chances as a </v>

123
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:51.170
<v Speaker 2>failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't exactly.</v>

124
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.333
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to make the presumption </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's going to put you in this </v>

125
00:07:55.051 --> 00:08:00.051
<v Speaker 2>situation other than one where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced a lot of frustration,</v>

126
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:01.550
<v Speaker 2>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointment,</v>

127
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:02.384
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain and anxiety at the bottom of the </v>

128
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:06.134
<v Speaker 2>heap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so generally that's not what people </v>

129
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:12.530
<v Speaker 2>are aiming for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although under certain circumstances,</v>

130
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 2>if people don't like responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>are willing to take their chances,</v>

131
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:18.014
<v Speaker 2>they might take the irresponsibility and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's apparent freedoms over the </v>

132
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:27.980
<v Speaker 2>necessity of thinking things through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>medium and long run.</v>

133
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we stop here.</v>

134
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:32.204
<v Speaker 2>I suggested to you that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary narrative representations was </v>

135
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:37.454
<v Speaker 2>the known or culture or order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was a or the explored </v>

136
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:43.640
<v Speaker 2>territory or the dominance hierarchy.</v>

137
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.640
<v Speaker 2>I think those things are basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>interchangeable from a,</v>

138
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:47.803
<v Speaker 2>from a representational perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know in the movie The lion king </v>

139
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.533
<v Speaker 2>that's represented by pride rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the central place of </v>

140
00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:57.534
<v Speaker 2>orientation founded on Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the sort of thing that people </v>

141
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:01.854
<v Speaker 2>embed their memories in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we make sculptures and </v>

142
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:05.424
<v Speaker 2>gravestones and that sort of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roc stands for permanent than to have </v>

143
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.773
<v Speaker 2>rock under your feet is to be on a solid</v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation and that's a pyramid in some </v>

144
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:14.814
<v Speaker 2>sense in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the pyramid has topped by the king </v>

145
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 2>and Queen and their offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

146
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

147
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 2>that's the divine couple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

148
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Speaker 2>And Simba of course is the newborn hero </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

149
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.323
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand that even though it's </v>

150
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:36.420
<v Speaker 2>lions and drawings of lions at that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals are acting it out,</v>

151
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.493
<v Speaker 2>it's completely irrelevant to you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>those characters happen to be animated </v>

152
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 2>and that what you're watching is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction.</v>

153
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.903
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say to you with regards to </v>

154
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:48.390
<v Speaker 2>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well is fiction true or not?</v>

156
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:52.794
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not true in that the events </v>

157
00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 2>portrayed in fiction occurred in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

158
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.960
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're fiction is true the same way</v>

159
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 2>numbers are true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say like,</v>

160
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have one apple and one orange and</v>

161
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:12.834
<v Speaker 2>one banana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the common malady between all of those </v>

162
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:19.860
<v Speaker 2>three is one and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

163
00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:24.861
<v Speaker 2>is one as real as one fruit is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction one as real as one fruit and</v>

164
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:29.640
<v Speaker 2>I would say it depends on what you mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>by real,</v>

165
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.713
<v Speaker 2>but representing things mathematically </v>
<v Speaker 2>and abstractly gives you incredible </v>

166
00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:35.304
<v Speaker 2>power and you could make the case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the abstraction is actually more real </v>

167
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:40.464
<v Speaker 2>than the phenomena that it represents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And certainly mathematicians would make </v>

168
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:45.060
<v Speaker 2>that case.</v>

169
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:50.010
<v Speaker 2>They would say that mathematics is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense more real than the phenomenal</v>

170
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:51.300
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

171
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:55.500
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to believe that mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of choice in some sense,</v>

172
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:56.334
<v Speaker 2>but you can't deny the fact that an </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction has enough reality so that </v>

173
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:03.120
<v Speaker 2>if you're proficient in using it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can really,</v>

174
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.700
<v Speaker 2>you can change the world and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

175
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:09.360
<v Speaker 2>and in and in insanely powerful ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

176
00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:10.194
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the computational equipment you </v>

177
00:11:11.121 --> 00:11:15.990
<v Speaker 2>people are using are dependent on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstractions one in zero essentially.</v>

178
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 2>And I mean look at what emerges from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

179
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction,</v>

180
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 2>if you take someone like Dostoevsky or </v>
<v Speaker 2>we think it's a favorite of mine,</v>

181
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:25.734
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would highly recommend that you read </v>

182
00:11:26.971 --> 00:11:27.804
<v Speaker 2>all five of his great novels because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are unparalleled in their </v>

183
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:33.170
<v Speaker 2>psychological depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

184
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.190
<v Speaker 2>and so if you're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>

185
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Dostoyevsky's the person for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tolstoy is more of a sociologist,</v>

186
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:41.034
<v Speaker 2>but Dostoyevsky man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets right down into the bottom of </v>

187
00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:46.770
<v Speaker 2>the questions and messes around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

188
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.050
<v Speaker 2>a transformative reading.</v>

189
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoyevsky's characters,</v>

190
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:53.334
<v Speaker 2>this character named her skull and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cove is a character in crime and </v>

191
00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:56.854
<v Speaker 2>punishment and risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the coffee's a materialist </v>

192
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 2>rationalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

193
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:04.350
<v Speaker 2>which was around rather new type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>person back in the 18 eighties.</v>

194
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.360
<v Speaker 2>And he was sort of taken by the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that God was dead and took and convinced</v>

195
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:13.144
<v Speaker 2>himself that the only reason that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that anyone acted in a moral way in a </v>

196
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:19.150
<v Speaker 2>traditional way was because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cowardice.</v>

197
00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:19.984
<v Speaker 2>They were unable to remove from them the</v>
<v Speaker 2>restrictions of mere convention and act </v>

198
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:30.640
<v Speaker 2>in the manner of someone who rose above </v>
<v Speaker 2>the norm.</v>

199
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 2>And so he's tortured by these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's half starving.</v>

200
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:35.734
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>law student who doesn't have enough to </v>

201
00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:37.990
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have much money,</v>

202
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:38.824
<v Speaker 2>and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not thinking all that clearly </v>

203
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:42.610
<v Speaker 2>either and it's got a lot of family </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

204
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:43.444
<v Speaker 2>His mother's sick and she can't spend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>send too much money and his sister is </v>

205
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:47.524
<v Speaker 2>planning to engage in a marriage that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>loveless to someone who's rather </v>

206
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:52.890
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who he,</v>

207
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:53.743
<v Speaker 2>she hopes will provide the family with </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough money so that he can continue in </v>

208
00:12:56.831 --> 00:13:01.831
<v Speaker 2>law school and they write him brave </v>
<v Speaker 2>letters telling him that she's very much</v>

209
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:02.674
<v Speaker 2>in love with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he is smart enough to read between </v>

210
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:05.944
<v Speaker 2>the lines and realize this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that his sister is just planning to </v>

211
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:10.340
<v Speaker 2>prostitute herself in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

212
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.710
<v Speaker 2>in an altruistic manner.</v>

213
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.770
<v Speaker 2>And he's not very happy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at the same time as all this is</v>

214
00:13:16.771 --> 00:13:20.590
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he becomes aware of this pawn broker who</v>

215
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:22.010
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

216
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.180
<v Speaker 2>pawning his last possessions too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's a horrible person and not only</v>

217
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:29.674
<v Speaker 2>by his estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she pawns a lot of things for the </v>

218
00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people really don't like her.</v>

219
00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:39.090
<v Speaker 2>She's grasping and cruel and deceitful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and and resentful and like,</v>

220
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.490
<v Speaker 2>and she has this nice who's not very </v>
<v Speaker 2>bright,</v>

221
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.360
<v Speaker 2>intellectually impaired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whom she basically treats as a slave and</v>

222
00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:48.590
<v Speaker 2>beats all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so risk called Nicole,</v>

223
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in this mess and half starved </v>

224
00:13:53.411 --> 00:13:58.411
<v Speaker 2>and a bit delirious and possessed of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these strange new nihilistic ideas.</v>

225
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.213
<v Speaker 2>Decides that the best way out of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation would be just to kill the </v>

226
00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:04.631
<v Speaker 2>landlord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

227
00:14:04.631 --> 00:14:07.750
<v Speaker 2>a pawnbroker take her wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which she,</v>

228
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:11.050
<v Speaker 2>all she does is keep it in a chest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a free,</v>

229
00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:11.740
<v Speaker 2>the nice.</v>

230
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.573
<v Speaker 2>So that seems like a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So remove one apparently horrible and </v>

231
00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:18.034
<v Speaker 2>useless person from the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free his sister from the necessity of </v>

232
00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:22.054
<v Speaker 2>this loveless marriage and allow him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to law school where he can become </v>

233
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:27.960
<v Speaker 2>educated and do some good for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

234
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things that's lovely about</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky is that he,</v>

235
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:33.124
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when sometimes when one person is </v>

236
00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:38.260
<v Speaker 2>arguing against another or when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>having an argument in their head,</v>

237
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.830
<v Speaker 2>they make their opponent into a straw </v>
<v Speaker 2>mat,</v>

238
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.693
<v Speaker 2>which is basically they take their </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponent and caricatures of their </v>

239
00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:45.604
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And try to make it as weak as possible </v>

240
00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:49.690
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and laugh about it,</v>

241
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:50.524
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they come up with their </v>

242
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:56.540
<v Speaker 2>argument and destroy this Straw man and </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel that they've obtained victory.</v>

243
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:59.690
<v Speaker 2>But it's a very pathetic way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

244
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:00.524
<v Speaker 2>It's not thinking at all what thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>is when you adopt the opposite position </v>

245
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:06.734
<v Speaker 2>from your suppositions and you make that</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument as strong as you can possibly </v>

246
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:11.624
<v Speaker 2>make it.</v>

247
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 2>And then you hit your perspective </v>
<v Speaker 2>against that,</v>

248
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.410
<v Speaker 2>that strong iron man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the straw man.</v>

249
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 2>And you argue it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you battle it out.</v>

250
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:25.940
<v Speaker 2>And that's what Dostoevsky does in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>novels.</v>

251
00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:26.774
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the people who stand for the </v>

252
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:29.954
<v Speaker 2>antithesis of what Dostoevsky Dostoevsky</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually believes are often the </v>

253
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 2>strongest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smartest,</v>

254
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes most admirable people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the book.</v>

255
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 2>And so he takes great moral courage to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

256
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:44.120
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

257
00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:44.954
<v Speaker 2>in rascal of what he wanted to do was </v>
<v Speaker 2>set up a character who had every reason </v>

258
00:15:48.651 --> 00:15:52.190
<v Speaker 2>to commit murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every reasonable reason,</v>

259
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.110
<v Speaker 2>philosophically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>practically,</v>

260
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.250
<v Speaker 2>ethically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even.</v>

261
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.503
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ruskell Nicole goes and he kills the </v>

262
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:01.543
<v Speaker 2>old lady with an ax and it doesn't go </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he expects it will because what </v>

263
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:10.601
<v Speaker 2>he finds out is that post murder risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>golden cove and pre murder riscal Nicole</v>

264
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 2>have are not the same people at all.</v>

265
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.640
<v Speaker 2>They're not even close to the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

266
00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:17.474
<v Speaker 2>He's entered an entirely different </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe and Dostoevsky does a lovely </v>

267
00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:21.794
<v Speaker 2>job of describing that universe of </v>
<v Speaker 2>horror and chaos and and and deception </v>

268
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:31.730
<v Speaker 2>and and and suffering and terror and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

269
00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:35.930
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't even use the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just buries it in an alley as fast as</v>

270
00:16:35.931 --> 00:16:38.820
<v Speaker 2>he can and then it doesn't want anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with it again.</v>

271
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.543
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason I'm telling you all this is </v>

272
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.160
<v Speaker 2>potentially to entice you into reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>the book because it is an amazing,</v>

273
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.640
<v Speaker 2>amazing book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also because you might say,</v>

274
00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:52.210
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is risky is what happened to risk in the</v>

275
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.120
<v Speaker 2>cove?</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

276
00:16:53.121 --> 00:16:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Are the stories in that book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>True?</v>

277
00:16:55.971 --> 00:16:57.440
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

278
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 2>from a factual perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly they're untrue.</v>

279
00:17:00.861 --> 00:17:01.694
<v Speaker 2>But then if you think of [inaudible] as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the embodiment of a particular type of </v>

280
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:10.490
<v Speaker 2>person who lived at that time and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>embodiment of a certain kind of ideology</v>

281
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.670
<v Speaker 2>which had swept across Europe and really</v>
<v Speaker 2>invaded Russia in,</v>

282
00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:18.350
<v Speaker 2>which was actually a precursor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a philosophical precursor to the Russian</v>

283
00:17:18.351 --> 00:17:22.640
<v Speaker 2>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then Ruskell Niqab is more real than any</v>

284
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.340
<v Speaker 2>one person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a composite person.</v>

285
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:26.443
<v Speaker 2>He's like a person who's irrelevancies </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been eliminated for the purpose of </v>

286
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.600
<v Speaker 2>relating something about the structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

287
00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:40.120
<v Speaker 2>And so I like to think of those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>as sort of met a real matter real.</v>

288
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.243
<v Speaker 2>They're more real than real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course that's what you expect </v>

289
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 2>people to do when they tell you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own lives,</v>

290
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.890
<v Speaker 2>about their own day.</v>

291
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.140
<v Speaker 2>You don't want a factual description of </v>
<v Speaker 2>every muscle twitch.</v>

292
00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:00.890
<v Speaker 2>You want them to distill their </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences down into the gist,</v>

293
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:03.923
<v Speaker 2>which is the significance of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and the significance of the </v>

294
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:07.644
<v Speaker 2>experience is roughly what you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>derive from listening to the experience </v>

295
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:17.220
<v Speaker 2>that will change the way that you look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the world and act in the world.</v>

296
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:18.563
<v Speaker 2>So it's valuable information and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can tell you a terrible story and then </v>

297
00:18:21.651 --> 00:18:25.020
<v Speaker 2>that can be valuable because that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you how not to look in the world,</v>

298
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.010
<v Speaker 2>look at the world and act in it or are </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can tell you a positive story.</v>

299
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:29.844
<v Speaker 2>You can derive benefit either way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why we also like to go watch </v>

300
00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:36.480
<v Speaker 2>stories about horrible psychopathic </v>
<v Speaker 2>thugs.</v>

301
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

302
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:39.114
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully we're learning not to be </v>

303
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:43.350
<v Speaker 2>like them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there are additional advantages</v>

304
00:18:43.351 --> 00:18:45.540
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

305
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.720
<v Speaker 2>someone who you might be some say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who is incapable of cruelty is a</v>

306
00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:54.060
<v Speaker 2>higher moral being than someone who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of cruelty.</v>

307
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 2>And I would say in this follows younger </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>

308
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.870
<v Speaker 2>that that's incorrect and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerously incorrect because if you are</v>

309
00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:01.704
<v Speaker 2>not capable of cruelty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are absolutely a victim to anyone </v>

310
00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:09.810
<v Speaker 2>who is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the reason that people go</v>

311
00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:10.644
<v Speaker 2>watch anti heroes and villains is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a part of them crying </v>

312
00:19:14.701 --> 00:19:17.820
<v Speaker 2>out for the incorporation of the monster</v>
<v Speaker 2>within them,</v>

313
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.270
<v Speaker 2>which is what gives them strength of </v>
<v Speaker 2>character and self respect.</v>

314
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Because it's impossible to respect </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself until you grow teeth and if you</v>

315
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:26.844
<v Speaker 2>grow teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you realize that you're somewhat </v>

316
00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:29.064
<v Speaker 2>dangerous and or maybe somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously dangerous and then you might </v>

317
00:19:33.511 --> 00:19:34.344
<v Speaker 2>be more willing to demand that you treat</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself with respect and other people </v>

318
00:19:37.861 --> 00:19:38.694
<v Speaker 2>do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that doesn't mean that being </v>

319
00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:41.994
<v Speaker 2>cruel is better than not being cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it means is that being able to be </v>

320
00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:46.704
<v Speaker 2>cruel and then not being cruel is better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than not being able to be cruel because </v>

321
00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:52.794
<v Speaker 2>in the first case you're nothing but we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can naive and in the second case you're </v>

322
00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:57.024
<v Speaker 2>dangerous but you have it under control </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know a lot of martial arts </v>

323
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:04.770
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on exactly that as part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their philosophy of training.</v>

324
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're not training you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

325
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.500
<v Speaker 2>We're training you to be peaceful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>awake and avoid fights.</v>

326
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.170
<v Speaker 2>But if you happen to have to get in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the.</v>

327
00:20:17.171 --> 00:20:18.004
<v Speaker 2>I guess the philosophy also is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you're a competent at </v>

328
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:22.314
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually decreases the probability </v>

329
00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:28.320
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to have to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when someone pushes you,</v>

330
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.010
<v Speaker 2>you will be able to respond with </v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence and with any luck,</v>

331
00:20:32.011 --> 00:20:33.810
<v Speaker 2>and this is certainly the case with </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullies,</v>

332
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.600
<v Speaker 2>with any luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reasonable show of confidence,</v>

333
00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:39.120
<v Speaker 2>which is very much equivalent to a show </v>
<v Speaker 2>of dominance,</v>

334
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.940
<v Speaker 2>is going to be enough to make the bully </v>
<v Speaker 2>back off,</v>

335
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.283
<v Speaker 2>and so the strength that you develop in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your monstrousness is actually the best </v>

336
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:52.150
<v Speaker 2>guarantee of peace and that's partly why</v>
<v Speaker 2>young believed that it was necessary for</v>

337
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:52.984
<v Speaker 2>people to integrate their shadow and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said that was a terrible thing for </v>

338
00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:59.230
<v Speaker 2>people to attempt because the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>shadow</v>

339
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.563
<v Speaker 2>which has all those things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself that you don't want to realize </v>

340
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.010
<v Speaker 2>reaches all the way to hell.</v>

341
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.993
<v Speaker 2>And what he meant by that was it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>through an analysis of your own shadow </v>

342
00:21:10.571 --> 00:21:15.100
<v Speaker 2>that you can come to understand why </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people are capable and you as well</v>

343
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.160
<v Speaker 2>of the sorts of terrible atrocities that</v>
<v Speaker 2>characterize,</v>

344
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:19.840
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century.</v>

345
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.063
<v Speaker 2>And without that understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no possibility of bringing it </v>

346
00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 2>under control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you study Nazi Germany,</v>

347
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:27.244
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you study the Soviet Union </v>

348
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 2>particularly under stelling and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>asking yourself,</v>

349
00:21:33.221 --> 00:21:35.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are these perpetrators like?</v>

350
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.470
<v Speaker 2>Forget about the victims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about the perpetrators.</v>

351
00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:42.160
<v Speaker 2>The answer is they're just like you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know that,</v>

352
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:42.994
<v Speaker 2>that just means that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about people including </v>

353
00:21:45.191 --> 00:21:46.024
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it also means that you have to </v>

354
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 2>discover why they're just like you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe me,</v>

355
00:21:51.671 --> 00:21:52.504
<v Speaker 2>that's no picnic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's enough to traumatize people </v>

356
00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:56.134
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly why they don't do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also partly why the path to </v>

357
00:21:59.471 --> 00:22:03.190
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment and wisdom is seldom trod </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon.</v>

358
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Because if it was all a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>following your bliss and doing what made</v>

359
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:07.924
<v Speaker 2>you happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then everyone in the world would be a </v>

360
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:11.980
<v Speaker 2>paragon of wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not that at all.</v>

361
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.113
<v Speaker 2>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of facing the thing you </v>

362
00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:18.130
<v Speaker 2>least want to face and everyone has that</v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

363
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.083
<v Speaker 2>There's this old story in King Arthur </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the night school off to look for </v>

364
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:23.134
<v Speaker 2>the holy grail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is either the cup that Christ </v>

365
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.213
<v Speaker 2>drank out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last supper or the cup into which </v>

366
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.130
<v Speaker 2>the blood gushed from his side was </v>
<v Speaker 2>poured when he was crucified.</v>

367
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.990
<v Speaker 2>The stories vary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

368
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.943
<v Speaker 2>It's basically a holy object like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>phoenix in some sense that's </v>

369
00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:42.640
<v Speaker 2>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a representation of transformation,</v>

370
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:43.833
<v Speaker 2>so it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an ideal and so King Arthur's </v>

371
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.270
<v Speaker 2>knights who sit at round table because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all roughly equal.</v>

372
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:50.403
<v Speaker 2>Go off to find the most valuable thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they and where do you look for the </v>

373
00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:57.100
<v Speaker 2>most valuable thing when you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it is?</v>

374
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.353
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each of the nights looks at the forest </v>

375
00:23:00.281 --> 00:23:01.114
<v Speaker 2>surrounding the castle and enters the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forest at the point that looks darkest </v>

376
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:09.780
<v Speaker 2>to him and that's a good thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand because the gateway to wisdom</v>

377
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.790
<v Speaker 2>and the gateway to the development of </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>

378
00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:17.470
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is precisely through the porthole portal</v>

379
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.513
<v Speaker 2>that you do not want to climb through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is actually </v>

380
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:24.610
<v Speaker 2>quite technical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a union presupposition too,</v>

381
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:25.900
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

382
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.913
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of things about you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are under developed and a lot of those </v>

383
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:29.974
<v Speaker 2>things are because there's things you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>avoided looking at because you don't </v>

384
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:36.670
<v Speaker 2>want to look at them and there's parts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of you you've avoided developing because</v>

385
00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:38.890
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for you to develop those </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts.</v>

386
00:23:38.891 --> 00:23:39.724
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's by virtual necessity that what you </v>

387
00:23:42.461 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 2>need is where you don't want to look </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's where you've kept</v>

388
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.630
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

389
00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.710
<v Speaker 3>and that's why there's an idiosyncratic </v>
<v Speaker 3>element of it for everyone.</v>

390
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:52.783
<v Speaker 3>Your particular place of enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 3>and terror is not going to be the same </v>

391
00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:57.074
<v Speaker 3>as yours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except that they're both places of </v>

392
00:23:58.821 --> 00:23:59.654
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment and terror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So their equivalent at one level of </v>

393
00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:05.390
<v Speaker 3>analysis and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and different at another.</v>

394
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:07.620
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to fiction and,</v>

395
00:24:07.621 --> 00:24:08.190
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

396
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.023
<v Speaker 3>and what it does is it distills truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it produces characters that are </v>

397
00:24:14.271 --> 00:24:17.550
<v Speaker 3>composites and the more they become </v>
<v Speaker 3>compass,</v>

398
00:24:17.551 --> 00:24:21.320
<v Speaker 3>it's the more they approximate a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythological character.</v>

399
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.843
<v Speaker 3>And so they become more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>universally true and more and more </v>

400
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.470
<v Speaker 3>approximating religious deities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with that is they become</v>

401
00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:33.500
<v Speaker 3>more and more distant from individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

402
00:24:33.501 --> 00:24:34.334
<v Speaker 3>And so with literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this very tight line where you </v>

403
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:43.940
<v Speaker 3>need to make the character more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>merely human,</v>

404
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.080
<v Speaker 3>but not so much of a god that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

405
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.850
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that happened to </v>
<v Speaker 3>superman in the 19 eighties,</v>

406
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.270
<v Speaker 3>superman started out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a heavenly set,</v>

407
00:24:52.271 --> 00:24:54.620
<v Speaker 3>a parents bought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way in an earthly set of parents.</v>

408
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.453
<v Speaker 3>And he's an orphan like Harry Potter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very common theme is that when Superman </v>

409
00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:02.270
<v Speaker 3>first emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could only jump over buildings.</v>

410
00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:04.070
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could stop a locomotive,</v>

411
00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:04.904
<v Speaker 3>but by the time the 19 eighties rolled </v>
<v Speaker 3>around like he could juggle planets and </v>

412
00:25:08.271 --> 00:25:11.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swallow hydrogen bombs and you know,</v>

413
00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:12.860
<v Speaker 3>he could do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

414
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.030
<v Speaker 3>people stopped buying the superman </v>
<v Speaker 3>comics because how interesting is that?</v>

415
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:20.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like something horrible happens and</v>
<v Speaker 3>superman deals with it and,</v>

416
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:25.100
<v Speaker 3>and something else horrible happens and </v>
<v Speaker 3>superman deals with it and it's like,</v>

417
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:28.940
<v Speaker 3>that's dull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He turned into such an archetype.</v>

418
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:32.060
<v Speaker 3>He was basically the omniscient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>omnipresent,</v>

419
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.200
<v Speaker 3>omnipotent God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's no fun.</v>

420
00:25:37.201 --> 00:25:40.480
<v Speaker 3>That's like Godwin's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then God wins again and then again,</v>

421
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:41.323
<v Speaker 3>God wins and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then they had to weaken him in </v>

422
00:25:44.021 --> 00:25:45.870
<v Speaker 3>different ways with Kryptonite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

423
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.310
<v Speaker 3>so green Kryptonite kind of made him </v>
<v Speaker 3>sick and red Kryptonite I think,</v>

424
00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.370
<v Speaker 3>kind of mutated him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly.</v>

425
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.203
<v Speaker 3>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to introduce flaws into his </v>

426
00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:55.574
<v Speaker 3>character so that there could be some </v>
<v Speaker 3>damn plot and not something to think </v>

427
00:25:58.611 --> 00:25:59.444
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

428
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.343
<v Speaker 3>there's a deep existential lesson in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in that your being is limited and </v>

429
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.290
<v Speaker 3>flawed and fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

430
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.333
<v Speaker 3>you're like the genie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is genius in the little tiny in </v>

431
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.630
<v Speaker 3>the little tiny a lamp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

432
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:15.523
<v Speaker 3>this immense potential but constrained </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this tiny little living space as </v>

433
00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Robin Williams said when he played the </v>
<v Speaker 3>genie in Aladdin.</v>

434
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.593
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that you have limitations </v>
<v Speaker 3>means that the plot of your life is the </v>

435
00:26:27.801 --> 00:26:31.910
<v Speaker 3>overcoming of those limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that if you didn't have limitations,</v>

436
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.270
<v Speaker 3>while there wouldn't be a plot and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be no life.</v>

437
00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:39.290
<v Speaker 3>And so that's part of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps you have to accept the fact that</v>

438
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:42.770
<v Speaker 3>you're flawed and insufficient and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and live with it.</v>

439
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:45.510
<v Speaker 3>And consider it a precondition for </v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

440
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 3>It's at least a reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a reasonable idea.</v>

441
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:51.443
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the main characters is the </v>

442
00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:55.860
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the known,</v>

443
00:26:55.861 --> 00:26:56.694
<v Speaker 3>the explored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went over that a bit and it always </v>

444
00:26:59.311 --> 00:27:00.144
<v Speaker 3>has two elements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean your country is your greatest </v>

445
00:27:03.781 --> 00:27:08.781
<v Speaker 3>friend and your worst enemy because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>squashes you into conformity and demands</v>

446
00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:11.214
<v Speaker 3>that you act in a certain manner and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reduces your individuality to that </v>

447
00:27:15.451 --> 00:27:20.451
<v Speaker 3>element that's tolerated by everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>else and it it constrains your potential</v>

448
00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:23.910
<v Speaker 3>in a single direction and so it's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrannical,</v>

449
00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:24.744
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time it provides you </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a place to be and all of the </v>

450
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:35.390
<v Speaker 3>benefits that have accrued as a result </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the actions of your ancestors and all</v>

451
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.820
<v Speaker 3>the other people that you're associated </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

452
00:27:38.821 --> 00:27:39.654
<v Speaker 3>So there's the good tyrant or the bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyrant and the good king and those were </v>

453
00:27:45.361 --> 00:27:46.194
<v Speaker 3>archetypal figures and that's because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're always true and they're always </v>

454
00:27:49.111 --> 00:27:50.310
<v Speaker 3>true simultaneously.</v>

455
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:51.623
<v Speaker 3>Which is partly why I object to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>notion of the patriarchy because it's a </v>

456
00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 3>mythological.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the.</v>

457
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.500
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you call that?</v>

458
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.950
<v Speaker 3>It's the apprehension of a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 3>trope,</v>

459
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:02.813
<v Speaker 3>which is that of the evil tyrant without</v>
<v Speaker 3>any appreciation for the fact that the </v>

460
00:28:06.301 --> 00:28:11.040
<v Speaker 3>archetype actually has two parts and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other part is the wise king and you know</v>

461
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.650
<v Speaker 3>you can tell an evil tyrant story about </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

462
00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:14.484
<v Speaker 3>no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's one sided and that's very </v>

463
00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:22.251
<v Speaker 3>dangerous because you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>forget all the good things that you have</v>

464
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.010
<v Speaker 3>while you're criticizing all the ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>that things are in error.</v>

465
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:29.790
<v Speaker 3>That's a lack of gratitude and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of wisdom and it's.</v>

466
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.033
<v Speaker 3>It's founded in resentment and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very dangerous both personally and </v>

467
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:36.654
<v Speaker 3>socially.</v>

468
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.773
<v Speaker 3>I told you that captain hook is a tyrant</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's got this crocodile chasing </v>

469
00:28:43.561 --> 00:28:45.900
<v Speaker 3>them in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The crocodile has a clock in its stomach</v>

470
00:28:45.901 --> 00:28:48.120
<v Speaker 3>and that's death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like obviously,</v>

471
00:28:48.121 --> 00:28:48.751
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tick,</v>

472
00:28:48.751 --> 00:28:49.411
<v Speaker 3>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tick,</v>

473
00:28:49.411 --> 00:28:50.244
<v Speaker 3>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a crocodile and it's under the </v>

474
00:28:52.411 --> 00:28:54.120
<v Speaker 3>water and it's already got a taste of </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

475
00:28:54.121 --> 00:28:54.954
<v Speaker 3>So he's being chased around by death and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes him terrified and resentful </v>

476
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:02.280
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and cruel and bitter.</v>

477
00:29:02.281 --> 00:29:05.970
<v Speaker 3>And so he's a tyrant and he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>wreak havoc everywhere.</v>

478
00:29:05.971 --> 00:29:09.360
<v Speaker 3>And then Peter Pan of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks at Captain Hook and thinks,</v>

479
00:29:09.361 --> 00:29:14.361
<v Speaker 3>why the hell should I grow up and to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a tyrant and sacrifice all the potential</v>

480
00:29:14.851 --> 00:29:15.684
<v Speaker 3>of childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is the potential </v>

481
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:19.374
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't utilize it as you mature </v>

482
00:29:22.111 --> 00:29:24.990
<v Speaker 3>and you just end up a 40 year old last </v>
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

483
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.880
<v Speaker 3>which is a horrifying thing to behold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost as if you're the corpse of a</v>

484
00:29:29.881 --> 00:29:31.950
<v Speaker 3>child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the living corpse of a child.</v>

485
00:29:31.951 --> 00:29:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Because who the hell wants a six year </v>
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>

486
00:29:34.321 --> 00:29:35.154
<v Speaker 3>40 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a little on the stale side by </v>

487
00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:40.500
<v Speaker 3>that point and not the world's happiest </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

488
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:41.970
<v Speaker 3>So you know</v>

489
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.340
<v Speaker 2>your potential is going to disappear </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you age anyways.</v>

490
00:29:45.341 --> 00:29:46.174
<v Speaker 2>And so you might as well shape that </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential in a particular direction and </v>

491
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:54.910
<v Speaker 2>at least become something no matter how </v>
<v Speaker 2>limited rather than nothing.</v>

492
00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.540
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Pan,</v>

493
00:30:01.371 --> 00:30:03.620
<v Speaker 2>that's a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great mythological story.</v>

494
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.233
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

495
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.030
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about tyrants.</v>

496
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only are they mythological figures,</v>

497
00:30:13.241 --> 00:30:15.670
<v Speaker 2>but they exist and they tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>deified.</v>

498
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Stalin was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for all intents and purposes,</v>

499
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:19.923
<v Speaker 2>God the father in Soviet Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although he was pretty much only the </v>

500
00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:28.480
<v Speaker 2>worst elements of Old Testament God who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was constantly smiling people and,</v>

501
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:29.703
<v Speaker 2>and wiping out populations and doing all</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things that seem to be quite </v>

502
00:30:32.861 --> 00:30:35.520
<v Speaker 2>nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But nonetheless,</v>

503
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people worshiped him in many ways.</v>

504
00:30:37.691 --> 00:30:39.010
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

505
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:39.844
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a representation of just exactly </v>

506
00:30:41.531 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 2>what goes wrong when things really go </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

507
00:30:43.991 --> 00:30:46.630
<v Speaker 2>when people stop paying attention and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they all lie.</v>

508
00:30:46.631 --> 00:30:47.464
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterized the communist state was </v>

509
00:30:50.291 --> 00:30:55.240
<v Speaker 2>that no one ever got to say anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually believed ever.</v>

510
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:59.590
<v Speaker 2>And that was partly because one out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>three people was an informer,</v>

511
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:01.690
<v Speaker 2>which meant if you had a family of six </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

512
00:31:01.691 --> 00:31:04.240
<v Speaker 2>two of them were informing on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government about you.</v>

513
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:07.420
<v Speaker 2>And that included your own children and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

514
00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:08.254
<v Speaker 2>And if you were an informer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were often amply rewarded by the </v>

515
00:31:10.961 --> 00:31:11.794
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that if you lived in an overcrowded </v>

516
00:31:13.301 --> 00:31:18.301
<v Speaker 2>apartment building with three families </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same flat and you informed on the</v>

517
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.800
<v Speaker 2>woman down the hall that you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

518
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:21.783
<v Speaker 2>she got shift shipped off to the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camp and you got her </v>

519
00:31:24.731 --> 00:31:25.564
<v Speaker 2>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was a lovely society and it </v>

520
00:31:28.031 --> 00:31:31.030
<v Speaker 2>only killed about 30 million people </v>
<v Speaker 2>between 19,</v>

521
00:31:31.031 --> 00:31:31.864
<v Speaker 2>19 in 1959.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what happens when the </v>

522
00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:38.320
<v Speaker 2>archetipal structure gets tilted badly </v>
<v Speaker 2>when people</v>

523
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:43.570
<v Speaker 2>forget that they have a responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fulfill as citizens,</v>

524
00:31:43.571 --> 00:31:44.404
<v Speaker 2>as a wake citizens who are capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stating the truth and the archetype </v>

525
00:31:48.071 --> 00:31:48.904
<v Speaker 2>shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's nothing left of the great </v>

526
00:31:51.011 --> 00:31:54.730
<v Speaker 2>father except the tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let's not have that happen.</v>

527
00:31:54.731 --> 00:31:55.564
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one on the right is really </v>

528
00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:59.710
<v Speaker 2>interesting because consciously or </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconsciously,</v>

529
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's Stellan surrounded by what is,</v>

530
00:32:03.461 --> 00:32:06.100
<v Speaker 2>for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>

531
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.353
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks like he looks like maleficent </v>

532
00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:12.610
<v Speaker 2>in sleeping beauty when she shows up at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aurora's Christening,</v>

533
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:13.643
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she puts her arms up in the air and </v>

534
00:32:14.531 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 2>green fire surrounds her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

535
00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.353
<v Speaker 2>like he's surrounded by fire and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lenin above him who's like king of the </v>

536
00:32:26.391 --> 00:32:29.630
<v Speaker 2>fiery realm and that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

537
00:32:29.631 --> 00:32:30.464
<v Speaker 2>all the terrors that happened in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union didn't start understanding </v>

538
00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.670
<v Speaker 2>and they started under Lenin and Lenin </v>
<v Speaker 2>was stolen,</v>

539
00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:41.680
<v Speaker 2>was definitely Lenin's legitimate son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>

540
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.450
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

541
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:45.284
<v Speaker 2>this is another example of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical element of the great father </v>

542
00:32:48.621 --> 00:32:51.620
<v Speaker 2>and the sorts of things that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

543
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:57.310
<v Speaker 2>I kind of got an evil kick out of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>ad was quite old,</v>

544
00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kitschy in some sense.</v>

545
00:33:01.641 --> 00:33:02.670
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

546
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:03.523
<v Speaker 2>it shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's something you'd </v>

547
00:33:04.311 --> 00:33:05.144
<v Speaker 2>ever see in a magazine today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 10 unusual stamps showing evil </v>

548
00:33:10.041 --> 00:33:11.720
<v Speaker 2>dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

549
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

550
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.480
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

551
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.373
<v Speaker 2>that's what he was and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence and that's just a tiny bit </v>

552
00:33:19.041 --> 00:33:23.750
<v Speaker 2>of the consequence because the Nazis </v>
<v Speaker 2>wiped out a very large number of people.</v>

553
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:27.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm often using compassion as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

554
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.150
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

555
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.430
<v Speaker 2>as a justification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they went after the mentally ill</v>

556
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:39.431
<v Speaker 2>and the terminally ill and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those who,</v>

557
00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.740
<v Speaker 2>whose intelligence was compromised for </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological reasons and,</v>

558
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:44.503
<v Speaker 2>and those who were too old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically justified it by saying </v>

559
00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:48.704
<v Speaker 2>that the enforced euthanasia was </v>
<v Speaker 2>merciful and that you were actually </v>

560
00:33:52.671 --> 00:33:56.690
<v Speaker 2>being a good person by complying with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the requirements.</v>

561
00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:01.700
<v Speaker 2>And so something to think about more </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological representations.</v>

562
00:34:01.701 --> 00:34:03.140
<v Speaker 2>I like these quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

563
00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:05.330
<v Speaker 2>there Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

564
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:06.223
<v Speaker 2>night of the faith essentially with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that's a recreation of the </v>

565
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.641
<v Speaker 2>Christian Holy Spirit dove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

566
00:34:13.641 --> 00:34:16.640
<v Speaker 2>except its an eagle which is a bird of </v>
<v Speaker 2>prey.</v>

567
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:17.533
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

568
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.190
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you call those things?</v>

569
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:20.990
<v Speaker 2>A scavenger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

570
00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:25.060
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's Hitler as knight of the,</v>

571
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:27.300
<v Speaker 2>of the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

572
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.540
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an allied,</v>

573
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.093
<v Speaker 2>a war poster essentially that </v>
<v Speaker 2>assimilates the Nazis to poisonous </v>

574
00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:38.240
<v Speaker 2>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

575
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.253
<v Speaker 2>we don't like poisonous snakes very much</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's probably because they've been </v>

576
00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:43.214
<v Speaker 2>preying on us for approximately $20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million years because snakes and </v>

577
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.200
<v Speaker 2>primates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans in particular co evolved.</v>

578
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.423
<v Speaker 2>And so the snake is a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that which lies outside the comfortable </v>

579
00:34:57.801 --> 00:34:59.780
<v Speaker 2>domain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that can be,</v>

580
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a snake obviously,</v>

581
00:35:02.241 --> 00:35:03.074
<v Speaker 2>or it can be a an abstract snake and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract snake is your enemy or an even </v>

582
00:35:09.111 --> 00:35:12.980
<v Speaker 2>more abstract snake is the evil in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>own heart.</v>

583
00:35:12.981 --> 00:35:15.980
<v Speaker 2>And this is going to be a bit of a leap </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>

584
00:35:15.981 --> 00:35:16.814
<v Speaker 2>but there's this ancient idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed in the West over thousands of </v>

585
00:35:21.321 --> 00:35:26.321
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far predating Christianity that at least</v>

586
00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:29.600
<v Speaker 2>it's origins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the snake in the garden of Eden was</v>

587
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:32.300
<v Speaker 2>also Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is like what the hell?</v>

588
00:35:32.301 --> 00:35:33.134
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason for that as far as I can </v>

589
00:35:35.991 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 2>tell is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

590
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 3>we have this circuitry that detects </v>
<v Speaker 3>predators and a predator.</v>

591
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:43.463
<v Speaker 3>A good representation of a Predator is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>snake or a monster that incorporates </v>

592
00:35:46.501 --> 00:35:48.990
<v Speaker 3>snake like features like a dragon or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

593
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:52.800
<v Speaker 3>or a dinosaur with lots of teeth or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shark that lives under the water.</v>

594
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:54.710
<v Speaker 3>And we'll pull you down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

595
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:55.643
<v Speaker 3>because I suspect a lot of our ancestors</v>
<v Speaker 3>met a nasty death at the hands of Nile </v>

596
00:35:58.741 --> 00:35:59.574
<v Speaker 3>crocodiles while they were in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>African Veldt going down to get some </v>

597
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:04.070
<v Speaker 3>nice water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

598
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:07.570
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that jumps up and pulls</v>
<v Speaker 3>you under and you know,</v>

599
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:11.610
<v Speaker 3>not happens in your own life because </v>
<v Speaker 3>things jump up and pull you under,</v>

600
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and use the same circuitry.</v>

601
00:36:13.891 --> 00:36:14.724
<v Speaker 3>We use the same circuitry to process </v>
<v Speaker 3>unknown things that upset us as we once </v>

602
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 3>used to detect predators who were likely</v>
<v Speaker 3>to invade our space.</v>

603
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:25.343
<v Speaker 3>And so and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and human beings are capable of </v>

604
00:36:27.181 --> 00:36:28.350
<v Speaker 3>abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

605
00:36:28.351 --> 00:36:29.184
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could think about the real Predator </v>

606
00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:34.080
<v Speaker 3>that might invade your space and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a snake or a wolf or,</v>

607
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.240
<v Speaker 3>or some kind of monster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

608
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.410
<v Speaker 3>and that's pretty concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And biological chimps have that,</v>

609
00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:42.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chimps don't like snakes.</v>

610
00:36:42.031 --> 00:36:45.720
<v Speaker 3>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a chimp comes across a snake in the wild</v>

611
00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.880
<v Speaker 3>than like a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

612
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:49.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what live with chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

613
00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.793
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they're pythons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have constrictors there </v>

614
00:36:52.351 --> 00:36:54.100
<v Speaker 3>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

615
00:36:54.101 --> 00:36:58.500
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's like a 20 foot constrictor</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this and the chimp like stays a good</v>

616
00:36:58.501 --> 00:37:00.720
<v Speaker 3>distance away from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it won't leave.</v>

617
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:05.960
<v Speaker 3>And then it has this particular cry that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it outers that's called a snake ram wr.</v>

618
00:37:06.311 --> 00:37:08.940
<v Speaker 3>Ay Ay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it makes this noise,</v>

619
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 3>which means something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

620
00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:12.900
<v Speaker 3>that's a big snake.</v>

621
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:13.943
<v Speaker 3>And I actually mean that because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>circuits that primates use to utter </v>

622
00:37:18.541 --> 00:37:22.530
<v Speaker 3>distress calls are the same circuits </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we use to curse.</v>

623
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why people with Tourette Syndrome</v>

624
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:28.740
<v Speaker 3>swear because like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up with that?</v>

625
00:37:28.741 --> 00:37:32.160
<v Speaker 3>How can you have a neurological </v>
<v Speaker 3>condition that makes you swear?</v>

626
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that got her role as effect</v>

627
00:37:36.031 --> 00:37:36.864
<v Speaker 3>laden curses are mediated by a different</v>
<v Speaker 3>speech circuit and that's the speech </v>

628
00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:45.150
<v Speaker 3>circuit we share with the Predator </v>
<v Speaker 3>alarms of other primates.</v>

629
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.430
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

630
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:48.264
<v Speaker 3>this is the chimp stands there and makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>this snake noise and then all bunch of </v>

631
00:37:52.261 --> 00:37:53.094
<v Speaker 3>other chimps come running and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them stay a fairways from the </v>

632
00:37:56.311 --> 00:37:57.144
<v Speaker 3>snake and some of them get pretty close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they'll stand there and watch that </v>

633
00:37:59.911 --> 00:38:02.580
<v Speaker 3>snake for like 24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

634
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:04.740
<v Speaker 3>So they're fascinated by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

635
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:05.574
<v Speaker 3>if you've handled snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can understand that fascination </v>

636
00:38:07.561 --> 00:38:10.450
<v Speaker 3>because they're fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

637
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.470
<v Speaker 3>and they're numinous.</v>

638
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 3>I would say that that's the right way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting it.</v>

639
00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:18.780
<v Speaker 3>A numinous is a word that means </v>
<v Speaker 3>intrinsically meaningful,</v>

640
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:20.190
<v Speaker 3>like fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

641
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 3>you can't look away from fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

642
00:38:22.411 --> 00:38:23.910
<v Speaker 3>if you're sitting in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fireplace,</v>

643
00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:27.840
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're staring at it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's because you're all descended from</v>

644
00:38:27.841 --> 00:38:28.674
<v Speaker 3>the first mad chimpanzee who had some </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird genetic mutation that made it </v>

645
00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:38.590
<v Speaker 3>impossible for to stay away from fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the first chimp arsonist,</v>

646
00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.793
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

647
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.280
<v Speaker 3>and he figured it out and well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

648
00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:44.620
<v Speaker 3>now he was a chimp with a stick with </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire on it.</v>

649
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a mega chimp man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

650
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:48.873
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have that mutation in spades and no </v>

651
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 3>wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

652
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:58.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they,</v>

653
00:38:58.361 --> 00:38:59.194
<v Speaker 3>they make this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have this reaction to snakes and </v>

654
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:02.763
<v Speaker 3>chimps that have never seen a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're in a cage and you throw a </v>

655
00:39:05.141 --> 00:39:07.240
<v Speaker 3>rubber snake in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like bang,</v>

656
00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:09.700
<v Speaker 3>they hit the roof,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then they look at the snake,</v>

657
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like,</v>

658
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:14.590
<v Speaker 3>it's terrifying and fascinating at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>

659
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:17.500
<v Speaker 3>And you should look at the snake because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to know what it does,</v>

660
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:19.750
<v Speaker 3>but you should stay away from it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a snake,</v>

661
00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.613
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of screwed in terms of your </v>

662
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 3>motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

663
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:25.870
<v Speaker 3>One is get the hell away and the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

664
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:26.853
<v Speaker 3>while don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't let that thing do anything that </v>

665
00:39:28.811 --> 00:39:29.644
<v Speaker 3>you're not watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's really the reaction we </v>

666
00:39:32.171 --> 00:39:35.440
<v Speaker 3>have to the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying.</v>

667
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 3>But we watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

668
00:39:37.601 --> 00:39:38.434
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Meta story is that not only do we </v>

669
00:39:39.791 --> 00:39:41.920
<v Speaker 3>watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we go explore it.</v>

670
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:44.860
<v Speaker 3>And so you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well back in the garden of Eden,</v>

671
00:39:44.861 --> 00:39:47.230
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were living in trees,</v>

672
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.650
<v Speaker 3>the snakes used to come and eat us and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and our,</v>

673
00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:55.270
<v Speaker 3>our offspring more likely and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we weren't very happy about that.</v>

674
00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:00.540
<v Speaker 3>And then we figured out how to maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe by accident drop a stay a stick on</v>

675
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:04.690
<v Speaker 3>a snake and that was a good thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the snake didn't like that.</v>

676
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:08.920
<v Speaker 3>And then maybe the next thing we learned</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little later was to like actually take</v>

677
00:40:08.921 --> 00:40:09.754
<v Speaker 3>a stick and whack the snake with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can believe that the first </v>

678
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:18.490
<v Speaker 3>primate who figured out that was just as</v>
<v Speaker 3>popular as the Guy Who mastered fire.</v>

679
00:40:18.491 --> 00:40:21.880
<v Speaker 3>And so we're pretty good at whacking </v>
<v Speaker 3>state snakes with sticks,</v>

680
00:40:21.881 --> 00:40:22.714
<v Speaker 3>which is why a springfield has a snake </v>
<v Speaker 3>whacking day that's devoted to nothing </v>

681
00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:29.530
<v Speaker 3>but that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

682
00:40:29.531 --> 00:40:31.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know that simpsons </v>
<v Speaker 3>episode,</v>

683
00:40:31.481 --> 00:40:33.970
<v Speaker 3>but it's quite comical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

684
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:35.373
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you think about the snake as a </v>

685
00:40:36.521 --> 00:40:41.230
<v Speaker 3>Predator and it's the thing that invades</v>
<v Speaker 3>the garden always because you just can't</v>

686
00:40:41.231 --> 00:40:44.080
<v Speaker 3>keep snakes out of the damn garden no </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter how hard you try.</v>

687
00:40:44.081 --> 00:40:44.914
<v Speaker 3>And then you think of snakes and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think of medicine aches and like a </v>

688
00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:49.114
<v Speaker 3>medicine ache would be also a predator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that's the Predator that </v>

689
00:40:53.351 --> 00:40:54.184
<v Speaker 3>represents the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the destructive spirit of the other </v>

690
00:40:56.801 --> 00:40:59.260
<v Speaker 3>tribe because chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

691
00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:02.950
<v Speaker 3>are quite tribal and they definitely go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to war with one another.</v>

692
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:03.783
<v Speaker 3>And so you think you abstract out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of the Predator to represent </v>

693
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:08.463
<v Speaker 3>malevolence as such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you take that one step further </v>

694
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.920
<v Speaker 3>and you realize that the worst of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil predators is the human capacity for</v>

695
00:41:19.841 --> 00:41:22.120
<v Speaker 3>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then at that point,</v>

696
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.453
<v Speaker 3>you know you're starting to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say psychologize or </v>

697
00:41:25.841 --> 00:41:29.680
<v Speaker 3>spiritualize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of danger and making it make it</v>

698
00:41:29.681 --> 00:41:30.514
<v Speaker 3>into something that's conceptual and </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's psychological and </v>

699
00:41:34.911 --> 00:41:39.150
<v Speaker 3>something that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can face sort of on moss.</v>

700
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:40.003
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things people had to figure </v>

701
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:41.774
<v Speaker 3>out was how do you deal with danger?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you figure out how you deal with </v>

702
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:46.544
<v Speaker 3>a specific danger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then because human beings are so </v>

703
00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:50.000
<v Speaker 3>damn smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought,</v>

704
00:41:50.001 --> 00:41:50.834
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if we considered the class of all </v>

705
00:41:53.001 --> 00:41:53.834
<v Speaker 3>dangerous things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what if we considered a a mode </v>

706
00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:58.514
<v Speaker 3>of being that was the best mode of being</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the face of the class of all </v>

707
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:03.320
<v Speaker 3>dangerous things.</v>

708
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot better.</v>

709
00:42:04.671 --> 00:42:07.550
<v Speaker 3>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get solve all the dangerous problems</v>

710
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:08.563
<v Speaker 3>all at once instead of having to conjure</v>
<v Speaker 3>up a different solution for every </v>

711
00:42:11.661 --> 00:42:12.494
<v Speaker 3>dangerous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's basically as far as I can </v>

712
00:42:14.511 --> 00:42:18.620
<v Speaker 3>tell where the hero's story came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the hero story is basically,</v>

713
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a community.</v>

714
00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:24.170
<v Speaker 3>It's threatened by the emergence of some</v>
<v Speaker 3>old evil,</v>

715
00:42:24.171 --> 00:42:25.004
<v Speaker 3>often represented by a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of typical say of the Lord </v>

716
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:31.910
<v Speaker 3>of the rings stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a hero,</v>

717
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:34.340
<v Speaker 3>often a humble guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not always.</v>

718
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:39.200
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes a night decides he'll go out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and chase down the snake,</v>

719
00:42:39.201 --> 00:42:40.034
<v Speaker 3>maybe even or the serpent or the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe even in its layer and he'll </v>

720
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:44.474
<v Speaker 3>have a bunch of adventures on the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that transform him from useless naive </v>

721
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.633
<v Speaker 3>hobbit into sword wielding hero and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>confronts the Dragon and gets the gold </v>

722
00:42:55.731 --> 00:43:00.731
<v Speaker 3>and frees the people that it had </v>
<v Speaker 3>enslaved and then comes back transformed</v>

723
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:04.280
<v Speaker 3>to share what he's learned with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

724
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:04.851
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

725
00:43:04.851 --> 00:43:07.190
<v Speaker 3>that's the human story fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

726
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.353
<v Speaker 3>that's our basic instinctive pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's represented in narratives </v>

727
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:13.610
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's partly what this sea,</v>

728
00:43:13.611 --> 00:43:15.260
<v Speaker 3>this has meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

729
00:43:15.261 --> 00:43:17.660
<v Speaker 3>what this means?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>

730
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.610
<v Speaker 3>why do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

731
00:43:19.611 --> 00:43:20.444
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it draws on symbolic </v>

732
00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:23.780
<v Speaker 3>representations that you already </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

733
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:24.614
<v Speaker 3>You understand that a mess of tooth </v>
<v Speaker 3>snakes is not a good thing and that may </v>

734
00:43:30.051 --> 00:43:34.250
<v Speaker 3>be the sensible thing to do is stomp </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and</v>

735
00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:37.183
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you need an instruction </v>
<v Speaker 3>manual to figure out what the poster </v>

736
00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.060
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

737
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:42.283
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's two different representations of </v>

738
00:43:43.671 --> 00:43:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Hitler that sort of the Pro Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation.</v>

739
00:43:46.241 --> 00:43:49.290
<v Speaker 3>And I would say that's the Anti Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation.</v>

740
00:43:49.291 --> 00:43:50.990
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the real Hitler,</v>

741
00:43:50.991 --> 00:43:53.630
<v Speaker 3>who at this point does not look like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very happy clam.</v>

742
00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.830
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the known.</v>

743
00:43:56.831 --> 00:43:57.664
<v Speaker 3>That's culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's order and what's eternally </v>

744
00:44:00.651 --> 00:44:05.651
<v Speaker 3>juxtaposed to culture and the known and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the explored and order is the unknown.</v>

745
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:12.200
<v Speaker 3>And the unknown is a strange place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The unknown is actually.</v>

746
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:13.543
<v Speaker 3>It's a physical place like the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the place that when you're camping </v>

747
00:44:17.391 --> 00:44:18.224
<v Speaker 3>and you're around a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unknown is everything outside the </v>

748
00:44:21.171 --> 00:44:23.990
<v Speaker 3>circle of the light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you remember in the Lion King,</v>

749
00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.630
<v Speaker 3>you may not remember when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

750
00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:30.080
<v Speaker 3>when Mufasa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the king,</v>

751
00:44:30.081 --> 00:44:30.914
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goes and takes Simba up to show him his </v>

752
00:44:33.331 --> 00:44:37.110
<v Speaker 3>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says he is the king of everything.</v>

753
00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:40.110
<v Speaker 3>The light touches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a very old idea.</v>

754
00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 3>And you guys had no problem with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was fine.</v>

755
00:44:43.021 --> 00:44:45.480
<v Speaker 3>That made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that I would be on the light was the</v>

756
00:44:45.481 --> 00:44:48.090
<v Speaker 3>darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the elephant graveyard.</v>

757
00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:50.820
<v Speaker 3>That was death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the place of death and danger.</v>

758
00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:54.180
<v Speaker 3>That's where the hyenas hung out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you weren't supposed to go there.</v>

759
00:44:54.181 --> 00:44:55.260
<v Speaker 3>And so of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simba,</v>

760
00:44:55.261 --> 00:44:56.094
<v Speaker 3>because he's a rule breaking hero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like Harry Potter immediately goes </v>

761
00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

762
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:01.060
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

763
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.810
<v Speaker 3>that's like the forbidden fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same sort of idea.</v>

764
00:45:03.811 --> 00:45:04.644
<v Speaker 3>If you want someone to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best thing to do is tell them that </v>

765
00:45:09.601 --> 00:45:13.110
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't and not explain why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

766
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:13.944
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I said to you at the beginning of </v>

767
00:45:15.691 --> 00:45:17.400
<v Speaker 3>this class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

768
00:45:17.401 --> 00:45:18.234
<v Speaker 3>I've got one rule here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't sit in that chair no matter what </v>

769
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:27.210
<v Speaker 3>you'd be thinking the whole year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if I reminded you just what's</v>

770
00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:30.030
<v Speaker 3>up with that chair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's chairs magical.</v>

771
00:45:30.031 --> 00:45:32.040
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of you might even,</v>

772
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.830
<v Speaker 3>while you probably wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is a ridiculous example,</v>

773
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:35.843
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come to class early and sit in that </v>

774
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:40.020
<v Speaker 3>chair just to see what would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

775
00:45:40.021 --> 00:45:43.140
<v Speaker 3>and people are very curious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what we're like.</v>

776
00:45:43.141 --> 00:45:45.360
<v Speaker 3>And that's a very old story too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

777
00:45:45.361 --> 00:45:47.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like opening Pandora's box.</v>

778
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Don't open that box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll be sorry.</v>

779
00:45:49.081 --> 00:45:49.914
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

780
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:51.203
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the horrors of the world fly out </v>

781
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:53.783
<v Speaker 3>and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will open Pandora's box many times </v>

782
00:45:57.601 --> 00:45:58.434
<v Speaker 3>in your life because you know with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>family or maybe your mate or maybe your </v>

783
00:46:03.481 --> 00:46:04.314
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll have this idea that they have a </v>

784
00:46:06.541 --> 00:46:10.740
<v Speaker 3>box with things in it that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know about and you'll say,</v>

785
00:46:10.741 --> 00:46:11.574
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of curious about this </v>

786
00:46:13.171 --> 00:46:15.720
<v Speaker 3>particular event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so why don't you tell me about it?</v>

787
00:46:15.721 --> 00:46:17.030
<v Speaker 3>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>

788
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:17.873
<v Speaker 3>we probably really shouldn't open that </v>
<v Speaker 3>box and you keep bugging him and then </v>

789
00:46:20.701 --> 00:46:21.534
<v Speaker 3>they open it and then all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things fly out that you didn't expect </v>

790
00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:26.130
<v Speaker 3>and then maybe you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

791
00:46:26.131 --> 00:46:29.220
<v Speaker 3>it would have been better if I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have just left that damn box closed,</v>

792
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.413
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can do the same thing to </v>

793
00:46:31.681 --> 00:46:32.490
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

794
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.460
<v Speaker 3>Believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the Pandora's box idea,</v>

795
00:46:35.461 --> 00:46:37.200
<v Speaker 3>the forbidden fruit idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

796
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:38.483
<v Speaker 3>that's a major league idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of the reason in the Judeo </v>

797
00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.293
<v Speaker 3>Christian tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why people are saddled with the notion </v>

798
00:46:44.221 --> 00:46:49.221
<v Speaker 3>of original sin is because hyper </v>
<v Speaker 3>cortically developed chimpanzees without</v>

799
00:46:50.221 --> 00:46:53.760
<v Speaker 3>much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't keep their hands off things.</v>

800
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:54.863
<v Speaker 3>And so they keep exploring even when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they know better and every time they do </v>

801
00:46:59.761 --> 00:47:03.390
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they learn something that is,</v>

802
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.200
<v Speaker 3>that destroys the paradise that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>currently inhabit.</v>

803
00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's plenty in the.</v>

804
00:47:09.351 --> 00:47:11.280
<v Speaker 3>And I never learned anything in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

805
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.143
<v Speaker 3>It's of importance without it having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty damn destabilizing effect on you </v>

806
00:47:16.861 --> 00:47:18.600
<v Speaker 3>at the moment of realization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

807
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:22.680
<v Speaker 3>You learn something happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like whatever,</v>

808
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:23.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll,</v>

809
00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.560
<v Speaker 3>that means is that I was doing things </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

810
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.020
<v Speaker 3>like it's nice and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not informative.</v>

811
00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.040
<v Speaker 3>You do something and all hell breaks </v>
<v Speaker 3>loose.</v>

812
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:35.223
<v Speaker 3>That'll make you think now it's for sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might never stop thinking for the </v>

813
00:47:38.321 --> 00:47:41.680
<v Speaker 3>rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

814
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:42.514
<v Speaker 3>the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unknown is that which surrounds the </v>

815
00:47:45.491 --> 00:47:47.530
<v Speaker 3>known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unexplored territory.</v>

816
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:52.710
<v Speaker 3>It's usually represented as female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for a variety of reasons.</v>

817
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:54.130
<v Speaker 3>And not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as female.</v>

818
00:47:54.131 --> 00:47:55.690
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the right way to think about it</v>

819
00:47:55.691 --> 00:47:56.524
<v Speaker 3>as feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not the same thing because </v>

820
00:47:58.421 --> 00:48:03.421
<v Speaker 3>feminine is a symbolic category,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas female is like an actual female.</v>

821
00:48:03.971 --> 00:48:07.110
<v Speaker 3>And so you don't want to confuse the </v>
<v Speaker 3>metaphor with the,</v>

822
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.460
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the actuality.</v>

823
00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:10.763
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we had these social cognitive </v>

824
00:48:12.761 --> 00:48:14.240
<v Speaker 3>categories built in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

825
00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:17.140
<v Speaker 3>you might say masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminine and offspring,</v>

826
00:48:17.141 --> 00:48:20.800
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had to use what we could to represent</v>

827
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:21.663
<v Speaker 3>what we were attempting to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we kind of mapped them onto the </v>

828
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:30.010
<v Speaker 3>external realities of being the best we </v>
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>

829
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:31.330
<v Speaker 3>using what we could.</v>

830
00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:32.590
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

831
00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:33.424
<v Speaker 3>nature is benevolent and it's fruitful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All things come from nature and all </v>

832
00:48:38.681 --> 00:48:40.420
<v Speaker 3>things come from the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

833
00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Because the known is already there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the unknown that manifests the new,</v>

834
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:48.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's part of the reason for the</v>

835
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.670
<v Speaker 3>characterization of the unknown as </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminine.</v>

836
00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:52.933
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's also the case that </v>

837
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:58.690
<v Speaker 3>women play a massive role in sexual </v>
<v Speaker 3>selection among human beings.</v>

838
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.740
<v Speaker 3>So that from an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

839
00:49:02.741 --> 00:49:05.560
<v Speaker 3>you're twice as likely to be a failure </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a man than you are.</v>

840
00:49:05.561 --> 00:49:06.394
<v Speaker 3>If you're a woman in that you have twice</v>
<v Speaker 3>as many female ancestors as male </v>

841
00:49:11.111 --> 00:49:12.310
<v Speaker 3>ancestors and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

842
00:49:12.311 --> 00:49:13.840
<v Speaker 3>that's impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

843
00:49:13.841 --> 00:49:18.040
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is imagine that every</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman has one child,</v>

844
00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:21.520
<v Speaker 3>half the men have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other half have zero.</v>

845
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:26.470
<v Speaker 3>And so end of problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's basically how it works out.</v>

846
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:31.390
<v Speaker 3>So women are more choosy maters than men</v>
<v Speaker 3>by a substantial margin.</v>

847
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.053
<v Speaker 3>There was a funny study done by the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who established one of the big dating </v>

848
00:49:37.721 --> 00:49:38.554
<v Speaker 3>sites and he looked at how women rated </v>
<v Speaker 3>men and they rated the 50th percentile </v>

849
00:49:46.991 --> 00:49:47.824
<v Speaker 3>man at the 15th percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 85 percent of men were below average </v>

850
00:49:52.061 --> 00:49:56.590
<v Speaker 3>according to women's ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now men had their same arbitrary choices</v>

851
00:49:56.591 --> 00:49:57.424
<v Speaker 3>because of course they preferred younger</v>
<v Speaker 3>women to older women and they were more </v>

852
00:50:02.171 --> 00:50:03.590
<v Speaker 3>swayed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say by um,</v>

853
00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:05.403
<v Speaker 3>by attractiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that didn't have nearly as big an </v>

854
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:10.740
<v Speaker 3>effect on their actually actual rating </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

855
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.780
<v Speaker 3>of women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

856
00:50:12.781 --> 00:50:13.840
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

857
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.510
<v Speaker 3>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a Darwinian perspective,</v>

858
00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.980
<v Speaker 3>nature is that which selects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all it is.</v>

859
00:50:20.981 --> 00:50:25.981
<v Speaker 3>And so sexual selection plays a massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>role in human evolution.</v>

860
00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that we have these massive</v>

861
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.843
<v Speaker 2>brains is very likely a consequence of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive feedback loop and sexual </v>

862
00:50:32.391 --> 00:50:34.160
<v Speaker 2>selection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

863
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:34.994
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise that's the only time </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get really rapid changes in </v>

864
00:50:38.391 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary space where you get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>process going.</v>

865
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:43.034
<v Speaker 2>That reinforces itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a little preference for </v>

866
00:50:45.411 --> 00:50:46.244
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and then that produces more</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent men and women and then </v>

867
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:52.050
<v Speaker 2>there's a little more preference for </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and you know,</v>

868
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:55.270
<v Speaker 2>maybe then that turns into the ability </v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak and,</v>

869
00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:56.143
<v Speaker 2>or to master fire and then there's way </v>
<v Speaker 2>more selection for intelligence in the </v>

870
00:50:59.421 --> 00:51:02.350
<v Speaker 2>brain just goes like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

871
00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:07.280
<v Speaker 2>and women have paid a pretty big price </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that because your hips are basically</v>

872
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:11.690
<v Speaker 2>so wide that you can barely run and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were any wider than you couldn't.</v>

873
00:51:11.691 --> 00:51:12.524
<v Speaker 2>And of course the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pelvic passageway through which the </v>

874
00:51:15.591 --> 00:51:20.591
<v Speaker 2>baby travels is too small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's really painful and dangerous and</v>

875
00:51:20.721 --> 00:51:23.570
<v Speaker 2>the baby's head has to compress quite a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

876
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:24.403
<v Speaker 2>I mean they come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cone shaped often and then they're born </v>

877
00:51:27.801 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 2>really young so you have to take care of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them forever.</v>

878
00:51:30.741 --> 00:51:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Like what the hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

879
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:34.460
<v Speaker 2>a deer is born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fawn is born and it's like two seconds</v>

880
00:51:34.461 --> 00:51:37.160
<v Speaker 2>later it's standing and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>running from a lion.</v>

881
00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:38.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

882
00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:39.493
<v Speaker 2>it's like 15 minutes later and a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you just lies there and you </v>

883
00:51:44.961 --> 00:51:47.630
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>utters plaintive noises.</v>

884
00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:48.464
<v Speaker 2>That's all it can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that does that for like 10 months </v>

885
00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:56.210
<v Speaker 2>before it could skitter away from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>slothy if it was predatory,</v>

886
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:57.044
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you really got to take care of those </v>

887
00:51:58.851 --> 00:52:02.270
<v Speaker 2>creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a big price to pay.</v>

888
00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a big price to pay for our </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical evolution.</v>

889
00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:06.283
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's some of the symbolic </v>

890
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:11.720
<v Speaker 2>representations represents </v>
<v Speaker 2>representatives of the unknown,</v>

891
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:15.460
<v Speaker 2>the unconscious dot uneasy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and four of the ID.</v>

892
00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:18.020
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort of Freud's representation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the unknown,</v>

893
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:21.320
<v Speaker 2>the terrors of the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the unknown.</v>

894
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:23.173
<v Speaker 2>The monsters that lurk there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the source and the resting place of all </v>

895
00:52:26.511 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The great mother,</v>

896
00:52:28.341 --> 00:52:30.830
<v Speaker 2>the Queen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Matrix which means mater,</v>

897
00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.380
<v Speaker 2>which means mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the matriarch matter,</v>

898
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:35.000
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the container,</v>

899
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:38.030
<v Speaker 2>the Cornucopia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the object to be fertilized,</v>

900
00:52:38.031 --> 00:52:39.860
<v Speaker 2>the source of all things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fecund,</v>

901
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:43.460
<v Speaker 2>the pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strange,</v>

902
00:52:43.461 --> 00:52:45.260
<v Speaker 2>the emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foreigner,</v>

903
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:48.350
<v Speaker 2>the place of returned and rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The deeper the valley,</v>

904
00:52:48.351 --> 00:52:50.240
<v Speaker 2>the cleft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cave hell,</v>

905
00:52:50.241 --> 00:52:53.690
<v Speaker 2>death and the grave because it's beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moon.</v>

906
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Ruler of the night and mysterious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark and matter and the earth.</v>

907
00:52:59.060 --> 00:52:59.893
<v Speaker 2>And you know all this because when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch a movie that's rife with symbolic </v>

908
00:53:03.651 --> 00:53:04.484
<v Speaker 2>representations that draws on those </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying metaphors and they're </v>

909
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.880
<v Speaker 2>natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean where does it,</v>

910
00:53:08.881 --> 00:53:11.610
<v Speaker 2>which live well in a swamp for God's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sake.</v>

911
00:53:11.611 --> 00:53:14.480
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't live in the penthouse of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York Tower.</v>

912
00:53:14.481 --> 00:53:16.700
<v Speaker 2>She lives at a swamp and it's dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

913
00:53:16.701 --> 00:53:18.800
<v Speaker 2>And if the moon's up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a better.</v>

914
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.770
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it could be a crescent moon or</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it could be a full moon,</v>

915
00:53:21.771 --> 00:53:22.604
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is live in the right place if </v>

916
00:53:24.591 --> 00:53:25.770
<v Speaker 2>you're going to understand it</v>

917
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.140
<v Speaker 3>and you all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you understand all of that.</v>

918
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:32.940
<v Speaker 3>And it's part of the structure of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination you could say.</v>

919
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:38.360
<v Speaker 3>And so it's part of the unspoken </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantastical Ah,</v>

920
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:42.630
<v Speaker 3>imagination that unites all of us and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes us specifically human.</v>

921
00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:44.943
<v Speaker 3>There is a good representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>underworld and the place of </v>

922
00:53:47.611 --> 00:53:50.820
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's hell in Isis.</v>

923
00:53:50.821 --> 00:53:54.990
<v Speaker 3>In Egypt was queen of the underworld and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the underworld generally has a queen and</v>

924
00:53:54.991 --> 00:53:57.960
<v Speaker 3>she usually shows up when order falls </v>
<v Speaker 3>apart.</v>

925
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:02.460
<v Speaker 3>And so you go to the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When your life falls apart,</v>

926
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.270
<v Speaker 3>that's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you see these stories of the</v>

927
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:08.290
<v Speaker 3>hero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

928
00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:12.510
<v Speaker 3>journeying to unknown lands of terror </v>
<v Speaker 3>and danger,</v>

929
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.210
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens to you.</v>

930
00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:16.980
<v Speaker 3>It happens to you all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you're,</v>

931
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:21.300
<v Speaker 3>you're in this little safe space like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hobbit in the Shire,</v>

932
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:22.373
<v Speaker 3>and then you know there's a great evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>brewing somewhere and you can no longer </v>

933
00:54:26.101 --> 00:54:26.640
<v Speaker 3>ignore it.</v>

934
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.473
<v Speaker 3>So off you go into the land of terror </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uncertainty and better to go on </v>

935
00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:34.680
<v Speaker 3>purpose then accidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure,</v>

936
00:54:34.681 --> 00:54:38.760
<v Speaker 3>because at least you can be prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we also know that if you're going to</v>

937
00:54:38.761 --> 00:54:42.120
<v Speaker 3>face a threat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you face it voluntarily,</v>

938
00:54:42.121 --> 00:54:46.260
<v Speaker 3>what happens is your body activates </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself for exploration and mastery.</v>

939
00:54:46.261 --> 00:54:50.010
<v Speaker 3>But if you face it voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same size threat,</v>

940
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.180
<v Speaker 3>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

941
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.890
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you revert to pray,</v>

942
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:56.370
<v Speaker 3>pray mode and you're frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's way,</v>

943
00:54:56.371 --> 00:54:58.590
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way more stressful.</v>

944
00:54:58.591 --> 00:54:59.424
<v Speaker 3>It's way harder on your body and so it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>better to keep your eyes open and watch </v>

945
00:55:04.291 --> 00:55:06.400
<v Speaker 3>for emergent threats because you all </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

946
00:55:06.401 --> 00:55:07.234
<v Speaker 3>you know what you're not doing quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>right and where your life is likely to </v>

947
00:55:09.451 --> 00:55:11.400
<v Speaker 3>unravel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You all have a sense of that.</v>

948
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:14.970
<v Speaker 3>And the best thing to do is to not </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignore that,</v>

949
00:55:14.971 --> 00:55:16.950
<v Speaker 3>to pay attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch it,</v>

950
00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.590
<v Speaker 3>and to take corrective action early.</v>

951
00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:23.610
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stay on top of things and things,</v>

952
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:24.803
<v Speaker 3>your little trip to the underworld might</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a few minutes long instead of a </v>

953
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:30.690
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe that produces posttraumatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress disorder,</v>

954
00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:33.900
<v Speaker 3>knocks you out for four or five years </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you never recover.</v>

955
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:35.940
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

956
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:36.893
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what these kind of symbolic </v>

957
00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:39.330
<v Speaker 3>representations mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

958
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.940
<v Speaker 3>those are states of being that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

959
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:47.190
<v Speaker 3>that indicate being devoured and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>be devoured by your own unconscious.</v>

960
00:55:48.121 --> 00:55:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happens all the time.</v>

961
00:55:49.711 --> 00:55:50.910
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

962
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.193
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's an autonomous thing in some </v>

963
00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:55.141
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

964
00:55:55.141 --> 00:55:55.974
<v Speaker 3>like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get depressed or if you get </v>

965
00:55:57.421 --> 00:55:59.970
<v Speaker 3>really anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any control over that.</v>

966
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.930
<v Speaker 3>It's like it sweeps up over you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulls you down.</v>

967
00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Wydown well down is where you go when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sad.</v>

968
00:56:08.401 --> 00:56:09.750
<v Speaker 3>You don't go up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

969
00:56:09.751 --> 00:56:10.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm up today.</v>

970
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's too bad.</v>

971
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.200
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's man.</v>

972
00:56:13.201 --> 00:56:15.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm down today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And while that's partly this,</v>

973
00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:20.370
<v Speaker 3>and it's partly because this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>subordinate and it's partly because down</v>

974
00:56:20.371 --> 00:56:24.580
<v Speaker 3>is closer to the ground and farther from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sky,</v>

975
00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:28.660
<v Speaker 3>like there's all sorts of reasons you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling down rather than op.</v>

976
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:30.520
<v Speaker 3>Op is where you're aiming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

977
00:56:30.521 --> 00:56:31.090
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mop.</v>

978
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.070
<v Speaker 3>You don't aim down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

979
00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:34.653
<v Speaker 3>the reason those phrases make sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're locked deeply into this </v>

980
00:56:37.661 --> 00:56:38.494
<v Speaker 3>underlying structure of imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And while those are the architects of </v>

981
00:56:42.941 --> 00:56:45.830
<v Speaker 3>the archetypal structures according to </v>
<v Speaker 3>young and um,</v>

982
00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that he's far as I can tell</v>

983
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:54.230
<v Speaker 3>he's dead accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

984
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.900
<v Speaker 3>and I think we understand the biology of</v>
<v Speaker 3>such things much better than we did.</v>

985
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.240
<v Speaker 3>So there is more representation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

986
00:57:01.241 --> 00:57:04.440
<v Speaker 3>she's quite the friendly creature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Kelly.</v>

987
00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like this representation better.</v>

988
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 3>Those are heads by the way and hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

989
00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:12.860
<v Speaker 3>so she sort of represents well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very complex thing.</v>

990
00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 3>She represents death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she represents transformation in this.</v>

991
00:57:17.441 --> 00:57:19.930
<v Speaker 3>I really liked this representation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's brilliant.</v>

992
00:57:19.931 --> 00:57:20.764
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that what the people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing who formulated these </v>

993
00:57:22.541 --> 00:57:23.374
<v Speaker 3>representations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they were trying to do was to make </v>

994
00:57:26.891 --> 00:57:30.940
<v Speaker 3>a representation of the domain of threat</v>
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>

995
00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.193
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that they could deal with the idea </v>

996
00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:34.720
<v Speaker 3>that because we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>threat,</v>

997
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:35.801
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

998
00:57:35.801 --> 00:57:37.150
<v Speaker 3>What the hell does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

999
00:57:37.151 --> 00:57:40.660
<v Speaker 3>threat is the category of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>threatening things.</v>

1000
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:41.494
<v Speaker 3>And so then you can think about threat </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can think about threat across </v>

1001
00:57:44.891 --> 00:57:45.724
<v Speaker 3>all those individual instances and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can figure out how to deal with </v>

1002
00:57:48.281 --> 00:57:49.150
<v Speaker 3>threat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1003
00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.073
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the best way to be in the world </v>

1004
00:57:52.541 --> 00:57:55.180
<v Speaker 3>so that you most effectively deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>threat.</v>

1005
00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:59.230
<v Speaker 3>While that's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apart from how do you deal with pain,</v>

1006
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.110
<v Speaker 3>that sort of like the ultimate question </v>
<v Speaker 3>of human beings.</v>

1007
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:04.450
<v Speaker 3>You want to be terrified?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1008
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.090
<v Speaker 3>So you want to be in danger?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1009
00:58:07.091 --> 00:58:07.924
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better figure out how to deal with </v>

1010
00:58:09.071 --> 00:58:10.180
<v Speaker 3>threats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first of all,</v>

1011
00:58:10.181 --> 00:58:11.014
<v Speaker 3>you have to conceptualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll take a look at this </v>

1012
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:16.760
<v Speaker 3>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now it's Kelly sheer.</v>

1013
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.610
<v Speaker 3>Her hair is on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1014
00:58:18.611 --> 00:58:19.480
<v Speaker 3>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1015
00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:22.180
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a numinous phenomena.</v>

1016
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:26.320
<v Speaker 3>Dangerous but transformative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's wearing a headdress of skulls.</v>

1017
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has a weapon in this hand.</v>

1018
00:58:29.551 --> 00:58:30.880
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1019
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:34.360
<v Speaker 3>she has a tiger's tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She often has a snake around her waist.</v>

1020
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Need none of these do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she often does,</v>

1021
00:58:37.991 --> 00:58:39.400
<v Speaker 3>but in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stem,</v>

1022
00:58:39.401 --> 00:58:42.880
<v Speaker 3>that's because snake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've already covered that.</v>

1023
00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:44.553
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things that looked like snakes </v>

1024
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:48.250
<v Speaker 3>here aren't you notice how her belly is </v>
<v Speaker 3>concave?</v>

1025
00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:49.563
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because she's just given birth to </v>

1026
00:58:50.621 --> 00:58:51.454
<v Speaker 3>this unfortunate person that she happens</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be standing on and she's eating him </v>

1027
00:58:54.461 --> 00:58:58.960
<v Speaker 3>intestines first and that's a fire ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he is in,</v>

1028
00:58:58.961 --> 00:59:00.940
<v Speaker 3>and then it's got skulls on the inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

1029
00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:03.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that supposed to do?</v>

1030
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:04.563
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>partly it's supposed to represent that </v>

1031
00:59:06.101 --> 00:59:08.380
<v Speaker 3>which terrifies you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1032
00:59:08.381 --> 00:59:09.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough,</v>

1033
00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:10.563
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't imagine you saw those </v>

1034
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:12.814
<v Speaker 3>things in there before I explain them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but someone who was familiar with that </v>

1035
00:59:15.281 --> 00:59:16.114
<v Speaker 3>image would know what it meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like some poor artist was sitting </v>

1036
00:59:19.121 --> 00:59:19.841
<v Speaker 3>there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1037
00:59:19.841 --> 00:59:21.860
<v Speaker 3>how do I represent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1038
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1039
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:24.283
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll put that down and then we won't </v>

1040
00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:26.960
<v Speaker 3>look at it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1041
00:59:26.961 --> 00:59:31.961
<v Speaker 3>and then what do you do with this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You make sacrifices to it and you think,</v>

1042
00:59:32.031 --> 00:59:35.570
<v Speaker 3>well that's kind of primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1043
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:39.500
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that doesn't really exist.</v>

1044
00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Well it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's an amalgam of threat symbols,</v>

1045
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:45.350
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

1046
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.340
<v Speaker 3>So it exists as an abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If nothing else do you offer it?</v>

1047
00:59:49.341 --> 00:59:51.650
<v Speaker 3>Sacrifices?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1048
00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:53.090
<v Speaker 3>what the hell do you think you do?</v>

1049
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:54.343
<v Speaker 3>What do you do it in class?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why aren't you like drinking vodka and </v>

1050
00:59:57.141 --> 00:59:59.120
<v Speaker 3>snorting cocaine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1051
00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:04.160
<v Speaker 3>because you could be doing that instead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here you are listening to me,</v>

1052
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:06.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slaving away in university,</v>

1053
01:00:06.681 --> 01:00:08.030
<v Speaker 3>you're young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1054
01:00:08.031 --> 01:00:10.580
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got nothing better to do than sit</v>

1055
01:00:10.581 --> 01:00:11.414
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what you're willing to forego </v>

1056
01:00:14.181 --> 01:00:17.090
<v Speaker 3>today's pleasure for tomorrow's </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage.</v>

1057
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:18.103
<v Speaker 3>And that's what sacrifice is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And human being's discovered that </v>

1058
01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:23.330
<v Speaker 3>dramatically first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1059
01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.970
<v Speaker 3>like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're apes for God's sake.</v>

1060
01:00:25.971 --> 01:00:28.010
<v Speaker 3>We didn't just leap up and think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1061
01:00:28.011 --> 01:00:30.200
<v Speaker 3>we better save for tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1062
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.043
<v Speaker 3>we took thousands of years for that idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>to emerge and it emerged in dramatic </v>

1063
01:00:35.481 --> 01:00:37.220
<v Speaker 3>form and it was sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1064
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.593
<v Speaker 3>society is sort of like a god no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they weren't thinking this through </v>

1065
01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:42.374
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to represent society </v>

1066
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.820
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like this masculine God.</v>

1067
01:00:46.821 --> 01:00:48.620
<v Speaker 3>That's always judging the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1068
01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.840
<v Speaker 3>That's everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all at the same time.</v>

1069
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:51.381
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1070
01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

1071
01:00:52.221 --> 01:00:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what do you have to do with it?</v>

1072
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to give it what it wants.</v>

1073
01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:57.643
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have to give it what it </v>

1074
01:00:58.551 --> 01:01:02.180
<v Speaker 3>wants?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it'll crush you if you don't.</v>

1075
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:03.433
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're lucky and you give it the </v>

1076
01:01:06.531 --> 01:01:10.610
<v Speaker 3>right sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it will smile on you and you get to</v>

1077
01:01:10.611 --> 01:01:12.470
<v Speaker 3>have a good life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was like,</v>

1078
01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:15.650
<v Speaker 3>that was the major discovery of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1079
01:01:15.651 --> 01:01:20.240
<v Speaker 3>That was the killer discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the discovery of the future,</v>

1080
01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:22.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we discovered the future as a place and </v>

1081
01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:27.710
<v Speaker 3>it was a place that you could bargain </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1082
01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:30.440
<v Speaker 3>You can bargain with the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1083
01:01:30.441 --> 01:01:32.630
<v Speaker 3>That's just what an idea that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1084
01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:34.310
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so unlikely.</v>

1085
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you bargain with the future while</v>

1086
01:01:37.821 --> 01:01:39.470
<v Speaker 3>you give it what it wants?</v>

1087
01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:40.573
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of that's you maintain your social </v>

1088
01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:46.190
<v Speaker 3>relationship and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make yourself useful to other people</v>

1089
01:01:46.191 --> 01:01:51.080
<v Speaker 3>and you shape yourself so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooperate with people and you,</v>

1090
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:52.633
<v Speaker 3>you don't act impulsively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you squirrel something away </v>

1091
01:01:55.791 --> 01:01:58.850
<v Speaker 3>for the next harvest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're hungry and you know,</v>

1092
01:01:58.851 --> 01:02:03.851
<v Speaker 3>and then the future isn't hell and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>make the proper sacrifices.</v>

1093
01:02:04.071 --> 01:02:04.904
<v Speaker 3>And so if you sacrifice to Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then she turns into her opposite and </v>

1094
01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.580
<v Speaker 3>showers benevolence on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's mother nature,</v>

1095
01:02:13.581 --> 01:02:14.414
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1096
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:16.850
<v Speaker 3>look out for Mother Nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1097
01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.253
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two weeks out in the right now and your </v>

1098
01:02:20.101 --> 01:02:23.430
<v Speaker 3>dad and it's not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if it's the spring,</v>

1099
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:26.550
<v Speaker 3>you'll last longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the bugs eat you.</v>

1100
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:29.640
<v Speaker 3>And so that's not very fun either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So nature,</v>

1101
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:33.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bent on your destruction,</v>

1102
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.200
<v Speaker 3>but if you treat it properly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>carefully and make the right sacrifices,</v>

1103
01:02:37.201 --> 01:02:42.201
<v Speaker 3>then maybe one of her trees will offer </v>
<v Speaker 3>you some fruit and that would be okay.</v>

1104
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.730
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>

1105
01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:47.100
<v Speaker 3>lots of people died trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that out.</v>

1106
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:51.390
<v Speaker 3>So here's another way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

1107
01:02:51.391 --> 01:02:53.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>order and chaos,</v>

1108
01:02:53.011 --> 01:02:55.080
<v Speaker 3>known unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unexplored territory,</v>

1109
01:02:55.081 --> 01:02:57.090
<v Speaker 3>unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love this.</v>

1110
01:02:57.091 --> 01:02:57.924
<v Speaker 3>This is the Taoist symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a symbol of being and being isn't </v>

1111
01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:05.280
<v Speaker 3>reality as you would conceptualize it as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a scientist.</v>

1112
01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:10.610
<v Speaker 3>It's more like reality as it manifests </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself to you as a living thing,</v>

1113
01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:12.920
<v Speaker 3>which is completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1114
01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:15.960
<v Speaker 3>science extracts out all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjectivity,</v>

1115
01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.213
<v Speaker 3>all it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is an array of objective facts of </v>

1116
01:03:19.201 --> 01:03:21.810
<v Speaker 3>equivalent value and that's part of its </v>
<v Speaker 3>method,</v>

1117
01:03:21.811 --> 01:03:23.670
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the world in which you </v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

1118
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:27.420
<v Speaker 3>The world in which you live is full of </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation and emotion.</v>

1119
01:03:27.421 --> 01:03:31.290
<v Speaker 3>It's full of terror and pain and joy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>frustration and,</v>

1120
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.690
<v Speaker 3>and other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

1121
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.480
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1122
01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:37.740
<v Speaker 3>well that's what this is.</v>

1123
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.240
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the real world.</v>

1124
01:03:39.241 --> 01:03:40.770
<v Speaker 3>And what is it made out of?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1125
01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.530
<v Speaker 3>it's made out of all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1126
01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:46.300
<v Speaker 3>that can get out of hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1127
01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:47.423
<v Speaker 3>because the explored territory and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>known can get so damn tight that it's </v>

1128
01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:54.780
<v Speaker 3>nothing but a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's all those things you don't</v>

1129
01:03:54.781 --> 01:03:55.614
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's pretty exciting because you </v>

1130
01:03:56.641 --> 01:03:57.474
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to go find out some things you </v>

1131
01:03:58.291 --> 01:04:00.810
<v Speaker 3>don't know and that adds a lot of spice </v>
<v Speaker 3>to life.</v>

1132
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:01.793
<v Speaker 3>You want a little adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to go out with someone </v>

1133
01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:07.470
<v Speaker 3>who's so predictable that you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything about them in a week.</v>

1134
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:09.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're hyper conservative,</v>

1135
01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.330
<v Speaker 3>you want to go out with someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>got there a little erratic,</v>

1136
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.390
<v Speaker 3>like not too erratic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say they're a little dangerous,</v>

1137
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.433
<v Speaker 3>perhaps not too dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of that at least you want </v>

1138
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.700
<v Speaker 3>predictability with a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>unpredictability in there.</v>

1139
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what this means.</v>

1140
01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.094
<v Speaker 3>It's thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's predictability with a little </v>

1141
01:04:27.481 --> 01:04:28.314
<v Speaker 3>unpredictability in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what that also means is that what </v>

1142
01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:34.620
<v Speaker 3>you know can be turned into what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know just like that.</v>

1143
01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.500
<v Speaker 3>And now it's going to happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of times in your life,</v>

1144
01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:39.660
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone close to you dies,</v>

1145
01:04:39.661 --> 01:04:41.550
<v Speaker 3>suddenly it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poof,</v>

1146
01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.940
<v Speaker 3>order turns into chaos and now you're in</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>

1147
01:04:44.941 --> 01:04:47.100
<v Speaker 3>And what the hell are you going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

1148
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.113
<v Speaker 3>And that's a good question because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to know what to do there because </v>

1149
01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:55.830
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be there and it happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you when your dreams fall apart,</v>

1150
01:04:55.831 --> 01:04:56.664
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean your dreams for your life or you </v>

1151
01:04:58.550 --> 01:04:59.383
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you discover something awful about </v>

1152
01:05:00.571 --> 01:05:02.940
<v Speaker 3>yourself that you didn't know or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1153
01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:05.640
<v Speaker 3>it flips on you all the time and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>small ways.</v>

1154
01:05:05.641 --> 01:05:08.910
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a fight with a friend or in big</v>

1155
01:05:08.911 --> 01:05:12.390
<v Speaker 3>ways that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wipe you out for while indefinitely</v>

1156
01:05:12.391 --> 01:05:16.710
<v Speaker 3>sometimes because you can fall into </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos and never get out.</v>

1157
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the people who are trapped in the</v>

1158
01:05:18.971 --> 01:05:19.804
<v Speaker 3>belly of the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't necessarily that when you </v>

1159
01:05:21.941 --> 01:05:25.450
<v Speaker 3>descend into chaos that you learn </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and you get back out.</v>

1160
01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:29.470
<v Speaker 3>You could just be stuck there suffering </v>
<v Speaker 3>until you die.</v>

1161
01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:30.760
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1162
01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:32.380
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't recommend that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1163
01:05:32.381 --> 01:05:36.490
<v Speaker 3>it's something to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it happens to people all the time.</v>

1164
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:38.980
<v Speaker 3>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see them wandering around,</v>

1165
01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:42.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shattered on the streets of Toronto,</v>

1166
01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:44.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're done.</v>

1167
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:48.760
<v Speaker 3>They're in chaos and there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos around them that you won't even go</v>

1168
01:05:48.761 --> 01:05:52.150
<v Speaker 3>near them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The chaos spreads like eight feet around</v>

1169
01:05:52.151 --> 01:05:54.220
<v Speaker 3>them and so when you see someone like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1170
01:05:54.221 --> 01:05:55.054
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well first we're not going to look too </v>

1171
01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.333
<v Speaker 3>closely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people like that often don't like </v>

1172
01:05:58.961 --> 01:05:59.794
<v Speaker 3>you to look at them because that also </v>
<v Speaker 3>helps them remember where they are and </v>

1173
01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:06.520
<v Speaker 3>that's no pleasant thing and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to just stay away from that.</v>

1174
01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you'll cross the street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you'll keep your head down,</v>

1175
01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:10.803
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going anywhere near that </v>

1176
01:06:12.221 --> 01:06:15.040
<v Speaker 3>chaos and no bloody wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1177
01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:15.933
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you don't think about it much after </v>

1178
01:06:17.531 --> 01:06:18.364
<v Speaker 3>you pass it because it's a hell of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to think about and what are you </v>

1179
01:06:22.301 --> 01:06:24.760
<v Speaker 3>going to do about it anyway so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what to do about it.</v>

1180
01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:27.610
<v Speaker 3>You might just make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1181
01:06:27.611 --> 01:06:28.870
<v Speaker 3>so chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1182
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:34.720
<v Speaker 3>that's the other half of life and it can</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn into order sometimes better order.</v>

1183
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:36.730
<v Speaker 3>That's actually what you do when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>explore,</v>

1184
01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:37.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You explore,</v>

1185
01:06:37.901 --> 01:06:40.120
<v Speaker 3>you find out something new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not too new,</v>

1186
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:42.800
<v Speaker 3>not to Pandora boxy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1187
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.963
<v Speaker 3>bite off as much as you can chew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no more and so that rearranges the </v>

1188
01:06:48.611 --> 01:06:49.444
<v Speaker 3>way you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're doing it voluntarily so you </v>

1189
01:06:51.371 --> 01:06:56.371
<v Speaker 3>can kind of tolerate the recalibration </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you strengthen the order,</v>

1190
01:06:57.071 --> 01:06:57.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1191
01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:58.173
<v Speaker 3>Because now you become more competent </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would say that you're trying to </v>

1192
01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:06.940
<v Speaker 3>live on the edge between order and chaos</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I and I mean that's a real place.</v>

1193
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:09.010
<v Speaker 3>That's an actual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a Meta place,</v>

1194
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's more real than places because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so old.</v>

1195
01:07:12.731 --> 01:07:16.120
<v Speaker 3>It's such an old place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really exists and your nervous system</v>

1196
01:07:16.121 --> 01:07:19.060
<v Speaker 3>knows that it sees the world this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1197
01:07:19.061 --> 01:07:19.894
<v Speaker 3>the right hemisphere is roughly </v>
<v Speaker 3>specialized for chaos and the left </v>

1198
01:07:22.901 --> 01:07:25.300
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere is roughly specialized for </v>
<v Speaker 3>order,</v>

1199
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:26.343
<v Speaker 3>which is why the left hemisphere tends </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have the linguistic elements and why </v>

1200
01:07:29.651 --> 01:07:30.484
<v Speaker 3>people are right handed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the right hemisphere has a more </v>

1201
01:07:32.231 --> 01:07:33.064
<v Speaker 3>diffuse structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more associated with negative </v>

1202
01:07:35.231 --> 01:07:36.064
<v Speaker 3>emotion and imagination and the to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate between each other through </v>

1203
01:07:39.101 --> 01:07:39.934
<v Speaker 3>the Corpus callosum and the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemisphere appears to update the less </v>

1204
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.300
<v Speaker 3>left hemisphere kind of slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often in dreams.</v>

1205
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:50.200
<v Speaker 3>And so if you are hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your right hemisphere has hurt,</v>

1206
01:07:50.201 --> 01:07:53.140
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back here in the prior lobe,</v>

1207
01:07:53.141 --> 01:07:56.680
<v Speaker 3>then you lose the left part of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

1208
01:07:56.860 --> 01:08:00.400
<v Speaker 3>You can't move it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also lose the idea that you have</v>

1209
01:08:00.401 --> 01:08:03.520
<v Speaker 3>a left part of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like blindness.</v>

1210
01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:07.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a blindness to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if someone comes along and says,</v>

1211
01:08:07.301 --> 01:08:09.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not moving your left arm,</v>

1212
01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:10.781
<v Speaker 3>you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1213
01:08:10.781 --> 01:08:14.620
<v Speaker 3>well my arthritis is bothering me to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>I moved it for six months.</v>

1214
01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arthritis is bothering today,</v>

1215
01:08:16.521 --> 01:08:19.110
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't move your left foot like,</v>

1216
01:08:19.111 --> 01:08:19.944
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1217
01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:22.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm too tired.</v>

1218
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.073
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happened is the left hemisphere </v>

1219
01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:26.293
<v Speaker 3>has a representation of the body and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not being updated because the part </v>

1220
01:08:29.721 --> 01:08:33.710
<v Speaker 3>of the brain that would notice that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>left is gone because of a stroke.</v>

1221
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:34.783
<v Speaker 3>It isn't there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the left already has a model and </v>

1222
01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:38.763
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just it's hard to change your model of </v>

1223
01:08:41.241 --> 01:08:43.220
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have a tooth pulled.</v>

1224
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:44.383
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like your damn tongue is in that </v>

1225
01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:49.910
<v Speaker 3>hole for the next six months fiddling </v>
<v Speaker 3>around constantly.</v>

1226
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:53.990
<v Speaker 3>And that's because you're rebuilding </v>
<v Speaker 3>your neurological model of your body.</v>

1227
01:08:53.991 --> 01:08:58.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like try it out with your whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>left side and see how well you do.</v>

1228
01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.353
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy named Ramachandran was </v>

1229
01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:05.860
<v Speaker 3>experimenting with people like this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things he did was Kinda.</v>

1230
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.793
<v Speaker 3>He was checking their balance and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do that by irrigating the ear with </v>

1231
01:09:11.541 --> 01:09:13.760
<v Speaker 3>cold water and that makes people go like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1232
01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:17.300
<v Speaker 3>makes their eyes move back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it upsets the vestibular system.</v>

1233
01:09:17.301 --> 01:09:18.134
<v Speaker 3>And what he found was that if he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he poured cold water in the left ear </v>

1234
01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:25.130
<v Speaker 3>of someone with right parietal damage </v>
<v Speaker 3>who had left neglect,</v>

1235
01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:29.510
<v Speaker 3>that they'd all of a sudden sort of wake</v>
<v Speaker 3>up catastrophic Lee,</v>

1236
01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:30.344
<v Speaker 3>they'd have a terrible reaction to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that they were paralyzed on the </v>

1237
01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:37.730
<v Speaker 3>left and they would know that it had </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened and cry.</v>

1238
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:41.330
<v Speaker 3>And it made all sorts of distress and no</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder,</v>

1239
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:42.553
<v Speaker 3>and then like 20 minutes later they </v>
<v Speaker 3>snapped back into their damaged mode of </v>

1240
01:09:47.991 --> 01:09:52.991
<v Speaker 3>being and they would not deny because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that isn't really what it is,</v>

1241
01:09:53.521 --> 01:09:54.354
<v Speaker 3>is that they couldn't update the model,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just didn't have the neurology for </v>

1242
01:09:57.741 --> 01:10:00.050
<v Speaker 3>it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they were backed in not noticing that</v>

1243
01:10:00.051 --> 01:10:03.380
<v Speaker 3>it was gone and coming up with stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it and so</v>

1244
01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:05.953
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a good example of how the </v>

1245
01:10:06.801 --> 01:10:10.340
<v Speaker 3>right and left hemispheres work together</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how they're kind of mapped onto this</v>

1246
01:10:10.341 --> 01:10:11.174
<v Speaker 3>weirdly enough so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're map were adapted to the Meta </v>

1247
01:10:15.141 --> 01:10:15.974
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what that would be is we're </v>

1248
01:10:18.021 --> 01:10:23.021
<v Speaker 3>adapted to that which remains constant </v>
<v Speaker 3>across the longest spans of time.</v>

1249
01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:29.120
<v Speaker 3>And that's not the same things that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see flitting around you day to day.</v>

1250
01:10:29.121 --> 01:10:31.130
<v Speaker 3>Those are just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just like clouds.</v>

1251
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:32.780
<v Speaker 3>They're just evaporating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1252
01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:34.213
<v Speaker 3>there's things underneath that that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>more fundamental that are more </v>

1253
01:10:36.171 --> 01:10:39.170
<v Speaker 3>fundamental realities like the dominance</v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>

1254
01:10:39.171 --> 01:10:43.190
<v Speaker 3>like the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the danger outside of society,</v>

1255
01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:47.690
<v Speaker 3>like the threat that other people pose </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you and that you pose to yourself.</v>

1256
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:51.830
<v Speaker 3>Those are eternal realities and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>adapted to those.</v>

1257
01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:55.310
<v Speaker 3>That's our world and that's why we </v>
<v Speaker 3>express that in stories.</v>

1258
01:10:55.311 --> 01:10:56.960
<v Speaker 3>And so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1259
01:10:56.961 --> 01:11:00.250
<v Speaker 3>how do you adapt yourself to this world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is,</v>

1260
01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.270
<v Speaker 3>and I believe this is a neurological </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer,</v>

1261
01:11:02.271 --> 01:11:07.271
<v Speaker 3>I believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your brain can tell you when you're</v>

1262
01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:09.464
<v Speaker 3>optimally situated between chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 3>order and the way it tells you that is </v>

1263
01:11:13.171 --> 01:11:17.550
<v Speaker 3>by producing the sense of engagement and</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning.</v>

1264
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:22.490
<v Speaker 3>So let's say there's a place in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment you should be okay,</v>

1265
01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:24.360
<v Speaker 3>what should that place be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1266
01:11:24.361 --> 01:11:26.400
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be terrified out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your skull.</v>

1267
01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Like what good is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1268
01:11:28.891 --> 01:11:32.520
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be so comfortable that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might as well sleep.</v>

1269
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:38.030
<v Speaker 3>You want to be somewhere where you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of on firm ground here,</v>

1270
01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:38.994
<v Speaker 3>but over here you're kind of testing out</v>
<v Speaker 3>new territory and some of you who were </v>

1271
01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:44.274
<v Speaker 3>exploratory and emotionally stable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're going to go pretty far </v>

1272
01:11:47.341 --> 01:11:51.270
<v Speaker 3>out into the unexplored territory </v>
<v Speaker 3>without destabilizing yourself.</v>

1273
01:11:51.271 --> 01:11:52.104
<v Speaker 3>And other people are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just put a toe in the chaos and you </v>

1274
01:11:55.261 --> 01:11:57.960
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's neuroticism basically,</v>

1275
01:11:57.970 --> 01:11:58.803
<v Speaker 3>that's your sensitivity to threat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's calibrated differently in </v>

1276
01:12:01.381 --> 01:12:04.710
<v Speaker 3>different people and some people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>more exploratory than others.</v>

1277
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:08.230
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of extraversion and openness</v>
<v Speaker 3>working together and,</v>

1278
01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.073
<v Speaker 3>and intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some people are going to tolerate a </v>

1279
01:12:12.271 --> 01:12:15.090
<v Speaker 3>larger admixture of chaos in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>

1280
01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.340
<v Speaker 3>Those are liberals by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1281
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.293
<v Speaker 3>and I mean that technically liberals are</v>
<v Speaker 3>more interested in novel chaos and </v>

1282
01:12:24.031 --> 01:12:24.864
<v Speaker 3>conservatives are more interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stabilization of the structures that </v>

1283
01:12:28.111 --> 01:12:30.810
<v Speaker 3>already exist and who's right?</v>

1284
01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:32.123
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on the situation and that's </v>

1285
01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:35.004
<v Speaker 3>why conservatives and liberals have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to each other because one of them </v>

1286
01:12:38.491 --> 01:12:39.324
<v Speaker 3>isn't right and the other wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes the conservatives are right </v>

1287
01:12:42.961 --> 01:12:43.794
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes the liberals are right </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the environment's going like </v>

1288
01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:48.180
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't predict the damn thing.</v>

1289
01:12:48.181 --> 01:12:52.470
<v Speaker 3>So that's why you have to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what a democracy does,</v>

1290
01:12:52.471 --> 01:12:53.304
<v Speaker 3>is it allows people of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>temperamental types to communicate and </v>

1291
01:12:55.741 --> 01:12:59.970
<v Speaker 3>to calibrate the damn societies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1292
01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:03.150
<v Speaker 3>so let's say you're optimally balanced </v>
<v Speaker 3>between chaos and order.</v>

1293
01:13:03.151 --> 01:13:04.830
<v Speaker 3>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1294
01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:08.820
<v Speaker 3>you're stable enough but you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested,</v>

1295
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:09.803
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because a little novelty heightens your </v>

1296
01:13:12.241 --> 01:13:15.900
<v Speaker 3>anxiety that wakes you up a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the adventure part of it,</v>

1297
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:20.640
<v Speaker 3>but it also focuses the part of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain that does exploratory activity and</v>

1298
01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:22.620
<v Speaker 3>that's actually associated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>pleasure.</v>

1299
01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:23.483
<v Speaker 3>That's the dopamine circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're optimally balanced and </v>

1300
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:28.103
<v Speaker 3>you know that you know you're there when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're listening to an interesting </v>

1301
01:13:30.061 --> 01:13:33.660
<v Speaker 3>conversation or you're engaged in one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a real conversation.</v>

1302
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:36.990
<v Speaker 3>You know you're saying some things you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know and the other person is saying some</v>

1303
01:13:36.991 --> 01:13:37.824
<v Speaker 3>things they know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the both of what you know is </v>

1304
01:13:41.311 --> 01:13:42.810
<v Speaker 3>changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1305
01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.160
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so interesting.</v>

1306
01:13:44.161 --> 01:13:45.920
<v Speaker 3>You'll have a conversation like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

1307
01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:47.340
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe you're reading a book like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1308
01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:52.670
<v Speaker 3>or you're listening to a piece of music </v>
<v Speaker 3>that models that because what music does</v>

1309
01:13:53.131 --> 01:13:53.964
<v Speaker 3>is provide you with predictable forms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multilevel predictable forms that </v>

1310
01:13:58.171 --> 01:13:59.004
<v Speaker 3>transform just the right amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so music is a very representational </v>

1311
01:14:03.031 --> 01:14:04.050
<v Speaker 3>art form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>

1312
01:14:04.051 --> 01:14:06.330
<v Speaker 3>this is what the universe is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1313
01:14:06.331 --> 01:14:11.331
<v Speaker 3>there's a dancing element to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Repetitive and then cute variations that</v>

1314
01:14:12.161 --> 01:14:14.890
<v Speaker 3>sort of surprise and delight you and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you think,</v>

1315
01:14:14.891 --> 01:14:18.010
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so cool and it doesn't matter how</v>

1316
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.053
<v Speaker 3>nihilistic you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Music still inside infuses you with a </v>

1317
01:14:22.631 --> 01:14:23.464
<v Speaker 3>sense of meaning and that's because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>models meaning that's what it does is </v>

1318
01:14:26.201 --> 01:14:27.034
<v Speaker 3>that's why we love it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could dance to it and that sort of </v>

1319
01:14:29.711 --> 01:14:30.544
<v Speaker 3>symbolizes you putting yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 3>harmony with these multiple poll layers </v>

1320
01:14:34.601 --> 01:14:39.601
<v Speaker 3>of reality and positioning yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly and you like that too.</v>

1321
01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:41.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll pay for it.</v>

1322
01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get to go dancing,</v>

1323
01:14:43.421 --> 01:14:44.380
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy.</v>

1324
01:14:44.381 --> 01:14:46.690
<v Speaker 3>I get to listen to music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the hell are you doing?</v>

1325
01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:48.940
<v Speaker 3>Listening to music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What good is that?</v>

1326
01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think that's a stupid question.</v>

1327
01:14:51.371 --> 01:14:54.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about your dopey criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to listen to some music,</v>

1328
01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no rational.</v>

1329
01:14:57.370 --> 01:14:59.470
<v Speaker 3>There's no rational argument against </v>
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>

1330
01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:02.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like you just don't even think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about him.</v>

1331
01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:07.000
<v Speaker 3>He just walk away from someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid enough to ask that question.</v>

1332
01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:11.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>some things are obvious.</v>

1333
01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:15.310
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1334
01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:17.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's pretty fun.</v>

1335
01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:22.120
<v Speaker 3>So what mediates between these two </v>
<v Speaker 3>domains?</v>

1336
01:15:22.121 --> 01:15:25.120
<v Speaker 3>While that's what consciousness does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far as I can tell,</v>

1337
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:27.910
<v Speaker 3>and that sort of the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the hero,</v>

1338
01:15:27.911 --> 01:15:30.700
<v Speaker 3>that's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the logos.</v>

1339
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:32.103
<v Speaker 3>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the word that generates order out </v>

1340
01:15:36.191 --> 01:15:38.110
<v Speaker 3>of chaos at the beginning of time.</v>

1341
01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:39.273
<v Speaker 3>It's the consciousness that interacting </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the matter of the world produces </v>

1342
01:15:43.361 --> 01:15:45.160
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's basically it.</v>

1343
01:15:45.161 --> 01:15:47.860
<v Speaker 3>That's basically you for all intents and</v>
<v Speaker 3>purposes.</v>

1344
01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you do that?</v>

1345
01:15:52.061 --> 01:15:54.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unconscious does it to some degree,</v>

1346
01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:54.963
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's with our fantasy that we </v>

1347
01:15:57.191 --> 01:15:59.320
<v Speaker 3>first meet the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1348
01:15:59.650 --> 01:16:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1349
01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:03.100
<v Speaker 3>say you're going out with a new person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what do you do?</v>

1350
01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:04.413
<v Speaker 3>You project a fantasy on them and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you fall in love with the fantasy and </v>

1351
01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:08.643
<v Speaker 3>aren't used stupid because you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to find out that the match between your </v>

1352
01:16:12.461 --> 01:16:16.360
<v Speaker 3>damn fantasy in the actual person is </v>
<v Speaker 3>tenuous at best.</v>

1353
01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:17.553
<v Speaker 3>And so young would call that a</v>
<v Speaker 3>projection of either the anima or the </v>

1354
01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:23.044
<v Speaker 3>animus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Anima is what a man projects onto a </v>

1355
01:16:25.361 --> 01:16:26.980
<v Speaker 3>woman he finds desirable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1356
01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:28.480
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's the perfect woman.</v>

1357
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:29.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1358
01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:32.770
<v Speaker 3>how do you know that you've like seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>her for four seconds,</v>

1359
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.883
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it grips you and the same thing </v>

1360
01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:38.590
<v Speaker 3>happens in the opposite direction and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an action of instinct.</v>

1361
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:39.423
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you fall in love with the </v>

1362
01:16:40.781 --> 01:16:44.890
<v Speaker 3>image and but interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do in a relationship that works</v>

1363
01:16:44.891 --> 01:16:45.724
<v Speaker 3>is that you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that what you see a rough </v>

1364
01:16:49.331 --> 01:16:52.960
<v Speaker 3>approximation when you project the ideal</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fall in love with it,</v>

1365
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:57.160
<v Speaker 3>you see what could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be that,</v>

1366
01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.540
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to take a hell of a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of work because like you got no shortage</v>

1367
01:17:01.541 --> 01:17:05.860
<v Speaker 3>of flaws and the other person has no </v>
<v Speaker 3>shortage of flaws and so you're bringing</v>

1368
01:17:05.861 --> 01:17:06.694
<v Speaker 3>your flaws together and that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>produce a lot of and you're going to </v>

1369
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.113
<v Speaker 3>have to engage in a lot of dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 3>before you approach that level of </v>

1370
01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.000
<v Speaker 3>perfection again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

1371
01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.130
<v Speaker 3>maybe you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you get to live happily ever after.</v>

1372
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't that be nice?</v>

1373
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:27.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the unconscious meets the unknown and</v>

1374
01:17:27.481 --> 01:17:31.460
<v Speaker 3>if it meets it with imagination and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantasy and dream and art,</v>

1375
01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:33.560
<v Speaker 3>that's how you take.</v>

1376
01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:34.513
<v Speaker 3>So you don't just go from what you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know to fully articulated knowledge and </v>

1377
01:17:37.941 --> 01:17:40.460
<v Speaker 3>one bloody leap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

1378
01:17:40.461 --> 01:17:45.461
<v Speaker 3>You have to extend pseudopods of fantasy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and imagination into the unknown.</v>

1379
01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.290
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of what theorizing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1380
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Even scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1381
01:17:49.911 --> 01:17:52.490
<v Speaker 3>you don't know something scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you generate a theory.</v>

1382
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:53.593
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an imaginative representation that </v>

1383
01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:56.533
<v Speaker 3>you're unconscious is helping you </v>
<v Speaker 3>generate and so you meet the unknown </v>

1384
01:17:59.751 --> 01:18:02.000
<v Speaker 3>with fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the unconscious is for.</v>

1385
01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:05.570
<v Speaker 3>From the psychoanalytic perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what dreams do.</v>

1386
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:08.180
<v Speaker 3>And you can see why you dream about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

1387
01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:09.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1388
01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:10.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the future going to be like,</v>

1389
01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:11.713
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a little imaginative story </v>

1390
01:18:12.531 --> 01:18:15.950
<v Speaker 3>going on and it's like you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>create it and it sort of,</v>

1391
01:18:15.951 --> 01:18:17.720
<v Speaker 3>you watch it unfold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1392
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:18.554
<v Speaker 3>maybe you can tweak it here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it sort of comes to you from </v>

1393
01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.200
<v Speaker 3>wherever the hell things like that come </v>
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

1394
01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:26.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the unconscious,</v>

1395
01:18:26.271 --> 01:18:27.104
<v Speaker 3>that's the psychoanalytic answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really much of an answer </v>

1396
01:18:30.051 --> 01:18:32.670
<v Speaker 3>because it's more like a representation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

1397
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:37.830
<v Speaker 3>of a place that we don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's where creativity comes from.</v>

1398
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:41.920
<v Speaker 3>And I mean some people are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>creative right down to the bloody core.</v>

1399
01:18:41.921 --> 01:18:42.754
<v Speaker 3>So in my clinical practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I often see people who are high in </v>

1400
01:18:45.291 --> 01:18:46.124
<v Speaker 3>openness because they're attracted to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they watch my lectures and you </v>

1401
01:18:49.131 --> 01:18:51.680
<v Speaker 3>have to kind of be high in openness to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like my lectures,</v>

1402
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:54.770
<v Speaker 3>so because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you do because they go everywhere,</v>

1403
01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:55.604
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're not necessarily very </v>

1404
01:18:56.541 --> 01:18:57.380
<v Speaker 3>orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1405
01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>

1406
01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:03.320
<v Speaker 3>lots of my clients are really high in </v>
<v Speaker 3>openness and they're funny people often,</v>

1407
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:04.423
<v Speaker 3>especially if they're smart because </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they have the most nihilistic </v>

1408
01:19:07.191 --> 01:19:08.024
<v Speaker 3>intelligence you can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just self critical and nihilistic </v>

1409
01:19:11.421 --> 01:19:15.110
<v Speaker 3>and brutally brutal man and smart.</v>

1410
01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:18.440
<v Speaker 3>And so they just criticize themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of existence.</v>

1411
01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:19.483
<v Speaker 3>And so often I have to just try to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to quit listening to their </v>

1412
01:19:23.421 --> 01:19:27.800
<v Speaker 3>chattering raw self critical rationality</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go out and create something,</v>

1413
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:30.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their massive creativity.</v>

1414
01:19:30.021 --> 01:19:30.854
<v Speaker 3>And as long as they're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're engaged in the world and happy </v>

1415
01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:34.394
<v Speaker 3>as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as soon as that self critical </v>

1416
01:19:35.721 --> 01:19:38.300
<v Speaker 3>rationality comes in and shuts down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>creativity,</v>

1417
01:19:38.301 --> 01:19:40.880
<v Speaker 3>they're just there just like walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>corpses,</v>

1418
01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:41.733
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's because if you're really open </v>

1419
01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.140
<v Speaker 3>like that's you're a tree and it has </v>
<v Speaker 3>some trunks and you know,</v>

1420
01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:49.093
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your most prominent trait is the most </v>

1421
01:19:50.601 --> 01:19:51.434
<v Speaker 3>lively trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're a creative person and </v>

1422
01:19:53.061 --> 01:19:55.880
<v Speaker 3>you're not engaging in a creative </v>
<v Speaker 3>enterprise,</v>

1423
01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.060
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like a tree that has been,</v>

1424
01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:04.160
<v Speaker 3>that has had its vitality amputated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is not trivial.</v>

1425
01:20:04.161 --> 01:20:04.994
<v Speaker 3>This stuff is.</v>

1426
01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:09.450
<v Speaker 3>This is deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply rooted in your biology.</v>

1427
01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:13.150
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those are people often who have like</v>

1428
01:20:13.230 --> 01:20:14.940
<v Speaker 3>dream lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just can't believe.</v>

1429
01:20:14.941 --> 01:20:15.774
<v Speaker 3>I have one client,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has like four spectacular dreams a </v>

1430
01:20:18.901 --> 01:20:19.734
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most of the time we just spend </v>

1431
01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:22.140
<v Speaker 3>discussing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean God,</v>

1432
01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:27.090
<v Speaker 3>he and I had another client who could be</v>
<v Speaker 3>lucid in her dreams,</v>

1433
01:20:27.091 --> 01:20:27.924
<v Speaker 3>which is more common among women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She could ask the damn characters what </v>

1434
01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:32.760
<v Speaker 3>they represented and they would tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

1435
01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:34.230
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1436
01:20:34.231 --> 01:20:35.064
<v Speaker 3>that was pretty weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like a lot of the things they told </v>

1437
01:20:36.901 --> 01:20:41.010
<v Speaker 3>her were really helpful and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>not things that she wanted to hear.</v>

1438
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:43.350
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she basically,</v>

1439
01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:45.990
<v Speaker 3>one of them told her she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she was going to live,</v>

1440
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:47.333
<v Speaker 3>she'd have to go visit a slaughterhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that was because she </v>

1441
01:20:51.541 --> 01:20:52.374
<v Speaker 3>was raised as a little princess and </v>
<v Speaker 3>protected from horrible mother nature </v>

1442
01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.173
<v Speaker 3>until she hit puberty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in which time she turned into an evil </v>

1443
01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:01.250
<v Speaker 3>villain because that's how the family </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

1444
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:05.580
<v Speaker 3>Perfect child evil teenager overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1445
01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.193
<v Speaker 3>well that was hard on her and she wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>prepared because she thought the world </v>

1446
01:21:09.571 --> 01:21:14.160
<v Speaker 3>was princess world and she couldn't go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through a butcher store without having a</v>

1447
01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:15.960
<v Speaker 3>fifth and no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1448
01:21:15.961 --> 01:21:17.580
<v Speaker 3>like really Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1449
01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:20.190
<v Speaker 3>it's no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you do it.</v>

1450
01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:21.653
<v Speaker 3>But she couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we used to go to butcher stores and </v>

1451
01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:24.830
<v Speaker 3>that would make her cry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1452
01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:27.990
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a vegetarian that would make her</v>

1453
01:21:27.991 --> 01:21:30.990
<v Speaker 3>cry and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be mon the cruelty of the world.</v>

1454
01:21:30.991 --> 01:21:31.771
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1455
01:21:31.771 --> 01:21:32.790
<v Speaker 3>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1456
01:21:32.791 --> 01:21:34.680
<v Speaker 3>Those are bloody slabs of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1457
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:35.723
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why everyone isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming when they walked through the </v>

1458
01:21:37.501 --> 01:21:38.970
<v Speaker 3>butcher store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1459
01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:40.493
<v Speaker 3>but you got to get used to it band </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't live in the world </v>

1460
01:21:42.841 --> 01:21:43.674
<v Speaker 3>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the dream character who was a </v>

1461
01:21:45.691 --> 01:21:46.524
<v Speaker 3>gypsy told her that she had to go visit </v>
<v Speaker 3>a slaughterhouse which seemed rather </v>

1462
01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:50.604
<v Speaker 3>impractical and so I asked her if she </v>
<v Speaker 3>could think of anything else to do and </v>

1463
01:21:54.211 --> 01:21:55.080
<v Speaker 3>she thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1464
01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:58.650
<v Speaker 3>why don't we go visit a funeral home and</v>
<v Speaker 3>and watch an embalming?</v>

1465
01:21:58.680 --> 01:21:59.970
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh good,</v>

1466
01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:01.043
<v Speaker 3>that sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds like a fun way to spend a </v>

1467
01:22:03.271 --> 01:22:06.600
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I phoned up a funeral parlor</v>

1468
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:10.183
<v Speaker 3>and I said I declined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was terrified of death now and I was </v>

1469
01:22:12.711 --> 01:22:17.711
<v Speaker 3>a therapist who is also a little shaky </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the concept myself and so they,</v>

1470
01:22:18.330 --> 01:22:21.480
<v Speaker 3>they had no problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They deal with death all the time,</v>

1471
01:22:21.481 --> 01:22:22.980
<v Speaker 3>which is really something to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1472
01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:23.814
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A human being can actually have an </v>

1473
01:22:25.081 --> 01:22:25.914
<v Speaker 3>occupation where they do nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with death and they don't go stark </v>

1474
01:22:30.181 --> 01:22:31.320
<v Speaker 3>raving mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1475
01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:32.154
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like working in a palliative care </v>

1476
01:22:34.411 --> 01:22:35.244
<v Speaker 3>ward where your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your clients that you have a </v>

1477
01:22:37.201 --> 01:22:38.034
<v Speaker 3>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all they're going to do is die this </v>

1478
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:41.011
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next week,</v>

1479
01:22:41.011 --> 01:22:43.230
<v Speaker 3>the week after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People do that.</v>

1480
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:47.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like those people are tough man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're tough.</v>

1481
01:22:48.090 --> 01:22:50.190
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went and watched this embalming,</v>

1482
01:22:50.191 --> 01:22:51.024
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a rather high level of disgust </v>

1483
01:22:53.851 --> 01:22:54.510
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity.</v>

1484
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:55.343
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a little on the rough side for </v>

1485
01:22:57.751 --> 01:23:01.020
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she sat there and first,</v>

1486
01:23:01.021 --> 01:23:03.510
<v Speaker 3>well she was not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were outside this little room.</v>

1487
01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:04.344
<v Speaker 3>She was not looking at that know away </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she'd kind of go like this and you </v>

1488
01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:08.860
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was pretty good.</v>

1489
01:23:08.861 --> 01:23:09.694
<v Speaker 3>And then she'd go like this and then she</v>
<v Speaker 3>go like this and then then she watched </v>

1490
01:23:14.771 --> 01:23:15.604
<v Speaker 3>it and then she asked if she could go in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she put on a glove and she touched </v>

1491
01:23:19.691 --> 01:23:20.524
<v Speaker 3>the body and she didn't have a fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't have a panic attack and so </v>

1492
01:23:24.371 --> 01:23:25.204
<v Speaker 3>she walked away from their learning that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a hell of a lot more to her </v>

1493
01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:29.044
<v Speaker 3>than she thought there was and that she </v>
<v Speaker 3>could see things that she didn't think </v>

1494
01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:32.860
<v Speaker 3>she could see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And live,</v>

1495
01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:35.200
<v Speaker 3>and after that she sort of had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>touchstone.</v>

1496
01:23:35.201 --> 01:23:36.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1497
01:23:36.461 --> 01:23:37.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of afraid of this.</v>

1498
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:39.880
<v Speaker 3>Was it as bad as going to see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bombing?</v>

1499
01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.350
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that bad.</v>

1500
01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:42.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I can do it.</v>

1501
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:44.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like an initiation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1502
01:23:44.321 --> 01:23:47.170
<v Speaker 3>She had an initiation and so did I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1503
01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:48.453
<v Speaker 3>and I learned a lot from doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned that one of the things you </v>

1504
01:23:51.311 --> 01:23:52.144
<v Speaker 3>need to do if you're going to be a human</v>
<v Speaker 3>being is to prepare yourself to be </v>

1505
01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:58.810
<v Speaker 3>useful in the face of death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you have a parent that dies,</v>

1506
01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:03.070
<v Speaker 3>which shatters people's ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>often they can't even think about it.</v>

1507
01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:05.770
<v Speaker 3>If you can't even think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1508
01:24:05.771 --> 01:24:06.604
<v Speaker 3>you've got some thinking to do because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to be able to at least think </v>

1509
01:24:10.421 --> 01:24:14.680
<v Speaker 3>about that because otherwise you're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be a wasteland when it happens.</v>

1510
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:17.320
<v Speaker 3>And you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could even have a higher ambition.</v>

1511
01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could even be useful when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

1512
01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:21.513
<v Speaker 3>Instead of being part of the heap of </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed people who also have to be </v>

1513
01:24:24.641 --> 01:24:26.350
<v Speaker 3>taken care of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1514
01:24:26.351 --> 01:24:27.184
<v Speaker 3>And that's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be brutal to be useful in </v>

1515
01:24:30.521 --> 01:24:32.440
<v Speaker 3>the aftermath of your parents' death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1516
01:24:32.441 --> 01:24:37.060
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to crumble and fall apart </v>
<v Speaker 3>and knowing you have every reason to,</v>

1517
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:41.680
<v Speaker 3>so you've got to be kind of some tough </v>
<v Speaker 3>monster to manage that,</v>

1518
01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:46.480
<v Speaker 3>but you want to be useful in the face of</v>
<v Speaker 3>tragedy or do you want to be pathetic?</v>

1519
01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:48.673
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1520
01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.600
<v Speaker 3>you make your choice so out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconscious,</v>

1521
01:24:54.601 --> 01:24:56.400
<v Speaker 3>you get ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get dreams,</v>

1522
01:24:56.401 --> 01:24:58.260
<v Speaker 3>you get drama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get stories,</v>

1523
01:24:58.261 --> 01:24:59.094
<v Speaker 3>you could arc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get music and that sort of buffers </v>

1524
01:25:01.111 --> 01:25:01.944
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have our little domain of competence </v>

1525
01:25:03.871 --> 01:25:04.704
<v Speaker 3>and we're buffered by the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantasy and culture and that's really </v>

1526
01:25:08.131 --> 01:25:09.960
<v Speaker 3>what you learned about when you come to </v>
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>

1527
01:25:09.961 --> 01:25:10.794
<v Speaker 3>if you're lucky and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the professors are smart enough to </v>

1528
01:25:12.601 --> 01:25:13.434
<v Speaker 3>actually teach you something about </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture instead of constantly telling </v>

1529
01:25:16.081 --> 01:25:19.590
<v Speaker 3>you that it's completely reprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 3>and should be destroyed.</v>

1530
01:25:19.591 --> 01:25:23.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like why you would prefer chaos to </v>
<v Speaker 3>order is beyond me.</v>

1531
01:25:23.431 --> 01:25:24.264
<v Speaker 3>And the only possible reason is that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't read enough history to </v>

1532
01:25:27.691 --> 01:25:31.740
<v Speaker 3>understand exactly what chaos means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And believe me,</v>

1533
01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:32.723
<v Speaker 3>if you understood what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be pretty God damn careful about </v>

1534
01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:36.953
<v Speaker 3>tearing down the temple that you live it</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you want to be at Denison of </v>

1535
01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:42.293
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>

1536
01:25:42.450 --> 01:25:44.400
<v Speaker 3>And some people do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1537
01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:45.293
<v Speaker 3>because that's when the impulses that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you harbor can really come out and </v>

1538
01:25:48.001 --> 01:25:48.834
<v Speaker 3>shine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a little gratitude is in order </v>

1539
01:25:51.451 --> 01:25:55.560
<v Speaker 3>and that makes you appreciative of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wise king.</v>

1540
01:25:55.561 --> 01:25:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Well being smart enough to know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's also an evil tyrant.</v>

1541
01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:02.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a total conception of the world.</v>

1542
01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 3>It's balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1543
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should preserve nature,</v>

1544
01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:08.180
<v Speaker 3>but good God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is trying to kill us.</v>

1545
01:26:08.181 --> 01:26:09.920
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1546
01:26:09.921 --> 01:26:12.470
<v Speaker 3>our culture is tyrannical and oppresses </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1547
01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:16.370
<v Speaker 3>but it is protecting us from dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's helpful.</v>

1548
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:19.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yes we're reasonably good people but</v>

1549
01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:20.413
<v Speaker 3>like don't take that theory too far </v>
<v Speaker 3>until you've tested yourself and you </v>

1550
01:26:24.201 --> 01:26:25.940
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's wisdom at least in part.</v>

1551
01:26:25.941 --> 01:26:28.670
<v Speaker 3>And that's what these stories try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>teach you.</v>

1552
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:35.750
<v Speaker 3>There is a nice mythological </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation.</v>

1553
01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:36.673
<v Speaker 3>I love this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the dome of the known and the </v>

1554
01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:42.260
<v Speaker 3>seeker looking outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1555
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:45.910
<v Speaker 3>that's a metaphysical representation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1556
01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.990
<v Speaker 3>and that is the world is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks to us,</v>

1557
01:26:47.991 --> 01:26:48.824
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go out in the field and it looks </v>

1558
01:26:49.431 --> 01:26:52.460
<v Speaker 3>like there's a dome covering it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a circle,</v>

1559
01:26:52.461 --> 01:26:53.294
<v Speaker 3>a big circle with a dome over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what's outside the Dome </v>

1560
01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.590
<v Speaker 3>while the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1561
01:26:57.591 --> 01:27:00.210
<v Speaker 3>That's where heaven is theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1562
01:27:00.211 --> 01:27:03.020
<v Speaker 3>it's a projection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously heaven is in the unknown.</v>

1563
01:27:03.021 --> 01:27:05.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was localized in space.</v>

1564
01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:08.150
<v Speaker 3>I suppose that's partly because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people looked up in the sky,</v>

1565
01:27:08.151 --> 01:27:12.800
<v Speaker 3>they were overwhelmed with all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a reasonable conclusion.</v>

1566
01:27:13.710 --> 01:27:14.543
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

1567
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:18.550
<v Speaker 3>it's a projection of an unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>presupposition.</v>

1568
01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:21.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a projection of fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1569
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:22.263
<v Speaker 3>heaven is a fantasy and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not denigrating fantasy by the </v>

1570
01:27:25.781 --> 01:27:26.614
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's projected imaginatively onto </v>

1571
01:27:28.691 --> 01:27:29.524
<v Speaker 3>the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of the way you discover </v>

1572
01:27:30.941 --> 01:27:33.460
<v Speaker 3>what's in your fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1573
01:27:33.461 --> 01:27:34.450
<v Speaker 3>this is us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1574
01:27:34.451 --> 01:27:36.860
<v Speaker 3>We mediate between chaos and order and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1575
01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:40.090
<v Speaker 3>those are the two archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations fundamentally,</v>

1576
01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:41.553
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1577
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:45.430
<v Speaker 3>and I think they apply to both genders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1578
01:27:45.431 --> 01:27:46.264
<v Speaker 3>like women can act as the individual who</v>
<v Speaker 3>holds the world on his or her shoulders </v>

1579
01:27:53.141 --> 01:27:55.570
<v Speaker 3>and males.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men can play a maternal role,</v>

1580
01:27:55.571 --> 01:27:56.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet,</v>

1581
01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.133
<v Speaker 3>female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings are quite masculine and </v>

1582
01:28:00.791 --> 01:28:03.130
<v Speaker 3>male.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human beings are quite feminine and so,</v>

1583
01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:04.313
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe maybe this archetype dominates </v>

1584
01:28:06.221 --> 01:28:08.800
<v Speaker 3>among men in that archetype dominates </v>
<v Speaker 3>among women,</v>

1585
01:28:08.801 --> 01:28:12.700
<v Speaker 3>which I would say is that is the case as</v>
<v Speaker 3>far as I'm concerned,</v>

1586
01:28:12.701 --> 01:28:14.910
<v Speaker 3>although they're in our individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptions,</v>

1587
01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:17.530
<v Speaker 3>of course those two things have to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>in conjunction,</v>

1588
01:28:17.531 --> 01:28:18.364
<v Speaker 3>but that's you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the eternal mediator between chaos and </v>

1589
01:28:21.791 --> 01:28:25.720
<v Speaker 3>order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which also has its enemy.</v>

1590
01:28:25.721 --> 01:28:27.940
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's horace there.</v>

1591
01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:34.520
<v Speaker 3>And that seth who's eventually turns </v>
<v Speaker 3>into Satan as the,</v>

1592
01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.200
<v Speaker 3>as the west progresses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

1593
01:28:37.201 --> 01:28:38.034
<v Speaker 3>and that's represented there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The temptations of I would say </v>

1594
01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.590
<v Speaker 3>resentment and hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which everyone has to fight with all the</v>

1595
01:28:46.591 --> 01:28:47.424
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1596
01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:50.500
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Initiations.</v>

1597
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:53.500
<v Speaker 3>So this is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a standard hero story.</v>

1598
01:28:53.501 --> 01:28:57.130
<v Speaker 3>And initiate initiatory rights are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of human heritage.</v>

1599
01:28:57.131 --> 01:28:59.770
<v Speaker 3>And so let's take a look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is from Eliana.</v>

1600
01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:04.070
<v Speaker 3>I would like even now stress the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the psychopathology of the romantic</v>

1601
01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:04.943
<v Speaker 3>vocation is not profane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does not belong to ordinary </v>

1602
01:29:07.951 --> 01:29:10.200
<v Speaker 3>symptomatology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not mental illness,</v>

1603
01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:13.470
<v Speaker 3>it has an ent initiatory structure and </v>
<v Speaker 3>signification.</v>

1604
01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:14.573
<v Speaker 3>In short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it reproduces a traditional mystical </v>

1605
01:29:16.321 --> 01:29:17.154
<v Speaker 3>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The total crisis of the future Sharman </v>

1606
01:29:19.410 --> 01:29:22.610
<v Speaker 3>sometimes leading to complete </v>
<v Speaker 3>disintegration of the personality and to</v>

1607
01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:26.370
<v Speaker 3>madness can be evaluated not only as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>initiatory death,</v>

1608
01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:27.713
<v Speaker 3>but also as a symbolic return to the pre</v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmogony chaos to the amorphous and </v>

1609
01:29:32.101 --> 01:29:35.250
<v Speaker 3>indescribable state that precedes any </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmogony.</v>

1610
01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.113
<v Speaker 3>While what he means by that is that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>suppose the mythological view of the </v>

1611
01:29:39.931 --> 01:29:40.764
<v Speaker 3>emergence of order that's a cosmogony is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a state of potential and </v>

1612
01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:47.970
<v Speaker 3>chaos out of which order emerges.</v>

1613
01:29:47.970 --> 01:29:48.930
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1614
01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:52.500
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how it is that you think that way</v>

1615
01:29:52.501 --> 01:29:54.990
<v Speaker 3>because you do think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1616
01:29:54.991 --> 01:29:57.930
<v Speaker 3>imagine what you're facing when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>facing the future,</v>

1617
01:29:58.560 --> 01:29:59.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While you might say,</v>

1618
01:29:59.701 --> 01:30:01.350
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future is full of potential,</v>

1619
01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:03.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's full of potential.</v>

1620
01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.340
<v Speaker 3>What the hell does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1621
01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:06.533
<v Speaker 3>you act as if that you act as if that </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential is really a real thing and </v>

1622
01:30:10.681 --> 01:30:11.514
<v Speaker 3>you're confronting it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm confronting the potential of the </v>

1623
01:30:13.651 --> 01:30:14.700
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1624
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:15.534
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't exist yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what you're confronting doesn't even </v>

1625
01:30:18.991 --> 01:30:19.824
<v Speaker 3>really exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're conceptualizing doesn't </v>

1626
01:30:21.121 --> 01:30:21.954
<v Speaker 3>really exist and in some sense you bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>it into being by plotting your path </v>

1627
01:30:25.741 --> 01:30:26.574
<v Speaker 3>through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while the pre cosmo going to chaos is </v>

1628
01:30:28.651 --> 01:30:32.100
<v Speaker 3>the same as the potential of the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly the same idea.</v>

1629
01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:37.370
<v Speaker 3>It's the realm of possibility from which</v>
<v Speaker 3>actuality emerges and you participate in</v>

1630
01:30:39.450 --> 01:30:42.270
<v Speaker 3>turning that possibility into actuality.</v>

1631
01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:44.790
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're doing all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1632
01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:47.550
<v Speaker 3>can I explain that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1633
01:30:47.551 --> 01:30:51.660
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea how consciousness and the</v>

1634
01:30:51.661 --> 01:30:56.661
<v Speaker 3>substrate of the world interact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can only say that that's how it looks.</v>

1635
01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:58.970
<v Speaker 3>That's how it feels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1636
01:30:59.160 --> 01:30:59.993
<v Speaker 3>that's how people act and they'll get </v>
<v Speaker 3>into trouble if they don't manifest </v>

1637
01:31:03.901 --> 01:31:06.180
<v Speaker 3>their potential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that is.</v>

1638
01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:09.260
<v Speaker 3>That's all those things you could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're not well,</v>

1639
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:11.940
<v Speaker 3>where are those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just potential.</v>

1640
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.980
<v Speaker 3>While that's the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a.</v>

1641
01:31:15.810 --> 01:31:20.760
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that's the cosmos.</v>

1642
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:22.890
<v Speaker 3>That's the cosmos that you live in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1643
01:31:22.891 --> 01:31:23.724
<v Speaker 3>It's a little story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the thing that you extract out of </v>

1644
01:31:25.951 --> 01:31:26.784
<v Speaker 3>the chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sorta consists of your conception of </v>

1645
01:31:29.251 --> 01:31:33.630
<v Speaker 3>where you are now and your conception of</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you want to be at some point could</v>

1646
01:31:33.631 --> 01:31:35.880
<v Speaker 3>be 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be three years it has.</v>

1647
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:36.833
<v Speaker 3>You can slide it and then you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little plan about how you should move </v>

1648
01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:44.730
<v Speaker 3>your body to transform one into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

1649
01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:45.593
<v Speaker 3>That's your action pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a little story and when you ask </v>

1650
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:48.833
<v Speaker 3>someone to say what they were up to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell you a little story like </v>

1651
01:31:50.971 --> 01:31:51.780
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1652
01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:55.590
<v Speaker 3>I was at someplace and I went somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>else and here's how I did it.</v>

1653
01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Then they might tell you more </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting story,</v>

1654
01:31:57.841 --> 01:32:02.841
<v Speaker 3>which is I was someplace and something </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened that I really didn't expect and</v>

1655
01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.170
<v Speaker 3>it knocked me for a loop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1656
01:32:08.650 --> 01:32:09.483
<v Speaker 3>and that's a good divorce story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came home one night and my wife was </v>

1657
01:32:12.701 --> 01:32:13.690
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1658
01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.093
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos and probably a bit of willful </v>

1659
01:32:17.771 --> 01:32:22.480
<v Speaker 3>blindness proceeding it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might suspect anyways down into chaos</v>

1660
01:32:22.481 --> 01:32:23.314
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe you learn something down </v>

1661
01:32:24.611 --> 01:32:25.444
<v Speaker 3>there and maybe you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but hopefully you do and you put </v>

1662
01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:30.760
<v Speaker 3>yourself together if you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then pop bang,</v>

1663
01:32:30.761 --> 01:32:31.594
<v Speaker 3>you pop up into another little structure</v>
<v Speaker 3>of order and that's an initiatory </v>

1664
01:32:34.631 --> 01:32:35.260
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

1665
01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:38.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're somewhere stable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>falls apart,</v>

1666
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:42.400
<v Speaker 3>or maybe you break it apart on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do it voluntarily.</v>

1667
01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:46.240
<v Speaker 3>You know people do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know they do that.</v>

1668
01:32:46.241 --> 01:32:48.550
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they experiment with drugs and they</v>

1669
01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.593
<v Speaker 3>do that when they go on wild adventures </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know when they break themselves </v>

1670
01:32:52.541 --> 01:32:56.260
<v Speaker 3>out of their normal routine and throw </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves somewhere,</v>

1671
01:32:56.261 --> 01:33:00.160
<v Speaker 3>they don't understand and hope that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to produce a transformation</v>

1672
01:33:00.161 --> 01:33:02.350
<v Speaker 3>of personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the basic story.</v>

1673
01:33:02.351 --> 01:33:04.510
<v Speaker 3>That's the initiatory story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1674
01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:05.673
<v Speaker 3>this is William James who was the one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the established rules of modern </v>

1675
01:33:08.981 --> 01:33:09.814
<v Speaker 3>psychology and I kind of an odd guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an early experimenter with </v>

1676
01:33:13.001 --> 01:33:14.140
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1677
01:33:14.141 --> 01:33:17.080
<v Speaker 3>they'll never tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was and he has.</v>

1678
01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:21.910
<v Speaker 3>His drug of choice was nitrous oxide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is an inhalent gas,</v>

1679
01:33:21.911 --> 01:33:25.090
<v Speaker 3>which seems to be inert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one really knows why it works,</v>

1680
01:33:25.091 --> 01:33:29.920
<v Speaker 3>but it produces quite intense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hallucinogenic experience,</v>

1681
01:33:29.921 --> 01:33:30.970
<v Speaker 3>mystical experience.</v>

1682
01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:34.120
<v Speaker 3>Although if you breathe too much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you die because it doesn't.</v>

1683
01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:35.920
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have any oxygen in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1684
01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:38.110
<v Speaker 3>so don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1685
01:33:38.210 --> 01:33:42.190
<v Speaker 3>and he wrote some really bad hippie </v>
<v Speaker 3>poetry back in the 18 eighties.</v>

1686
01:33:42.370 --> 01:33:43.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

1687
01:33:44.210 --> 01:33:45.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>experimenting with,</v>

1688
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:48.700
<v Speaker 3>with nitrous oxide is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll read a little bit of that too.</v>

1689
01:33:48.701 --> 01:33:49.534
<v Speaker 3>You pure experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The name which I give to the original </v>

1690
01:33:52.601 --> 01:33:55.930
<v Speaker 3>flux of life before reflection has </v>
<v Speaker 3>categorized it.</v>

1692
01:34:00.311 --> 01:34:01.144
<v Speaker 3>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>illnesses or blows can have an </v>

1693
01:34:02.111 --> 01:34:07.111
<v Speaker 3>experience pure in the literal sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that which is not yet any definite,</v>

1694
01:34:07.271 --> 01:34:12.271
<v Speaker 3>what they'll ready to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any sorts of what's fourth full,</v>

1695
01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:13.564
<v Speaker 3>both of oneness and of many dentists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in respects that don't appear </v>

1696
01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:20.560
<v Speaker 3>changing throughout yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So confusedly that it's phases,</v>

1697
01:34:20.561 --> 01:34:21.394
<v Speaker 3>interpenetrate and no points either of </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinction or of identity can be </v>

1698
01:34:25.061 --> 01:34:25.894
<v Speaker 3>caught.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these old guys that established</v>

1702
01:34:33.010 --> 01:34:33.843
<v Speaker 3>what we regard as fairly stable bodies </v>
<v Speaker 3>of knowledge were just as crazy as you </v>

1703
01:34:38.411 --> 01:34:39.244
<v Speaker 3>can possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just the most peculiar damn </v>

1704
01:34:41.651 --> 01:34:44.240
<v Speaker 3>people and they get sanitized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1705
01:34:44.530 --> 01:34:45.363
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they are represented in history and </v>

1706
01:34:46.901 --> 01:34:48.820
<v Speaker 3>that's no fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1707
01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:49.683
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's much more interesting to know what </v>

1708
01:34:51.041 --> 01:34:51.874
<v Speaker 3>they were like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were just so bloody peculiar and </v>

1709
01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 3>strange and involved in all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird things.</v>

1710
01:34:58.041 --> 01:35:00.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot more fun to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's his poem.</v>

1711
01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like right from 1968,</v>

1712
01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:09.890
<v Speaker 3>no verbiage can give it because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>verbiage is other incoherent,</v>

1713
01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:11.630
<v Speaker 3>coherent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same,</v>

1714
01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:14.870
<v Speaker 3>and it fades and it's infinite and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite.</v>

1715
01:35:15.230 --> 01:35:18.980
<v Speaker 3>Don't you see the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you see the identity constantly?</v>

1716
01:35:18.981 --> 01:35:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Opposites united,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same me telling you to write and not</v>

1717
01:35:22.401 --> 01:35:24.140
<v Speaker 3>to right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Extreme,</v>

1718
01:35:24.141 --> 01:35:24.974
<v Speaker 3>extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme something and other than that </v>

1719
01:35:26.961 --> 01:35:27.794
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intoxication and otherness than </v>

1720
01:35:29.871 --> 01:35:32.540
<v Speaker 3>intoxication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every attempt at betterment,</v>

1721
01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:37.640
<v Speaker 3>every attempted other month is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It fades forever and forever as we move,</v>

1722
01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:41.810
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's just about as incoherent </v>
<v Speaker 3>as postmodernist philosophy.</v>

1723
01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:44.953
<v Speaker 3>So we know for archaic and traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultures that are symbolic return to </v>

1724
01:35:47.841 --> 01:35:50.690
<v Speaker 3>chaos is equivalent to preparing a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>creation.</v>

1725
01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:54.600
<v Speaker 3>It follows that we may interpret the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychic chaos of the future Sharman as a</v>

1726
01:35:54.601 --> 01:35:55.434
<v Speaker 3>sign that the profane man is being </v>
<v Speaker 3>dissolved and a new personality being </v>

1727
01:35:58.311 --> 01:36:02.960
<v Speaker 3>prepared for birth transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a way of thinking about it.</v>

1728
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paradise lost redemption.</v>

1729
01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:11.990
<v Speaker 3>Classic story of mankind always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a great past.</v>

1730
01:36:11.991 --> 01:36:14.870
<v Speaker 3>We're in a state of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're heading towards a better future.</v>

1731
01:36:15.710 --> 01:36:20.390
<v Speaker 3>Everyone thinks that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stories are based on that all that's</v>

1732
01:36:20.391 --> 01:36:24.440
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now ellenberger who,</v>

1733
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:25.303
<v Speaker 3>who wrote a lot about the psychoanalysts</v>
<v Speaker 3>believed that Freud and young in </v>

1734
01:36:28.821 --> 01:36:29.654
<v Speaker 3>particular how to create an illness </v>
<v Speaker 3>which he regarded as this sort of </v>

1735
01:36:31.941 --> 01:36:36.941
<v Speaker 3>spontaneous shamonic transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said a creative illness has these</v>

1736
01:36:37.521 --> 01:36:38.510
<v Speaker 3>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It follows,</v>

1737
01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:39.373
<v Speaker 3>succeeds a period of intense </v>
<v Speaker 3>preoccupation with an idea and search </v>

1738
01:36:42.291 --> 01:36:43.250
<v Speaker 3>for certain truth.</v>

1739
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:46.550
<v Speaker 3>It's a polymorphous condition that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>take the shape of depression,</v>

1740
01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:47.384
<v Speaker 3>neurosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychosomatic ailments or even </v>

1741
01:36:49.041 --> 01:36:49.874
<v Speaker 3>psychosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Young was in that state when he wrote </v>

1742
01:36:51.561 --> 01:36:54.230
<v Speaker 3>this book called the Red Book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was just released last year,</v>

1743
01:36:54.231 --> 01:36:55.064
<v Speaker 3>which is full of visionary illustrations</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and it's very strange poetry and it </v>

1744
01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:01.273
<v Speaker 3>contains the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the communications he had with </v>

1745
01:37:05.150 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 3>imaginative beings that he conjured up </v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1746
01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:10.340
<v Speaker 3>when practicing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing exactly that.</v>

1747
01:37:10.341 --> 01:37:11.174
<v Speaker 3>He practiced that for years and he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>these autonomous beings manifest </v>

1748
01:37:15.981 --> 01:37:19.250
<v Speaker 3>themselves in his fantasy and had long </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations with them,</v>

1749
01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:20.800
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1750
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:23.270
<v Speaker 3>while he was working as a doctor and </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a sane,</v>

1751
01:37:23.271 --> 01:37:26.840
<v Speaker 3>normal life and well it's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1752
01:37:27.170 --> 01:37:29.270
<v Speaker 3>it's really something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the symptoms,</v>

1753
01:37:29.271 --> 01:37:30.104
<v Speaker 3>they're felt as painful while he thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he was going mad and some people </v>

1754
01:37:33.081 --> 01:37:36.080
<v Speaker 3>think he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not agonizing by the subject,</v>

1755
01:37:36.081 --> 01:37:39.200
<v Speaker 3>with alternating periods of alleviation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and worsening throughout the illness.</v>

1756
01:37:39.201 --> 01:37:40.034
<v Speaker 3>The subject never loses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thread of is dominating </v>

1757
01:37:41.931 --> 01:37:42.764
<v Speaker 3>preoccupation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's often compatible with normal </v>

1758
01:37:45.531 --> 01:37:46.364
<v Speaker 3>professional activity and family life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even if he keeps to his social </v>

1759
01:37:48.831 --> 01:37:49.664
<v Speaker 3>activities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's almost entirely absorbed with </v>

1760
01:37:53.151 --> 01:37:53.984
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He suffers feelings of isolation even </v>

1761
01:37:57.031 --> 01:37:57.864
<v Speaker 3>when he has a mentor who guides them </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the ordeal like the and </v>

1762
01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:01.173
<v Speaker 3>apprentice with his master.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The termination is often rapid and </v>

1763
01:38:03.451 --> 01:38:07.770
<v Speaker 3>marked by a phase of exhilaration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The subject emerges from his ordeal with</v>

1764
01:38:07.771 --> 01:38:11.580
<v Speaker 3>a permanent transformation in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality and a conviction that he has</v>

1765
01:38:11.581 --> 01:38:14.460
<v Speaker 3>discovered a great truth or a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual world.</v>

1766
01:38:17.710 --> 01:38:18.543
<v Speaker 3>Many of the 19th and 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 3>figures regarded universally as great </v>

1767
01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:23.200
<v Speaker 3>niche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Darwin,</v>

1768
01:38:23.201 --> 01:38:24.460
<v Speaker 3>Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tolstoy,</v>

1769
01:38:24.461 --> 01:38:25.294
<v Speaker 3>Freud Young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all additionally characterized by </v>

1770
01:38:26.861 --> 01:38:30.160
<v Speaker 3>lengthy periods of profound </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological unrest and uncertainty.</v>

1771
01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:31.173
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't generate a new theory without </v>

1772
01:38:33.881 --> 01:38:35.440
<v Speaker 3>some birth pangs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1773
01:38:35.441 --> 01:38:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Because you're all theory has to bite </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dust first.</v>

1774
01:38:38.501 --> 01:38:40.270
<v Speaker 3>And when you're old theory bites the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dust.</v>

1775
01:38:40.271 --> 01:38:41.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are you?</v>

1776
01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:42.753
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know if you're going to come up </v>

1777
01:38:44.141 --> 01:38:45.790
<v Speaker 3>with a new one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1778
01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:50.000
<v Speaker 3>Here's a cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my daughter.</v>

1779
01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:51.133
<v Speaker 3>She was five years at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was playing prince or princess with </v>

1780
01:38:54.141 --> 01:38:56.270
<v Speaker 3>Julia and her three year old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

1781
01:38:56.271 --> 01:38:57.650
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we killed the dragon,</v>

1782
01:38:57.651 --> 01:38:59.270
<v Speaker 3>we could use his skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his armor.</v>

1783
01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.310
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't that be a good idea?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

1784
01:39:01.311 --> 01:39:01.730
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1785
01:39:01.730 --> 01:39:03.160
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a hell of an idea,</v>

1786
01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:04.160
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1787
01:39:04.161 --> 01:39:04.994
<v Speaker 3>you go right after the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>frightens you the most and you develop </v>

1788
01:39:08.181 --> 01:39:10.070
<v Speaker 3>something that protects you from doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1789
01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:12.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where did she get that idea?</v>

1790
01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:14.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good work Kiddo.</v>

1791
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:19.460
<v Speaker 3>She had plenty of dragons in her life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

1792
01:39:22.090 --> 01:39:24.520
<v Speaker 3>the following dream was described by my </v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter Mckayla.</v>

1793
01:39:24.521 --> 01:39:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Three years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine months old,</v>

1794
01:39:25.811 --> 01:39:27.700
<v Speaker 3>above my son Julian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One year,</v>

1795
01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:29.373
<v Speaker 3>Julian was in the process of toilet </v>
<v Speaker 3>training and rapid speech development </v>

1796
01:39:31.811 --> 01:39:33.820
<v Speaker 3>was having some trouble controlling his </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions.</v>

1797
01:39:33.821 --> 01:39:34.654
<v Speaker 3>MCKAYLA liked to call him baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had several discussions about the </v>

1798
01:39:37.211 --> 01:39:39.130
<v Speaker 3>fact that he wasn't really a baby </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1799
01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:41.500
<v Speaker 3>She told me this story while I was at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the computer,</v>

1800
01:39:41.501 --> 01:39:44.680
<v Speaker 3>so I was able to get it verbatim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't very happy with the idea that</v>

1801
01:39:44.681 --> 01:39:46.990
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't a baby anymore because she </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of liked her.</v>

1802
01:39:47.050 --> 01:39:47.883
<v Speaker 3>The baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She took care of that baby you lot and </v>

1803
01:39:49.271 --> 01:39:53.350
<v Speaker 3>her little brain was having a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the notion that whatever that thing</v>

1804
01:39:53.351 --> 01:39:55.210
<v Speaker 3>is now it isn't a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1805
01:39:55.211 --> 01:39:56.260
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's my baby?</v>

1806
01:39:56.261 --> 01:39:57.094
<v Speaker 3>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plenty of mothers go through the same </v>

1807
01:39:58.631 --> 01:40:00.520
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they attempt to keep their children</v>

1808
01:40:00.521 --> 01:40:04.900
<v Speaker 3>babies for the rest of their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is what Mikayla said,</v>

1809
01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:05.620
<v Speaker 3>the dream.</v>

1810
01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Julian's eyes fell out and then he </v>
<v Speaker 3>falled into pieces.</v>

1811
01:40:08.710 --> 01:40:10.300
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what sort of pieces?</v>

1812
01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:11.163
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Julian pieces and the bones fold out to </v>

1813
01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.393
<v Speaker 3>then a whole God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and there was water in it and when </v>

1814
01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:21.370
<v Speaker 3>he came out he was big mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Julian isn't a baby anymore.</v>

1815
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:22.263
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a big boy and a bug with legs go </v>

1816
01:40:24.501 --> 01:40:26.620
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out cause bugs can swim and the hole</v>

1817
01:40:26.621 --> 01:40:30.070
<v Speaker 3>was in the park and it moved into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>backyard and he fall into it.</v>

1818
01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:32.770
<v Speaker 3>A tree burned and left the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

1819
01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:34.480
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so amazing.</v>

1820
01:40:34.481 --> 01:40:37.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a shamanic transformation dream.</v>

1821
01:40:37.961 --> 01:40:42.220
<v Speaker 3>It was like the tree that's the tree of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life had burnt and left a hole.</v>

1822
01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:43.650
<v Speaker 3>The kid fell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Intuitive,</v>

1823
01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:46.600
<v Speaker 3>dissolved them right down to his bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This little bug,</v>

1824
01:40:46.601 --> 01:40:49.870
<v Speaker 3>which would be a union representation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the self,</v>

1825
01:40:49.871 --> 01:40:51.160
<v Speaker 3>like Jimminy cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1826
01:40:51.161 --> 01:40:51.994
<v Speaker 3>in Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bug was the thing that was alive </v>

1827
01:40:54.251 --> 01:40:55.870
<v Speaker 3>that helped them through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>

1828
01:40:55.871 --> 01:40:56.704
<v Speaker 3>He stepped out and now he was big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that was her little brain </v>

1829
01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:02.890
<v Speaker 3>conjuring up the notion of radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>

1830
01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:05.620
<v Speaker 3>So this is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope this works.</v>

1831
01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:10.570
<v Speaker 3>This is a dream that my nephew had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone animated</v>

1832
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.823
<v Speaker 5>Jordan Peterson is a clinical </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychologist from the University of </v>

1833
01:41:15.250 --> 01:41:16.083
<v Speaker 5>Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do disagree with some of those </v>

1834
01:41:17.361 --> 01:41:20.570
<v Speaker 5>fundamental ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Put his thoughts and fixing problems.</v>

1835
01:41:20.630 --> 01:41:21.463
<v Speaker 5>Merge with my stomach values</v>
<v Speaker 5>within one of his maps of meaning </v>

1836
01:41:25.761 --> 01:41:26.594
<v Speaker 5>lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He tells a true story about a four year </v>

1837
01:41:28.221 --> 01:41:29.054
<v Speaker 5>old boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his nephew who for months was suffering </v>

1838
01:41:31.641 --> 01:41:34.880
<v Speaker 5>from terrible night terrors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrors that were waking him up,</v>

1839
01:41:34.881 --> 01:41:37.010
<v Speaker 5>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This boy,</v>

1840
01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.100
<v Speaker 5>by the way did have some areas of </v>
<v Speaker 5>instability in his family life,</v>

1841
01:41:41.210 --> 01:41:44.050
<v Speaker 5>Jordan versus the young boys hosts and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the boy was running around,</v>

1842
01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.280
<v Speaker 5>dressed as a need with a sword,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a shield,</v>

1843
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:48.440
<v Speaker 5>and a helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At nighttime,</v>

1844
01:41:48.441 --> 01:41:52.880
<v Speaker 5>he would take a sword and shield to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Jordan goes back into him and the boy</v>

1845
01:41:52.881 --> 01:41:57.230
<v Speaker 5>described his dream and the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's standing thrown by me.</v>

1846
01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:58.113
<v Speaker 5>Hey dwarves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These dwarves had beaks and every time </v>

1847
01:42:01.101 --> 01:42:01.934
<v Speaker 5>you were trying to move the doors would </v>
<v Speaker 5>jump up and Beta and very fretting </v>

1848
01:42:05.061 --> 01:42:05.894
<v Speaker 5>scenario for a young boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you look behind all the doors </v>

1849
01:42:09.010 --> 01:42:09.790
<v Speaker 5>away in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>up back,</v>

1850
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:10.623
<v Speaker 5>there was a dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and every time this dragon with puff </v>

1851
01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:13.423
<v Speaker 5>owed fire and smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more dwarves will be created so there's </v>

1852
01:42:16.491 --> 01:42:19.240
<v Speaker 5>no point fighting off the doors because </v>
<v Speaker 5>more would just be made.</v>

1853
01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:23.510
<v Speaker 5>So Jordan tapped him and asked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what could you do about that?</v>

1854
01:42:24.650 --> 01:42:26.990
<v Speaker 5>So the kid says he could jump up in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dragon's head,</v>

1855
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:30.110
<v Speaker 5>could put a's with a sword,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he couldn't see.</v>

1856
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:34.580
<v Speaker 5>Then he could go during the route to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>box where the fire came,</v>

1857
01:42:34.590 --> 01:42:37.100
<v Speaker 5>chrome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>carve a piece out of that box,</v>

1858
01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:40.550
<v Speaker 5>thereby destroying it and use that </v>
<v Speaker 5>pieces of sheet.</v>

1859
01:42:41.810 --> 01:42:45.890
<v Speaker 5>The change before Jordan a was already </v>
<v Speaker 5>acting out in life.</v>

1860
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.903
<v Speaker 5>What he knew he had to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and after that conversation he had no </v>

1861
01:42:50.361 --> 01:42:54.410
<v Speaker 5>more nightmares.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what Marcus really is meant when</v>

1862
01:42:54.411 --> 01:42:57.920
<v Speaker 5>he said the impediment to action </v>
<v Speaker 5>advances action.</v>

1863
01:42:58.580 --> 01:42:59.413
<v Speaker 5>What stands in the way becomes a way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was telling us that we must not shy </v>

1864
01:43:03.741 --> 01:43:06.860
<v Speaker 5>away from problems or shutting our </v>
<v Speaker 5>personal responsibility.</v>

1865
01:43:07.670 --> 01:43:11.330
<v Speaker 5>You must be willing to sacrifice or </v>
<v Speaker 5>conference who does Roseboro problems to</v>

1866
01:43:11.331 --> 01:43:13.520
<v Speaker 5>solve them and then take something away.</v>

1867
01:43:14.410 --> 01:43:15.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

1868
01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:20.030
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was waking up screaming at night for,</v>

1869
01:43:20.050 --> 01:43:22.030
<v Speaker 3>for weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the night terrors.</v>

1870
01:43:22.031 --> 01:43:22.864
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't really remember what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell was going on and there was </v>

1871
01:43:25.211 --> 01:43:26.044
<v Speaker 3>instability in his family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His parents got divorced soon after and </v>

1872
01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:31.960
<v Speaker 3>he was off to kindergarten and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of destabilizing them too.</v>

1873
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:35.500
<v Speaker 3>And so it was fun to watch him zip </v>
<v Speaker 3>around as a night.</v>

1874
01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:37.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do you get that idea?</v>

1875
01:43:37.961 --> 01:43:38.651
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1876
01:43:38.651 --> 01:43:40.780
<v Speaker 3>he watched TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watched movies.</v>

1877
01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:41.614
<v Speaker 3>He is a little imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was aggregating the picture of the hero </v>

1878
01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:47.590
<v Speaker 3>and then he was trying to act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he was doing,</v>

1879
01:43:47.591 --> 01:43:48.424
<v Speaker 3>pretending right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretending to be the thing that </v>

1880
01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:53.510
<v Speaker 3>takes on the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he has this amazing dream.</v>

1881
01:43:53.511 --> 01:43:56.900
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so sophisticated.</v>

1882
01:43:56.901 --> 01:43:57.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1883
01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:01.790
<v Speaker 3>here I am and there's troubles </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and they're biting me.</v>

1884
01:44:01.791 --> 01:44:04.640
<v Speaker 3>They're jumping up on me and it's like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hydra,</v>

1885
01:44:04.641 --> 01:44:05.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Hydra,</v>

1886
01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:08.240
<v Speaker 3>you cut off a hydros head and seven more</v>
<v Speaker 3>heads grow.</v>

1887
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:09.530
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's life,</v>

1888
01:44:09.531 --> 01:44:10.850
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Solve one problem,</v>

1889
01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.590
<v Speaker 3>seven more appear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1890
01:44:12.670 --> 01:44:16.400
<v Speaker 3>So also that was the dragon at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>

1891
01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:19.130
<v Speaker 3>Chaos itself and chaos kept breeding</v>

1892
01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:23.640
<v Speaker 3>these evil little dwarfs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what it does.</v>

1893
01:44:23.641 --> 01:44:25.740
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's one damn trouble after </v>
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>

1894
01:44:25.741 --> 01:44:27.270
<v Speaker 3>You fight this one off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight this one off.</v>

1895
01:44:27.271 --> 01:44:28.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>

1896
01:44:28.141 --> 01:44:28.974
<v Speaker 3>The Dragon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dwarf generating machine is still </v>

1897
01:44:31.261 --> 01:44:33.130
<v Speaker 3>working in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He.</v>

1898
01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:36.300
<v Speaker 3>I asked him and that was purposeful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What could you do?</v>

1899
01:44:37.290 --> 01:44:38.123
<v Speaker 3>See that's a leading question that </v>
<v Speaker 3>implies that there's something that he </v>

1900
01:44:41.251 --> 01:44:42.690
<v Speaker 3>could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1901
01:44:42.691 --> 01:44:43.524
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take my dad that was missing in the </v>

1902
01:44:45.001 --> 01:44:46.840
<v Speaker 3>animation and we'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1903
01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:49.020
<v Speaker 3>poke to drag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always out.</v>

1904
01:44:49.021 --> 01:44:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Go right down to the source of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>

1905
01:44:52.630 --> 01:44:54.220
<v Speaker 3>extinguish it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make a shield.</v>

1906
01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:55.054
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that meant that he would have </v>

1907
01:44:55.961 --> 01:44:58.510
<v Speaker 3>strengthened his character by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>encounter.</v>

1908
01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:00.153
<v Speaker 3>So brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I talked to his mom for months </v>

1909
01:45:04.081 --> 01:45:07.500
<v Speaker 3>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>done no more night terrors.</v>

1910
01:45:07.650 --> 01:45:10.450
<v Speaker 3>What had happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1911
01:45:10.451 --> 01:45:11.284
<v Speaker 3>identified with the mythological hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He identified with St George and the </v>

1912
01:45:14.111 --> 01:45:14.944
<v Speaker 3>dragon he identified with that little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bloody tree dwelling primate who 20 </v>

1913
01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:23.200
<v Speaker 3>million years ago was the first one to </v>
<v Speaker 3>drop a stick on a snake.</v>

1914
01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:24.213
<v Speaker 3>He adopted the classic human mode of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in the face of uncertainty and </v>

1915
01:45:28.961 --> 01:45:32.800
<v Speaker 3>construed himself as that which could </v>
<v Speaker 3>prevail.</v>

1916
01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:36.430
<v Speaker 3>End of terrors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1917
01:45:40.670 --> 01:45:41.510
<v Speaker 3>I guess we're done a.</v>

1918
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.863
<v Speaker 6>So we're going to do something a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>different than the syllabus today </v>

1919
01:45:48.031 --> 01:45:48.864
<v Speaker 6>because we've got this one hour,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two hour problem and I already can't </v>

1920
01:45:52.681 --> 01:45:53.514
<v Speaker 6>cover constructionism reasonably in two </v>
<v Speaker 6>hours or one hour that was supposed to </v>

1921
01:45:57.121 --> 01:45:57.954
<v Speaker 6>be today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm going to do instead is continue </v>

1922
01:46:00.630 --> 01:46:01.463
<v Speaker 6>on the line that I've been pursuing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm going to expand it up more into </v>

1923
01:46:04.651 --> 01:46:05.484
<v Speaker 6>union psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the what we're going after </v>

1924
01:46:08.011 --> 01:46:08.844
<v Speaker 6>after constructivism anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I can weave the constructivism </v>

1925
01:46:12.511 --> 01:46:13.344
<v Speaker 6>and the depth psychology together and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's nice to do that because it gives </v>

1926
01:46:15.901 --> 01:46:18.600
<v Speaker 6>you a kind of a coherent view.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So just so you know,</v>

1927
01:46:18.601 --> 01:46:20.730
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're one lecture ahead at the moment,</v>

1928
01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:21.593
<v Speaker 6>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'll do constructivism on Tuesday </v>

1929
01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:25.440
<v Speaker 6>for two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

1930
01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:26.803
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I showed you that enemy animation I </v>

1931
01:46:28.861 --> 01:46:31.170
<v Speaker 6>told you about my nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his dream,</v>

1932
01:46:31.171 --> 01:46:33.060
<v Speaker 6>which is a remarkable dream,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1933
01:46:33.061 --> 01:46:34.860
<v Speaker 6>really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just amazing,</v>

1934
01:46:34.861 --> 01:46:39.861
<v Speaker 6>amazing dream and</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's got this archetypal pattern.</v>

1935
01:46:40.570 --> 01:46:44.160
<v Speaker 6>The pattern is that there's a threat and</v>
<v Speaker 6>worse than that,</v>

1936
01:46:44.190 --> 01:46:47.880
<v Speaker 6>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are threats and at the back of it,</v>

1937
01:46:47.881 --> 01:46:51.600
<v Speaker 6>there is that the fact of threat itself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see,</v>

1938
01:46:51.601 --> 01:46:53.220
<v Speaker 6>so human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're so smart.</v>

1939
01:46:53.221 --> 01:46:54.054
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so this is so amazing that we figured </v>

1940
01:46:56.161 --> 01:46:57.690
<v Speaker 6>this out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you imagine,</v>

1941
01:46:57.691 --> 01:47:02.220
<v Speaker 6>well human beings are the only creatures</v>
<v Speaker 6>that can really conceive of the class of</v>

1942
01:47:02.221 --> 01:47:03.054
<v Speaker 6>all threatening things right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of why we can be permanently </v>

1943
01:47:05.611 --> 01:47:06.720
<v Speaker 6>anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's.</v>

1944
01:47:06.721 --> 01:47:08.660
<v Speaker 6>So it's sort of annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>

1945
01:47:08.670 --> 01:47:09.503
<v Speaker 6>here you are and it's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no lions here or a or anything </v>

1946
01:47:13.951 --> 01:47:14.784
<v Speaker 6>that might prey on you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you can think of something to be </v>

1947
01:47:18.901 --> 01:47:20.220
<v Speaker 6>anxious about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No problem.</v>

1948
01:47:20.221 --> 01:47:20.661
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

1949
01:47:20.661 --> 01:47:21.494
<v Speaker 6>I'm certain you've got some little </v>
<v Speaker 6>skeleton rattling around in your closet </v>

1950
01:47:25.081 --> 01:47:27.000
<v Speaker 6>somewhere that's like eating away at </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

1951
01:47:27.001 --> 01:47:27.834
<v Speaker 6>And so I think part of the reason we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>so damn awake human beings is because </v>

1952
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:34.130
<v Speaker 6>we're always anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1953
01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:35.323
<v Speaker 6>and you have to be awake when you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>anxious and the anxiety system actually </v>

1954
01:47:39.661 --> 01:47:41.880
<v Speaker 6>activates your reticular activating </v>
<v Speaker 6>system and that,</v>

1955
01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:44.430
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that actually produces.</v>

1956
01:47:46.410 --> 01:47:47.243
<v Speaker 6>It's the substrate for consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you snap a few fibers in the back of </v>

1957
01:47:50.101 --> 01:47:50.934
<v Speaker 6>your brain that are part of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>reticulating activating reticular </v>

1958
01:47:53.221 --> 01:47:55.190
<v Speaker 6>activating system in a car accident or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

1959
01:47:55.210 --> 01:47:57.630
<v Speaker 6>you'll go into a coma and that'll be </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're in,</v>

1960
01:47:57.660 --> 01:48:00.330
<v Speaker 6>you're not getting out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't take much of an injury either</v>

1961
01:48:00.331 --> 01:48:02.910
<v Speaker 6>in the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So anyways,</v>

1962
01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:07.920
<v Speaker 6>so human beings have been struggling </v>
<v Speaker 6>with this problem of threat forever.</v>

1963
01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:12.450
<v Speaker 6>A really for as long as there's been </v>
<v Speaker 6>life or at least as long as there's life</v>

1964
01:48:12.451 --> 01:48:14.080
<v Speaker 6>with a nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

1965
01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:17.040
<v Speaker 6>that's several hundred million years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a long time.</v>

1966
01:48:17.610 --> 01:48:18.443
<v Speaker 6>And of course</v>

1967
01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.540
<v Speaker 6>it's easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1968
01:48:21.630 --> 01:48:24.150
<v Speaker 6>to respond to a particular threat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Think about zebras,</v>

1969
01:48:24.151 --> 01:48:26.880
<v Speaker 6>they're out there on the belt and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's lions everywhere,</v>

1970
01:48:26.881 --> 01:48:28.140
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the zebras are like,</v>

1971
01:48:28.141 --> 01:48:30.360
<v Speaker 6>they're calm because there's lions are </v>
<v Speaker 6>sleeping.</v>

1972
01:48:30.361 --> 01:48:33.420
<v Speaker 6>And so the zebras don't think </v>
<v Speaker 6>apparently,</v>

1973
01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:34.973
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what was going to happen with those </v>

1974
01:48:36.631 --> 01:48:39.810
<v Speaker 6>lions wake up because they don't think </v>
<v Speaker 6>that way.</v>

1975
01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:40.733
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not going to be happy if the </v>

1976
01:48:41.401 --> 01:48:46.020
<v Speaker 6>line goes into a hunting crouch and </v>
<v Speaker 6>starts it's hunting approach obviously,</v>

1977
01:48:46.021 --> 01:48:46.854
<v Speaker 6>but it's not like the zebras are </v>
<v Speaker 6>freaking out nonstop because there are </v>

1978
01:48:50.521 --> 01:48:51.630
<v Speaker 6>lions around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1979
01:48:51.631 --> 01:48:55.490
<v Speaker 6>so they can react to specific threats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But human beings,</v>

1980
01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:58.980
<v Speaker 6>partly because we discovered the future,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was a big mistake,</v>

1981
01:48:59.110 --> 01:49:02.070
<v Speaker 6>it was a big mistake because the future </v>
<v Speaker 6>is an uncertain place.</v>

1982
01:49:02.850 --> 01:49:04.320
<v Speaker 6>We realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1983
01:49:04.321 --> 01:49:05.154
<v Speaker 6>there isn't any threat right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there might well be some tomorrow </v>

1984
01:49:07.770 --> 01:49:08.603
<v Speaker 6>and if there isn't some tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well maybe next week or next month or </v>

1985
01:49:10.981 --> 01:49:11.760
<v Speaker 6>next year.</v>

1986
01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:14.790
<v Speaker 6>Like it's common.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so there's danger.</v>

1987
01:49:14.850 --> 01:49:17.190
<v Speaker 6>So it's the category of danger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1988
01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:21.390
<v Speaker 6>and out of the category of danger </v>
<v Speaker 6>emerged specific threats.</v>

1989
01:49:21.391 --> 01:49:25.650
<v Speaker 6>And the dragon seems to be a symbol of </v>
<v Speaker 6>it is a symbol I believe,</v>

1990
01:49:25.690 --> 01:49:30.690
<v Speaker 6>of the ever present fact of predatory,</v>
<v Speaker 6>slightly predatory threat.</v>

1991
01:49:32.521 --> 01:49:37.230
<v Speaker 6>But our nervous systems as they've </v>
<v Speaker 6>become capable of abstraction,</v>

1992
01:49:37.231 --> 01:49:41.410
<v Speaker 6>have used that underlying architecture </v>
<v Speaker 6>to represent more abstract category,</v>

1993
01:49:41.411 --> 01:49:44.700
<v Speaker 6>so it's not the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not a Predator like a dragon is not</v>

1994
01:49:44.701 --> 01:49:45.534
<v Speaker 6>a Predator because there are no dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but maybe a dragon is a snake and a and </v>

1995
01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:52.240
<v Speaker 6>a crocodile and maybe a leopard and </v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe a,</v>

1996
01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:55.830
<v Speaker 6>a predatory bird all mangled into one </v>
<v Speaker 6>monster.</v>

1997
01:49:55.970 --> 01:49:56.803
<v Speaker 6>A monster is actually technically </v>
<v Speaker 6>something that's made out of disparate </v>

1998
01:49:59.291 --> 01:50:00.124
<v Speaker 6>parts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it's a good symbolic </v>

1999
01:50:00.791 --> 01:50:05.791
<v Speaker 6>representation for the unknown as such </v>
<v Speaker 6>that which lies beyond the campfire,</v>

2000
01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:08.320
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and what lurks out there.</v>

2001
01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:11.860
<v Speaker 6>And so the eternal problem is what the </v>
<v Speaker 6>hell do you do with the Dragon?</v>

2002
01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:16.930
<v Speaker 6>And that also explains why the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 6>typically is at treasure guarder right?</v>

2003
01:50:16.931 --> 01:50:17.764
<v Speaker 6>Because it's even more,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the problem is even worse out there in </v>

2004
01:50:21.191 --> 01:50:24.130
<v Speaker 6>no man's land out there in potential </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's threat and,</v>

2005
01:50:24.131 --> 01:50:26.110
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and like mortal threat.</v>

2006
01:50:26.410 --> 01:50:29.740
<v Speaker 6>But there's also endless opportunity and</v>
<v Speaker 6>riches and wealth and,</v>

2007
01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:30.993
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the possibility of attracting </v>

2008
01:50:32.561 --> 01:50:35.470
<v Speaker 6>someone and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so while the dragon,</v>

2009
01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:36.393
<v Speaker 6>you can't just be afraid of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just stay in your burrow the whole </v>

2010
01:50:38.981 --> 01:50:41.230
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And lots of animals more or less do that</v>

2011
01:50:41.231 --> 01:50:42.010
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2012
01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:44.320
<v Speaker 6>especially the nocturnal ones,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they just hide away.</v>

2013
01:50:44.650 --> 01:50:45.483
<v Speaker 6>But that isn't what human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 6>light because we're not only praying </v>

2014
01:50:47.201 --> 01:50:48.820
<v Speaker 6>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're also predators.</v>

2015
01:50:48.821 --> 01:50:51.820
<v Speaker 6>And then of course we're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're absolutely insane.</v>

2016
01:50:51.821 --> 01:50:53.050
<v Speaker 6>Chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2017
01:50:53.051 --> 01:50:53.884
<v Speaker 6>We're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so we're always out there mucking </v>

2018
01:50:55.631 --> 01:51:00.631
<v Speaker 6>about with things and with our fingers </v>
<v Speaker 6>and our thumbs and,</v>

2019
01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:03.550
<v Speaker 6>and taking the world apart and putting </v>
<v Speaker 6>it back together.</v>

2020
01:51:03.550 --> 01:51:07.630
<v Speaker 6>And we're crazily exploratory and </v>
<v Speaker 6>troublemaking.</v>

2021
01:51:07.631 --> 01:51:12.130
<v Speaker 6>And so we don't just run from dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we go hunt them down.</v>

2022
01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:16.860
<v Speaker 6>And so</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so there's a story here,</v>

2023
01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:17.823
<v Speaker 6>there's the oldest story that mankind </v>
<v Speaker 6>knows and literally it is the oldest </v>

2024
01:51:20.381 --> 01:51:21.214
<v Speaker 6>story that we know is this stories.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the story basically is there's a </v>

2025
01:51:24.101 --> 01:51:26.710
<v Speaker 6>bounded space,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a walled garden,</v>

2026
01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:27.573
<v Speaker 6>a walled city in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on all the original cities were walled </v>

2027
01:51:29.710 --> 01:51:30.543
<v Speaker 6>because if they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>barbarians would swoop in and they just </v>

2028
01:51:33.101 --> 01:51:34.870
<v Speaker 6>steal all your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

2029
01:51:35.090 --> 01:51:36.400
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was kind of pointless.</v>

2030
01:51:36.401 --> 01:51:37.234
<v Speaker 6>So you know you wanted to have some </v>
<v Speaker 6>major league walls surrounding your </v>

2031
01:51:40.391 --> 01:51:41.224
<v Speaker 6>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that's inhabited space and inside </v>

2032
01:51:43.661 --> 01:51:47.920
<v Speaker 6>that is your little dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 6>and so all you primates knew exactly who</v>

2033
01:51:47.921 --> 01:51:48.754
<v Speaker 6>was who inside that space so you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>have to fight with each other and you </v>

2034
01:51:51.251 --> 01:51:54.280
<v Speaker 6>could predict each other's behavior </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you believed the same things and</v>

2035
01:51:54.430 --> 01:51:55.263
<v Speaker 6>saw the world roughly the same way and </v>
<v Speaker 6>acted the same way and so you were sort </v>

2036
01:51:58.391 --> 01:51:59.170
<v Speaker 6>of secure.</v>

2037
01:51:59.170 --> 01:52:02.530
<v Speaker 6>But then the problem is is that that can</v>
<v Speaker 6>always be breached.</v>

2038
01:52:02.531 --> 01:52:04.810
<v Speaker 6>There's always something outside of it </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a danger,</v>

2039
01:52:04.811 --> 01:52:09.811
<v Speaker 6>and so that's signified by this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this little creature here is this dragon</v>

2040
01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:14.830
<v Speaker 6>and that that twirl in its tail is very </v>
<v Speaker 6>common among dragons.</v>

2041
01:52:14.831 --> 01:52:18.340
<v Speaker 6>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's actually a symbol because imagistic</v>

2042
01:52:18.341 --> 01:52:19.174
<v Speaker 6>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 6>images to symbols have an ancient </v>

2043
01:52:21.671 --> 01:52:22.504
<v Speaker 6>language and it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's referring to something that's </v>

2044
01:52:25.031 --> 01:52:27.700
<v Speaker 6>basically eternal and see it lives down </v>
<v Speaker 6>here in this,</v>

2045
01:52:27.730 --> 01:52:30.070
<v Speaker 6>in this cave,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it's an underground thing,</v>

2046
01:52:30.490 --> 01:52:31.323
<v Speaker 6>it's an underground thing and you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of imagine what that's like and </v>

2047
01:52:33.461 --> 01:52:37.090
<v Speaker 6>sometimes this happens in initiation </v>
<v Speaker 6>rituals among archaic people.</v>

2048
01:52:37.390 --> 01:52:38.980
<v Speaker 6>They're gonna win.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to initiate.</v>

2049
01:52:39.010 --> 01:52:39.843
<v Speaker 6>Usually the young men,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because nature initiates women all by </v>

2050
01:52:41.711 --> 01:52:43.960
<v Speaker 6>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm usually the young men,</v>

2051
01:52:44.290 --> 01:52:46.340
<v Speaker 6>maybe they'll put them in cave and leave</v>
<v Speaker 6>them there,</v>

2052
01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.313
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for like,</v>

2053
01:52:48.170 --> 01:52:48.820
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who knows,</v>

2054
01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:51.170
<v Speaker 6>who knows how long,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so you've got to think what's in the</v>

2055
01:52:51.171 --> 01:52:52.004
<v Speaker 6>cave.</v>

2056
01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:54.890
<v Speaker 6>Caves are dark man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if you've ever been in one,</v>

2057
01:52:54.891 --> 01:52:55.724
<v Speaker 6>but like they're dark and they're really</v>
<v Speaker 6>dark and so not only is there whatever </v>

2058
01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:03.290
<v Speaker 6>there is in the cave and you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 6>what the hell is in the cave.</v>

2059
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:06.140
<v Speaker 6>There's whatever you imagine might be in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the cave.</v>

2060
01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:09.050
<v Speaker 6>And so when you're in that cave and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're alone,</v>

2061
01:53:09.051 --> 01:53:11.600
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're confronting the devils and demons</v>

2062
01:53:11.601 --> 01:53:13.850
<v Speaker 6>and monsters of your own imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2063
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:17.540
<v Speaker 6>and so then you have a chance to perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 6>deal with that and overcome it.</v>

2064
01:53:17.541 --> 01:53:20.450
<v Speaker 6>And that's perhaps part of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>initiation ceremony,</v>

2065
01:53:20.451 --> 01:53:21.284
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's part of growing up because </v>

2066
01:53:22.641 --> 01:53:27.530
<v Speaker 6>you have to learn how to face the things</v>
<v Speaker 6>that terrify and upset you and,</v>

2067
01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:30.650
<v Speaker 6>and re cast them and put them back </v>
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>

2068
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:34.810
<v Speaker 6>We talked a little bit about this idea </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the pre cosmo Gona chaos that,</v>

2069
01:53:34.811 --> 01:53:35.830
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2070
01:53:35.850 --> 01:53:38.550
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eliana refers to an end.</v>

2071
01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:39.433
<v Speaker 6>That's the stuff out of which order is </v>
<v Speaker 6>produced at the beginning of time and </v>

2072
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:43.993
<v Speaker 6>it's also the stuff out of which you </v>
<v Speaker 6>constantly reproduce order and the </v>

2073
01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:49.880
<v Speaker 6>unions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the psychoanalysts,</v>

2074
01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:50.773
<v Speaker 6>especially the really deep </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychoanalysts like young Freud was a </v>

2075
01:53:53.481 --> 01:53:56.030
<v Speaker 6>more surface psychoanalyst and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>not an insult.</v>

2076
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:58.640
<v Speaker 6>There's some things that Freud figured </v>
<v Speaker 6>out there is absolutely amazing.</v>

2077
01:53:58.830 --> 01:54:03.470
<v Speaker 6>He was a precursor to young for sure</v>
<v Speaker 6>for young.</v>

2078
01:54:03.471 --> 01:54:06.620
<v Speaker 6>The Hero's journey was the journey </v>
<v Speaker 6>inside the unconscious and that would be</v>

2079
01:54:06.621 --> 01:54:07.454
<v Speaker 6>perhaps in some sense that the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the willingness to face everything </v>

2080
01:54:11.301 --> 01:54:12.134
<v Speaker 6>terrible that's happened to you and to </v>
<v Speaker 6>think it through and to articulate it </v>

2081
01:54:14.250 --> 01:54:18.020
<v Speaker 6>and to come to grips perhaps with your </v>
<v Speaker 6>own capacity for malevolence.</v>

2082
01:54:18.230 --> 01:54:20.540
<v Speaker 6>That was a really important part of </v>
<v Speaker 6>union ideas.</v>

2083
01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:23.570
<v Speaker 6>That the first step towards </v>
<v Speaker 6>individuation,</v>

2084
01:54:23.571 --> 01:54:25.880
<v Speaker 6>which is the manifestation of your full </v>
<v Speaker 6>self,</v>

2085
01:54:25.881 --> 01:54:26.714
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was the discovery of your shadow and </v>

2086
01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:29.653
<v Speaker 6>your shadow is the part of you that will</v>
<v Speaker 6>do terrible things under the right </v>

2087
01:54:33.441 --> 01:54:34.340
<v Speaker 6>circumstances.</v>

2088
01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:36.590
<v Speaker 6>And maybe even without that much </v>
<v Speaker 6>provocation.</v>

2089
01:54:36.591 --> 01:54:37.424
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's a terrifying part of you to </v>

2090
01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:41.300
<v Speaker 6>come into contact with because it sort </v>
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

2091
01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:42.493
<v Speaker 6>it sort of the way that you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>specifically attached to the archetype </v>

2092
01:54:44.931 --> 01:54:47.480
<v Speaker 6>of evil now it's like that's a good way </v>
<v Speaker 6>of thinking about it.</v>

2093
01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:48.800
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>modern people,</v>

2094
01:54:48.801 --> 01:54:52.040
<v Speaker 6>they don't really think much about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>bunch of both the idea of good and evil,</v>

2095
01:54:52.041 --> 01:54:54.110
<v Speaker 6>but that's because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of them are so damn naive,</v>

2096
01:54:54.111 --> 01:54:57.920
<v Speaker 6>you can just barely even comprehend it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2097
01:54:57.921 --> 01:55:01.460
<v Speaker 6>if you read any history,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you really read it like,</v>

2098
01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:02.993
<v Speaker 6>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you don't come away with the idea </v>

2099
01:55:04.641 --> 01:55:05.474
<v Speaker 6>that evil exists.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you're just reading the wrong </v>

2100
01:55:07.251 --> 01:55:08.490
<v Speaker 6>kind of history.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2101
01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:12.890
<v Speaker 6>it's just unbelievable what people can </v>
<v Speaker 6>do to each other.</v>

2102
01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:14.990
<v Speaker 6>And we're so imaginative,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2103
01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:17.060
<v Speaker 6>and one of the things I figured out </v>
<v Speaker 6>about people,</v>

2104
01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:21.080
<v Speaker 6>the reason that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have the knowledge of good and evil,</v>

2105
01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:24.410
<v Speaker 6>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that because we're self conscious and</v>

2106
01:55:24.411 --> 01:55:27.080
<v Speaker 6>we know about ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we know about our own vulnerability,</v>

2107
01:55:27.110 --> 01:55:27.500
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2108
01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:28.333
<v Speaker 6>You know what hurts you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You really know what hurts you way more </v>

2109
01:55:30.801 --> 01:55:32.600
<v Speaker 6>than an animal notes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

2110
01:55:32.601 --> 01:55:35.420
<v Speaker 6>and you're also creative and so once you</v>
<v Speaker 6>know what hurts you,</v>

2111
01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:38.240
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can really hurt someone else and you</v>

2112
01:55:38.241 --> 01:55:41.000
<v Speaker 6>can do it in such a creative way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can draw it out,</v>

2113
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:44.520
<v Speaker 6>you can make it excruciating.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can take people apart physically and</v>

2114
01:55:44.521 --> 01:55:45.354
<v Speaker 6>psychologically and you can keep them </v>
<v Speaker 6>say even right on the edge of death so </v>

2115
01:55:48.601 --> 01:55:49.434
<v Speaker 6>that you can keep doing that endlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know that happens a hell of a </v>

2116
01:55:53.401 --> 01:55:54.810
<v Speaker 6>lot more than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It happens.</v>

2117
01:55:54.811 --> 01:55:59.050
<v Speaker 6>It happens a lot and so</v>
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>

2118
01:55:59.090 --> 01:55:59.851
<v Speaker 6>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2119
01:55:59.851 --> 01:56:01.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that doesn't involve me.</v>

2120
01:56:01.231 --> 01:56:02.370
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yes it does,</v>

2121
01:56:02.371 --> 01:56:03.204
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the problem because you know </v>

2122
01:56:04.411 --> 01:56:05.244
<v Speaker 6>you're human and that's the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>things that human beings are capable of </v>

2123
01:56:07.741 --> 01:56:09.330
<v Speaker 6>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying you're all,</v>

2124
01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:13.620
<v Speaker 6>it's all probable that you do that ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>or or that,</v>

2125
01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:15.570
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2126
01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:17.153
<v Speaker 6>you gotta take that into account when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're looking at the world and you </v>

2127
01:56:19.801 --> 01:56:21.630
<v Speaker 6>think about all the perpetrators out </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

2128
01:56:21.630 --> 01:56:22.463
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not like there's perpetrators and </v>

2129
01:56:24.391 --> 01:56:27.000
<v Speaker 6>their victims.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That isn't how it works.</v>

2130
01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:28.373
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't work that way at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so the horrors of humanity as well </v>

2131
01:56:31.441 --> 01:56:32.274
<v Speaker 6>as the noble elements of humanity are </v>
<v Speaker 6>all elements of your central being and </v>

2132
01:56:35.911 --> 01:56:38.580
<v Speaker 6>for young,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is the terrible thing for using</v>

2133
01:56:38.581 --> 01:56:39.414
<v Speaker 6>the pathway to higher wisdom was through</v>
<v Speaker 6>the terrible portal of while you could </v>

2134
01:56:43.531 --> 01:56:45.610
<v Speaker 6>say hell for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

2135
01:56:45.630 --> 01:56:47.940
<v Speaker 6>And so who wants to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man?</v>

2136
01:56:47.941 --> 01:56:49.860
<v Speaker 6>It's like no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2137
01:56:49.861 --> 01:56:51.630
<v Speaker 6>like maybe you're resentful about </v>
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

2138
01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:52.493
<v Speaker 6>Well you probably are because like </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody's resentful about something </v>

2139
01:56:54.751 --> 01:56:57.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and resentment is just vicious emotion.</v>

2140
01:56:58.230 --> 01:56:59.063
<v Speaker 6>It's really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really useful because if you're </v>

2141
01:57:01.411 --> 01:57:04.890
<v Speaker 6>resentful about something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it either means that you should grow the</v>

2142
01:57:04.891 --> 01:57:09.891
<v Speaker 6>hell up and accept the responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 6>and quit sniveling around and whining or</v>

2143
01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:12.860
<v Speaker 6>it means that someone actually is </v>
<v Speaker 6>oppressing you and,</v>

2144
01:57:12.861 --> 01:57:13.694
<v Speaker 6>and pushing on you too hard and bullying</v>
<v Speaker 6>you and demeaning you and you have </v>

2145
01:57:16.771 --> 01:57:21.771
<v Speaker 6>something to say or do that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 6>saying or doing and no wonder you're not</v>

2146
01:57:22.831 --> 01:57:27.831
<v Speaker 6>saying or doing it because you know it </v>
<v Speaker 6>can be really dangerous to say things or</v>

2147
01:57:28.111 --> 01:57:31.740
<v Speaker 6>do them to free yourself from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from being oppressed.</v>

2148
01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:33.690
<v Speaker 6>You can get it a lot of trouble in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>short term.</v>

2149
01:57:33.691 --> 01:57:34.524
<v Speaker 6>For doing it so it's easier just to not </v>
<v Speaker 6>say anything sort of day after day in </v>

2150
01:57:38.371 --> 01:57:41.070
<v Speaker 6>the short term you protect yourself but </v>
<v Speaker 6>just crushes you.</v>

2151
01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:44.160
<v Speaker 6>And then the resentment comes up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>resentment.</v>

2152
01:57:44.161 --> 01:57:46.290
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that can just get so out of hand.</v>

2153
01:57:46.291 --> 01:57:47.124
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it starts with resentment and then it </v>

2154
01:57:48.721 --> 01:57:51.540
<v Speaker 6>starts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It goes to the desire for revenge.</v>

2155
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:52.583
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because you'll play nasty little tricks </v>

2156
01:57:53.521 --> 01:57:56.160
<v Speaker 6>on the person that's oppressing you at </v>
<v Speaker 6>any chance.</v>

2157
01:57:56.161 --> 01:57:59.190
<v Speaker 6>You'll talk about them behind their back</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if they want you to do something,</v>

2158
01:57:59.191 --> 01:58:01.380
<v Speaker 6>you'll do it badly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or you'll do it grudgingly.</v>

2159
01:58:01.381 --> 01:58:04.670
<v Speaker 6>Or you'll do a half rate job and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 6>set up little traps and you know,</v>

2160
01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:08.220
<v Speaker 6>so it puts you in a poisonous space.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then if that,</v>

2161
01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:09.233
<v Speaker 6>if you really start to dwell on that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say in your basement for three or four </v>

2162
01:58:12.781 --> 01:58:13.614
<v Speaker 6>years about just exactly how terrible </v>
<v Speaker 6>the world is and how that's focused on </v>

2163
01:58:16.291 --> 01:58:17.820
<v Speaker 6>you and how everyone's rejected you.</v>

2164
01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:20.700
<v Speaker 6>And how you get to this point where </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're thinking that,</v>

2165
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:21.863
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>existence itself is a kind of poisonous </v>

2166
01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:26.250
<v Speaker 6>endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that the best thing for you to do is</v>

2167
01:58:26.251 --> 01:58:27.084
<v Speaker 6>go out there and do as much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>create as much mayhem as you possibly </v>

2168
01:58:30.121 --> 01:58:32.700
<v Speaker 6>can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if you really get to a dark place,</v>

2169
01:58:32.701 --> 01:58:33.534
<v Speaker 6>you think I'm going to create as much </v>
<v Speaker 6>mayhem as I possibly can by targeting </v>

2170
01:58:36.901 --> 01:58:39.480
<v Speaker 6>the most innocent thing I can possibly </v>
<v Speaker 6>imagine.</v>

2171
01:58:39.690 --> 01:58:40.523
<v Speaker 6>And then you end up shooting kids in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Connecticut and that's how you get </v>

2172
01:58:43.211 --> 01:58:46.390
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so that's a bad road man.</v>

2173
01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:47.413
<v Speaker 6>There's dark things down there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you can go there and people do and </v>

2174
01:58:50.981 --> 01:58:51.814
<v Speaker 6>they go through the whole of resentment </v>
<v Speaker 6>and resentment can tell you you've got </v>

2175
01:58:56.021 --> 01:58:58.930
<v Speaker 6>something to say.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You bloody well better say it.</v>

2176
01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:02.410
<v Speaker 6>You've gotta free yourself from what's </v>
<v Speaker 6>oppressing you.</v>

2177
01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:06.670
<v Speaker 6>You have to stand up for that because </v>
<v Speaker 6>otherwise you become oppressed.</v>

2178
01:59:06.670 --> 01:59:11.410
<v Speaker 6>And then once you're oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just not so good.</v>

2179
01:59:11.530 --> 01:59:14.320
<v Speaker 6>And so like in your marriage and your </v>
<v Speaker 6>relationships,</v>

2180
01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:17.230
<v Speaker 6>you gotta tell people what you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking.</v>

2181
01:59:17.231 --> 01:59:18.064
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to assume you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a whole different story because </v>

2182
01:59:20.951 --> 01:59:22.160
<v Speaker 6>you're not because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2183
01:59:22.161 --> 01:59:26.470
<v Speaker 6>ignorant and you're biased and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you're not right,</v>

2184
01:59:26.650 --> 01:59:31.650
<v Speaker 6>but you can stumble towards Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this expression of yourself and then you</v>

2185
01:59:32.201 --> 01:59:33.034
<v Speaker 6>can listen to the other person and hope </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they tell you some way that you're </v>

2186
01:59:36.071 --> 01:59:36.904
<v Speaker 6>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's useful so you can be a little </v>

2187
01:59:38.381 --> 01:59:41.410
<v Speaker 6>less stupid in the future because that </v>
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't that be good.</v>

2188
01:59:41.950 --> 01:59:44.650
<v Speaker 6>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go after the unknown.</v>

2189
01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:48.820
<v Speaker 6>You don't protect what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You already know what you know.</v>

2190
01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:50.493
<v Speaker 6>You go after what you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why you have to talk to people </v>

2191
01:59:52.511 --> 01:59:53.344
<v Speaker 6>you don't agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why you have to talk to your </v>

2192
01:59:54.881 --> 01:59:57.790
<v Speaker 6>enemies because they're going to tell </v>
<v Speaker 6>you things you don't know.</v>

2193
01:59:57.790 --> 01:59:58.623
<v Speaker 6>You could even listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's possibly know a thing or two you </v>

2194
02:00:00.401 --> 02:00:02.470
<v Speaker 6>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but people don't like that.</v>

2195
02:00:02.471 --> 02:00:04.120
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they just talked to people who think the</v>

2196
02:00:04.121 --> 02:00:08.020
<v Speaker 6>same way and then they just stay stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so that's.</v>

2197
02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:11.530
<v Speaker 6>And that's not good because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>not wise,</v>

2198
02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:15.150
<v Speaker 6>the world will wall up you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'll flatten you and,</v>

2199
02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:16.083
<v Speaker 6>and far more than it has to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you'll be bitter and resentful </v>

2200
02:00:19.181 --> 02:00:23.290
<v Speaker 6>and you'll be part of that force,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that wall ups instead of the forest that</v>

2201
02:00:23.291 --> 02:00:25.780
<v Speaker 6>fights against that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So while,</v>

2202
02:00:25.781 --> 02:00:27.670
<v Speaker 6>so you go after the dragon and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

2203
02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:30.580
<v Speaker 6>that's what this guy is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's going after the dragon hint.</v>

2204
02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:34.300
<v Speaker 6>It's threatening the society because it </v>
<v Speaker 6>always does chaos.</v>

2205
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:36.730
<v Speaker 6>What's outside of order always threatens</v>
<v Speaker 6>order.</v>

2206
02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:38.380
<v Speaker 6>Always,</v>
<v Speaker 6>always.</v>

2207
02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:41.560
<v Speaker 6>And so you have to step forward,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2208
02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:44.290
<v Speaker 6>in this manner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>voluntarily and,</v>

2209
02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:45.613
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and go after that when it's still </v>

2210
02:00:46.631 --> 02:00:47.470
<v Speaker 6>manageable.</v>

2211
02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:48.453
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's the case in your own life </v>

2212
02:00:49.211 --> 02:00:50.044
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>

2213
02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:53.080
<v Speaker 6>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you've had a proclivity to be bullied</v>

2214
02:00:53.081 --> 02:00:54.130
<v Speaker 6>in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2215
02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:55.773
<v Speaker 6>and you want to get out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you have to do is you have to make </v>

2216
02:00:57.371 --> 02:01:01.300
<v Speaker 6>yourself awake to the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the,</v>

2217
02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:02.710
<v Speaker 6>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the,</v>

2218
02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:03.753
<v Speaker 6>what would you say to the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the initial stages of that sort of </v>

2219
02:01:07.391 --> 02:01:09.340
<v Speaker 6>bullying emerging in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

2220
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:10.183
<v Speaker 6>that sort of domination.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you have to step forward against it </v>

2221
02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:15.610
<v Speaker 6>when it's still in its developing </v>
<v Speaker 6>stages.</v>

2222
02:01:15.611 --> 02:01:17.470
<v Speaker 6>Because maybe you can just not have it </v>
<v Speaker 6>happen.</v>

2223
02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:18.693
<v Speaker 6>That would be better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so you have to be ready to speak </v>

2224
02:01:22.150 --> 02:01:25.300
<v Speaker 6>what you have to say more or less on a </v>
<v Speaker 6>moment's notice.</v>

2225
02:01:25.301 --> 02:01:26.880
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't be impulsive about,</v>

2226
02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:28.073
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you and I are talking and you </v>

2227
02:01:28.961 --> 02:01:33.610
<v Speaker 6>make a mistake or I make a mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if it's bothers one or the other of</v>

2228
02:01:33.611 --> 02:01:35.050
<v Speaker 6>us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we should just write it off because it's</v>

2229
02:01:35.051 --> 02:01:36.370
<v Speaker 6>like one encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the hell,</v>

2230
02:01:36.371 --> 02:01:37.204
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe we had a bad night's sleep or </v>

2231
02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:39.673
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2232
02:01:40.170 --> 02:01:41.600
<v Speaker 6>so you've got to be a little forgiving.</v>

2233
02:01:42.030 --> 02:01:42.863
<v Speaker 6>But if it happens twice then you know </v>
<v Speaker 6>you should be a little awake and you </v>

2234
02:01:46.371 --> 02:01:49.010
<v Speaker 6>should remember both times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then if it happens a third time,</v>

2235
02:01:49.011 --> 02:01:52.250
<v Speaker 6>it's like that's when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's when you act and you say,</v>

2236
02:01:52.251 --> 02:01:56.060
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we talked and this happened.</v>

2237
02:01:56.061 --> 02:01:57.260
<v Speaker 6>And I thought yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

2238
02:01:57.261 --> 02:02:01.460
<v Speaker 6>And then you did it again and then you </v>
<v Speaker 6>just did it again.</v>

2239
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:03.260
<v Speaker 6>Well then the person who is basically </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2240
02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:04.820
<v Speaker 6>what are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2241
02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:08.270
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well maybe they might argue with you,</v>

2242
02:02:08.271 --> 02:02:10.820
<v Speaker 6>but you kind of got them and you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>generally.</v>

2243
02:02:10.821 --> 02:02:13.310
<v Speaker 6>If you just point that out to people </v>
<v Speaker 6>just like that,</v>

2244
02:02:13.311 --> 02:02:15.830
<v Speaker 6>just that you noticed and are willing to</v>
<v Speaker 6>say something about it,</v>

2245
02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:17.173
<v Speaker 6>they'll back the hell off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll often apologize and sometimes </v>

2246
02:02:19.731 --> 02:02:21.500
<v Speaker 6>you even make them a little more </v>
<v Speaker 6>conscious,</v>

2247
02:02:21.501 --> 02:02:22.460
<v Speaker 6>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2248
02:02:22.461 --> 02:02:25.700
<v Speaker 6>that's not such a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what all this means.</v>

2249
02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:29.210
<v Speaker 6>And so this caught this chaos idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so for union,</v>

2250
02:02:29.230 --> 02:02:30.500
<v Speaker 6>it was the unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2251
02:02:30.501 --> 02:02:31.334
<v Speaker 6>It was the contents of your unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 6>and so that might be the unknown past </v>

2252
02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:35.113
<v Speaker 6>that threatening past that you have </v>
<v Speaker 6>never dealt with might be the </v>

2253
02:02:37.641 --> 02:02:40.790
<v Speaker 6>threatening future.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might be too threatening present,</v>

2254
02:02:41.210 --> 02:02:42.043
<v Speaker 6>but you realized as his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as he got older that that the </v>

2255
02:02:45.561 --> 02:02:48.230
<v Speaker 6>unconscious was also the world when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>think,</v>

2256
02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:49.333
<v Speaker 6>and so the chaos is not only your </v>
<v Speaker 6>unconscious mind which meets the </v>

2257
02:02:52.401 --> 02:02:53.234
<v Speaker 6>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's actually the unknown itself </v>

2258
02:02:54.411 --> 02:02:56.320
<v Speaker 6>mingled together and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2259
02:02:56.321 --> 02:03:00.050
<v Speaker 6>what the hell does that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why the dragon is a land creature</v>

2260
02:03:00.051 --> 02:03:02.690
<v Speaker 6>in an error creature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's matter and spirit at the same time,</v>

2261
02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:03.673
<v Speaker 6>and this sort of gets us into </v>
<v Speaker 6>constructivism because the </v>

2262
02:03:05.841 --> 02:03:06.674
<v Speaker 6>constructivists think that basically </v>
<v Speaker 6>what happens is that you encountered </v>

2263
02:03:09.191 --> 02:03:10.024
<v Speaker 6>those elements of the world that don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>fit into your theory and out of those </v>

2264
02:03:13.641 --> 02:03:14.474
<v Speaker 6>new elements you make the world through </v>
<v Speaker 6>your perceptions and you make yourself </v>

2265
02:03:17.841 --> 02:03:18.674
<v Speaker 6>by incorporating the information and </v>
<v Speaker 6>transforming yourself and that's how </v>

2266
02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:23.390
<v Speaker 6>piaget explains the development of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>child.</v>

2267
02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:25.910
<v Speaker 6>If the child starts out with some </v>
<v Speaker 6>reflexes,</v>

2268
02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:30.530
<v Speaker 6>basic reflexes and manifesting the </v>
<v Speaker 6>reflex is produces results in the world,</v>

2269
02:03:30.531 --> 02:03:31.364
<v Speaker 6>and then the child has to reorganize its</v>
<v Speaker 6>perceptions to take into account the </v>

2270
02:03:34.971 --> 02:03:35.804
<v Speaker 6>transformations and so then it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it gets a little more sophisticated and </v>

2271
02:03:38.841 --> 02:03:42.560
<v Speaker 6>then it can do a few more things and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then it can manifest more changes in the</v>

2272
02:03:42.561 --> 02:03:43.394
<v Speaker 6>world and then it modern.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It attracts them and modifies its </v>

2273
02:03:46.161 --> 02:03:46.994
<v Speaker 6>perceptions and actions to account for </v>
<v Speaker 6>them and it just keeps doing that and </v>

2274
02:03:49.791 --> 02:03:53.000
<v Speaker 6>that's how the child boots itself up </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a computer does.</v>

2275
02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:57.440
<v Speaker 6>It's a very cool idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so from from the Piagetian stance,</v>

2276
02:03:57.441 --> 02:03:58.274
<v Speaker 6>so it's constructive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The stance you could think of the world </v>

2277
02:03:59.781 --> 02:04:00.614
<v Speaker 6>as a latent pool of information,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's something like that with a </v>

2278
02:04:04.071 --> 02:04:04.904
<v Speaker 6>structure obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you can interact with with your </v>

2279
02:04:07.161 --> 02:04:07.994
<v Speaker 6>little fingers in your body and your </v>
<v Speaker 6>mind and your eyes and your mouth and </v>

2280
02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:12.763
<v Speaker 6>you make changes happen and you track </v>
<v Speaker 6>them and you've modeled them and you </v>

2281
02:04:15.501 --> 02:04:16.334
<v Speaker 6>build your skills and as you continue to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do that in the safety of your house </v>

2282
02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:22.550
<v Speaker 6>initially under the care of your parents</v>
<v Speaker 6>who,</v>

2283
02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:24.880
<v Speaker 6>who fill in where you're ignorant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

2284
02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:25.743
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just emerge more and more competent </v>

2285
02:04:28.281 --> 02:04:30.470
<v Speaker 6>and confident and ready to move ahead.</v>

2286
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:31.303
<v Speaker 6>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's how the constructivist idea </v>

2287
02:04:32.301 --> 02:04:33.410
<v Speaker 6>works.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

2288
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:36.260
<v Speaker 6>so there's kind of a chaos id at the </v>
<v Speaker 6>bottom of that,</v>

2289
02:04:36.261 --> 02:04:37.094
<v Speaker 6>which is that out of which you emerge </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the world emerges at the same time </v>

2290
02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:44.460
<v Speaker 6>because you know you don't see reality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not at all.</v>

2291
02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:47.610
<v Speaker 6>You see almost like an animated version </v>
<v Speaker 6>of reality.</v>

2292
02:04:47.611 --> 02:04:48.960
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when I look at you,</v>

2293
02:04:48.961 --> 02:04:49.794
<v Speaker 6>I just see the front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just see the outside of the US EU at </v>

2294
02:04:52.351 --> 02:04:53.184
<v Speaker 6>this height.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't see any of your internal </v>

2295
02:04:54.181 --> 02:04:57.450
<v Speaker 6>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't see the back part of you at all.</v>

2296
02:04:57.451 --> 02:05:00.150
<v Speaker 6>I don't see your family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't see your history.</v>

2297
02:05:00.270 --> 02:05:02.370
<v Speaker 6>I don't see your future.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2298
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:06.210
<v Speaker 6>I just see this slice of you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're so complicated.</v>

2299
02:05:06.211 --> 02:05:07.044
<v Speaker 6>I just see this little like </v>
<v Speaker 6>oversimplified slice of you right now </v>

2300
02:05:11.041 --> 02:05:13.240
<v Speaker 6>and I think that's the reality and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2301
02:05:13.250 --> 02:05:15.930
<v Speaker 6>it's sort of the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the way that the simpsons,</v>

2302
02:05:16.410 --> 02:05:18.840
<v Speaker 6>a simpsons character is you.</v>

2303
02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:23.910
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's sort of like you and it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>enough so that you can watch the story,</v>

2304
02:05:23.911 --> 02:05:28.140
<v Speaker 6>but the real you man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>God only knows what that is and that's a</v>

2305
02:05:28.141 --> 02:05:28.974
<v Speaker 6>union idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know that the real you is something </v>

2306
02:05:31.351 --> 02:05:32.184
<v Speaker 6>that radically transcends your </v>
<v Speaker 6>perception of yourself or your </v>

2307
02:05:35.251 --> 02:05:36.084
<v Speaker 6>conception of yourself and that you get </v>
<v Speaker 6>to that hire you at least in part by </v>

2308
02:05:40.111 --> 02:05:44.950
<v Speaker 6>going into the darkest place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it's a hell of an idea,</v>

2309
02:05:44.980 --> 02:05:45.900
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really.</v>

2310
02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:46.883
<v Speaker 6>But it's the old idea of initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's as old as time that idea and </v>

2311
02:05:50.611 --> 02:05:52.930
<v Speaker 6>there's something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we definitely recreate it.</v>

2312
02:05:52.931 --> 02:05:55.590
<v Speaker 6>And psychotherapy like this isn't an </v>
<v Speaker 6>airy theory.</v>

2313
02:05:56.070 --> 02:06:00.600
<v Speaker 6>It's quite the contrary because what you</v>
<v Speaker 6>do and as a psychologist always,</v>

2314
02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:01.493
<v Speaker 6>always a behaviorist say that the most,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the most logical clinical type of </v>

2315
02:06:06.061 --> 02:06:06.894
<v Speaker 6>psychologist or behaviorist is that an </v>
<v Speaker 6>initiatory Sharma and even though he or </v>

2316
02:06:10.771 --> 02:06:13.680
<v Speaker 6>she doesn't know it because what they do</v>
<v Speaker 6>is they say,</v>

2317
02:06:13.681 --> 02:06:15.420
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well let's take a look at your life.</v>

2318
02:06:15.450 --> 02:06:16.171
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2319
02:06:16.171 --> 02:06:17.004
<v Speaker 6>you got a bunch of problems and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>like massive dragons and you're just </v>

2320
02:06:19.831 --> 02:06:20.664
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not going anywhere with those </v>

2321
02:06:21.991 --> 02:06:24.060
<v Speaker 6>problems here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just cowering in the corner.</v>

2322
02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:27.480
<v Speaker 6>And what the behavior therapist does is </v>
<v Speaker 6>cut them,</v>

2323
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:32.190
<v Speaker 6>cut that dragon into those little dwarfs</v>
<v Speaker 6>until the doors are small enough so that</v>

2324
02:06:32.191 --> 02:06:33.024
<v Speaker 6>you can really kick the hell out of them</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so and that by the way they do that </v>

2325
02:06:36.091 --> 02:06:36.924
<v Speaker 6>is they take the problem and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>decompose it into elements that are </v>

2326
02:06:40.051 --> 02:06:44.670
<v Speaker 6>small enough that you have a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 6>probability of mastering them.</v>

2327
02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:48.900
<v Speaker 6>So you take the problem apart into </v>
<v Speaker 6>intuit's micro problems.</v>

2328
02:06:49.050 --> 02:06:49.883
<v Speaker 6>Careful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>careful analytic process and then you </v>

2329
02:06:51.751 --> 02:06:52.261
<v Speaker 6>think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2330
02:06:52.261 --> 02:06:55.140
<v Speaker 6>well how could we progress a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 6>this week?</v>

2331
02:06:55.141 --> 02:06:59.460
<v Speaker 6>And some of that is to face to practice </v>
<v Speaker 6>facing things you're afraid of.</v>

2332
02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:02.490
<v Speaker 6>So like if your agoraphobic and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>can't get on an elevator,</v>

2333
02:07:02.610 --> 02:07:05.640
<v Speaker 6>you can't get on a taxi and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 6>stand up to your husband,</v>

2334
02:07:05.641 --> 02:07:08.160
<v Speaker 6>and I'm saying husband,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because most agoraphobic are women,</v>

2335
02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:11.490
<v Speaker 6>most of them are middle aged women and </v>
<v Speaker 6>most of them were too dependent for most</v>

2336
02:07:11.491 --> 02:07:12.324
<v Speaker 6>of their life.</v>

2337
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:15.750
<v Speaker 6>So that's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like society,</v>

2338
02:07:15.751 --> 02:07:17.400
<v Speaker 6>husband,</v>
<v Speaker 6>elevator,</v>

2339
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:18.750
<v Speaker 6>taxi,</v>
<v Speaker 6>subway.</v>

2340
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:19.703
<v Speaker 6>It's a monster and it's that place you </v>
<v Speaker 6>will not go and that's because you feel </v>

2341
02:07:23.731 --> 02:07:26.160
<v Speaker 6>this high and everything else looks this</v>
<v Speaker 6>big.</v>

2342
02:07:26.550 --> 02:07:27.383
<v Speaker 6>And so and partly that's because you've </v>
<v Speaker 6>run away and when you run away from </v>

2343
02:07:29.761 --> 02:07:32.010
<v Speaker 6>something it grows and chases you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which is,</v>

2344
02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:33.173
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's exactly what happens to a prey </v>

2345
02:07:34.291 --> 02:07:35.124
<v Speaker 6>animal man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you go in the woods and you find a </v>

2346
02:07:36.701 --> 02:07:38.770
<v Speaker 6>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially at Grizzly,</v>

2347
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:41.380
<v Speaker 6>while you're in real trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it's a grizzly.</v>

2348
02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:43.000
<v Speaker 6>But if it's a black bear,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2349
02:07:43.001 --> 02:07:45.280
<v Speaker 6>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you stand your ground and make a hell</v>

2350
02:07:45.281 --> 02:07:46.750
<v Speaker 6>of a lot of noise,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that thing,</v>

2351
02:07:46.751 --> 02:07:49.980
<v Speaker 6>we'll leave you alone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you run well,</v>

2352
02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:53.350
<v Speaker 6>what's it supposed to think?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It eats things that run from it.</v>

2353
02:07:54.250 --> 02:07:56.770
<v Speaker 6>So that's exactly where that idea came </v>
<v Speaker 6>to come from.</v>

2354
02:07:56.771 --> 02:07:57.604
<v Speaker 6>You turn tail and run and then the thing</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're afraid of is really a </v>

2355
02:08:00.341 --> 02:08:03.010
<v Speaker 6>monster and it's gonna get you and eat </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

2356
02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:05.560
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well that's true psychologically as well</v>

2357
02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:08.860
<v Speaker 6>and the same circuits that we use to </v>
<v Speaker 6>when we were,</v>

2358
02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:10.510
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>out in the forest,</v>

2359
02:08:10.511 --> 02:08:11.344
<v Speaker 6>even even in trees,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the same circuits that we used to parse </v>

2360
02:08:13.841 --> 02:08:18.160
<v Speaker 6>up the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then into safe territory and place where</v>

2361
02:08:18.161 --> 02:08:21.790
<v Speaker 6>the predators loom is the way we parse </v>
<v Speaker 6>up the world now,</v>

2362
02:08:21.791 --> 02:08:25.150
<v Speaker 6>which is safe territory and the place </v>
<v Speaker 6>where the predators loom.</v>

2363
02:08:25.151 --> 02:08:28.750
<v Speaker 6>It's just become abstracted way up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>abstracted way up.</v>

2364
02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:31.390
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it's the same damn circuits.</v>

2365
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:36.070
<v Speaker 6>We know this like the same circuits you </v>
<v Speaker 6>use to forage for information.</v>

2366
02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:37.173
<v Speaker 6>Just dopaminergic circuit is the circuit</v>
<v Speaker 6>that squirrels used to forage for nuts </v>

2367
02:08:41.230 --> 02:08:42.370
<v Speaker 6>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well why?</v>

2368
02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:45.910
<v Speaker 6>Well it's because there's no difference </v>
<v Speaker 6>between information and food.</v>

2369
02:08:46.810 --> 02:08:48.910
<v Speaker 6>Like you trade information for food all </v>
<v Speaker 6>the time.</v>

2370
02:08:48.911 --> 02:08:50.380
<v Speaker 6>That's what you're doing when you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>working,</v>

2371
02:08:50.381 --> 02:08:52.270
<v Speaker 6>especially if you're working on a </v>
<v Speaker 6>computer.</v>

2372
02:08:53.050 --> 02:08:53.883
<v Speaker 6>So the idea that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's an equation between information </v>

2373
02:08:57.341 --> 02:08:58.270
<v Speaker 6>and food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2374
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:59.223
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>obviously obviously there's an equation </v>

2375
02:09:01.361 --> 02:09:04.090
<v Speaker 6>between them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so of course you'd use the same circuits</v>

2376
02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:05.253
<v Speaker 6>and I mean the damn squirrel has to </v>
<v Speaker 6>remember where the nuts are and so for </v>

2377
02:09:08.501 --> 02:09:12.370
<v Speaker 6>him information is food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even so in what happened to human beings</v>

2378
02:09:12.371 --> 02:09:14.170
<v Speaker 6>is that we started thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

2379
02:09:14.171 --> 02:09:15.004
<v Speaker 6>maybe it's better to go after </v>
<v Speaker 6>information than it is to go after food </v>

2380
02:09:18.850 --> 02:09:22.420
<v Speaker 6>because going after inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 6>produces more food than just going after</v>

2381
02:09:22.421 --> 02:09:23.254
<v Speaker 6>food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so that was a pretty damn smart </v>

2382
02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:26.680
<v Speaker 6>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we're still doing that.</v>

2383
02:09:26.860 --> 02:09:27.693
<v Speaker 6>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is what you're supposed to be </v>

2384
02:09:28.391 --> 02:09:30.040
<v Speaker 6>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

2385
02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:33.490
<v Speaker 6>and this is what behavior therapists do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they decompose your problems.</v>

2386
02:09:33.610 --> 02:09:35.080
<v Speaker 6>What are you afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2387
02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:37.000
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're afraid of everything.</v>

2388
02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:37.953
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's get something specific you're </v>

2389
02:09:39.311 --> 02:09:40.001
<v Speaker 6>afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2390
02:09:40.001 --> 02:09:41.080
<v Speaker 6>I'm afraid of an elevator.</v>

2391
02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:42.760
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>An elevator.</v>

2392
02:09:42.910 --> 02:09:45.730
<v Speaker 6>So I have a client,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's afraid of elevators.</v>

2393
02:09:45.731 --> 02:09:46.900
<v Speaker 6>The elevator door opened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She goes,</v>

2394
02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:49.270
<v Speaker 6>that's a tube.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I thought,</v>

2395
02:09:49.330 --> 02:09:51.460
<v Speaker 6>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was an elevator,</v>

2396
02:09:51.490 --> 02:09:54.820
<v Speaker 6>but for you it's not a bloody elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's death.</v>

2397
02:09:55.390 --> 02:09:57.820
<v Speaker 6>And so that's what you're afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's worse than that.</v>

2398
02:09:57.821 --> 02:10:00.520
<v Speaker 6>You're afraid of being trapped inside </v>
<v Speaker 6>there in the dark alone,</v>

2399
02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:03.670
<v Speaker 6>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not knowing if anyone is going to rescue</v>

2400
02:10:03.671 --> 02:10:04.504
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuck there with your damn imagination </v>

2401
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:08.170
<v Speaker 6>freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2402
02:10:08.171 --> 02:10:09.004
<v Speaker 6>and if that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then maybe you have a heart attack </v>

2403
02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:13.120
<v Speaker 6>because you're so terrified and you die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2404
02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:16.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that's the elevator.</v>

2405
02:10:16.630 --> 02:10:17.580
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's no bloody wonder.</v>

2406
02:10:17.590 --> 02:10:19.330
<v Speaker 6>No one's going to get into something </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that.</v>

2407
02:10:19.331 --> 02:10:23.290
<v Speaker 6>And then maybe underneath that is your </v>
<v Speaker 6>distrust in the mechanisms of society,</v>

2408
02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:24.453
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because you know a normal person that </v>

2409
02:10:27.351 --> 02:10:29.740
<v Speaker 6>was weird creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll get an elevator.</v>

2410
02:10:29.741 --> 02:10:31.060
<v Speaker 6>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't care.</v>

2411
02:10:31.090 --> 02:10:33.100
<v Speaker 6>And partly it's because they have an </v>
<v Speaker 6>implicit belief.</v>

2412
02:10:33.110 --> 02:10:36.740
<v Speaker 6>Even if the thing stops,</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody will come along and rescue them</v>

2413
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:38.690
<v Speaker 6>and usually you don't even think about </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2414
02:10:38.691 --> 02:10:39.430
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2415
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:40.251
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the hell?</v>

2416
02:10:40.251 --> 02:10:41.330
<v Speaker 6>It's an elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like</v>

2417
02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:44.910
<v Speaker 6>the danger is invisible to you</v>

2418
02:10:46.290 --> 02:10:47.123
<v Speaker 6>and it's partly because you implicitly </v>
<v Speaker 6>trust the structure and so maybe you go </v>

2419
02:10:49.711 --> 02:10:50.544
<v Speaker 6>into the unconscious presuppositions of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the person who is terrified of the </v>

2420
02:10:54.181 --> 02:10:55.014
<v Speaker 6>elevator in the subways and you find out</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have a real problem with trusting </v>

2421
02:10:57.481 --> 02:10:58.314
<v Speaker 6>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's partly why they don't get along </v>

2422
02:10:59.611 --> 02:11:00.444
<v Speaker 6>with her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why they'd never been able to stand up </v>

2423
02:11:01.981 --> 02:11:04.320
<v Speaker 6>for themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so then you say,</v>

2424
02:11:04.321 --> 02:11:06.210
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well you're afraid of the damn elevator,</v>

2425
02:11:06.211 --> 02:11:07.044
<v Speaker 6>but it's not an elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a tomb and the tomb is partly you </v>

2426
02:11:09.511 --> 02:11:10.344
<v Speaker 6>and partly it's partly the elevator and </v>
<v Speaker 6>partly your unconscious mind and so </v>

2427
02:11:14.220 --> 02:11:15.450
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what can you handle?</v>

2428
02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:18.630
<v Speaker 6>Can you go and look at an elevator from </v>
<v Speaker 6>10 feet away?</v>

2429
02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:19.673
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

2430
02:11:19.740 --> 02:11:21.660
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How about nine feet away?</v>

2431
02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:23.310
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Five feet.</v>

2432
02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:24.430
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Four feet?</v>

2433
02:11:24.450 --> 02:11:25.740
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2434
02:11:25.741 --> 02:11:27.450
<v Speaker 6>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Four and a half feet.</v>

2435
02:11:27.451 --> 02:11:28.284
<v Speaker 6>We're going to go from that elevator and</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to look at the damn thing </v>

2436
02:11:30.810 --> 02:11:33.690
<v Speaker 6>until you're bored of it because that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>what we're trying to.</v>

2437
02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:37.620
<v Speaker 6>You should be board of the elevator </v>
<v Speaker 6>because then you're not afraid of it.</v>

2438
02:11:37.621 --> 02:11:39.570
<v Speaker 6>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's an elevator.</v>

2439
02:11:39.930 --> 02:11:41.370
<v Speaker 6>You just don't notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2440
02:11:41.790 --> 02:11:44.340
<v Speaker 6>All of these things around here that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't notice.</v>

2441
02:11:44.490 --> 02:11:46.560
<v Speaker 6>I'd take you out of here to ask you what</v>
<v Speaker 6>color the walls are.</v>

2442
02:11:46.561 --> 02:11:48.840
<v Speaker 6>You haven't gotten any idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2443
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:49.903
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I suspect for most of you there's not a </v>

2444
02:11:51.301 --> 02:11:52.134
<v Speaker 6>chance you'd be able to identify the </v>
<v Speaker 6>gender of the person who's sitting next </v>

2445
02:11:55.651 --> 02:11:56.484
<v Speaker 6>to you unless you know them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you just don't remember </v>

2446
02:11:58.111 --> 02:11:58.944
<v Speaker 6>anything and why should you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything works like you don't have to </v>

2447
02:12:01.831 --> 02:12:03.150
<v Speaker 6>pay attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2448
02:12:05.130 --> 02:12:06.880
<v Speaker 6>does that stay up?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2449
02:12:06.890 --> 02:12:08.150
<v Speaker 6>it's still off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2450
02:12:08.610 --> 02:12:10.860
<v Speaker 6>Still up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Still up.</v>

2451
02:12:10.890 --> 02:12:11.880
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really?</v>

2452
02:12:12.260 --> 02:12:13.530
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2453
02:12:13.531 --> 02:12:16.530
<v Speaker 6>you get bored of that real quick and so </v>
<v Speaker 6>then you just ignore it and.</v>

2454
02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:17.713
<v Speaker 6>But the agoraphobic has had that veil of</v>
<v Speaker 6>ignorance torn away and what they see </v>

2455
02:12:22.411 --> 02:12:23.244
<v Speaker 6>behind it is mortal threat and so that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>really what you're helping them deal </v>

2456
02:12:25.831 --> 02:12:26.664
<v Speaker 6>with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so this week there are four and a </v>

2457
02:12:29.220 --> 02:12:30.053
<v Speaker 6>half feet from the elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Next week they're a foot from the </v>

2458
02:12:30.991 --> 02:12:34.980
<v Speaker 6>elevator and the week after that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the horrible gates of hell open and they</v>

2459
02:12:34.981 --> 02:12:37.620
<v Speaker 6>look inside and they don't run.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

2460
02:12:37.621 --> 02:12:38.454
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're tougher than they thought they </v>

2461
02:12:39.931 --> 02:12:41.610
<v Speaker 6>were.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what you're teaching them.</v>

2462
02:12:41.611 --> 02:12:42.444
<v Speaker 6>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not teaching them that the world </v>

2463
02:12:43.261 --> 02:12:47.190
<v Speaker 6>isn't dangerous because that's a stupid </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing to teach someone bloody right.</v>

2464
02:12:47.191 --> 02:12:48.024
<v Speaker 6>The world is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's terrifying and sometimes people </v>

2465
02:12:50.701 --> 02:12:55.480
<v Speaker 6>under a realize that and the veil lifts </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they see horror everywhere.</v>

2466
02:12:55.590 --> 02:12:57.600
<v Speaker 6>They see that and then they think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2467
02:12:57.601 --> 02:12:59.700
<v Speaker 6>I'm just a little rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm over here in the corner.</v>

2468
02:12:59.970 --> 02:13:01.950
<v Speaker 6>I can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm petrified.</v>

2469
02:13:02.340 --> 02:13:05.550
<v Speaker 6>And then they can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They hide it home.</v>

2470
02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:06.473
<v Speaker 6>They cower at home because everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>has become a predatory domain and so </v>

2471
02:13:10.111 --> 02:13:14.670
<v Speaker 6>what you teach them is you're not as </v>
<v Speaker 6>much of a rabbit as you think,</v>

2472
02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:19.290
<v Speaker 6>and part of that is that you help them </v>
<v Speaker 6>grow some teeth so that they can go home</v>

2473
02:13:19.291 --> 02:13:20.124
<v Speaker 6>and have that fight with their husband </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they should have had 25 years ago </v>

2474
02:13:22.650 --> 02:13:27.090
<v Speaker 6>and it happens very frequently with </v>
<v Speaker 6>agoraphobic clients that you get them so</v>

2475
02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:28.193
<v Speaker 6>they can go on the damn elevator and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they can go on the subway and they can </v>

2476
02:13:30.301 --> 02:13:32.910
<v Speaker 6>take a taxi.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they learned to drive,</v>

2477
02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:35.950
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That get some upon me and then there are</v>

2478
02:13:35.951 --> 02:13:36.784
<v Speaker 6>a little tougher and so then they can </v>
<v Speaker 6>stand up from the for themselves and </v>

2479
02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:42.900
<v Speaker 6>they go back and like their husband </v>
<v Speaker 6>might not be very happy with any of this</v>

2480
02:13:43.530 --> 02:13:43.980
<v Speaker 6>really.</v>

2481
02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:45.900
<v Speaker 6>It depends on what sort of guy he is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2482
02:13:45.901 --> 02:13:46.734
<v Speaker 6>if he's a real tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he might be just perfectly happy that </v>

2483
02:13:49.171 --> 02:13:53.040
<v Speaker 6>he's married to someone who was afraid </v>
<v Speaker 6>of her own shadow because then she won't</v>

2484
02:13:53.070 --> 02:13:57.240
<v Speaker 6>ever leave and so that's a nasty little </v>
<v Speaker 6>story and believe me,</v>

2485
02:13:57.241 --> 02:13:58.074
<v Speaker 6>it's not uncommon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So she gets tougher by facing what she </v>

2486
02:14:01.111 --> 02:14:01.944
<v Speaker 6>fears and what she finds out is there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>a hell of a lot more to her than she </v>

2487
02:14:04.441 --> 02:14:05.274
<v Speaker 6>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's really what happens when you </v>

2488
02:14:06.841 --> 02:14:08.970
<v Speaker 6>do behavior therapy with someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 6>agoraphobic.</v>

2489
02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:11.130
<v Speaker 6>It isn't really that they get less </v>
<v Speaker 6>afraid.</v>

2490
02:14:11.131 --> 02:14:14.100
<v Speaker 6>It's that they get braver.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's way different.</v>

2491
02:14:14.630 --> 02:14:18.840
<v Speaker 6>It's because brave is alert and able to </v>
<v Speaker 6>cope.</v>

2492
02:14:19.650 --> 02:14:22.770
<v Speaker 6>Naive is there's no danger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like hell yeah,</v>

2493
02:14:22.771 --> 02:14:23.970
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no danger.</v>

2494
02:14:23.971 --> 02:14:26.010
<v Speaker 6>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What a stupid theory that is.</v>

2495
02:14:26.490 --> 02:14:28.440
<v Speaker 6>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what all this is.</v>

2496
02:14:28.441 --> 02:14:30.060
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the story man.</v>

2497
02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:31.950
<v Speaker 6>And it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a major story.</v>

2498
02:14:31.951 --> 02:14:35.250
<v Speaker 6>It's the story of human transformation </v>
<v Speaker 6>and growth.</v>

2499
02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:36.113
<v Speaker 6>It's the evolved evolution of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's a major story and we've </v>

2500
02:14:40.831 --> 02:14:45.831
<v Speaker 6>been working on the damn thing for like</v>
<v Speaker 6>God only knows how long,</v>

2501
02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:48.810
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Snakes and primates,</v>

2502
02:14:48.940 --> 02:14:51.930
<v Speaker 6>coevolved and our vision are sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sharp,</v>

2503
02:14:51.931 --> 02:14:52.764
<v Speaker 6>sharp vision seems to have been an </v>
<v Speaker 6>evolutionary adaptation forced on us by </v>

2504
02:14:57.781 --> 02:14:58.614
<v Speaker 6>the presence of predatory snakes and </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're talking tens of millions of years </v>

2505
02:15:02.701 --> 02:15:05.700
<v Speaker 6>ago and human beings have unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 6>sharp eyesight.</v>

2506
02:15:06.030 --> 02:15:10.290
<v Speaker 6>The only thing that can see us as birds </v>
<v Speaker 6>of prey and they have like an eagle,</v>

2507
02:15:10.291 --> 02:15:15.000
<v Speaker 6>a bald eagle has eyes as big as ours,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it has to phobias that phobia is the</v>

2508
02:15:15.001 --> 02:15:18.420
<v Speaker 6>central part of the vision.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So an eagle is all eyes man,</v>

2509
02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:20.250
<v Speaker 6>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but human beings,</v>

2510
02:15:20.251 --> 02:15:21.084
<v Speaker 6>we're kind of like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And like half our brain is devoted to </v>

2511
02:15:22.981 --> 02:15:23.940
<v Speaker 6>visual processing.</v>

2512
02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:25.133
<v Speaker 6>We have acute vision in Madagascar where</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are primates with no predatory </v>

2513
02:15:29.011 --> 02:15:30.270
<v Speaker 6>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're lemurs.</v>

2514
02:15:30.271 --> 02:15:33.660
<v Speaker 6>They can't see worth a damn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm an anthropologist named Lynn.</v>

2515
02:15:33.661 --> 02:15:34.494
<v Speaker 6>Isabelle did a comprehensive study </v>
<v Speaker 6>worldwide trying to account for the </v>

2516
02:15:37.261 --> 02:15:38.094
<v Speaker 6>acuity of primate vision.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what she found was that the more </v>

2517
02:15:40.741 --> 02:15:41.574
<v Speaker 6>predatory snakes in the vicinity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the sharper the eyesight of the </v>

2518
02:15:43.711 --> 02:15:47.580
<v Speaker 6>primates,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so we have a really sharp eyesight,</v>

2519
02:15:47.790 --> 02:15:51.240
<v Speaker 6>so that means a lot of us were eaten by </v>
<v Speaker 6>snakes and none of your ancestors,</v>

2520
02:15:51.241 --> 02:15:53.340
<v Speaker 6>fortunately because otherwise you </v>
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't be here,</v>

2521
02:15:53.341 --> 02:15:58.341
<v Speaker 6>but a lot of those who fell by the </v>
<v Speaker 6>wayside were snake snack and you know,</v>

2522
02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:03.510
<v Speaker 6>when you're little and living in a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a snake is no damn joke.</v>

2523
02:16:03.511 --> 02:16:04.344
<v Speaker 6>And even now with lots of people get </v>
<v Speaker 6>bitten by snakes and people are phobic </v>

2524
02:16:06.841 --> 02:16:11.130
<v Speaker 6>of snakes at quite a rate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And some of that actually seems innate.</v>

2525
02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:14.250
<v Speaker 6>There's arguments about cycling between </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychologists about this,</v>

2526
02:16:14.251 --> 02:16:16.920
<v Speaker 6>but even the ones who don't accept the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fact that it's innate,</v>

2527
02:16:17.250 --> 02:16:18.083
<v Speaker 6>except the fact that you can make </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone afraid of a snake by </v>

2528
02:16:20.971 --> 02:16:21.804
<v Speaker 6>conditioning just like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're trying to make them afraid of a </v>

2529
02:16:24.121 --> 02:16:26.700
<v Speaker 6>flower by conditioning is really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really hard.</v>

2530
02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:32.170
<v Speaker 6>So we're at least at minimum prepared to</v>
<v Speaker 6>be afraid of snakes minimum.</v>

2531
02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:34.240
<v Speaker 6>And I believe it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

2532
02:16:34.241 --> 02:16:37.120
<v Speaker 6>I believe that fear is actually innate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>although you can learn to control it.</v>

2533
02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:38.433
<v Speaker 6>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that's that story and like what a </v>

2534
02:16:40.991 --> 02:16:43.120
<v Speaker 6>story man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so amazing,</v>

2535
02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:44.463
<v Speaker 6>amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see the Dan of the dragon here is </v>

2536
02:16:46.841 --> 02:16:49.210
<v Speaker 6>littered with skulls and bones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what that is.</v>

2537
02:16:49.211 --> 02:16:50.530
<v Speaker 6>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the thing is no joke,</v>

2538
02:16:50.590 --> 02:16:53.410
<v Speaker 6>it's like look the hell out and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

2539
02:16:53.411 --> 02:16:54.244
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and look it up on the top right hand </v>

2540
02:16:55.991 --> 02:16:57.550
<v Speaker 6>corner there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2541
02:16:57.670 --> 02:16:59.020
<v Speaker 6>that's from Peter Pan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2542
02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:00.610
<v Speaker 6>All you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Captain Hook,</v>

2543
02:17:00.611 --> 02:17:01.444
<v Speaker 6>we talked about him already.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a tyrant and he's a tyrant because </v>

2544
02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:07.330
<v Speaker 6>he's afraid of death and that's all he </v>
<v Speaker 6>sees in life.</v>

2545
02:17:07.331 --> 02:17:11.000
<v Speaker 6>And so it makes them cruel and bitter </v>
<v Speaker 6>and death has already taken part of it,</v>

2546
02:17:11.001 --> 02:17:11.834
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why he has a hook and that damn </v>

2547
02:17:12.851 --> 02:17:14.260
<v Speaker 6>crocodile's chasing him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tick,</v>

2548
02:17:14.290 --> 02:17:14.860
<v Speaker 6>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tick,</v>

2549
02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:18.670
<v Speaker 6>tick all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And of course that's the same situation.</v>

2550
02:17:18.671 --> 02:17:19.540
<v Speaker 6>You're all in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2551
02:17:19.541 --> 02:17:20.374
<v Speaker 6>There's a crocodile with a clock in its </v>
<v Speaker 6>stomach chasing you and it could easily </v>

2552
02:17:23.621 --> 02:17:24.454
<v Speaker 6>turn you into a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It can turn you into a tyrant or a </v>

2553
02:17:26.951 --> 02:17:30.280
<v Speaker 6>cowering victim or a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are the options fundamentally.</v>

2554
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:34.240
<v Speaker 6>So that's the Gorgon looking at her own,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Medusa,</v>

2555
02:17:34.241 --> 02:17:35.800
<v Speaker 6>looking at her own reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2556
02:17:35.801 --> 02:17:37.870
<v Speaker 6>mother nature with a head full of </v>
<v Speaker 6>snakes,</v>

2557
02:17:37.871 --> 02:17:38.704
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a terrifying vision and that's actually </v>

2558
02:17:40.271 --> 02:17:44.420
<v Speaker 6>to some degree in archetype that men get</v>
<v Speaker 6>confused with women and you know,</v>

2559
02:17:44.430 --> 02:17:47.830
<v Speaker 6>that's the witchy part of women and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the part that's attractive,</v>

2560
02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:48.880
<v Speaker 6>attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>attractive,</v>

2561
02:17:48.881 --> 02:17:50.680
<v Speaker 6>but rejecting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>rejecting,</v>

2562
02:17:50.681 --> 02:17:51.340
<v Speaker 6>rejecting.</v>

2563
02:17:51.340 --> 02:17:55.630
<v Speaker 6>It's so many men are petrified by women.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They won't approach them at all.</v>

2564
02:17:55.780 --> 02:17:56.613
<v Speaker 6>They have no idea how to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're just petrified into immobility </v>

2565
02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:01.870
<v Speaker 6>and that's way more common than you </v>
<v Speaker 6>think.</v>

2566
02:18:02.050 --> 02:18:04.750
<v Speaker 6>And so that breeds resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you wouldn't believe,</v>

2567
02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:07.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll hear the guy who shot up like,</v>

2568
02:18:07.650 --> 02:18:09.310
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dawson College.</v>

2569
02:18:09.311 --> 02:18:10.144
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the hell do you think motivated </v>

2570
02:18:10.901 --> 02:18:12.680
<v Speaker 6>him?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like he,</v>

2571
02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:16.310
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what he saw and it was because as</v>

2572
02:18:16.311 --> 02:18:19.270
<v Speaker 6>well he was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my opinion is he was too goddamn useless</v>

2573
02:18:19.271 --> 02:18:20.104
<v Speaker 6>to be attractive to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so that's a hell of a place to be </v>

2574
02:18:22.781 --> 02:18:23.980
<v Speaker 6>in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2575
02:18:24.310 --> 02:18:25.600
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the problem too.</v>

2576
02:18:25.601 --> 02:18:27.460
<v Speaker 6>If you're chronically rejected by </v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

2577
02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:29.890
<v Speaker 6>it's often because of your own </v>
<v Speaker 6>insufficiencies,</v>

2578
02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:31.203
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether that's cowardice or lack of </v>

2579
02:18:32.411 --> 02:18:33.244
<v Speaker 6>social skills or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you can't just brush it off </v>

2580
02:18:36.071 --> 02:18:36.371
<v Speaker 6>as,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2581
02:18:36.371 --> 02:18:37.001
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2582
02:18:37.001 --> 02:18:38.920
<v Speaker 6>no one likes me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but really I'm okay.</v>

2583
02:18:39.070 --> 02:18:39.903
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2584
02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:41.650
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wrong.</v>

2585
02:18:41.710 --> 02:18:42.543
<v Speaker 6>If everyone rejects you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's probably something wrong and </v>

2586
02:18:45.281 --> 02:18:48.640
<v Speaker 6>it's probably deep and difficult and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's gonna be horrible to fix.</v>

2587
02:18:48.970 --> 02:18:51.610
<v Speaker 6>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this isn't a trivial problem.</v>

2588
02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:55.030
<v Speaker 6>It's not a trivial problem at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

2589
02:18:55.031 --> 02:18:56.800
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's mother nature for men too,</v>

2590
02:18:56.801 --> 02:18:59.530
<v Speaker 6>because from the sexual selection point </v>
<v Speaker 6>of view,</v>

2591
02:18:59.950 --> 02:19:02.770
<v Speaker 6>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they're not selected as a mate,</v>

2592
02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:07.750
<v Speaker 6>nature has taken them out of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2593
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.771
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2594
02:19:08.771 --> 02:19:11.350
<v Speaker 6>people don't really like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not that happy without.</v>

2595
02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:14.950
<v Speaker 6>And so by getting all whiny about it and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then getting violent is like,</v>

2596
02:19:15.340 --> 02:19:18.100
<v Speaker 6>that's just not all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not really very helpful.</v>

2597
02:19:18.101 --> 02:19:22.090
<v Speaker 6>Although it's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this is Lynn,</v>

2598
02:19:22.091 --> 02:19:24.790
<v Speaker 6>Isabelle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and evolutionary arms race between early</v>

2599
02:19:24.791 --> 02:19:25.624
<v Speaker 6>snakes and mammals triggered the </v>
<v Speaker 6>development of improved and large brain </v>

2600
02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:29.473
<v Speaker 6>in primates.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A radical new theory suggests these are </v>

2601
02:19:31.431 --> 02:19:32.720
<v Speaker 6>old representations.</v>

2602
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:34.550
<v Speaker 6>I really liked this one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is.</v>

2603
02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:37.220
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's Greek,</v>

2604
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:40.220
<v Speaker 6>but it doesn't exactly look Greek.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might be older.</v>

2605
02:19:40.580 --> 02:19:41.690
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anyways.</v>

2606
02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:45.230
<v Speaker 6>You see it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Same ideas as as Graham's dream,</v>

2607
02:19:45.231 --> 02:19:46.064
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's this thing that </v>

2608
02:19:47.001 --> 02:19:47.661
<v Speaker 6>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

2609
02:19:47.661 --> 02:19:51.080
<v Speaker 6>this multi-headed snake,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's got this infinity problem.</v>

2610
02:19:51.081 --> 02:19:53.120
<v Speaker 6>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's that little circle down there,</v>

2611
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:55.280
<v Speaker 6>and the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2612
02:19:55.310 --> 02:19:56.720
<v Speaker 6>what do you do with it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You cut off one head,</v>

2613
02:19:56.721 --> 02:19:57.740
<v Speaker 6>seven more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Grow.</v>

2614
02:19:58.250 --> 02:20:02.960
<v Speaker 6>That's the eternal problem of life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the problem is they're there.</v>

2615
02:20:03.170 --> 02:20:07.670
<v Speaker 6>There is the category of problems in </v>
<v Speaker 6>life and it ain't going anywhere.</v>

2616
02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:08.563
<v Speaker 6>And so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can you deal with the whole category at </v>

2617
02:20:11.301 --> 02:20:13.940
<v Speaker 6>the same time?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing.</v>

2618
02:20:13.941 --> 02:20:17.720
<v Speaker 6>That's how to be in the world is to deal</v>
<v Speaker 6>with that category all at the same time.</v>

2619
02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:19.700
<v Speaker 6>And so how did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how did human beings,</v>

2620
02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:21.920
<v Speaker 6>what did they come up with as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>solution?</v>

2621
02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:22.753
<v Speaker 6>And that's so cool too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because the solution they come up with </v>

2622
02:20:25.130 --> 02:20:29.180
<v Speaker 6>not only was the heroism that allows you</v>
<v Speaker 6>to approach what you're terrified by and</v>

2623
02:20:29.181 --> 02:20:31.550
<v Speaker 6>what you find offensive and to learn </v>
<v Speaker 6>from it,</v>

2624
02:20:32.210 --> 02:20:36.200
<v Speaker 6>but also the idea of sacrifice and that </v>
<v Speaker 6>was played out by cultures everywhere,</v>

2625
02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:38.360
<v Speaker 6>including human sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you think,</v>

2626
02:20:38.361 --> 02:20:41.300
<v Speaker 6>what the hell was up with those crazy </v>
<v Speaker 6>bastard so long ago?</v>

2627
02:20:41.301 --> 02:20:43.520
<v Speaker 6>They were sacrificing to God's all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

2628
02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:44.593
<v Speaker 6>What kind of clueless behavior was that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Burned something and please God burned </v>

2629
02:20:48.771 --> 02:20:51.470
<v Speaker 6>something valuable and please God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2630
02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:54.140
<v Speaker 6>what was with that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What were they thinking?</v>

2631
02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:56.180
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they weren't stupid.</v>

2632
02:20:56.181 --> 02:20:57.890
<v Speaker 6>Those people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they were stupid,</v>

2633
02:20:57.891 --> 02:20:59.840
<v Speaker 6>we wouldn't be here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were not stupid.</v>

2634
02:20:59.841 --> 02:21:00.674
<v Speaker 6>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they lived under a lot harsher </v>

2635
02:21:02.151 --> 02:21:05.480
<v Speaker 6>conditions than we do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So those were some tough people,</v>

2636
02:21:05.481 --> 02:21:06.530
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2637
02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:08.990
<v Speaker 6>back then you'd last about 15 minutes.</v>

2638
02:21:09.050 --> 02:21:13.070
<v Speaker 6>So you don't want to be thinking of your</v>
<v Speaker 6>ancestors as stupid,</v>

2639
02:21:13.150 --> 02:21:13.983
<v Speaker 6>like there's no real evidence that we're</v>
<v Speaker 6>much different cognitively than we were </v>

2640
02:21:16.461 --> 02:21:19.760
<v Speaker 6>150,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So anyways,</v>

2641
02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:22.220
<v Speaker 6>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does that mean?</v>

2642
02:21:22.221 --> 02:21:23.240
<v Speaker 6>Sacrifice?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2643
02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:26.660
<v Speaker 6>it's a discovery man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the discovery of the future.</v>

2644
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:27.823
<v Speaker 6>It's like the future is actually the </v>
<v Speaker 6>place where there is threat and it's </v>

2645
02:21:31.551 --> 02:21:33.200
<v Speaker 6>always gonna be there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what do you do?</v>

2646
02:21:33.650 --> 02:21:37.370
<v Speaker 6>You make sacrifices in the present so </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the future is better,</v>

2647
02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:40.280
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everyone does that.</v>

2648
02:21:40.281 --> 02:21:42.920
<v Speaker 6>That's what you're doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what you're doing here.</v>

2649
02:21:42.921 --> 02:21:43.754
<v Speaker 6>That's what your parents are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When they pay money to send you to </v>

2650
02:21:45.351 --> 02:21:46.184
<v Speaker 6>university,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they think let you can bargain with </v>

2651
02:21:48.531 --> 02:21:50.930
<v Speaker 6>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>

2652
02:21:50.931 --> 02:21:51.764
<v Speaker 6>You can bargain with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can forestall gratification now and </v>

2653
02:21:56.541 --> 02:21:57.374
<v Speaker 6>it'll pay off it at it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at a place in time that doesn't even </v>

2654
02:21:59.811 --> 02:22:01.970
<v Speaker 6>exist yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2655
02:22:02.210 --> 02:22:03.620
<v Speaker 6>who wouldn't believe that?</v>

2656
02:22:03.650 --> 02:22:04.483
<v Speaker 6>It's like that's a miracle that that </v>
<v Speaker 6>occurs and it's not like people just </v>

2657
02:22:07.131 --> 02:22:09.280
<v Speaker 6>figured that overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2658
02:22:09.350 --> 02:22:12.380
<v Speaker 6>we were champs for Christ's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like how are we going to come up with an</v>

2659
02:22:12.381 --> 02:22:14.450
<v Speaker 6>idea like that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>While it's like,</v>

2660
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:17.960
<v Speaker 6>well we thought about it for 7 million </v>
<v Speaker 6>years and you know,</v>

2661
02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:20.360
<v Speaker 6>we got to the point where we could kind </v>
<v Speaker 6>of act it out,</v>

2662
02:22:20.930 --> 02:22:24.220
<v Speaker 6>but we didn't know what we were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it was a emerge.</v>

2663
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:25.063
<v Speaker 6>It's like a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was so the terror of the future is a </v>

2664
02:22:27.811 --> 02:22:32.520
<v Speaker 6>dream and the solution to the terror,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the dream of the terror of the future is</v>

2665
02:22:32.521 --> 02:22:34.370
<v Speaker 6>another dream and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it,</v>

2666
02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:35.353
<v Speaker 6>it comes out in mythology and in fantasy</v>
<v Speaker 6>and in drama where you act out the </v>

2667
02:22:39.211 --> 02:22:43.080
<v Speaker 6>sacrifice and then it's a step on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>way to full understanding.</v>

2668
02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:46.170
<v Speaker 6>So we can say sacrifice now instead of </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing it,</v>

2669
02:22:46.470 --> 02:22:47.790
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>although we still do it,</v>

2670
02:22:47.970 --> 02:22:50.160
<v Speaker 6>it's just not concretized like it used </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be.</v>

2671
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:55.020
<v Speaker 6>We do it abstractly and we all have </v>
<v Speaker 6>faith that it will work,</v>

2672
02:22:55.550 --> 02:22:56.383
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we also set up our society so that </v>

2673
02:22:57.781 --> 02:22:59.520
<v Speaker 6>it'll work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And one thing about,</v>

2674
02:22:59.910 --> 02:23:00.743
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a fan of moral relativism for a </v>

2675
02:23:03.931 --> 02:23:06.320
<v Speaker 6>variety of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>partly because I think it's an,</v>

2676
02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:09.510
<v Speaker 6>it's an extreme form of cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But anyways,</v>

2677
02:23:09.511 --> 02:23:11.490
<v Speaker 6>apart from that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2678
02:23:11.491 --> 02:23:12.150
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2679
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:14.070
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's minimal ways that you can set up</v>

2680
02:23:14.071 --> 02:23:14.904
<v Speaker 6>a society that will work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so one of them is that this society </v>

2681
02:23:18.481 --> 02:23:19.314
<v Speaker 6>has to be set up so that your sacrifices</v>
<v Speaker 6>will pay off or you won't work and then </v>

2682
02:23:23.461 --> 02:23:26.910
<v Speaker 6>the society will die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it has to make promises.</v>

2683
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:28.740
<v Speaker 6>People have to make promises to one </v>
<v Speaker 6>another,</v>

2684
02:23:28.860 --> 02:23:29.693
<v Speaker 6>and that's what money is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Money is a promise that your sacrifice </v>

2685
02:23:32.821 --> 02:23:35.640
<v Speaker 6>will pay off in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what money is.</v>

2686
02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:40.950
<v Speaker 6>And so if the society is stable,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can store up your work right now.</v>

2687
02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:46.340
<v Speaker 6>You can sacrifice your impulses and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>can work and you can store up credit for</v>

2688
02:23:47.371 --> 02:23:50.160
<v Speaker 6>the future and then you can make the </v>
<v Speaker 6>future a better place.</v>

2689
02:23:50.161 --> 02:23:53.310
<v Speaker 6>But society has to be stable enough to </v>
<v Speaker 6>allow for that.</v>

2690
02:23:53.850 --> 02:23:54.683
<v Speaker 6>Hyperinflation will do you in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the promise that's implicit in the </v>

2691
02:23:57.991 --> 02:24:02.040
<v Speaker 6>currency is the promise that what you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing now will pay off in the future.</v>

2692
02:24:02.310 --> 02:24:03.143
<v Speaker 6>And if people don't have that promise,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then well we know what they do because </v>

2693
02:24:06.511 --> 02:24:08.220
<v Speaker 6>in in gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

2694
02:24:08.221 --> 02:24:09.054
<v Speaker 6>and say gangs in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the time horizon of the gang members </v>

2695
02:24:11.941 --> 02:24:14.460
<v Speaker 6>shrinks rapidly because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>really expect to be alive,</v>

2696
02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:15.333
<v Speaker 6>pat much past 21.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so they get really impulsive and </v>

2697
02:24:17.611 --> 02:24:19.640
<v Speaker 6>violent and like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why the hell not that's,</v>

2698
02:24:19.810 --> 02:24:23.490
<v Speaker 6>that's what you do when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when the future doesn't matter,</v>

2699
02:24:23.550 --> 02:24:27.450
<v Speaker 6>when it's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you default back to living in the moment</v>

2700
02:24:27.451 --> 02:24:28.284
<v Speaker 6>and you take what you can get right now </v>
<v Speaker 6>and no wonder because you don't know if </v>

2701
02:24:31.081 --> 02:24:35.250
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be around in a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a year and you get whatever you can.</v>

2702
02:24:35.251 --> 02:24:38.970
<v Speaker 6>Well you can bloody well get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's like anarchy that state.</v>

2703
02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:40.133
<v Speaker 6>And so you don't want to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people like to live in that state </v>

2704
02:24:41.881 --> 02:24:43.650
<v Speaker 6>because they're already wired for that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2705
02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:44.873
<v Speaker 6>And so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're much more comfortable in those </v>

2706
02:24:47.371 --> 02:24:48.260
<v Speaker 6>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're,</v>

2707
02:24:48.830 --> 02:24:51.600
<v Speaker 6>they're kind of like warrior types,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say in some sets.</v>

2708
02:24:51.601 --> 02:24:52.434
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for most people that's just where that </v>

2709
02:24:56.100 --> 02:24:57.500
<v Speaker 6>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll just do 10,</v>

2710
02:24:57.560 --> 02:24:59.160
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the stress of a life like that.</v>

2711
02:24:59.610 --> 02:25:00.443
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

2712
02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:05.640
<v Speaker 6>that's a pretty horrible picture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The one on the right I think,</v>

2713
02:25:05.641 --> 02:25:06.474
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's creepy picture and don't you think </v>

2714
02:25:09.430 --> 02:25:11.220
<v Speaker 6>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it seems like a creepy picture to me.</v>

2715
02:25:11.610 --> 02:25:13.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so that's quit silicone oil,</v>

2716
02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:15.240
<v Speaker 6>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was an,</v>

2717
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:17.970
<v Speaker 6>he was an Aztec Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

2718
02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:20.480
<v Speaker 6>and that's the eye of horus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>By what?</v>

2719
02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:21.820
<v Speaker 6>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this little thing here,</v>

2720
02:25:21.821 --> 02:25:24.340
<v Speaker 6>and I'm that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See the Egyptians?</v>

2721
02:25:24.341 --> 02:25:27.130
<v Speaker 6>They worshiped the I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2722
02:25:27.131 --> 02:25:28.360
<v Speaker 6>Well that's cool because it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2723
02:25:28.390 --> 02:25:29.890
<v Speaker 6>why did they worship the eye?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2724
02:25:29.950 --> 02:25:33.370
<v Speaker 6>wake the hell up and look at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's your salvation to do that.</v>

2725
02:25:33.430 --> 02:25:34.263
<v Speaker 6>Pay Bloody attention,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially to the things you don't want </v>

2726
02:25:36.251 --> 02:25:37.084
<v Speaker 6>to pay attention to and use your vision.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have some vision and you can use your </v>

2727
02:25:41.441 --> 02:25:44.320
<v Speaker 6>vision to see into the future and that </v>
<v Speaker 6>is your.</v>

2728
02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:46.930
<v Speaker 6>That's your redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the Egyptians,</v>

2729
02:25:47.230 --> 02:25:48.063
<v Speaker 6>they didn't know how to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they knew how to represent it and </v>

2730
02:25:51.581 --> 02:25:52.810
<v Speaker 6>that's how they represented it.</v>

2731
02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:55.240
<v Speaker 6>Like the pupil on that as completely </v>
<v Speaker 6>open,</v>

2732
02:25:55.300 --> 02:25:57.280
<v Speaker 6>completely dilated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's a god.</v>

2733
02:25:57.281 --> 02:25:59.680
<v Speaker 6>As far as the Egyptians were concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's horace.</v>

2734
02:25:59.681 --> 02:26:01.570
<v Speaker 6>And I'll tell you a horror story at some</v>
<v Speaker 6>point.</v>

2735
02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:04.930
<v Speaker 6>So early primates develop a better eye </v>
<v Speaker 6>for color,</v>

2736
02:26:04.931 --> 02:26:07.810
<v Speaker 6>detail and movement and the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 6>see in three dimensions,</v>

2737
02:26:08.050 --> 02:26:10.660
<v Speaker 6>traits that are important for detecting </v>
<v Speaker 6>threats at close range.</v>

2738
02:26:10.661 --> 02:26:13.390
<v Speaker 6>Humans are descended from these same </v>
<v Speaker 6>primates.</v>

2739
02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:18.620
<v Speaker 6>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so now the initiation way,</v>

2740
02:26:18.730 --> 02:26:22.300
<v Speaker 6>when you go into psychotherapy or when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you make any supreme moral effort,</v>

2741
02:26:22.510 --> 02:26:23.343
<v Speaker 6>which is roughly the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to confront that which you do </v>

2742
02:26:26.951 --> 02:26:27.784
<v Speaker 6>not know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now I mentioned the cat called Primo </v>

2743
02:26:30.191 --> 02:26:33.250
<v Speaker 6>cosmo going to chaos and the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 6>at the end of [inaudible] life,</v>

2744
02:26:33.251 --> 02:26:36.640
<v Speaker 6>he sort of thought of the unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the world as the same and you think,</v>

2745
02:26:36.641 --> 02:26:38.860
<v Speaker 6>what the hell does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But here's what it means.</v>

2746
02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:40.353
<v Speaker 6>So let's say you're in a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 6>intimate relationship and you get </v>

2747
02:26:42.311 --> 02:26:44.260
<v Speaker 6>betrayed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>

2748
02:26:44.261 --> 02:26:49.261
<v Speaker 6>So what is it that you see when you see </v>
<v Speaker 6>your partner at the moment,</v>

2749
02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:52.120
<v Speaker 6>you know of the betrayal?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2750
02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:55.630
<v Speaker 6>you see the pre cosmogony chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 6>here's why.</v>

2751
02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:00.910
<v Speaker 6>Well it rattles your unconscious up </v>
<v Speaker 6>because you don't know anything anymore.</v>

2752
02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:03.610
<v Speaker 6>You don't know what the past was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2753
02:27:03.611 --> 02:27:04.444
<v Speaker 6>You don't know what it was and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to be real and all of a sudden </v>

2754
02:27:06.851 --> 02:27:10.090
<v Speaker 6>you don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so you come up with wild ideas about</v>

2755
02:27:10.091 --> 02:27:12.670
<v Speaker 6>what it might have been and what it </v>
<v Speaker 6>represented,</v>

2756
02:27:12.671 --> 02:27:14.890
<v Speaker 6>and then you don't know what the future </v>
<v Speaker 6>is going to be anymore.</v>

2757
02:27:15.130 --> 02:27:15.963
<v Speaker 6>So then your fantasy fills that space </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you don't know who the hell you're </v>

2758
02:27:18.521 --> 02:27:20.350
<v Speaker 6>looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's for sure.</v>

2759
02:27:20.351 --> 02:27:21.184
<v Speaker 6>And you don't know much about human </v>
<v Speaker 6>beings and you certainly don't know </v>

2760
02:27:23.231 --> 02:27:24.400
<v Speaker 6>anything about yourself.</v>

2761
02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:25.833
<v Speaker 6>And so all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not only is everything in chaos inside </v>

2762
02:27:28.931 --> 02:27:29.764
<v Speaker 6>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but everything is in chaos in your </v>

2763
02:27:31.301 --> 02:27:33.430
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it actually is.</v>

2764
02:27:33.431 --> 02:27:35.800
<v Speaker 6>And there's no telling the difference </v>
<v Speaker 6>between those two things.</v>

2765
02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:39.250
<v Speaker 6>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so then you're just sheer shattered.</v>

2766
02:27:39.430 --> 02:27:42.670
<v Speaker 6>And so then you go talk to a therapist </v>
<v Speaker 6>for like two years and you think,</v>

2767
02:27:42.990 --> 02:27:45.940
<v Speaker 6>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was the reality?</v>

2768
02:27:46.210 --> 02:27:49.860
<v Speaker 6>And the reality is because who knows </v>
<v Speaker 6>what the reality was like.</v>

2769
02:27:49.990 --> 02:27:50.823
<v Speaker 6>But as far as you're concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the reality is I better represent this </v>

2770
02:27:53.291 --> 02:27:57.010
<v Speaker 6>properly in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I better figure out who I was,</v>

2771
02:27:57.011 --> 02:27:59.740
<v Speaker 6>who that person was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what we did together,</v>

2772
02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:00.813
<v Speaker 6>and what it meant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I do not want this to happen </v>

2773
02:28:03.580 --> 02:28:07.780
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so you're healed when you get to the</v>

2774
02:28:07.781 --> 02:28:11.590
<v Speaker 6>point where you've grasped the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 6>moral of the story,</v>

2775
02:28:11.770 --> 02:28:16.090
<v Speaker 6>what went wrong and how can I not have </v>
<v Speaker 6>that happen again?</v>

2776
02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:17.950
<v Speaker 6>Because that's the purpose of learning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2777
02:28:18.220 --> 02:28:19.053
<v Speaker 6>That's the purpose of memory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's to prepare you for the future and </v>

2778
02:28:22.461 --> 02:28:26.270
<v Speaker 6>so you have to pull out of that massive </v>
<v Speaker 6>chaos,</v>

2779
02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:30.920
<v Speaker 6>a functional representation that </v>
<v Speaker 6>increases your wisdom so that you're not</v>

2780
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:32.023
<v Speaker 6>this naive target.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The next time you enter into a </v>

2781
02:28:33.711 --> 02:28:34.544
<v Speaker 6>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so at least you can have another </v>

2782
02:28:36.051 --> 02:28:40.080
<v Speaker 6>relationship without being so </v>
<v Speaker 6>traumatized that you know you,</v>

2783
02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:40.993
<v Speaker 6>you're done and you know it can take </v>
<v Speaker 6>people years to talk that through </v>

2784
02:28:43.791 --> 02:28:48.620
<v Speaker 6>because this landscape of potential </v>
<v Speaker 6>opens up when when they're betrayed,</v>

2785
02:28:48.621 --> 02:28:51.200
<v Speaker 6>it's like anything could have been the </v>
<v Speaker 6>truth.</v>

2786
02:28:51.740 --> 02:28:56.740
<v Speaker 6>Well you to sort through that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to wander through all that mess</v>

2787
02:28:57.200 --> 02:28:59.930
<v Speaker 6>and it's really painful and emotional as</v>
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>

2788
02:29:00.110 --> 02:29:04.190
<v Speaker 6>You have to sort through all that mess </v>
<v Speaker 6>to come out with the new you,</v>

2789
02:29:04.310 --> 02:29:06.740
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The renewed you and so</v>

2790
02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:11.680
<v Speaker 6>well this is a representation of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is how people act this out.</v>

2791
02:29:12.670 --> 02:29:15.480
<v Speaker 6>By whatever method he may have been </v>
<v Speaker 6>designated.</v>

2792
02:29:15.490 --> 02:29:16.323
<v Speaker 6>The Shaman is recognized as such as only</v>
<v Speaker 6>after having received two methods of </v>

2793
02:29:20.111 --> 02:29:23.080
<v Speaker 6>instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The first is ecstatic dreams.</v>

2794
02:29:23.081 --> 02:29:23.914
<v Speaker 6>Trances envisions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The second is traditional shamonic </v>

2795
02:29:26.261 --> 02:29:28.330
<v Speaker 6>techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 6>names and functions of the spirit,</v>

2796
02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:31.780
<v Speaker 6>mythology and genealogy of the clan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the secret language.</v>

2797
02:29:31.930 --> 02:29:33.250
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that happens,</v>

2798
02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:36.930
<v Speaker 6>this happens to you even if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you encounter something terrible like</v>

2799
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:37.783
<v Speaker 6>could be trail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happens is that you have to take a </v>

2800
02:29:39.881 --> 02:29:43.150
<v Speaker 6>journey into the domain of morality </v>
<v Speaker 6>essentially,</v>

2801
02:29:43.151 --> 02:29:43.871
<v Speaker 6>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2802
02:29:43.871 --> 02:29:44.704
<v Speaker 6>how did I act and how did that person to</v>
<v Speaker 6>act and how should have they acted and </v>

2803
02:29:47.771 --> 02:29:49.210
<v Speaker 6>how should have I acted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so,</v>

2804
02:29:49.450 --> 02:29:51.910
<v Speaker 6>and that's part of your cultural </v>
<v Speaker 6>structure.</v>

2805
02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:55.600
<v Speaker 6>And so that's the idea of rescuing the </v>
<v Speaker 6>dead father from the depths.</v>

2806
02:29:55.601 --> 02:29:56.434
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what we'll show you some </v>

2807
02:29:57.251 --> 02:29:59.050
<v Speaker 6>examples of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

2808
02:30:02.440 --> 02:30:05.620
<v Speaker 6>this is a critical issue with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the shamanic transformation,</v>

2809
02:30:05.621 --> 02:30:07.420
<v Speaker 6>is that people go through these </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrible,</v>

2810
02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:10.960
<v Speaker 6>terrible experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 6>often drug induced by the way,</v>

2811
02:30:10.961 --> 02:30:11.794
<v Speaker 6>with regards to the sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they usually use psychedelic </v>

2812
02:30:13.271 --> 02:30:15.520
<v Speaker 6>chemicals of one form or another,</v>
<v Speaker 6>often mushrooms.</v>

2813
02:30:15.521 --> 02:30:16.354
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they've come up with some very </v>

2814
02:30:17.321 --> 02:30:18.154
<v Speaker 6>strange concoctions like Iowasca down in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Amazon and Iowasca has an amazing </v>

2815
02:30:22.301 --> 02:30:23.134
<v Speaker 6>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's made out of the bark of one thing </v>

2816
02:30:25.360 --> 02:30:26.193
<v Speaker 6>and another plant whose name I don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>remember that hardly even grow in the </v>

2817
02:30:29.771 --> 02:30:34.771
<v Speaker 6>same place and that has to be cooked </v>
<v Speaker 6>together in a special way and no one has</v>

2818
02:30:34.811 --> 02:30:37.270
<v Speaker 6>any idea how the damn Amazonians figured</v>
<v Speaker 6>that out.</v>

2819
02:30:37.271 --> 02:30:39.400
<v Speaker 6>It looks impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you ask them,</v>

2820
02:30:39.401 --> 02:30:39.941
<v Speaker 6>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2821
02:30:39.941 --> 02:30:43.780
<v Speaker 6>the plants told us how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was western people don't find very</v>

2822
02:30:43.781 --> 02:30:46.120
<v Speaker 6>helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the Germans are perfectly healthy,</v>

2823
02:30:46.180 --> 02:30:47.013
<v Speaker 6>happy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That description in Iowasca takes them </v>

2824
02:30:49.511 --> 02:30:50.344
<v Speaker 6>apart and it does that in part because </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's effects the serotonergic system </v>

2825
02:30:53.351 --> 02:30:55.030
<v Speaker 6>very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very powerfully,</v>

2826
02:30:55.031 --> 02:30:55.864
<v Speaker 6>like all psychedelics do and it </v>
<v Speaker 6>transports them to another world and </v>

2827
02:31:00.071 --> 02:31:01.390
<v Speaker 6>that's how they interpret it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2828
02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:02.800
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2829
02:31:04.060 --> 02:31:04.893
<v Speaker 6>and what we know about psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can put it in a thimble and then </v>

2830
02:31:07.031 --> 02:31:10.090
<v Speaker 6>throw the thimble away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We know nothing about psychedelics.</v>

2831
02:31:10.510 --> 02:31:13.300
<v Speaker 6>There's new experiments going on at </v>
<v Speaker 6>Johns Hopkins,</v>

2832
02:31:13.301 --> 02:31:15.180
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with Psilocybin,</v>

2833
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:18.190
<v Speaker 6>which is part of this active chemical in</v>
<v Speaker 6>magic mushrooms.</v>

2834
02:31:18.430 --> 02:31:19.263
<v Speaker 6>Same structure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Basically as LSD and masculine and all </v>

2835
02:31:21.361 --> 02:31:22.194
<v Speaker 6>the real psychedelics have basically the</v>
<v Speaker 6>same structure except the one that's </v>

2836
02:31:25.051 --> 02:31:25.884
<v Speaker 6>derived from m Anita area,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is called muscular enoch acid and </v>

2837
02:31:28.411 --> 02:31:29.244
<v Speaker 6>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's its own weird thing that no one </v>

2838
02:31:30.601 --> 02:31:32.510
<v Speaker 6>knows anything about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anyways.</v>

2839
02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:37.520
<v Speaker 6>They have profound neurochemical effects</v>
<v Speaker 6>in very small doses and I'm the research</v>

2840
02:31:37.681 --> 02:31:41.520
<v Speaker 6>group at Johns Hopkins has given </v>
<v Speaker 6>Psilocybin to research subjects,</v>

2841
02:31:41.640 --> 02:31:42.473
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>purified been because they started the </v>

2842
02:31:44.101 --> 02:31:48.330
<v Speaker 6>new experimentation with psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's been banned for like 40 years</v>

2843
02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:49.633
<v Speaker 6>because psychedelics were so terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 6>to our culture that we just put them </v>

2844
02:31:51.901 --> 02:31:53.400
<v Speaker 6>away and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh no,</v>

2845
02:31:53.401 --> 02:31:54.390
<v Speaker 6>we're not going there.</v>

2846
02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:59.010
<v Speaker 6>And so even from a research perspective </v>
<v Speaker 6>and even though some of the psychedelics</v>

2847
02:31:59.011 --> 02:31:59.844
<v Speaker 6>look very promising for the treatment of</v>
<v Speaker 6>disorders like alcoholism and they </v>

2848
02:32:02.521 --> 02:32:06.630
<v Speaker 6>recently used psilocybin to help people </v>
<v Speaker 6>stop smoking down at Johns Hopkins and I</v>

2849
02:32:06.631 --> 02:32:08.490
<v Speaker 6>think they had an 80 percent success </v>
<v Speaker 6>rate,</v>

2850
02:32:08.491 --> 02:32:12.030
<v Speaker 6>which is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just absolutely mind boggling and</v>

2851
02:32:12.031 --> 02:32:12.864
<v Speaker 6>so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you give people psilocybin and </v>

2852
02:32:14.401 --> 02:32:15.234
<v Speaker 6>they have a mystical experience,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is very common among people who </v>

2853
02:32:18.001 --> 02:32:18.834
<v Speaker 6>take these sorts of chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then their personality transforms </v>

2854
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:26.310
<v Speaker 6>permanently such that one year later </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're one standard deviation,</v>

2855
02:32:26.311 --> 02:32:27.144
<v Speaker 6>higher in openness and openness is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>creativity dimension and that seems to </v>

2856
02:32:30.781 --> 02:32:33.600
<v Speaker 6>be a permanent transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so that's really remarkable.</v>

2857
02:32:33.601 --> 02:32:34.434
<v Speaker 6>And about 80 percent of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 6>undergo the Johns Hopkins Experiments </v>

2858
02:32:38.731 --> 02:32:39.564
<v Speaker 6>report that the experience is like one </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the two or three most important </v>

2859
02:32:42.091 --> 02:32:44.910
<v Speaker 6>things they've ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's never ever happened to them.</v>

2860
02:32:45.300 --> 02:32:47.070
<v Speaker 6>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that's,</v>

2861
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:48.240
<v Speaker 6>that's something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2862
02:32:48.241 --> 02:32:49.074
<v Speaker 6>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then there's this guy named Rick </v>

2863
02:32:50.581 --> 02:32:51.414
<v Speaker 6>straussman down at,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was at the University of </v>

2864
02:32:53.610 --> 02:32:56.040
<v Speaker 6>Texas and he did experimentation with </v>
<v Speaker 6>DMT,</v>

2865
02:32:56.270 --> 02:32:57.103
<v Speaker 6>dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dimethyltryptamine I remember if I </v>

2866
02:32:59.160 --> 02:32:59.993
<v Speaker 6>remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is the active ingredient in Iowasca and </v>

2867
02:33:02.611 --> 02:33:04.980
<v Speaker 6>you produce it in your brain and it's in</v>
<v Speaker 6>plants.</v>

2868
02:33:04.981 --> 02:33:05.814
<v Speaker 6>It's like a very common chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But DMT is a weird hallucinogen because </v>

2869
02:33:09.721 --> 02:33:12.480
<v Speaker 6>it has an extraordinary short mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 6>of action.</v>

2870
02:33:12.481 --> 02:33:13.314
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and people who take it report that </v>

2871
02:33:15.260 --> 02:33:18.780
<v Speaker 6>they're blasted out of their body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like out of a cannon.</v>

2872
02:33:18.990 --> 02:33:19.823
<v Speaker 6>And then they go out somewhere and </v>
<v Speaker 6>encounter beings of various sorts and </v>

2873
02:33:24.241 --> 02:33:28.170
<v Speaker 6>then 10 minutes later they're back and </v>
<v Speaker 6>virtually everyone reports that,</v>

2874
02:33:28.171 --> 02:33:29.360
<v Speaker 6>which is really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2875
02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:30.533
<v Speaker 6>and so strassman was giving people dmt </v>
<v Speaker 6>intravenously so that the trip would </v>

2876
02:33:34.831 --> 02:33:35.960
<v Speaker 6>last longer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He could,</v>

2877
02:33:36.030 --> 02:33:37.080
<v Speaker 6>this was all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all,</v>

2878
02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:38.400
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nih funded,</v>

2879
02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:39.593
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>experimentation all cleared with the </v>

2880
02:33:40.831 --> 02:33:43.550
<v Speaker 6>relevant ethics boards all conducted </v>
<v Speaker 6>within the last 10 years.</v>

2881
02:33:43.550 --> 02:33:47.610
<v Speaker 6>And he basically quit doing it because </v>
<v Speaker 6>he was a pretty straight scientists,</v>

2882
02:33:47.611 --> 02:33:48.444
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who he was measuring heart rate and </v>

2883
02:33:49.141 --> 02:33:52.200
<v Speaker 6>pulse and all that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to look at the physiology.</v>

2884
02:33:52.201 --> 02:33:53.034
<v Speaker 6>And then the people he was giving these </v>
<v Speaker 6>chemicals to kept coming back and </v>

2885
02:33:56.341 --> 02:33:58.860
<v Speaker 6>telling him these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these crazy stories.</v>

2886
02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:02.100
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well it just,</v>

2887
02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:03.780
<v Speaker 6>it was too much for him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2888
02:34:03.781 --> 02:34:04.950
<v Speaker 6>and no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2889
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:06.840
<v Speaker 6>because they all said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he'd say,</v>

2890
02:34:06.841 --> 02:34:07.710
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was a dream.</v>

2891
02:34:07.711 --> 02:34:09.690
<v Speaker 6>And they'd say no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it was the most real thing that ever</v>

2892
02:34:09.691 --> 02:34:10.501
<v Speaker 6>happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he'd say,</v>

2893
02:34:10.501 --> 02:34:10.981
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2894
02:34:10.981 --> 02:34:12.990
<v Speaker 6>it's an architectural experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they'd say,</v>

2895
02:34:13.290 --> 02:34:14.210
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2896
02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:15.840
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was no archetipal experience.</v>

2897
02:34:15.841 --> 02:34:18.700
<v Speaker 6>I went somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I saw things and I'm back and like,</v>

2898
02:34:18.701 --> 02:34:21.460
<v Speaker 6>I don't care what you think and like who</v>
<v Speaker 6>the hell knows?</v>

2899
02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:22.960
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because it's all subjective.</v>

2900
02:34:23.260 --> 02:34:24.093
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the weird thing about it is that </v>

2901
02:34:25.241 --> 02:34:28.930
<v Speaker 6>everyone's reporting the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How the hell do you account for that?</v>

2902
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:30.310
<v Speaker 6>And then the shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2903
02:34:30.311 --> 02:34:32.440
<v Speaker 6>when they take these psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 6>chemicals,</v>

2904
02:34:32.441 --> 02:34:34.240
<v Speaker 6>they basically say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They say,</v>

2905
02:34:34.241 --> 02:34:36.970
<v Speaker 6>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it more or less killed me.</v>

2906
02:34:38.140 --> 02:34:40.470
<v Speaker 6>That's this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2907
02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:41.393
<v Speaker 6>I dissolved to skeleton.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I climbed a tree that Unites </v>

2908
02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:45.633
<v Speaker 6>Heaven and earth and I went into the </v>
<v Speaker 6>realm of the gods and they gave me some </v>

2909
02:34:48.071 --> 02:34:50.110
<v Speaker 6>information and I'm back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2910
02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:51.430
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2911
02:34:51.490 --> 02:34:52.323
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we don't really know what to make of </v>

2912
02:34:53.171 --> 02:34:54.220
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we.</v>

2913
02:34:54.290 --> 02:34:55.123
<v Speaker 6>And certainly that's what len describes </v>
<v Speaker 6>when he describes the MNEMONIC is </v>

2914
02:34:57.781 --> 02:35:01.100
<v Speaker 6>romantic procession,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not the shamanic initiation.</v>

2915
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:02.663
<v Speaker 6>There's dissolution to a skeleton first.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then like a death is symbolic death </v>

2916
02:35:05.771 --> 02:35:06.604
<v Speaker 6>or experienced as an actual death and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then bang up into the realm of the gods </v>

2917
02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:11.470
<v Speaker 6>and then they come back.</v>

2918
02:35:12.820 --> 02:35:13.653
<v Speaker 6>It's a very old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's a medieval representation of </v>

2919
02:35:16.451 --> 02:35:19.420
<v Speaker 6>the tunnel that people travel through at</v>
<v Speaker 6>the end of their life to,</v>

2920
02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:20.950
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to find the light,</v>

2921
02:35:20.980 --> 02:35:23.530
<v Speaker 6>which is a very common near death </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience report.</v>

2922
02:35:23.531 --> 02:35:24.364
<v Speaker 6>And people don't have any idea what the </v>
<v Speaker 6>hell to do with those reports except </v>

2923
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:27.611
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2924
02:35:27.611 --> 02:35:31.780
<v Speaker 6>it's the paroxysms of the dying brain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which you'd expect to be a hell of a lot</v>

2925
02:35:31.781 --> 02:35:32.614
<v Speaker 6>more random in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the idea is there's a rebirth after </v>

2926
02:35:35.531 --> 02:35:36.364
<v Speaker 6>that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>here this is the Scandinavian </v>

2927
02:35:39.551 --> 02:35:42.730
<v Speaker 6>representation of that tree that unites </v>
<v Speaker 6>Earth with heaven.</v>

2928
02:35:43.090 --> 02:35:45.340
<v Speaker 6>And so there's the Scandinavian </v>
<v Speaker 6>representation.</v>

2929
02:35:45.341 --> 02:35:47.830
<v Speaker 6>It has a snake snakes down here eating </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2930
02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:51.340
<v Speaker 6>And then that's the Amazonian </v>
<v Speaker 6>representation.</v>

2931
02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:54.040
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how the hell do you account for that?</v>

2932
02:35:54.250 --> 02:35:54.820
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those,</v>

2933
02:35:54.820 --> 02:35:57.160
<v Speaker 6>those pictures are so similar that it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

2934
02:35:57.820 --> 02:36:00.470
<v Speaker 6>it's beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2935
02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:02.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we lived in trees for a long time,</v>

2936
02:36:03.090 --> 02:36:04.330
<v Speaker 6>a long,</v>
<v Speaker 6>long,</v>

2937
02:36:04.331 --> 02:36:05.680
<v Speaker 6>long,</v>
<v Speaker 6>long time,</v>

2938
02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:06.933
<v Speaker 6>millions of years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there were lots of snakes around </v>

2939
02:36:09.131 --> 02:36:09.610
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

2940
02:36:09.610 --> 02:36:13.870
<v Speaker 6>And so the idea that reality is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>tree that's surrounded by a snake that's</v>

2941
02:36:13.871 --> 02:36:14.531
<v Speaker 6>in us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2942
02:36:14.531 --> 02:36:16.240
<v Speaker 6>it's down there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's deep.</v>

2943
02:36:16.270 --> 02:36:18.340
<v Speaker 6>And there's something about it that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>true,</v>

2944
02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:21.310
<v Speaker 6>not true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we normally think of truth,</v>

2945
02:36:21.311 --> 02:36:23.830
<v Speaker 6>but truth true in an entirely different </v>
<v Speaker 6>manner.</v>

2946
02:36:24.580 --> 02:36:26.500
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And all.</v>

2947
02:36:26.501 --> 02:36:28.480
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty damn strange.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll stop with this.</v>

2948
02:36:28.481 --> 02:36:30.550
<v Speaker 6>My son drew this when he was seven years</v>
<v Speaker 6>old.</v>

2949
02:36:30.910 --> 02:36:33.370
<v Speaker 6>Blew me away man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was so cool.</v>

2950
02:36:33.371 --> 02:36:34.204
<v Speaker 6>So I had it laminated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so here is what it is on the right </v>

2951
02:36:37.021 --> 02:36:38.080
<v Speaker 6>hand side,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the order.</v>

2952
02:36:38.590 --> 02:36:41.770
<v Speaker 6>It's like the Yin Yang thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>ordered left side chaos,</v>

2953
02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:44.140
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And those are all mushroom houses,</v>

2954
02:36:44.141 --> 02:36:44.974
<v Speaker 6>which I thought was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then there's this river that runs </v>

2955
02:36:48.701 --> 02:36:51.400
<v Speaker 6>right down the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the line for order and chaos.</v>

2956
02:36:51.550 --> 02:36:55.570
<v Speaker 6>And then there's this tree that goes up </v>
<v Speaker 6>to heaven and that's having up there.</v>

2957
02:36:55.570 --> 02:36:57.850
<v Speaker 6>It's like there St Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's the pearly gates,</v>

2958
02:36:57.851 --> 02:36:59.610
<v Speaker 6>there's the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's.</v>

2959
02:36:59.780 --> 02:37:01.810
<v Speaker 6>He never went to church,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2960
02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:04.900
<v Speaker 6>it's like what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then there's a little bug there that</v>

2961
02:37:04.901 --> 02:37:08.860
<v Speaker 6>goes up and down from heaven to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that was him.</v>

2962
02:37:09.230 --> 02:37:12.250
<v Speaker 6>I thought he had a very organized </v>
<v Speaker 6>psyche.</v>

2963
02:37:12.251 --> 02:37:13.210
<v Speaker 6>That kid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was a very,</v>

2964
02:37:13.211 --> 02:37:16.550
<v Speaker 6>very stable kid and still is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he drew that and I thought,</v>

2965
02:37:16.940 --> 02:37:18.710
<v Speaker 6>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just bloody well,</v>

2966
02:37:18.770 --> 02:37:19.603
<v Speaker 6>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I still think that when I look at </v>

2967
02:37:21.771 --> 02:37:22.604
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's a great example of an </v>

2968
02:37:23.931 --> 02:37:27.020
<v Speaker 6>archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so we'll see you Tuesday.</v>
