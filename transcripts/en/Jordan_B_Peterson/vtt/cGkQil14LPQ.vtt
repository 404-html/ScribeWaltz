1
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.073
<v Speaker 1>Should be this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you mentioned these ideas of </v>

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of virtue of respect.</v>

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.153
<v Speaker 1>You've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.123
<v Speaker 1>detailed what you think students </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't do in these examples of like </v>

5
00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:21.260
<v Speaker 1>protests and these examples of certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>types of activist tactics.</v>

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.333
<v Speaker 1>What advice would you have for students?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can students make the changes that </v>

7
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>they want to make?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particularly,</v>

8
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:28.850
<v Speaker 1>do you have any advice for students </v>
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read great books.</v>

10
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

11
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.283
<v Speaker 1>you've got this four year period that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been carved out of your lives by </v>

12
00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:37.531
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

13
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

14
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.050
<v Speaker 1>it's given you an identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a high quality identity and freedom</v>

15
00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:42.884
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're not going to get that again </v>

16
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to,</v>

17
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 1>you've got a respectable identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>university students and complete freedom</v>

18
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>associated with that or as near as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ever going to get.</v>

19
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.503
<v Speaker 1>And you've got these unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 1>libraries that are full of the writings </v>

20
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:56.324
<v Speaker 1>of people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are intelligent and articulate </v>

21
00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:00.530
<v Speaker 1>beyond comprehension and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.573
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can go there and you can learn </v>

23
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:04.040
<v Speaker 1>all this and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>why should you learn it?</v>

25
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.143
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you learn it to get a job or you </v>

26
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>learn it to get good grades or you learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to get a degree.</v>

27
00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:12.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's all nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nonsense.</v>

28
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.993
<v Speaker 1>The reason that you come to university </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be educated is because there is </v>

29
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:17.024
<v Speaker 1>nothing more powerful than someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>is articulate and who can think and </v>

30
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:22.760
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's power and I mean power of the best,</v>

31
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:26.780
<v Speaker 1>sort of its authority and influence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectability and competence.</v>

32
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.913
<v Speaker 1>And so you come to university to craft </v>
<v Speaker 1>your highest skill and your highest </v>

33
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 1>skill is to be found in articulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

34
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 1>And if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

35
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.940
<v Speaker 1>if you're a master at formulating your </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments,</v>

36
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.640
<v Speaker 1>you win everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And better than that,</v>

37
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 1>when you win everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone around you wins too.</v>

38
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.403
<v Speaker 1>Because to transform yourself into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's consider you consider your </v>

39
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does something approximating the logos.</v>

40
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.200
<v Speaker 1>It means you shine a light on the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

41
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more exciting to do with</v>

42
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.983
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing better you can possibly </v>

43
00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:58.694
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to think that you're going to </v>

44
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:00.910
<v Speaker 1>university to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.720
<v Speaker 1>trained to have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like great.</v>

46
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:03.554
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a lot better than being</v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployed and covered with cheeto dust </v>

47
00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>while you're snacking away in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your video game in the basement.</v>

48
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>But it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>

49
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.970
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to have anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>against video games by the way,</v>

50
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's hardly a triumphant call to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to being in the world.</v>

51
00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:23.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's what universities should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling forth.</v>

52
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you people,</v>

53
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.730
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I know what Harvard students are like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I taught here for five years.</v>

55
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:31.550
<v Speaker 1>You people are spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're spectacular.</v>

56
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.241
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

57
00:02:32.241 --> 00:02:33.074
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all capable of being world </v>

58
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:35.354
<v Speaker 1>beaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You transform yourself into something </v>

59
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:37.784
<v Speaker 1>that's articulated and sensible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounded in history and knowledgeable </v>

60
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>and wise.</v>

61
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.163
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do anything you want and </v>

62
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 1>hopefully anything you want for good </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you have any sense,</v>

63
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.713
<v Speaker 1>everything you want to do would be for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good because there's nothing more </v>

64
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.043
<v Speaker 1>compelling or meaningful or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or useful in combating the tragedy of </v>

65
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:55.604
<v Speaker 1>life than to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than to struggle with all your soul on </v>

66
00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>behalf the good and the universities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgotten that.</v>

67
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>It's why everyone's bailing out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities and they should.</v>

68
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.154
<v Speaker 1>The humanities are corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're corrupt because they're not </v>

69
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>telling the students this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so bloody obvious.</v>

70
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like learn to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to speak room to read.</v>

71
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.950
<v Speaker 1>It makes you a super power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual superpower.</v>

72
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.203
<v Speaker 1>You have it under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why that isn't just </v>

73
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.070
<v Speaker 1>told to students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that hard to understand it.</v>

74
00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

75
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do this.</v>

76
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I can do that.</v>

77
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

78
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:37.501
<v Speaker 1>really you could do that and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>society around you is labored for really</v>

79
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.033
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years to provide every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single one of you with this spectacular </v>

80
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.034
<v Speaker 1>opportunity that you have while your </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates and graduate students </v>

81
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

82
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.083
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's just praying that you would </v>

83
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:48.394
<v Speaker 1>come here and manifest everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could manifest and that's what you </v>

84
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.164
<v Speaker 1>should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of waving plaque cards and </v>

85
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>complaining about how your old pressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>for God's sake,</v>

86
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>you see these Yale students complaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>about their oppression.</v>

87
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:04.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just leaves me aghast.</v>

88
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

89
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 1>we're against the ruling class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

90
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:08.141
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

91
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your baby ruling class members,</v>

92
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.853
<v Speaker 1>you're young.</v>

93
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.460
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

94
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.680
<v Speaker 1>only reason you're not rich is cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're young.</v>

95
00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:23.540
<v Speaker 1>You know that's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

96
00:04:23.541 --> 00:04:25.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the 1%,</v>

97
00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:29.510
<v Speaker 1>even the dreaded 1% you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of those people are old.</v>

98
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.160
<v Speaker 1>when you progress through life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're reasonably successful,</v>

100
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.150
<v Speaker 1>you trade in your promising youth for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your wealthy old age,</v>

101
00:04:38.151 --> 00:04:41.060
<v Speaker 1>but you're still bloody old you when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade it.</v>

102
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.583
<v Speaker 1>Would you trade your youth for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you factor age out of the </v>

103
00:04:45.621 --> 00:04:47.600
<v Speaker 1>economic equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things look a lot different.</v>

104
00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:48.081
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

105
00:04:48.081 --> 00:04:50.540
<v Speaker 1>older people have more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they have any sense,</v>

106
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:52.250
<v Speaker 1>they'd been collecting it for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life.</v>

107
00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:53.084
<v Speaker 1>Is that somehow unfair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not unfair unless you want to want </v>

108
00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:56.384
<v Speaker 1>to be poverty stricken when you're 70 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you and you don't want to be </v>

109
00:04:59.121 --> 00:04:59.954
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strict pop poverty stricken when you </v>

110
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:06.051
<v Speaker 1>were 17 so I just don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happened to the universities.</v>

111
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that you're not told </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you come the first day,</v>

112
00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are right.</v>

113
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.923
<v Speaker 1>You're here on a heroic mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to take your capacity to </v>

114
00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:17.720
<v Speaker 1>articulate yourself to levels that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>undreamed of,</v>

115
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.090
<v Speaker 1>you're going to come out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm unstoppable.</v>

116
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.920
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be able to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

117
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what you're here for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

118
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.030
<v Speaker 1>you're taught that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

119
00:05:26.031 --> 00:05:26.864
<v Speaker 1>you know the world's a pretty oppressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>place and you're probably the bottom of </v>

120
00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:30.530
<v Speaker 1>the victim pile and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

121
00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:31.520
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

122
00:05:31.521 --> 00:05:32.354
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's virtually nothing you can do </v>

123
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:34.364
<v Speaker 1>about it except no deconstruct the </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy and it's so rude deed and so </v>

124
00:05:38.211 --> 00:05:39.044
<v Speaker 1>pathetic that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the university should be </v>

125
00:05:40.701 --> 00:05:43.130
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed that that's what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>peddling to students.</v>

126
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm embarrassed by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

127
00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I've gone on public record telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

128
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.513
<v Speaker 1>how do you well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send your boys to trade school because </v>

129
00:05:50.211 --> 00:05:51.044
<v Speaker 1>at least they'll learn something useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a terrible thing for someone </v>

130
00:05:53.781 --> 00:05:56.900
<v Speaker 1>like me to say because I do believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

131
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.023
<v Speaker 1>the being articulated in educated in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest possible manner is there's </v>

132
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>nothing that's better for you and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

133
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>And why are the why of the university's </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgotten this?</v>

134
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's postmodern neo Marxism for you.</v>

135
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.593
<v Speaker 1>Then the philosophy of intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and oppression and group </v>

136
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 1>identity and god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just.</v>
